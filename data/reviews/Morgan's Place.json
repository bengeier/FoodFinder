{"text":"Hey, since they still show as open, they are in fact closed for good.  Morgans shut its doors 2 months ago.  New farm to table place going in"}
{"text":"Food was ok. As other guests have stated the service is slow. I came in for lunch and had to wait over a half hour for a simple hamburger. There was also only one waitress and she was also playing hostess. This place has the potential to be great, but on a Wednesday afternoon this consumer was disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food! A great place to get your burger and fries fix. The portion size was just right. Enough to fill you up for a fair price. 

The waitress was pleasant and made us feel as though she was inviting us into her home. 

The restaurant is conveniently located on the Chardon Square. A cozy atmosphere, very well put together."}
{"text":"Excellent home cooking and attentive service. I enjoy the friendly atmosphere that Laura and her staff create. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Friendly, delicious eatery on Chardon Square.  Great food at a great price.  Love to frequent for lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"I went with the intention to get their turkey and swiss sandwich, however they had just run out.  So I went with one of the specials they and posted on the board up front, which was a chicken bruschetta sandwich.  It was very tasty, just the right amount of basil, and the chicken was moist with a great flavor.  I got the salad as a side, which was a perfect side dish.  

The coffee was good and hot, and my sister a choice of a wide variety of hot teas.  I would definitely go back again.  Quick service too, I was able to get in and out on my lunch."}
{"text":"Great breakfast on Saturday and Sunday only. Opens at 9:00 am on those days. Good coffee, reasonable prices and friendly servers. Highly recommended. Could improve by expanding the menu for weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"LOVE MORGAN'S!
Stopped in on a Friday night fifteen minutes before they closed (we thought they didn't close for another hour). We were happy to leave since it was our mistake but the wonder staff were so nice and welcoming that they almost demanded that we stay. 

I had the brunch burger which was really delicious. Fries were perfect. 

Cheap and delicious! Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch when in town on business. Hostess was also the phone answer-er and waitress. She never greeted us... simply asked us how many there was in our party and then asked us what we wanted to drink. When we tried to order food at the same time as our drinks she said \"the kitchen doesn't like when we double ticket, I'll have to come back.\" When she came back, our sodas were flat. When our food came that wasn't much better either. Our waitress couldn't even bother to place the food in front of us - she stood in one place and passed it across the table. I had the chef salad. Eggs were green. Bacon was out of a jar. The other two people in our party had the pulled pork sandwiches. Sandwiches were luke warm at best and tasted like Lloyds pulled pork from the refrigerated section of the grocery store. The regular fries were gray in color and limp. I'm guessing they were quite old and the oil wasn't hot enough when they dropped them in. The sweet potato fries were a 3/10 at best. Definitely would not return and would not recommend this place to others. Much better off going to Bob Evans down the street! Oh, and the bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks. I seriously question the validity of the other 4 and 5 star reviews on here."}
{"text":"Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich for me and a Cheeseburger for my daughter and both were excellent! The sweet potato fries are really, really good, especially with the special dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. The brisket was tender, not too smoky. Their house made BBQ sauce is excellent, not too sweet. We also had the prime rib, very good as well. Burgers are great, but you have to like the char that grilled burgers sometimes have. Hand cut fries are a plus. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices and good service. We stopped in after a LONG hike at Holden Arboretum and I enjoyed a burger and my husband had a prime rib sandwich (special) and we both really enjoyed them. He got the sweet potato fries and they came with a crazy maple/soy dipping sauce that we asked about and the waitress said she had no clue what was in it \"they won't tell us\"! That stuff was a great pairing with the sweet p. fries! My kids had nothing exciiting off the kids menu, but the price was right! If we are in Chardon ever again we'd go back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible, food was bland, flavorless and awful, service was fast but food presentation killed everything, do yourself a favor and avoid this junk by all means. Half a star will be more deserving but oh well I will never eat here ever."}
{"text":"our favorite place to go when in the area, my husband loves the pork chops, they  turn our moist and perfect every time"}
{"text":"We were in Chardon around lunch time and looked on Yelp to find a place to eat. Morgan's had good reviews and was right on the square. It's in an old building and the interior is charming, with a stamped tin ceiling and photos illustrating the history of Chardon. I had a pulled pork sandwich and my husband had a brisket sandwich. Both were very good. The fries looked hand cut and reminded me of \"fair fries.\" I'm giving this place five stars for keeping malt vinegar on the table. It's the little things that make a difference."}
{"text":"Best Bar-B-Que in Eastern Ohio!

We found this place a couple of weeks ago and have been back twice since. It is on the west side of the Chardon square, across from the gazebo. From the outside it doesn't look like your typical BBQ place, but on the inside the BBQ is fantastic. There is the perfect level of slow smoke flavor, tenderness, and spiciness. The brisket was good, but the pulled pork and the baby-back ribs have been the favorites. The sauce tastes great, better than Smokey Bones, Cowboys, or Blazen Bills - although it is inconsistent from visit to visit. One time it is thick enough to stick to the ribs then next it is watery to the point where it forms a tasty BBQ soup on the plate. 

The decor is the nicest in Chardon and the 20 bin wine list is the most extensive of anyplace I have been to within Chardon. In addition to the BBQ, there is a full menu of everything that you would expect at a typical nice restaurant including a tasty breakfast menu. The wait staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  

On the down side, you can tell that this is still a \"small town\" restaurant.  The staff seems to have set up a \"nest\" in the bar/lounge area.  It is used as a combination of staging area and break room, making the area unusable as a bar. The second odd thing is that the only music seems to be coming from a boom box (?) in or near the kitchen. Rather than the Blues, Jazz, or even Country that you would expect at a classy BBQ joint, there is a combination of classic rock and pop, depending on who is cooking that day, I suppose. The music is not noticeable in the front of the restaurant, but progressively gets louder as you go to the back until it gets loud and rather annoying when you get back to the bar/staff break area.  The boom box has been going in two or our three visits, hopefully it stops soon and appropriate music is instead piped through the ceiling mounted speakers. 

With a few small changes, Morgan's Place can be a great BBQ destination.  We wish them all the best of luck!"}
{"text":"Had their brunch burger. 1/2 lb burger with egg bacon and cheese ontop and it was so good. Fries were okay. Service was great even though they were busy. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came in today with my boyfriend. We were planning to eat here for dinner but when we asked to use the bathroom they said we couldn't unless we were paying customers. Well unfortunately they lost our business with their attitude. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. No complaints. Haven't tried anything I didn't like. Prices are reasonable.  The turkey platter is very good."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars with a few caveats. I would do 3.5 if the app let me. But don't be put off! The brief summary is: this place is absolutely worth stopping at, and it would great for takeout too. The food is excellent. The staff is friendly. And it's clean. Thumbs up for those. If I could stop here, I'd say it gets an 85-90% rating from me. And if I stop in again and things have been tweaked, I'd give it 4 or 5 stars easy.

The meal: 
I had a great brisket sandwich on a pretzel bun. It was only maybe the third time I've had brisket, but I can be pretty picky and I thought it was very tasty. Not dry, and not a mouthful of smoke. Overall a good balance. I ordered it with a side of broccoli to offset my guilt, and that was 100% perfect. I also had the garlic wings which were very good. Maybe just a tiny touch more oil than I'd prefer, but I plowed through six of them so who's counting?

We also had ribs. These were the highlight at the table. I'm not a rib expert, but it seemed to me that they've got these nailed. Kudos to their kitchen for the recipes and the hours they clearly put into these!

Another item we ordered was the portabella sandwich and some bruschetta. Neither item was nearly as good as the rich, flavorful, meaty items above. It was just okay.

Now the caveats: 
We were told they no longer have biscuits. Like I said, I'm not very experienced with BBQ, but I thought this was a prerequisite. I wouldn't even mention it if it weren't for the fact that it's listed on the website. Just sayin.

Also, I said the staff were polite and friendly, but a bit more attentiveness would be great too. I know theres a fine line between hovering and being absent, but we were hoping someone would check on things a bit more. For example, we didn't want to make a big deal out of it (I suppose I am now), but we had a big glass of iced tea on the table that tasted like a moldy national geographic magazine. We each took a sip, made a face, and there it sat for 30 minutes. The server took no notice. Likewise, someone finished their water and wasn't offered anything else. Myself, on the other hand, managed to drink two full beers, and could easily have got a third. Again, just sayin.

Again, overall this was a decent experience with fair prices. Just don't expect to have it be the only place you ever want to eat again. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Among the very best burgers I've ever had!  I am a very particular foody, and when I ordered a feta cheeseburger, seared so it was rare I had very few hopes, but Morgan's really proved me wrong because my feta burger was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My wife had the turkey and it was well seasoned and had a good smoke on it but was sliced way to thin. 
I had the brisket and it was probably good out of the smoker but was obviously soaked in some type of gravy that completely killed any seasoning and smoke flavor. Was also served in large chunks, neither sliced or chopped. 
Gave them a shot but won't be back."}
