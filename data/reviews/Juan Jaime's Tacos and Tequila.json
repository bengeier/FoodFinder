{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Now that have, I'm good. 

It's the kind of place you go to after a night of partying when your standards aren't so high. It wasn't all THAT bad, but not great  either.  

I judge Latin-style restaurants on their chips and salsa. If it's not good, I know what to expect from their kitchen. With that said..
the chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante. 

I had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice. The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry. I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up. All and all...it was decent, but not any better quality than a late night taco place. 

Service was ok."}
{"text":"Mediocre lunch spot. Reasonably priced. I had the taco salad with carnitas (pork), the salad seemed fresh and the pork was really good there just was not very much of it at all. The chips were cold and not very crunchy but fine. My husband had the steak burrito with no complaints. The service was fine and fast."}
{"text":"The selection of tequilas is great, and the tacos are light, refreshing, and great tasting."}
{"text":"This place was great for lunch. I ordered the 3 taco plate (fish) with beans and rice. It was great and filling.  Go for the Hot salsa at the salsa bar and try the taco sauce.  Good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Friday night. Restaurant was crowded but we were able to get a table quickly. Service was friendly and attentive. Margarita was average, but the food and salsa were excellent! The sautéed vegetables in the vegetarian burrito as well as the quesadilla in particular were fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place to go for reasonably priced good Mexican food in North Scottsdale. The ambience is okay, nothing special and the service is inconsistent. Usually good but can be slow when they are busy. Overall a good place that I go back to repeatedly."}
{"text":"Not bad... First time here. Tacos were not bad. Salsa bar, do not see the point. Would go back. Better than getting a burger. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood taco shop and you can't beat the happy hour til 8!"}
{"text":"If Juan Jaime was from Mexico, he would be totally embarrassed to eat what they call Mexican in this Tacos and tequila joint. I ordered some tacos, one with carne asada, one with pork and one with chicken. You could not make a decent taco out of these three; no flavor, no juiciness,no taste whatsoever. The black beans were dry and tasteless so was the rice. Juan, if you can hear me , please tell your people they need to educate themselves on real Mexican food, after all it is your name that it is at stake!!!  A good place to go and familiarize with true authentic  Mexican food is Los Reyes de la torta. Mexican food at its best, I dare you Juan to check it out."}
{"text":"The chorizo tacos are crazy good! I could eat like a dozen of those things! Friendly staff and just a cool place to hang out. Nothing fancy, nothing authentic, just a small place to get some drinks and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Since I have not had the chance to partake in their happy hour, my review will be based solely on the food and service.

Probably the best thing about this place is value for your money.  Yes, you do have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but when you can get a burrito for $6.95, it ends up being a great value.  With a few sprinkles of salt, the chips were good and the salsa bar gives you the chance to enjoy different flavors with your chips (and meal.)

I had the carnitas burrito which was tasty, but was made unevenly such that all the rice was on one side and all of the carnitas and beans were on the other side.  Not too big of a deal; I just had to be strategic in piecing together my bites.  The nice thing is that it was a good size burrito; not some \"as big as your head\" monstrosity.

I was full after the meal so I didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts, but the Kahlua brownie with ice cream sounded delicious.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. They are open late for us night owls yet still serve GREAT food. Most places that are open late are not very good, but Juan Jaime's never disappoints. I am absolutely addicted to their refried beans - I am pretty sure they're made fresh onsite, because they taste so good! My only complaint is that, in my opinion, the food is a bit overpriced (it IS Mexican food - just beans, cheese and tortillas in various combinations lol).
I will still go and recommend this place because the service is consistently fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the service is terrible every time I go there. It doesn't matter what time of day or how slow it is or which server I get. Time to hire a new serving staff."}
{"text":"Have been here for dinner once in the past week. Service was attentive, and the food good. Margarita was ok. Will most likely visit again."}
{"text":"Just went here to celebrate my mom's birthday with our whole family of 15 people.  The service was great, always had a full drink and basket of chips.

The chicken tacos are about as good as they get!  Absolutely delicious!  The salsa bar is amazing as well.

Didn't drink on this occasion but definitely looks like a great place for happy hour .. $2.50 domestic drafts, $3.00 margaritas.

The server even brought my mom a margarita with a candle lit in the middle of it! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a great taco and happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great happy hour. The two taco platter is the perfect amount of food for a quick dinner and their margaritas aren't too strong. I like the patio outside, ate there both times we have been here. If it wasn't for the umbrellas to block the sun, I probably wouldn't be able to enjoy myself outside."}
{"text":"First time here.  Taco platter.  Get the steak with flour tortillas!  Staff was pleasant and Efficient!"}
{"text":"This food is incredible.. it is as good as it gets. Amazing and well trained staff. Fast service, and convenient hours!"}
{"text":"Had the three taco lunch special.

Service was friendly and prompt.

Offered chips and salsa and the salsa that comes with the dish, albeit very mild, is good.  Tried an assortment of other salsas from the salsa bar.  The \"taco sauce\" was somewhat bland, the salsa verde was very good (and spicy) but the other salsas I tried were lacking punch.

Ordered one carne asada, one chicken and one carnitas.

All three tacos didn't quite have enough onions or cilantro for my tastes but the bartender brought some extra when I asked.

Carne Asada really needed more marinade as it was bland.

Chicken was good, but certainly benefitted from the salsa verde and a couple shakes of salt.

Carnitas, a little over greasy, but flavor was good.

There's not a huge beer selection, which is a positive, but had he standards and a good selection of mexican beers.

Hopefully they can get the spice levels set correctly and I would be more than happy to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Favorite place around me for tacos.  Super simple and always perfect.  No frills and I love it!  Margs are pretty decent for under $5, too.  Hard to beat!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere to relax and enjoy the good tacos and salsa and guac! The service is great and they are fast. Once i came in a bit early and I work nights so I assumed they were open however the manager served us anyway even though i felt bad. He reassured us that it's ok. This is a local favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!!!! The food is so good, and not expensive and actually tastes like Mexican food!!! I love the house salsa and the cheese quesidillas and the salsa bar! Wait I love it all! A must go! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! The margaritas need to be larger though, but that's the only negative, they taste great.  I'm not sure why i haven't come here before... I'm going to be a regular customer note though."}
{"text":"Tequila must make the experience a lot better.....  Not sure where the 5 star reviewers have eaten their tacos, but JJTT's food has a long walk to authenticity and quality.  Regardless of the underwhelming impression that the food will make, the staff is friendly and nice.  The folks who were drinking definitely appeared to be enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Delicious food, strong margaritas, awesome happy hour and great service! Highly recommended to taco and tequila lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Friendly servers, food is delicious. Also, they have Sopaipillas!"}
{"text":"If I had the choice not to give any stars I wouldn't. If your Mexican or like Mexican food this isn't the place to go. Very nasty. Saw my food sitting under the warmer while others where cooking. Yuck !"}
{"text":"I live how simple and casual this place is. It is really easy taking our kids there, and the food is delicious! The service is always fast and they have the best Pepsi I swear. I don't know how they make it taste so good?!? This is a great place to go when you are short on time as the service is always great and you get served quickly. I personally love their steak tacos. I'm never usually a fan of rice at Mexican restaurants but theirs is by far my favorite. They have a salsa bar where you can help your self to your liking. The prices are great too. They have a good bar area and nice outdoor seating as well. It's nothing fancy, but it sure is good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Simple menu with gret tacos and salsa."}
{"text":"Good place to meet and chat with neighbors. Fun atmosphere, the bartenders are a breath of fresh air. Food is good and nicely priced."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  Lots of food, cool salsa bar, not expensive, and great service.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"JJ's is the best! Took us awhile to discover but worth it. 
Their food is great, especially for the price, and the service is awesome. 
Neighborhood type of place. Great atmosphere. 

The Enchalida Stlye Buritto is the best. Get it with red aside, but be careful, HOT. 

We go back often, because the food is so consistent."}
{"text":"After my last review I received a sincere note from John the owner inviting me back to see the changes he had made the menu since my last visit. I have had a chance to visit twice since then and John and his staff have out done themselves. The food is wonderful (I recommend the grilled steak burrito enchilada style). With the new menu changes it qualifies as a traditional Mexican food restaurant. For those of you that frequent Jalapeno's in north Scottsdale this is a great alternative. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have had a great experience almost every time I have gone into Juan Jaime's.  Usually, I have gone in for lunch, and I have been greeted with a smile and quick service by the staff.  It is seat yourself, which is nice (except for when it is very busy). The have a spectacular and diverse menu...hot dogs really??? hah. I love their cilantro and white oinon on top of the steak tacos.
seriously cute waitresses too."}
{"text":"We returned again after the owner reached out to us to apologize about our previous experience there. This time around, our server Eric was wonderful. He was very attentive and friendly and everything came out quickly as well.

Between the four of us, we ordered drinks (great margaritas!), the trio chip appetizer, tacos, and sopapillas. All of the food was very good.

The prices here are excellent. Our total bill was very inexpensive for all that we ordered. This is a fun hangout spot!"}
{"text":"Great food great prices. Good friendly service. Food always comes out crazy fast."}
{"text":"Slow service. Overpriced. I was not impressed. I won't go back"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out tonight, but unfortunately it was not a great experience. Our waiter was great, but we waited 50 minutes for our food. We were told the kitchen was backed up, but looking around no one was eating. Not sure what was going on. When we did get our food, it was tepid. We did not wait around to order dessert."}
{"text":"These guys are a bunch of clowns.  The service is always rude and I'm always overcharged for food.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd give the food a 7 but the service has been a 1 every time I've eaten there.  Will not be doing business with them any more."}
{"text":"Just got out of the place. Left before we even ordered. The bartender \"Tony\" was smashed. I mean you could tell he was trying to stay upright, hard. My girlfriend and I noticed they had shrimp on the menu and she has a very severe shellfish allergy. She'll die if there is even a hint of shellfish on something. We asked him about it and he rudely said that he didn't know and would have to ask him as he point to a back wall. He then rudely asked \"Are you guys going to order tequila or not?\" not even a second after he said the previous statement. We tried to say we need to know if there was any cross contamination before we even attempted to get anything which he then said \"If you might be allergic to the chips then don't eat them!\" when it wasn't just the chips we were talking about. We walked out as a patron there said \"Tony! Are you okay? Are you as drunk as me?\". I wouldn't suggest going to this place. Very rude service and Tony is a drunken mess."}
{"text":"I had to stop by here to leave a comment the salsa is so darn amazing the tacos the meat the EVERYTHING is AMAZING !!!! Oh and did I mention the service everyone is friendly and the place itself is nice inside , its a must go to place during lunch because they have amazing specials , I work across the street and will walk over on my lunch because that's how amazing their food is .... if you haven't been your missing out !!!! You go Juan Jaime's keep up the good job your doing !!!! Oh and the blonde girl with the longer hair is the funniest server there if you get her tip her well !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dine out quite often.  JJ's is always on our list every week or 10 days.  The food is always consistent.  No, it's not flashy, but you can count on a solid meal.  

Besides the food and atmosphere which we enjoy, the staff is, in our opinion, top notch.  One person in particular knows exactly what we order, unless we throw him a curveball.  But the other waitresses come very close and are good.

So dinner for us, including alcohol, is around $25.  Where else can you have a solid experience, great food and service for that price?   Thanks JJ's!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Juan Jaime's! It has become a regular lunch spot when I eat out. The food is simple yet delicious! The bean tostada is my absolute favorite along with the salsa bar. Thuy is an amazing server and remembers my order each time I go. Every when it is crazy busy during the lunch rush, a server always acknowledges you when you walk in which I appreciate! I've also been a couple times on a weekend and I highly recommend the house margarita!"}
{"text":"I saw so many people at the bar when I went o have dinner. I should have joined them but we went for dinner. The food is horrible!!! I can get better food from the frozen section at a grocery store for less than half the price. My waitress gave me horrible recommendations! I would never go back there to eat! I would however go back to check out the bar area."}
{"text":"Cool Place and very friendly staff.  Food is average though. Fun place to hang out though!"}
{"text":"Great salsa bar. Great selection of tequila. Great service. Family comes here often for a quick good meal."}
{"text":"This is the best local bar! Good food, great company......i want to say it's like cheers only mexican style."}
{"text":"Juan Jamie's Tacos and Tequila - After four visits, I recommend this restaurant.  The food is tasty and the service friendly and responsive. I also appreciate the clean restroom and outdoor patio seating (dog friendly!).  

If you like chicken tacos (my favorite), I find the white meat chicken well seasoned and complimented by salsa and toppings.  I have not tried the beans, but enjoy the mexican rice. The salsa bar highlights some tasty offering that are worth sampling. Others in my party have spoken highly about the beef tacos and burritos.

While there is plenty of parking, keep in mind that there is a major grocery store that shares the lot, which can make parking stressful at certain times."}
{"text":"The BEST crunchy taco shells in scottsdale, idk if they're housemade or not but I find myself so unsatisfied with other Mexican restaurants because they don't have the \"Juan Jamie's\" taco shells."}
{"text":"Great experience. We met another couple here for Happy Hour and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of their food. I had the chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the steak burrito. The beans & rice were amazing! The salsa bar in the back is a nice touch. All reasonably priced and great service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yuck... Not good. Straight from the can (at least it tastes like it). Go to Espo's. Right down the street and I have NO vested interest in any restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Everyone we bring with us really seems to enjoy it too.  Great value.  Great salsa.  Great food and service is always quick and friendly.  Would be nice to have a couple more types of salsa though.  We've had some chipotle and mango salsas at a couple of other places that I'm betting Juan Jaime's could do really well."}
{"text":"Really loved the cheese crisp with chicken.   And the salsa bar is great,  too!  The mild green sauce over the burrito is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a casual drink and a bite to eat. Definitely wouldn't choose here for anything beyond that. Spotty service. Food is decent tho."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff. Picture this: you walk in, waiting to be seated, the place is basically empty (first of all, weird) and the hostess has her sunglasses on, midriff baring, and ignoring you. Instead, she's waving and smiling across the restaurant to male coworker waiter man. After standing there awkwardly not welcomed or directed there for 5 minutes, she'll mutter, \"uh you can sit anywhere.\" No thank you; over it at this point (we left). And in the window is lady hostess literally scowling and rolling her eyes at you while waiter man stares at you, flails (yes, picture a child flailing) his arms laughing. MOST UNPROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT EVER. Have no clue about the food, not willing to contribute to this business after experiencing that nonsense. I mean, we are in Phoenix after all: choices galore."}
{"text":"YUMMY! North Scottsdale Gem!

My hubby is a great cook, so we are picky. This place is somewhere we will eat a few times a week sometimes. The shrimp and mahi are fresh, and great in tacos. The ground beef tacos are perfect, and they double tortilla, which is cool and authentic. The enchiladas are awesome too, and I can't wait to go down the menu and keep trying stuff. 

We had a buddy up from Mexico last night, and he thought it was amazing. We ordered a mix of tacos, the queso, and rice and beans. 

Best part, super reasonable. Don't find that in North Scottsdale very often."}
{"text":"I came for the Negra Modelo on tap. Every bar should have it and Juan does.  5 stars 

Located in a great area, great Christmas setting and better tacos ! 

I wish I could meet Juan him self."}
{"text":"Just went tonight.  Was looking for some late night Mexican food and atmosphere a step above most things that are open this late and found success.

This place is definitely trying to pull off cool and I think they do a pretty good job of it.  Their expansive selection of Tequila, enhances the mood they set out to create.

I do not like that you had to pay for chips and salsa but the food was pretty cheap for how nice the restaurant was, so I think it evens out.  

They might charge for chips because it's the kind of restaurant where you could spend several hours drinking and if people ate chips the whole time that was happening it wouldn't be profitable.  I say this because their alcohol is a good deal.  16 oz. Dos Equis for four bucks on tap and it wasn't happy hour!

This place is a balance of modestly priced mexican, drinking and nice atmosphere.  The food is not amazing but it's good, and with the atmosphere and wanting to eat at 11 at night this restaurant/bar is overall impressive.  (If weren't for the late late night aspect would probably only give it three stars)"}
{"text":"It's a nice spot for a decent lunch. Naturally I ordered the tacos figuring they'd be a solid choice for a place with \"tacos\" in the business name. Overall I was happy with the food quality and service. It tasted fresh and the meals arrived very quickly. The menu was simple and the prices very affordable. I'd return for a nice quick lunch. Salsa bar was good but you do have to pay for chips. The taco shells appeared and tasted pre-made too."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was cool. The food was lighter than normal Mexican but still tasted authentic. I'm big on beans and rice and chips and salsa. This place was excellent with all 3. The food is also really well priced. I got a two taco plate - 1 veggie and 1 shrimp. Both were light and tasty. The portion sizes were not oversized which I actually appreciated. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for tacos and tequila! The house margaritas are on point! The place wasn't packed, but rather calm and relaxing. Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"After they gave me an excuse for bringing a dirty wine glass that was IT for me.  Never went back.  Bad service - waitress was snoddy."}
{"text":"Phenom. 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. 
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. 
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. 
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. 
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. 
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. 
Service is friendly and quick. 
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. 
Good food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I have been coming here weekly for lunch for over a year and it's all because of Thuy! Of course we like the food as well but the service we receive from Thuy is fantastic. She makes us feel like we are VIP from the moment we walk in the door.

I came on Monday with a friend and Thuy wasn't there. The food and service was still good but something was missing and that's why I felt like I needed to write this review. 

Thank you Thuy for making my weekly Juan Jamie's experience awesome!! 

Oh and the queso is scrumptious also!!"}
{"text":"Rolled in here on a whim with no recommendation craving some Mexican food so did not expect anything too special. Boy was I wrong. After a dozen or so visits I can say this is my favorite mexican food place anywhere nearby. Food is cheap fast and good. A giant meal is not even $10. Food is made with pride and quality ingredients, not just random Mexican stuff smothered in red sauce. Take out is ready before I even walk in the door and dining in takes 5 minutes from ordering to plate, made to order. What a nice surprise. If you are looking for 5 star french cuisine, this is not for you. If you want fantastic Mexican food to fill your belly and soul this is the spot."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food but  nothing special.  Juan Jaime's is one of the better restaurants in this complex, having tried all of them."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Literally taste like canned chicken and the queso is like jarred cheese from Walmart. Everyone I was with hated it. The service was good"}
{"text":"My new favorite neighborhood joint. Not fancy but good food and cheap! Great beers and food is consistent and good. Love the guacamole, taco salad, steak tacos. Family favorite and easy with little kids. Food comes quickly and servers really friendly!"}
{"text":"Ashley was a great server. She had a suggestion for everything on the menu. We were there for Happy Hour which is everyday from 4PM-7PM. When we ordered the fish tacos, she suggested adding a great verde sauce- which wasn't on the menu. 

I ordered the house margarita on the rocks. They're made from a mix and the first one was tasty and the second one seemed a little heavier on the mix. Happy Hour margaritas were $2.50."}
{"text":"Do not understand why Jaun Jaime's Tacos and Tequila would rate 5 stars. 

I ordered the chicken burrito \"enchilada\" style. Which means they pour some sauce on top and charge you a couple of more bucks.  Pass on that.  The sauces are uninspired and you will do better at the salsa bar.

It is weird that they charge for chips but you could probably make a small salad at the \"salsa bar\" for free. Did not try the margaritas, so maybe thats the key to enjoyment. 

Fast and friendly service. Uninspired but edible food.  I'd meet friends there, but I wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"If you mind waiting 30 minutes for water and more than 45 minutes for a soda, then you probably shouldn't go here.

We had a table of 10 here for Father's Day - and they weren't even that busy - and that's how long we waited for drinks. Oh and we sat down and were never given menus, we got those for ourselves.

However, the food is decent. The salsa is good. And the food and drinks are cheap. Though I wouldn't come here again since it's irritating to wait so long for a drink in 110 degree heat, some may not mind and then maybe this place is worth trying. But if you're like me and love Mexican food and a great experience, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we will definitely be going back. The food was delicious and the refried beans were the best I've had in a long time. Surprisingly great prices too! We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good margaritas but lousy food especially for vegetarians. Usually most average restaurants serving Mexican cuisine offer at least a couple of respectable veggie options but this place falls way short. Not sure if we visited at the wrong time but service was tardy too. Wouldn't visit again. Even their nachos were really subpar - quite oily."}
{"text":"I love the queso dip and ground beef. The martini's are good. Cool low key vibe when I have gone. More of an older crowd early 30s to 40s!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after a concert. Tacos are amazing. And the service is great! Craig, the bartender, very knowledgeable, great personality and super nice!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here after seeing generally positive reviews. I ordered one shrimp and one mahi mahi taco and was underwhelmed. The food came out very quickly (maybe in 2-3 minutes?). I like quick service but too quick says something about the quality. The shrimp was not appetizing at all--too chewy and tasting strange. I left the remainder on my plate. The fish was fine but nothing special. The rice and beans were similar. My waitress was nice and I enjoyed the ambiance and (a few) choices of salsas, but overall, the quality of the food was just too poor."}
{"text":"Great burritos, the lunch staff is excellent love not needing a menu because the waitress knows us. Additionally food comes out fast.   Love it."}
{"text":"Had the two taco meal and was pretty good. The chicken and the shrimp taco were OK once I topped with lettuce and sauce from the salsa bar. Refried beans were fantastic and the rice was typical. 

Overall a solid experience and I especially liked the salsa bar."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this bar. The staff is great and the food is great as well. The only complaint I have is the temperature is always way too hot. Our corporate client was so uncomfortable we had to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"This places tacos and margaritas are making me wish I would have moved to AZ. I'm from CA and have had so many Tacos but none are the quality of this place. Not only is the food and margaritas amazing but the customer service is also outstanding."}
{"text":"Really good tacos.
Generic beer selection.
Had a slow/rude/lazy Bartender."}
{"text":"This is a happy hour review.

This one is easy. We have been here for happy hour once a week since it opened. We bring friends here. We bring family here. We bring work here. We call it Juan Yummies now... We are addicted. 

Something like 100 tequilas to choose from. The host/owner (Andy?) know his tequila... ask him for a recommendation. We have actually started keeping track of our favorite teq's and he can make suggestions based on what YOU like and suddenly you know what to look for in taste and body. I hope this does not turn me into a teq snob.

Average patio (couple too many kids for our liking), sexy cute servers (love Jamie), and fast bartending.

Foodwise, you can choose your meat in all the traditional dishes and it's been fun to work through the choices. I like the carnitas and for god's sake get some ground beef in a hard shell... Who knew?  Also love the taco sauce at the salsa bar... kinda like the little taco bell packets, only tasty... if that makes sense. 

Yeah we can walk to Yummies and the prices are a little Scottsdaley, but dang it's good and you can eat and sip a nice teq for under $25 including a XX on tap during happy hour.

Take the drive. Mmmm."}
{"text":"So I went to this new location located off of Hayden in North Scottsdale.  They have had signs up for a while so I was pretty excited to have something new for a change.  

We came in at diner time, and went only for dinner, no drinks.

I looked at the menu and saw 10 dollars for three tacos, I thought it was kind of expensive, but maybe the tacos were really good.

I also ordered chips and salsa, and they weren't free. That was a joke.  

I ordered one steak, one chicken, and one Chorizo and Egg.

The steak and the Chorizo and Egg were just terrible.  I had one in a hard shell, and one in a soft shell.  They tasted pretty much the same, and the texture was rubbery.  

The Chicken was decent, and had a little flavor.  

My Fiancee ordered the Vegetarian Tacos, which consisted of beans and green peppers and a hell of a lot more grease than anything I ordered.  One was so grease filled she had to throw it out.

They also had a Salsa Bar that had 4 different Salsas.  One had no taste, one had no taste but was hot, one tasted of onions, and the Green Verde salsa had a lot of flavor and was really spicy.  So 1for 4 is above average, right?  It's good in baseball I guess.

The soft shell tacos were a lot better than the hard shells, I would recommend if you have to eat there,  go for the soft.  Chicken rather than steak.

But hey, I gave Rubios 1 star, so this is at least a step up, but for a lot more money."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Anytime my husband and I come here we have a great experience. An added bonus: you very easily veganize your meal!!!"}
{"text":"- the food is bland
- their wildly-touted \"salsa bar\" is boring, and 4' by 4' large
- the waitstaff is, sigh, boring
- the bill is 50% higher than you'd expect for bland food/service/atmosphere

It's unlikely that things will get better, so it's unlikely that I will recommend friends/family.  The signage and hype are cool to see, though, and their location is excellent.

Bottom line:  don't bother"}
{"text":"Great happy hour (runs till 8 pm), the food is always excellent. The folks working there are always friendly and prompt.  

Try the Halibut burrito,  tried it once and I haven't looked back.

The decor is conducive to having a drink and relaxing.

Watching sports is easy with the 5 or 6 flat screens.

The have a small but robust salsa bar.  Some hot stuff on there!

Overall, a great place to relax."}
{"text":"I went last Sunday with a friend n I was really surprise about how many tequilas they have for not a big place not a big fan of it but it's nice the fact a mexican place has that. 

For other part they have clamato and squirt!!! How many bars have that???? Actually one of the only ways I drink tequila is with squirt :) so I was really happy .....

My friend had the tacos n they looked amazing they looked like real tacos def have to come back to try those!! And come back for a great service with Aaron...."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in North Scottsdale. Happy hour is from 4-7pm with the best prices on beer and house margaritas. The environment is super relaxed, the food is superb, and the prices are unbeatable. Make sure you get the queso!"}
{"text":"Yep.....una estrella!  Someone accidentally listed this in the mexican genre. This was taco bell with nice decor and a bar.  If those are the kind of boots you wear go for it.....not me.  Granted i did not partake in the alcohol, so maybe around 10PM on a friday night with a few beers maybe the tacos start to look and taste beautiful.  A tactic many establishments use....turn down the lights, turn up the alcohol....they'll pay for whatever i put on the plate."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Start with the three amigos and a margarita on the rocks! Good stuff! The tacos are two tortillas melted together with cheese- yum! Definitely recommend for large groups if you want a fun happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Good for families for dining. Food was yummy and margaritas were fabulous. Price was really inexpensive and we will be regulars now. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Good food, ingredients were fresh, service without a smile, so-so margarita, terrible and annoying music"}
{"text":"Terrible and loud music. Feel like I'm at a bad rave club. 

Food was less than average. I ordered the mahi mahi and it tasted awful. Could not eat more than 2 bites. Black beans were ok. Kids did not like their burritos . Verdict. I would never return. Service was not great. When we walked out, the teens running the place asked us how our meal was. They were obviously not listening or did not care. We replied. \"It was terrible.\" The guy replied, \"OK\", and we walked out.

So many better places in town. Darn. This was close to home. The owner is doing a disservice by letting teens run the place, letting teens choose the music and letting teens lose customers."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh...this place sticks. Who are you newbs that are giving this place such high ratings? It's Taco Bell with a bar. Have you folks never been to Mexico, know Mexicans, ate at good Mexican rest? Yelp lets me down every once and awhile. The black beans seemed canned, the rice was dry and the taco meat was...well poor quality (see pic), I spit out as much as I ate. The chips and salsa were the highlights and they were average. Go to Si Senor in or Los Dos Molinos...trust me."}
{"text":"Mexican bar with some class in North Scottsdale. Open atmosphere, large patio, with a dual sided outside-connected bar. The chips are thin and hot with a salsa bar with 5 different types of varying heat levels. I usually get the tasty street-style tacos with a big portion of quality meat filling. Good selection of mexican beers on tap. There is one negative, their house margarita is a little weak, in a small glass, and was filled with too much ice. I hit up this place often though because of the combo of quality, quick service, and price."}
{"text":"Service was very good and friendly. The food was mediocre at best. My son ordered a steak that required the jaws of steel to chew while my Taco Salad with Mahi-Mahi and steak fillings was bland and tasteless. Finding my fish and steak within the salad was a challenge since both where microscopic in nature, more of a molecule rather than a food item. The Sangria tasted and looked liked served out of a Capri Sun container purchased at wallmart. Again, service was great, no complains, food, not so much."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night with my boyfriend and a friend. We were planning on visiting anyway, but we got a coupon for a free appetizer and that pretty much cinched it.

We went during happy hour so we all indulged in the $3 margaritas. I got the watermelon (on the rocks), which I loved. My boyfriend got the house maragrita (on the rocks), which he wasn't crazy about it, and my friend got the peach (blended) which really wasn't all that great.

We got the nachos, which were about $7. I was surprised to see that it was just chips and cheese with some salsa and jalapenos on the side. They do have a salsa bar with different kinds of salsa and also lettuce and cabbage, but when I think nachos I also think sour cream and at least some kind of beans or ground beef of it. Not to say it wasn't tasty, just not really what I was expecting.

For dinner I got a combo of a cheese enchilada and a steak taco with rice and beans on the side. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the enchilada, but everything else was tasty.

For dessert we got sopapillas. These were tasty (how can you go wrong with fried dough?), but had a little too much cinnamon (this is coming from a girl who *likes* her cinnamon). They were also served with warm honey, which was good. My friend and boyfriend were only so-so about the sopapillas.

It was a pretty good eat, although I don't know if I'd become a regular."}
{"text":"Carnitas and mahi fish tacos are great here!  Your choice of taco shell is a nice touch as well.  Solid bar, fantastic tequila selection!  Not sure about prior reviews citing high prices.  None of the food items are over $10."}
{"text":"With so many excellent options in Phoenix for excellent Mexican food I would skip this one. Food is average and nothing of note in the way of ambiance or drinks."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little taco joint if you are in the mood for some quick tacos... I ate here a couple days ago for the first time. 

Our tacos came out quick (i mean REALLY quick) and I admit that I was a little bit disappointed when I first saw them because they were small. However they were tasty, especially with the help of the salsa bar - the salsa bar is awesome.

I will definitely return when I am in the mood for some quick tacos."}
{"text":"My visit here was pleasant due to the kind waiter, however the food was awful. It definitely seemed like microwaved lack of flavor frozen food that you could get in any grocery store and heat up & throw on a plate. Disappointed with the food, margarita was mediocre. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Great service and food. AND the BEST TEQUILA and best prices. My new favorite hangout."}
{"text":"You can either go to Juan Jaime's or save a few bucks and go to Taco Bell.  Very forgettable Mexican food."}
{"text":"Very nice place to relax and enjoy some good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"YUM!! 

I'm glad we found this place! Great happy hour, great prices, love all of the salsa options. I also like that it's casual but still not a boring place to be for happy hour (which goes until 8pm). Very smart on the restaurants part since we usually couldn't make it until like 6 anyway. 

Paul (name on ticket) was a great server! The manager was walking around (I think he was a manager) and he seemed really friendly and attentive. 

This is our new spot for some good Mexican food. I had the taco salad with steak and my fiancé had tacos with rice and beans. Yum!!"}
{"text":"overpriced and poor quality food. the service was slow. We had an hour for and had to get to go boxes once they finally gave us our food. was never given a drink refill in the hour we were there."}
{"text":"We just tried this restaurant for the first time !!!  What a well-kept secret !!!  We ate outside on the patio and it was a GORGEOUS evening weatherwise !!!  The service was PHENOMENAL,,,,, extremely friendly and efficient !!!  The salsa bar is a fun added touch !!! Food was DELICIOUS and all at such reasonable prices !!!!  We will be making this a weekly regular event !!!  We will be spreading the word to others !!!  Scottsdale needs more places like this !!  Casual atmosphere, great staff, and wonderful food !!!  Thanks Juan Jaime's !!!"}
{"text":"A great find. The menu is simple, the food was really good (burrito enchilada with ground beef and red sauce, mmm...), and the margaritas are dynamite. Great value also. Add the happy hour in there and you have a solid pick."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a poor example of how not to prepare, as well as serve Mexican food. I should have ran when I saw a hot dog on the menu, then got served small portions on a plastic plate. The food was simply horrible, and my date said her tacos (while chicken) tasted like fish. I had enchiladas, and they were the incorrect meat combinations I had ordered. Not only that but there was no flavor and it was also salty. I returned our overpriced dishes, paid for our beers and drove home-- only to get sick along with my date the following day! seriously!  I have doubts about the cleanliness of their kitchen. Is the cook washing his cutting boards properly? Mixing meats? ..... Won't be back in my lifetime. 

The only redeeming thing about the experience was that our polite and courteous Waitress was well versed in the procedure of returning their sub par pseudo mexican dishes to the kitchen.

** Note to the owner:   Even IF a meal was comped , I don't think Id be back. I appreciate the response, saying your kitchen is clean. Perhaps both my girlfriend and I just endured a rare occurrence ; but the food wasn't good either.  I think it's time for a new kitchen staff, and probably new guidelines on how to prepare or store meat.  Just my two cents ; because I never get sick from food - this was my first time in 10 + years. And if you get me sick, you can bet your bottom dollar I won't be back."}
{"text":"A simple setting with flavorful food. The title of this place says it all. The service takes it a little further. Hits the spot when I'm craving this genre of food and liquid libations."}
{"text":"Best margys ever! Love the staff 
The muddled orange margy is to die for 
Great spicey bean dip! Very accommodating. Great place"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great food, awesome Happy hour and manager Brendan is the best!"}
{"text":"We love the enchiladas here, and of course the margaritas.  And quite inexpensive for the area."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I probably would not have stopped in here - but I'm glad I did go because I really like this place.

No this is not \"true mexican food\" everyone - it's a healthier interpretation of an Americanized version.  They try hard and the food is very good - and I give them 4 stars for that.  

They have healthier options you can choose like whole wheat instead of flour tortillas if you'd like.  The Taco Salad comes with a Cilantro Vinaigrette that is yummy and light and there is no fried taco shell.  One small note - the ground beef is a bit spicy so if you're not a spice fan, you should opt for the steak instead.

Favorites on the list - Burrito (ground beef) Enchilada style with creamy green sauce, Taco Salad and the tacos are really good.  My favorite tacos are the Mahi and -- holy crackers -- the shrimp taco's are to die for!  I also love their refried beans.  Not sure what they do to them but they are creamy, delicious and addicting.

Ask for a Top Shelf margarita made by Eric and you will get a smoooooth and wonderful taste sensation.  The family and I go on Saturday afternoons as we always do and we've been coming here the longest now.  Yes, you pay for the chips and salsa but they are fresh and the rest of the food is so reasonable, I've paid more for much worse in other places that served free chips.

Go in, have a margarita and some chips and queso.  Ask for Eric and let them know Olga and Ryan sent you..."}
{"text":"Love chips & Guac!  Chips and thin and crispy, not too salty.  Love the guac because it's basically just avocados!  I hate it when places add tons of purple onion & garlic- torturous on my tummy, but not here!"}
{"text":"We were looking for an outdoor type of spot to munch at...... Soooo happy we stopped here. The food was delish and our waiter was great. Suggestive and attentive. Great experience!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice with a group of people and were very pleased with the Service. The food is very good and fairly priced. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are always awesome and a good place to relax with some friends.  Food is consistently horrible.  I decided to give their tacos another shot and they were even worse than the first time.  I can whip up something more flavorful in my kitchen."}
{"text":"Come on AZ, why does this place have high ratings for its food? I use to live in Phoenix (86-2011) grew up in Phoenix, went to Horizon High, and there are 10 places in Charlotte, NC ( live now) that have better tacos and food. They have a basic menu which is great and they should be great at it however the food is below par, filibertos makes a better burrito and taco. Disappointed to say the least as I was wanting a great Taco and a cold beer ( cold beer  they did have). I am sure there are better places for great tacos and burritos, this place is not it. Some details: meat was dry no real or original flavor, chips and salsa were ok, burrito was more rice and beans than anything else with very little flavor."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, many years.  Not for any bad reason but use to work around here and don't anymore. But I forgot how much I liked this place. The drinks were so good and the food was great except for the Spanish rice,  but other then that it was great. Our server Justine was amazing very accommodating. We will come back. They have a salsa bar, that my fiance loved."}
{"text":"Place is a filthy hole in the wall. Food is awful. Chicken tastes old.... And I'm only talking about a chicken taco. The Salsa bar is a joke. The salsa is watered down and tastes like garbage. A salsa bar is a horrible idea to begin with... Breeds germs. The bathrooms are filthy which makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. A strong 1 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have eaten here many times with my family.  The service is always great.  The owner takes notice of repeat customers and frequently stops by the table to say hello.  The Pork Street Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas and Chicken Burritos are all amazing.  I have tried all of the salsas in their \"Salsa Bar\" and they are great as well.  

I also really enjoy the casual laid back atmosphere with TV's that play various sports.  They have a great outdoor patio area that is nice when the weather is cooler (although I think the furniture out there could be upgraded a bit).

On the weekends there is a cool vibe and it turns into a busy \"watering hole\" with great food.

We will definitely eat here again... and again...  :)"}
{"text":"Good salsas, cheap drinks and food, had quesadilla and hard taco .. I would recommend to go for happy hour drinks and quick snack!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The salsa bar is amazing. The staff is wonderful and the food is great. We drive 20 minutes at lunch just to eat here."}
{"text":"Best local hot spot. Perfect place for a quick lunch, happy hour or late night fun. Great prices, friendly staff and fun atmosphere.. All age groups enjoy Jjs!"}
{"text":"Spicy Mango Margarita.... enough said. I am not a huge Margarita drinker but I would come back to this restaurant just for that drink. It was so delicious and I think the spicy aspect of the drink took out the sweetness of the margarita, which I loved! I did not eat any food, my aunt and I came here for a happy hour, but all the food looked amazing and I would love to  try. Next trip to AZ, I will be revisting for this one of a kind spicy drink!"}
{"text":"Food was okey. No real flavors.
Nachos and dips are good though.
Place is pretty cool for some drinks."}
{"text":"Go here too often for my own good. 3.50$ margaritas till 8, you can't go wrong there. 
 Haven't really tried the food, but like the chips and salsa. Large tequila selection if you're into that. Also, friendly staff! :)"}
{"text":"Well....as a huge fan of fish tacos, I was excited to try this place and see what they offered. Meh. I had fish tacos and my husband had i think had the chicken tacos and we both left hungry. For the price you pay for the meal (if you'd call it a meal) it leaves you very empty. Maybe not bad for a late night bite to eat and a drink but I wouldn't suggest going for a dinner. Oh and the fish tacos were just average."}
{"text":"What a great place. For lunch, chose the Mahi-Mahi burrito with black beans and rice in flour tortilla with sour cream side.

Abundant chips with variety of salsas and different hotnesses.

Simple, fresh and tasty Tex-Mex. 

Returned in the evening for well-made Margarita. A quality margargita made with 1800 and Cointreau is $10. House margaritas are $4...yep.

Based on freshness and value, highly rate Juan Jamie's, and will return.

Small gripe:  with the hard walls, the place is noisey for a conversation."}
{"text":"Went in on a Wednesday night about 8:15pm and sat on the patio. The service was terrible, our waitress forgot several items, we ran out of drinks multiple times and the food wasn't very good. This place reminds me of a little classier fast casual Mexican restaurant with a very limited menu. The person I was with made the comment that blue coast burrito is way better(and that place is horrible)

If this place was the only place open I would probably go the jack n the box next store and get 2 tacos for .99

Skip this place"}
{"text":"Ok here's an update. Just to give a little back info the owner of JJ emailed me through yelp because he was concerned about my low review and bad experience.  I thought that was kind of impressive he would actually care that much. He was nice and I had kind of forgotten about it.

Well it was a really pretty day in AZ and I happened to be in the neighborhood so I decided to give it another try. Maybe it could have been an isolated incident and I don't like to be an evil yelper. I choose to sit outside since it was so nice and I was immediately helped and got a drink fast ( good start ).  Ordered the veggie tacos which came out promptly.  This was about the same time I ate here last time just for reference. Taylor my waiter informed me there is a salsa bar so I headed inside to grab some salsa verde.

The tacos were quite good as well as the rice and salsa verde. I'm not usually a fan of black beans, but they really were nice. I would give it 3.5 stars for food, but maybe since I am in a good mood today and Taylor was a very cheerful and excellent waiter I am going with 4.

I'll be back, but so far seems like I just hit them on a bad day last time."}
{"text":"I love coming here after 9PM.  Such a fun atmosphere!

Food is always awesome! and the bartenders are even better.  They treat you like family and take care of you like family.  You're not just a customer here, you're a guest!"}
{"text":"Food and service on the restaurant side...meh.

The bar looks looks like a pretty decent place to hang for a few hours though, if you're into tequila (they have quite an impressive tequila menu)...and happy hour is from 4-8pm daily (more like happy evening!!) 

:)"}
{"text":"Great place nice food and wonderful tequila selection, ask for Erin at the bar for the best service."}
{"text":"Spicy mango margarita on happy hour! It's the best thing they've got. 

I always get the chicken burrito with a wheat tortilla and black beans, with the rice on the side. They give you a generous portion and I'm able to add as much or as little as I want to my burrito, depending on how hungry I am. 

Their happy hour is great, and they have an awesome range of margaritas and beers. 

I also have to say that they are SUPER willing to help you plan an event. They've offered to set aside the patio for a large party, and they really seem to take the time to help you without being difficult. I never felt like I was an inconvenience to make requests of them. They have wonderful customer service. 

Get there early on Friday/Saturdays, because it WILL fill up. The food is great for the price and quality. 

Also, try the taco sauce on the salsa bar. It's spicy, but SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican place I've been to in Chandler. I have eaten here several times but my favorite is the egg and chorizo enchilada with creamy green sauce, recommended by my bartender Craig (who is the most amazing bartender and makes the most amazing margaritas!!!) this place is one of my favorite hang outs after work and any day. And great happy hour!!  Craig is the best bartender ever and always has the best recommendations and is willing to do basically anything for you. Highly recommend this place. ! 10 stars !"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a low cost meal in North Scottsdale, this is it!  Great for dine-in and take-out, my husband and I love this place!

Know what you are getting into...its not fancy...just a fun local hang out."}
{"text":"We go here all the time.  It is a great neighborhood place and the Cadillac Margaritas are amazing!  The food is very simple, fresh and delicious.  Some of the staff has been there for years and you get very good service!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very poor service and their tacos tasted like corn tortillas.  You had to load them up with salsa for flavor.  Salsa selection is nice as in the patio seating.  Makes sense for happy hour but the beer i had from the tap was pretty flat.  Really not much good to reference here except the salsas.  Unfortunately that is not something you can build a restaurant on."}
{"text":"JJ's is a staple for my office. It's close, consistent, and well priced. Their Happy Hour is also a great value, and goes later from 4-8 pm DAILY. Beat that! $4 house margaritas pack a punch along with the value. Not a ton of flavor - but take a trip to the salsa bar and add your own. I feel like it's healthier with less grease and maybe that's the flavor compromise. One of the best choices in the shopping center, by far."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. We went for date night. The food was good. Not great but definitely not bad. Seasoning was spot on. Plenty of options. Wish their happy hr extended to food items. Although prices are not too bad. Plenty of food per serving. I had the salad with the pork, and my husband tried two tacos. One pork one ground beef on hard shell. We went with my sister ava get husband who had 3 tacos and the mahi mahi. I tried the sangria which was very good. The margarita (house) however was blah...to much margarita mix...The server was slightly rude not really helpful. We asked that instead of having to get up every time she brought a chip refill if she would also bring the salsa that comes with it as well. She said no and that we could refill it ourselves. She could have been more customer oriented. That's a big thing for me is customer service ave she definitely failed. However,  The regular house salsa and pico de gallo were the best things on the salsa bar. Loved that we could grab radishes and cabbage for the tacos. I would go back to take advantage of happy hour and maybe have a snack."}
{"text":"This place proves that tastes in food is purely subjective.  So with that in mind, I'll submit my review of Juan Jamie's.  While in Chandler to visit family, we had a hankering for Mexican food.  I lived in Chandler for a few years, so I'm familiar with El Zocalo, Serrano's etc.  Wanting to try something new and not wanting to run up a big bill for drinks, and checking the Google reviews (sorry YELP, I definitely paid for it later) we chose Juan Jaime's.  WHAT A MISTAKE.  Ok, ok.  Yes the Happy Hour Margaritas are passable for $5, and for cheap drinks I would recommend J.J.'s  But the food was horrible!  Frozen dinner Mexican food. Taco Bell quality food.  Bad. Bad. Bad.  I've eaten Mexican food all over the West...but Juan Jaime's ranks up there with the worst.  Happy Hour cheap drinks/chips and salsa? Yes.  Food?  No. No way.  Pass!  Run for your life! Horrible.  And not only that?  It's just not very good at all!"}
{"text":"Good simple food in a simple clean atmosphere.  Service was great and attentive.  This is a great drop in and grab a bite kind of place with generous servings."}
{"text":"There's better & more authentic Mexican food just down the street.. Great service but i was hoping to be impressed. Rice did not taste good. Mahi Mahi tacos were too fishy but their hot green salsa saved em."}
{"text":"I was next door for a hair cut, which Brooke did an excellent job and their prices are very reasonable, and saw this place so I went in for lunch. The place wasn't very crowded and that worried me a bit but I figured what the hell. 

I'm glad I went in. I had a super burrito, enchilada style and a ice tea. The waiter was very friendly and was very attentive but not over bearing. Although it wasn't crowded I'm pretty sure he wss the only one waiting on tables and he did a great job. 
He brought me chips and a mild salsa and informed me they have a salsa bar and it has a variety of different degrees of heat to them. He even explained which was which. I like extra spicy but tried 3 different ones. They all had good flavor. 

He brought my burrito out fairly quickly. But , again, it wasn't that crowed. The burrito was very good. I choose ground beef and it was good. Very tender. Lol. And it was a big burrito. 

My bill came to right around $13 so the price is very reasonable. You almost spend that at Taco Bell. Next time I'll try the carne asada.

It's a good place with good service, and good prices. Oh, it was very clean too. You can't go wrong with that combination."}
{"text":"Love going to this restaurant! The authentic New Mexican food with sauces and salsas made from Hatch green and red chiles is amazing! We have been going here for years not only for the great food, but also the warm friendliness of the staff, too.  (Zach, Sammie, Ervin, Paul, Amber!) Most of them have been there for years and it's always nice to catch up. Oh, and last but definitely not least, the bartenders are the best, too! Best margaritas around! Great job, Senior Jaime!"}
{"text":"Service and the margaritas were good but the food was awful. Very Far from authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Could not be more impressed! My husband and I are new to the area and brought my mother here when she was visiting and we love the Tex-mex food.. so much we came here twice in three days. My mother and husband ordered the burrito enchilada style, they said it was very very good. Red sauce is a little spicy but the green was delicious! I ordered two hard shell tacos and they were so so great! The shells were fresh as well as the chips, for sure made in house. Highly recommend this place and happy hour drinks are awesome! Even not during happy hour prices are very reasonable. Great service as well, we will be visiting here frequently!! :)"}
{"text":"In quiet chandler there isn't many options. This is a pretty good place. Crowd is young in the evening, especially after all the local servers get off work and come here to spend their tips. Get the tacos trio. Get the margarita special and keep em coming."}
{"text":"One word: BEANS.

I'm not sure what demi-god they have in the kitchen cooking up their beans, but I kid you not, these are the. best. beans. you will ever have the pleasure of consuming. Like, I can't get over it, they were that good. And it's weird because beans are a side, they don't have to be that good, but they are! 

I ordered three tacos to-go: steak, pork, and chicken. All were decently flavored and good portions - leaning on the bigger side which I didn't mind at all. There were bites of the chicken taco and the mexican rice that came with the order, that were a little bit dryer than I would like it to be. But the flavors were there and adding one of their many salsas helped with the dry meat/rice. Which, by the way, they have several good salsas, all with different kicks to them and levels of heat. Very good!

But like I mentioned, get the friggin beans and you'll be happy! 

I will be back, bringing friends! And looking forward to trying some of their margs and other entrees. 

Also, their service was super quick and friendly! Now go get some beans!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are delicious and margaritas are strong. Great meal for the price.  Oh and the salsa is good too."}
{"text":"Went on Wed for happy hour and pretty dead.  Taco's good, cheap margaritas are what you pay for.  Will give it another shot another time."}
{"text":"One of my meetup groups decided to have a meeting at Juan Jaime's.  I had driven by the location and never even noticed it!  Parking is a little crowded even though it is in a strip center.  We were promptly greeted and our server was wonderful - very attentive during the 3 hours we ate and drank.  We all tried the house Margaritas and not only are they strong, but they have a wonderful taste!  Chips were light and crunchy - I like that style even though they are oily.  Many salsas to choose from, all ranging from mild to medium in heat - nothing too spicy.  I had the tostada and taco plate and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican food in town. Its modern Mexican food with awesome margaritas. I would recommend getting the 3 tacos first time you go, try steak, chicken and the mahi is a must its a great start to see what your favorite would be. I love the mahi fish its defiantly one of my fave. second time you come go with the platter of your favorite, you can do a combo like steak and mahi platter is what i get, it comes with rice and beans oh and the rice is the best BTW. When you get the chips and salsa ask for spicy bean dip its not on the menu so you have to ask, its beans mixed with their green chili and its the best bean dip i have ever had. I go there like once or twice a week its worth the drive even to the one in Scottsdale that one is also really nice the bar is open to the outside so it feels like your almost on the beach in Mexico."}
{"text":"not good! Stale taco shells and very little meat inside..We left hungry!! Pay for chips and salsa? What's that about?"}
{"text":"Local favorite for us, no complaints! They have a great happy hour menu and mix up a stellar margarita!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty. Service was good. However,  the music playlist is pretty bad. Staff is aware, but I guess they can't change it."}
{"text":"You just have to go out for Mexican on Cinco de mayo and really glad we came here. The food had great flavor and descent price.  Vegetarian burrito was perfect and I would definitely go back for that alone.  The margarita was yummy as well, but may of skimped on the tequila. Great service also."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, place was not packed at all. Had an hour for lunch, figured could have a good lunch across the street from work & not feel rushed. We ended up having to get to-go boxes for our food after 45 min. My order was missing rice that came with it. Not the biggest deal but really? Also took a while to get the check. I used to like this place, not anymore. Will go back for drinks, but this was my last time dining here"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a salsa bar and the best refried beans in country. 
Try the burrito with beans and the creamy green enchilada sauce.
I've pretty much eaten everything on their menu and keep coming back to that burrito.
Service is always on top of things and quick with a drink refill. 
Juan Jaimes is a weekly stop for me and the family."}
{"text":"Ended up here because my original destination was hosting a private party.

Obviously popular with people from the neighborhood. Lots of folks who greeted each other at the tables,

Food was passable. Beer list was week, but it is billed as a tequila place.

Chips were wimpy. They don't stand up to the guac. I never understand this.

Overall, the place was OK, just not someplace I would choose as a destination."}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is a cool ambient neighborhood place to get some cocktails and drinks. I've definitely had some better Mexican food, but Juan Jaime's is pretty good. They have a build your own salsa bar which is pretty cool, but makes me feel like I'm at Chipotle. Overall, this place is perfect for a quick dinner after work, or a to hang out at the bar on Saturday Night."}
{"text":"Listen. Whoever owns this place.... please don't ever let your food come out cold like it did for us to other people. My wife got fish and steak tacos..... the freakin cheese wasn't even melted. So you can imagine how hot the steak and fish was....freaking cold.. but at least the beer was decent but of course you can't really mess up beer. Get your act together. I can get better food at philly b's."}
{"text":"Uber-casual, relaxed atmosphere with DELICIOUS Mexican fare. We started the meal with their trio dip sampler which included a salsa, guac, and queso. Perfect app to snack on while watching a Copa America soccer match (which is what we were there to do). The dips were very flavorful. There's free refills of the salsa at the diy salsa stand, so we tried a few new ones too. Each was vibrant and clearly made fresh. 

For my entree I had the taco salad- perfect. Some taco salads are heavy and leave me feeling like I might as well have splurged on the enchiladas, but this one was perfect. The veggies were fresh, chicken well seasoned, and cooked perfectly. My husband got the burrito and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't an overly large one: big, to be sure, but he didn't leave feeling like a stuffed burrito.

They have a full bar here with a good selection of tequilas. I had two tequila/grapefruit drinks and my husband had several margs. Next time we want high quality and highly relaxed Mexican fare, we'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos.  They were ok, nothing special.  They put cheese in the black beans and they were not appetizing at all.  They are close to where I live but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I actually go to Juan Jaimes all the time and probably take out at least 4 or 5 times a month.   For the most part, I love it... I really do.  Food is consistent, staff is great and all the rest.  We order the same thing every time and almost perfect street tacos for us. Service is usually spot on, and super quick.  Now, why the one star well, I am certain they are NOT using the brands of tequilas they represent.  Last time I was in was the last straw.  I sent a letter letting them know about it around 4 months ago, where I had a detailed denial (on my third try).  I drink the same reposado almost every day.  (a small glass), So I know exactly what it is.  In fact, I had the same experience with one other there prior at the same place.  I think they switch bottles and brands and don't think anyone will notice.  I'd skip buying a drink if you care what you like, and what you're paying for.  Food really is okay, you kind of get what you'd expect, basic tacos that are middle of the road at a good value."}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's has been my favorite neighborhood Mexican place for quite some time. Good food, great service with a casual, friendly vibe.  I've especially enjoyed bringing my pups to the dog friendly patio.  Unfortunately, the last few times I've sat on the patio, I've gagged on cigar and cigarette smoke and had to pack up my food and leave. I'm very familiar with the law and that smoking IS allowed.  So, I would try to sit outside at off times, when it's not crowded.  Even that's not working anymore. Now, it's my choice to stop going there as many other restaurant patios are smoke free by choice as well as dog friendly!"}
{"text":"We went for the Happy Hour which ends at 8:00. 
The place is divided into two parts with the well stocked bar on your right and a dining area on the left.

 The $4 wines were good.  They offer, burritos & salads with a good selection of fillings.  

My taco had the grilled mahi mahi which was excellent but a wee bit dry.  There Salsa Bar is unique and I used their pico de gallo and other salsas to spice up my tacos.

The unique feature of the mahi mahi that I liked is that it is not breaded.  If you have been to Rubio's for their good fish tacos, sometimes you get more breading than actual fish.

My partner had the chicken salad & enjoyed having the toppings grouped together on top and having the cilantro dressing separate.

Our server, Sara, was great.  As the saying goes, she was \"attentive without being intrusive\".   

We noticed families with kids of all ages.

There best parking is reserved for take out.

Another great Mexican food place is Garcia's although J J is by far better on the pocketbook."}
{"text":"Canned mexican food, taco bell is better.... rice is boxed crap.. salsa bar is weak, canned salsa. Why they have all these high reviews is beyond me. Try it for yourself. But you have been advised to find a better mexican joint... won't be back..   OH, and be sure to try there homemade canned guacamole.. waitres dropped cap from salt shaker on floor, rolled around, picked it up, screwed back onto salt shaker and put back on table, Didnt even bother to wipe it off,  do they wash there hands after using the toilet?"}
{"text":"Love the carnitas burrito enchilada style. It's a definite must if you eat here. Pretty good happy hour too."}
{"text":"Both juan jaimie's locations have good food! Convenient and always good service. Some of the best cheese enchiladas I've had! The menu is pretty bland and not too much to choose from. overall average mexican food but great location and friendly neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's does it right!  I have eaten at Juan Jaime's three times but have enjoyed libations there multiple other times.  They have a comfortable dining room and a great bar.  They also have a very spacious patio that can accommodate A LOT of guests.  

I have never been able to try anything other than the tacos.  Their tacos are served in soft tortillas (actually the tortilla is two tortillas held together by a layer of cheese).  The fish tacos are 100% on point!  The carnitas and beef tacos are out of the world as well.  They have a self serve salsa stand that may be the best part of the culinary experience.  Their salsas aren't pure heat but seem to focus on flavor instead.

Aside from the great tacos, Juan Jaime's pours a great drink!  they have a few creative drink recipes I've never seen anywhere else and a gigantic tequila selection.  They also draw a nice crowd and make you feel like a regular from your first visit."}
{"text":"Trying the Scottsdale location, have eaten at the Chandler location. Lunch with friends form the office, introduced them to street tacos and the salsa bar. Everyone enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"I was saving my \"cheat day\" for some authentic Mexican food and came to Juan jaimes. The food was as Americanized as you can get. I got the cheese enchiladas and it was very average. The drinks were good, especially at happy hour prices. We did have a very attentive server which made up somewhat for being seated in the back corner near the restrooms and kitchen. Overall, I was disappointed and probably won't return unless it's during happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm here all the time, it's the perfect neighborhood spot to grab a bite and drink and chill. It's not obnoxious and overly loud, you can just grab a booth and relax, it's dark lighting and cool, it's NOT your typical mexican-cantina. Dos Gringos has nothing on this place, I HATE DOS GRINGOS, it's sloppy, sticky, disgusting, and the food is garbage, not to mention the awful staff. Juan Jaime's has good food, it's simple but good. The staff at Juan's is also nice and accommodating, they know their people and take care of them the right way.

Juan Jaime's is a big win in my book for offering whole wheat tortillas...nobody else does I swear. They make a good burrito, they make good tacos, it's a good bite every time, I never have a bad experience eating here, and I don't get bored of it either!

I love coming here to just chill and fill up, it's relaxed, it's cool, it's a place to be."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the dark haired waitress was one of the more annoying people ever. No refills, no check, nasty attitude - so I hope she enjoyed her $1 tip. She asked if we wanted chips and salsa (free) which is strange because 100 percent of places bring those items out without asking (it was our first visit here). She was trying to get us to buy Guac and chips which was $4.75 before telling us that regular chips and salsa were free.
    This is more like a glorified Berto's kind of Mexican food with nothing priced over $10 and a kitchen staff not trained to make anything exciting. I did like my burrito which had grilled chicken and rice and sour cream, but the other smothered burrito that was ordered somehow contained very hard to chew chicken. The salsa bar had a bunch of choices with the green having the most flavor. Appears to be a neighborhood joint where everybody knows everybody. Would not dine-in again, but if in area might grab that burrito to go."}
{"text":"We went late on a Sunday afternoon and just made it in time for their lunch specials. Three mini tacos was the perfect amount of food and it allowed me to try three different kinds. I got the steak, shrimp, and chicken tacos. The steak and chicken were really good, the shrimp taco was good too, but I'm partial to the Baja Fresh shrimp taco-that one is my favorite. My boyfriend got the carnitas taco and said it was really good too. I wasn't too impressed with the salsas. The green one was my favorite. The atmosphere was great for either a quiet afternoon lunch, but I could also see it being a really fun place for night life too! I can't wait to go back and order a margarita! I love the simple, straight-forward menu and the extremely reasonable prices. Our server/bartender was very nice too!"}
{"text":"I guess the only bad thing I could say about this place is that it is not closer to my house. The staff truly cares for every customer, not just the regulars. Both locations are very consistent. Food is always great. Best misters in town. And the choice of salsa is like no other. I met the owner a couple times and he took every word from my mouth to heart. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I usually never change my review...so this is a first.  After giving this place a very honest review (not favorable) I had been contacted by the owner to come back.  He had said he had made a bunch of changes.  I refused, and wished him luck.  As it turns out my friends go there A LOT and drug me in there one night.  Our service was amazing...and fast.  Everyone there was so wonderful, I felt bad about my previous review.  I wondered if the great experience was because my friends go all the time, and it was just them that were getting great service.  I went with my hubby a few days later.  Our server was beyond amazing.  I told him I have some food allergies, and he was so great about it.  Our food came very fast, and just how we had ordered it.  There were a lot of people in that night, but our server still took the time to chat with us for a second.   We went back a THIRD time...still waiting for the prior bad experience to rear it's ugly head.  We had a different server...much to my surprise, she was amazing as well.  Not only was she great, our server from the last time saw us and made sure he said good bye to us.  I give the owner a big congrats on turning this place around.  It is now one of my favorite mexican food places in the area.  Congrats Juan Jamie's...you changed this stubborn girls mind!!!!"}
{"text":"Caitlyn is an awesome waitress. Very attentive when she needs to be; leaves me alone when I am working or talking. Plus the food is solid and they have a salsa bar where you can mix two good salsas into an awesome salsa."}
{"text":"What the heck!  This place has awesome tacos and salsa! ! Happy hour is great and if in question just ask your bartender.  Love it...kitchen open till 12 am ...... thats just cray cray good.  LoL."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place. I work graves, so I also appreciate that this place serves food until 1am because my sleep and eating schedule operate way out of bounds of the normal hours of operation for most places. Portion sizes are excellent for the amount you pay. I had the steak tacos and they were a little under seasoned and dry, truthfully, but the house salsa fixed it right up. I also wasn't a big fan of the guacamole, but that's a personal preference. We were fans of the rice and received beans though. Super tasty! My boyfriend had the chicken tacos and he liked them quite a bit. Our waitress (didn't catch her name) was very nice and attentive. We're not drinkers, so we really appreciate that she didn't push us to buy alcohol like some places can do. Overall, I'd check this place out again and try some of the other stuff they have to offer (I was excited to see they serve their taco salad in a wheat bowl!)."}
{"text":"It's what you shiuld expect from a Mexican place. Decent food, good prices, awesome happy hour. Worth a visit. We have ended up there regularly for weeks now."}
{"text":"Food and service is was bad. The food has no flavor and the meat wasn't fresh. Only good thing is the salsa"}
{"text":"Best cheese enchiladas ever!. Have been here many times and it is consistently great. With the nice weather approaching we look forward to sitting on the outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is where the simple taste of Mexico are served with delectable results.  The kitchen produces vibrant fiesta flavors that left me wanting more. The simple menu offers approachable, exciting, delicious food that satisfies any appetite.  The Margarita's flavor should be praised. And the staff is top notch.  This is just what Chandler needed.  If you go ask for the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  You'll thank me later.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I thought it was good, not amazing but good. The waitress was super friendly and helpful talking about the drinks and menu.  I had  the chicken taco, enchilada, and bean tostada. Tacos are great! Didn't like the creamy green sauce and the tostada was good. Wish they had the cabbage with lime juice, they only had plain shredded cabbage. All in all, stop in for a taco and great tequila."}
{"text":"Drinks are good but skip the steak anything...

Came in looking for some good grub. The place itself is great in decor and friendliness. Bartender was super friendly and quickly upsold my water to a vodka redbull (nicely done!). I was stoked for my comida. 

I ordered the steak tacos (hold the onion) and unfortunately was less than impressed. ***I was raised to always appreciate a chefs effort.*** However I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BETTER FOOD FROM A FOOD TRUCK! Not sure how long the meat had been sitting out but they definitely overcompensate on spice the way McDonald's does with salt on heat lamp french fries. 

Thank goodness I was able to add flavor to the taco with my guac and salsa. But after one taco I regretted my choice and thought... I should have had a salad :/

I will definitely give them another try but perhaps try the chicken or mahi next time :)"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout for a fun buzzing atmosphere. Great for happy hour and fun dinner."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's a super short walk from where I live, but I wouldn't recommend it as a place to go if you would have to drive more than a few minutes. My boyfriend & I have only been going in for lunch where it's been pretty empty & quiet.

The place is pretty nice inside for a strip mall restaurant and has a small outdoor patio with an indoor/outdoor bar and window walls that open up. There are a few tv's for watching games. The menu is standard tex mex & delivers a good meal, if not especially exciting. I've had:

- Quesadilla: These things are massive, as in an entire pizza pan massive. The cheese is a little on the rubbery side, and there isn't much filling other than cheese. 
- Queso Dip: Better than nacho cheese but not as good as queso fundido. It's fine for dipping.
- Salad: Fresh fillings & decently sized. 
- Cheese Enchiladas: Pretty okay. The sauce is average, but tastes really amazing if you're looking for a greasy alcohol absorbing meal. 
- Rice: Average. Pretty much tastes like grocery store rice."}
{"text":"What a waste of an evening. Before I ordered I asked the waiter if the hard shelled taco shells came pre-made or if they make them here. He assured me that they were a \"scratch restaurant\" and that they were made to order. 
Well............... out came our orders which consisted of pre-made taco shells and overcooked fillings. The mahi-mahi was cooked to death and the beef and pork were not even warm. Everything was covered with a mass amount of shredded iceberg lettuce and cheese. The beans and rice had little taste and weren't hot. 
This place caters to what I'm guessing are out of town visitors who have absolutely no idea what actual Mexican food should taste like. The saddest part is that if the waiter was upfront when asked abut the taco shells we would have paid for our drinks and eaten dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"The wife and I make this a regular stop, like several times a week regular.  We have been coming here since they opened and many of the staff are like family.  The food is good, the service is excellent and the prices are fair.  This is our go-to bar."}
{"text":"We love Juan Jaimes! Great food, great service, best homemade margaritas! Time after time they don't disappoint!"}
{"text":"So when I get up on Saturday mornings I make sure my husband has started on the mile-long honey-do list I've left him, and I shake my finger at him and then say, \"No Bud Light until you're finished with that list, Mister,\" and then I pile on a gallon of some Jessica Simpson designer imposter perfume, put on my yoga pants, a push-up bra, my most over-priced tank top, and grab my squalling 16-month-old to go meet up with my best girl, Traycee, and shop at Nordstrom Rack.  We drag my kid, Barrington, all over the store, and he's screaming the whole way, but really, who cares?  Then we head to Juan Jaime's for half a bottle of tequila and a couple of tortilla chips, and Barrington is still screaming, but again, who cares?  I  had a great time and jacked the credit card up six- or eight-hundred dollars.  I forget, but I don't pay the bill so whatever.  

Man.  There is a whole other world out there, and I'm glad I don't live in it.  But sadly, sometimes I catch the effects of it.

I am so glad we finally tried Juan Jaime's.  Ladena has always been our server, and she is awesome.  She makes sure those drinks don't get empty and is quick with the food and the check as well.  

I have a new love.  It's their pomegranate margarita.  Delicious!  Right now I can't feel my elbows or my kneecaps and I'm pretty sure I only weigh 110 pounds.  That's a great drink!  We've also had the street dog lunch special, the carnitas and beef tacos, the nachos, and the cheese enchiladas.  Everything is tasty and reasonably priced.  

Next time we'll have to try the patio where we can then be entertained by all the bad drivers on Chandler Blvd.  GREAT place!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and great margaritas.  Often stop here on the way home.  Is a treat for us way up in NE valley to have a place like this right here in our neighborhood.  Sure, South Phoenix has the best mexican but that is also 40 miles away!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! BUT!!!! And it's a huge BUT!!! Like KIM KARDASHIAN BIG!!! Their music SUCKS!!! Ace the Scottsdale club bullshit! Give me some reggae beats, slightly! Sublime! That shit you play is wretch!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  Love the indoor/outdoor type of seating.
Guacamole, chips and salsa were decent.
I had a ground beef taco that was too salty (coming from a gal who loves salt).  But maybe that was a one off so I'd like to try this place again."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for North Scottsdale.  There is nothing more than $10.  The taco trio is really good.  Comes with rice and beans.  I always have at least one mahi mahi.  Love it.  I also like the Mahi platter is I want a little less carbs.  Antonio is awesome he makes great margaritas which are really a deal.   Their happy hour is one of the more generous in town, it is until 8pm.  Another great thing is that they are open late.  Everything around our neighborhood closes around 9pm."}
{"text":"This place had such amazingly tasty tacos and their salsa bar was the bomb. Will be eating here again now that I am back in town. Oh and the service so chill. Check it out."}
{"text":"White people Mexican food.  The beans and rice tasted like they were straight from a box.  The salsa was bland, including several of the options from their \"salsa bar\".  The meat was tender, but lacked flavor.  The service was prompt and friendly, but that's not enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"Love Juan Jaimes! My go to meal is the beef hard shell tacos with salsa bar.  The server always remembers my name and order!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing drinks. Best bartenders. Everyone in chandler should go. But need a new music playlist. Always the same songs every time."}
{"text":"Juan Jaimes is a very decent place to wine (mixed drinks) and dine.
My only observation is that although the food is mighty tasty, I wouldn't be surprised if it was all cooked in a microwave."}
{"text":"fantastic low priced margaritas, that have quite the punch.  the food is ok at best.  the only mexican restaurant that I know of that does not have a fajitas option.  The service can be quite challenging at times and they are reluctant to make any change requests to any menu item. 

I won't be coming here for dinner anymore, now it will just be drinks."}
{"text":"I had to give 3 stars because the margarita was kind of bad. I didn't tell my server but this thing tasted too like too much tequila. I don't like my margaritas that strong. They have a salsa bar. I had a green enchilada and taco. It was combo plate for $7.95. Like the food more than the margarita. Went here because I met someone who works there once at a bar. Friend of a friend. But he wasn't working that night."}
{"text":"Always delivers. #lovemesomeJuanJaimes The food is always awesome and fresh. Love the margaritas and love their service."}
{"text":"I just here from texas and the food here is decent but sometimes its the service that bumep up the stars.   The bartender Shane is friendly remebers his costumers and welcomes them like a friend.  Which is nice being new to the area"}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is probably one of the best Mexican watering holes I've been to in a very long time. And, the food isn't bad either!!  LOL

Recently, one of friend was relocating back to the Midwest and we came here for the send off. Inside was packed as usual, but the thirty of us held court outside for three hours. Everything went smoothly and the service was mostly good. 

Nachos, Street Tacos, we all served hot and hit the spot. The tab? Who knows. LOL. We were mostly a long neck group and they kept coming. They have all the usual beers on tap or in a bottle (photo). Nice.

We normally come here mostly for their Taco Tuesday's, but the service and the bartenders are top notch and friendly. I particularly like their Salsa bar, with limes, radishes, jalapeños peppers, and four or five different salsas. 

It's so good here, you'll come for lunch, and stay for dinner. LOL. It's the Hotel California Of Mexican restaurants. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We are in Scottsdale for a quick vacation.  We were in the mood for Mexican food and we yelped it and here we are.  Great food at reasonable prices and our server, John, was one of the best waiters we've ever had.  We will be back and I give this place an emphatic two thumbs up ."}
{"text":"JD and I stopped in for a late lunch on Superbowl Sunday.  The first thing that I noticed and loved was the salsa bar!  I am a salsa fanatic and always ask for a trough of it at every mexican restaurant I visit. How nice to be able to help myself! So we wasted no time ordering chips and a plain cheese quesadilla. I was in salsa heaven! We got every kind they had and mixed up some tasty concoctions. Chips were thin, crispy and great with salsa and our quesadilla was good too (I think it'd be hard to mess one up really)! 

I had a chicken soft taco and a cheese and onion enchilada, JD had a chicken burrito. The enchilada was the very best, covered in a spicy red sauce with just enough cheese. My chicken taco was fine but JD's burrito was pretty blah. He said it tasted like mush. I tasted it too and agreed, I think because all you could really taste was rice. There wasn't a whole lot of chicken in it. We agreed that the salsa bar and the enchilada saved the place from failing (in our eyes) and agreed to give it another go in the future."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood find , if I lived here I'm sure I'd frequent this place often, food was great and I like that the portions weren't huge. They have a huge tequila selection,margaritas were of the hook, and I liked the salsa bar. Our waitress was nice and friendly as well."}
{"text":"This place has become a regular go to spot for our family. The variety of tacos and salsa bar pleases everyone at our table. The kids are also happy with their choices. 
The prices are reasonable. Tonight four of us ate a nice meal with drinks for $43. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Awful food bad service. Anything else? I worked by here for a while and some team members liked to come into this place at lunch for drinks. Even the cheese crisp SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, good vibe, decent margaritas, but the food is rice, rice, and more rice.  The burritos are mostly rice.  The \"filling\" is hard to find and very small quantities.  Good salsa \"bar\".  Happy hour was a bargain and the drinks were not downsized as most places do for happy hour."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place a dozen times and finally stopped in. We walked in at 5pm on a Wednesday, the place was empty, but during the hour the place started to fill up quickly.

Tony, the bartender is terrific.  Excellent margarita, excellent service.  I really liked the salsa, good flavor and not too spicy, and then there is a salsa bar, my husband picked a hot salsa off the bar and he really liked that. 
I had a combo, cheese enchilada and steak taco with rice and beans.  Defiantly having that taco again, delish.  Enchilada was different than I am use to but the flavor was good.  Absolutely loved the re-fried beans. Not usually a fan.  Most of the time they are thick and dry but these were creamy and delish.  Having those again also.  We have been to several Mex .rest. and so far this is the one we have agreed we will return to.  
Although I will add, I did not like the guacamole.  Not the best"}
{"text":"Just an update to my previous review. A few reviews had complained about having to pay for chips & salsa. On my most recent visit, chips & salsa were free as long as you were purchasing a meal item..."}
{"text":"Fresh food, very reasonably priced, and an awesome selection of tequila. Need I say more? An added plus, they have great happy hour selections and a misted patio."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The service was not even mediocre.  Do not like the concept in a sit down restaurant that I have to get up for salsa refills even when the chip refills are delivered to the table.  I did not care for the food.  Salsa was fine, radishes were fresh.  Did not like the mahi mahi platter, beans or tortillas.

I would not come back.  So many other dining options in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices we go every 1-2 weeks.  Wait staff is very friendly, however they often get a little bogged down if it's really busy."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos!! GREAT Margaritas!!!!  Good service and friendly. 

Don't know if anyone knew, but The Kevin McHale from the Boston Celtics was eating here with his family while we dined also."}
{"text":"Awesome for good food, spicy bloodys, salsa bar and tequila. Been going here almost weekly for five years. The best taco/beer/tequila joint in the SE valley."}
{"text":"After the previous review,  I was contacted by the owner. I was very impressed by how genially he seemed to care to find out the reason behind the low star rating and eager to fix the issues. This convinced me enough to give this place another shot.

This time I brought my boyfriend with me as well as another couple, the girl of which was there with me on my original trip to this place. 

The reason behind the stars increase was the service. Our server  was very attentive and knowledgeable. He brought me a wine list!!! It turns out they do have one! I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and the rest of the party got margaritas which were delicious!

The food was brought out quickly and was very yummy. We got appetizer trio, I ordered the fish again. This time it was actually grilled and tasted good. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food as well. The meal was finished off with Sopapillas!! Although if I could do anything different is add ice cream to dessert, Sopapillas were still great! All this and our bill was very reasonable!

I am a bit baffled by how different my two visits were! Will def go back. Great place and great prices."}
{"text":"This location is a little tricky to find... It's in the back of the shopping center, right next to the Cox Communications store. 

This place is very good. They have a great selection of authentic Mexican food, and they also have a very great Tequila bar. 

If you are planning on drinking, make sure that you go for their Happy Hour. They have some great drink specials. 


What's nice about this place is that the charge for the food is based off of what you get, not the meat. You can get a burrito with Grilled Mahi Mahi, and it is the same price as their Grilled Steak. Very tasty. 

Also, make sure that you get some Chips and Salsa. They have a great salsa bar with very fresh salsas and toppings. Their chips are cooked right there, and they have that great thin and crisp texture that makes eating them quite addicting. 

If you're looking for some great Mexican food right around the corner from the Chandler Fashion Center, look no further. This is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I told my waiter I was going to yelp about my La Pinta Pomegranate Margarita today and I meant it! Wow! Fantastic job guys. This was my first visit and the service was SPOT ON and the food fantastic. I am moving away from Chandler soon and wish you guys were in Scottsdale! Nevertheless, I'll come back, if for no other reason, just to taste the great tequilas! Keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"Service was very nice but slow due to crowd of people coming in at once.   Ambiance is very good. Comes down to food though, where the burrito I had was very dry, salsa was just ok, and guac was bland. Great chips though and salsa was (while bland), still fresh and easily accessible at the bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great happy hour pricing everyday and the margaritas are really good. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Took forever to get even acknowledged, much less to get drinks. Seriously terrible food and service. Took forever to get our bill and the waiter seemed like he was completely uninterested in doing his job. I have no idea how this place even has three and and half stars... oh wait... the chips were on point. But that's about it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love the vibe. Love the burritos and their happy hour!  Free chips and salsa are awesome.  My husband and son say that their tacos are dry.  Menu is limited.  I wish they had decent quesadillas.  We are there a lot!!!!"}
{"text":"I live down the street and it's a good thing I do. Bruh, the tequila selection? I'm like, \"Damn son! How have I not been here?\" I got the carnitas burrito and it was soooo good tomorrow I'm going back to try something else. My server I'll call \"J-Slim\" was pretty dope not bugging or rushing and at 8pm seating yourself with fast service was str8 legit. There's the patio and I'd totally have sat out there but I was half watching the basketball game. It was a good time and I'll mosdef sit outside next time. Cheers yo!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's across the street from work, has great late-night hours, and it's just super convenient.  I've given it three tries, and it's been three fails.  I won't go back.

Order #1: Take-out nachos.   They take chips from the grocery store, throw shredded cheese on them, and microwave them.  They taste just like you'd imagine they'd taste....like warm cardboard.  

Order #2: Take-out chicken tacos.  Super dry meat, very bland tacos.  Without some salsa they would have been inedible.  The only saving grace is that the salsa is decent, as are the refried beans.

Order #3: Take out carnitas tacos.  Better than the chicken, however the taco plate comes with three tacos and when I got back to work with my food I found they had only given me two tacos.  Funny...I didn't get a discount on the price....just got less food for no reason.

Yeah...this place isn't good.  Go somewhere else....save your money."}
{"text":"Just not a favorite place. Food is subpar and bar tenders seem to have their minds on the women customers versus trying to serve.  After giving a few try's will not go back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food have have been to many, many Mexican restaurants and this restaurant has the most bland food. All the salsas at the Salsa bar are almost tasteless. You would expect a mild, medium and hot salsa; not here, they all have the same bland taste. We got the chicken tacos which were soggy and skimpy on the chicken. Our meal was so unexceptional and an utter disappointment. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We are here every week. Heck this is our Weekend home.  The funny thing we are here so much the servers know our order ...  and even know the timing in which my husband orders their Kailua Brownie.. Now that is amazing service!! Oh and the margaritas are the best. In fact when we visit other locations we measure the margaritas to Juan Jamie's and nothing has reached the bar in which they have set.  Our Favorite is the Tacos Trio and the salsa bar reminds me of my Moms salsa !!"}
{"text":"Had a few tacos on a Sunday afternoon here. They were decent, but there are definitely better tacos out there. The boyfriend had a burro of some sort. It was also good, but not amazing. The rice and beans are a little sub-par if you ask me. Perhaps the drinks were good, but we weren't drinking (for once!). I hear this place is open late for an option for a late-r night drink, so I'll probably eventually end up here again for that purpose - there isn't much of that in this part of town."}
{"text":"My family and I gave this place a try because of the good reviews but I have to say, it's really pretty awful. I got a burrito and it seemed like it tried to hard to be chipotle but with less flavor. I tried my husband's enchilada style burrito and it tasted like canned enchilada sauce. All around it was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Love this Grayhawk neighborhood spot. Good food that's cheap! They have a great salsa bar as well and a nice patio area for when it's nice out!"}
{"text":"Ok, can I say I'm a tough critic so when I say this place is top shelf I mean it! The best fresh margaritas I have ever had. The guacamole is to die for, seasoned perfectly. Chips are crisp and fresh. I had a combo taco enchilada platter, was excellent and my husband had the grilled steak tacos. Flavor was superb. Must go to place in North Scottsdale. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around.   Service was super attentive and welcoming.  Drinks were good and reasonably priced.   Food was good bordering on great.   Menu is almost ala carte and overall very simple.  Easy to enjoy with little kids."}
{"text":"We have lived in area for two years. We go there at least once a week. The food is good and the service is great. Great salsa bar and outstanding tacos. Their taco salads are really good too. The most expensive item on the menu is like $10. They make a skinny margarita that my wife loves.  The best wait staff is Eric, Danny, or Tia."}
{"text":"This place needs craft beer on tap which would go well with their menu IMO.  Their grilled steak tasted great and their ingredients were fresh.  Great place to watch the game and hang out in the patio area since there are plenty of TVs around the bar area.  The waitress reminded us of Mila Kunis and Michelle Rodriguez into one ;-)"}
{"text":"Here are my thoughts about Juan Jaime's:
- I can't believe they charge for chips and salsa. This is not Taco Bell, it's a sit down restaurant.
- I asked for more salsa and the server said to me \"Oh, it's right over there at the salsa bar.\" Apparently I have to get my food myself. Not the best customer service.
- The menu is limited. That being said, I did enjoy by pork burrito, which was recommended by my server.
- The happy hour specials are pretty good. I enjoyed my strawberry margarita made with a top shelf tequila.

I really want to love Juan Jaime's because the food options directly around Chandler Mall are limited to mostly family chain restaurants. Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I come here probably more often than anyone should admit.  I wouldn't say this is the best mexican food I've ever had, but for what it is, it's awesome.  It's more of an American take on mexican food.  There's a salsa bar (which I personally love), the tacos aren't deep friend, the margaritas are typically delicious and deceptively potent and overall its VERY affordable for being in N. Scottsdale.  The service is almost consistently amazing here as well.  Some high end places probably need to take note."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  My son had the Maui Maui burrito - loved it.  The steak in the steak platter was delicious.  Definitely will return for more fantastic food."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great! Service has been lacking both times I've been here."}
{"text":"Let me just say that this has been a long time coming...

Living across the street for over two years now, Juan Jaime's is my go to place... Really it is the perfect fix for 'anytime' food or drink. 

Shane and Martin (Marteen) are the two guys that make this place what it is... Ask anyone who comes here consistently and they will tell you that its these guys will take care of you at the bar and make you're night more memorable, regardless of how it started!  

Coolest reasons to come here? ** Always, ALWAYS open until 2am. Most places close up shop around here if the heartbeat drops but you can always count one Juan's to have a drink left for you. ** Loaded quesadillas and chips and salsa are worth the trip in itself, ask Martin to spray some salt and lime juice on your chips to get that 'little extra'"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual place to eat in North Scottsdale and don't want to spend a fortune, this is a great choice. The menu might be Mexican but the decor is contemporary, no sombreros or pinatas here. It has a big patio, indoor-outdoor bar and the walls open when the weather is nice. The owner has been there almost every time I've been there, making the rounds, checking on service and shooting the breeze. The house margarita is excellent. I just automatically order one when I walk in. The menu isn't huge, mainly tacos, burritos and enchiladas, but that's ok. I'm sure it keeps the cost down and the service fast. The restaurant is located at the corner of Thompson Peak Parkway and Hayden Rd. in the Fry's Marketplace shopping center so there's plenty of parking. If you have rug rats, this place is family friendly but also cool enough to take a date on the way to a movie."}
{"text":"Love the salsa bar. Tacos not the best I will have to say. Ground beef taco was insanely greasy, pork taco Carnitas did not have good flavor , turn Asada taco blah . bar and outside seating.... clean nice place.... so good for drinking not so great for eating I will try one more time"}
{"text":"The food is just okay.  Not much of a salsa bar.  Its not bad for a quick lunch. The pricing is fair for the food quality"}
{"text":"Good food, Good service and good ambience.
Love the shrimp tacos and their salsa bar is awesome."}
{"text":"Surprisingly enough North Scottsdale is devoid of quality tacos.  Juan Jaime's has a small but solid menu that makes for a nice lunch.  I do believe that this place is better served as fast casual concept rather then a place offering sit down service."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day and over all my experiences was okay. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about either. 

My friend and I both had the Grilled Steak, which was flavored very nicely.  

The wait staff during the lunch hour were extremely nice. If you in the area and looking for a place to eat, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here last night for happy hour and dinner and we were both less than impressed. We both ordered the margaritas and we could barely drink them they were so awful. I decided to try the sangria and it literally tasted like cough syrup. It was very thick and disgustingly sweet. I couldn't even finish it. 
My friend had the tacos and she said they were \"just ok\". I had the chicken burrito and mine was about the same. Definitely nothing to rave about. 
Neither of us will be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite happy hour spot probably because it's one of the few places that has happy hour until 8pm. Love the chips and salsa with the two taco plates."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I ate there tonight for the first time and we really enjoyed the food. The Owner was there and very nice to us and it was a great balance of good food good atmosphere and reasonable prices. We will be back and bring some friends!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some work friends earlier today. The service was prompt even with the seat yourself method for lunch. I ordered the tacos plate. The food came within about 15 min which for 4 people wasn't too bad. The beans were the best thing on my dish which probably isn't the best thing considering its for tacos. The tacos were just ok nothing great and the salsa bar wasn't superb as many people said it has about 3 good salsas in my opinion at least. None of the salsas  in my opinion provided that punch i was looking for. Customer Service was awesome food just didn't match."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Super friendly staff great fast Mexican food and their Margaritas are to die for!!  They serve food till 1am everyday!! Love it!"}
{"text":"I was really unaware of the sheer number of different types of Tequila until I stumbled upon this restaurant. So thank you, Juan Jaime's, for that educational experience! 

My partner and I stumbled into Juan Jamie's for happy hour because we were intrigued by the tequila in the title. Sitting at the bar, we were entertained by the vast amount of liquor to choose from. Over the course of our time at Juan Jamie's, I got two house margaritas, and my partner did a few shots of the different tequilas. We enjoyed all of our drinks! 

Since I hate drinking without food we ordered the chips and salsa. This appetizer wasn't fantastic but it went well with the drinks! 

Overall, an a-ok experience!"}
{"text":"The tacos were great & their red taco sauce was amazing. Be sure to partake in salsa bar! The server told me the salsas are made fresh daily."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to everyone, from the mahi platter which was out of this world to the grilled chicken burrito was absolutely outstanding.From the chips and the queso to the sopapilla and margaritas, it was an amazing mouthful of heaven!!Come one come all,and try this place out, and if you come,ask for our server Brett, he made sure we were taken care of on our first visit ,and took so much pride in his work,that I thought he was the owner! An amazing experience which we will share with co workers,friends and family!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! Fast friendly, funny service. Great food. Great spot for kids. Enough said."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and full of flavor. I've liked everything I've tried here. Great service! Get Eric if you can."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but ended up being massively let down. Here's why.... Upon entry, no one greeted us. We stood there for a few minutes while servers ignored us. We had to ask a Hispanic guy where a waitress was, to which one finally came and told us we could sit anywhere. We had a party of 6 and nothing inside that was available would work, so we ended up outside on a typical hot AZ day (read: IT SUCKS). The table was utterly filthy so we asked the same Hispanic gentleman if he wouldn't mind cleaning up the table, and he was rude about it, even making a comment about us under his breath, both of which my wife and son heard. Service was HORRIBLE (had two different waitresses???), food was slow to arrive, and the tacos were subpar. My family enjoyed their meals, but me? Nope. There are far better tacos for the price out there. My family might be back, but as for me, I wont."}
{"text":"Typical strip mall Mexican food.  I ordered the steak fajitas and a flat strip steak cut into four chunks....if you're hungry this is a joke."}
{"text":"Fresh Mexican food, affordable prices and awesome staff keeps my wife and I coming back at least every other week it seems! The fresh salsa bar is stocked with mild to fiery selections to top your tacos, burritos, salads and chips."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened in 2007 I think... I love the shrimp tacos and salsa bar! Awesome drinks and great prices....happy hour is until 8pm!!!"}
{"text":"Good food fast. Strong drinks. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Overpriced and nothing special. Tried it twice in a year. Money better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome place to get a full entree or just a simple taco. Love the extended hours of serving food. The only reason for the 4 stars is they are always understaffed. In general the service is good but could be better with one more person."}
{"text":"This place rocks. I have been there twice and the staff is friendly, food is excellent and pricing is great. I will be visiting there often!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the residents of North Scottsdale keep this place all to themselves... 

JJ's (as the locals call it) is an inviting little cantina style restaurant --- with lots of big windows, high top tables, and garage style windows that open up to the delightful patio. It's the perfect stop for a casual family dinner or happy hour with friends after a long day at work.

The Margarita... fill it up again!!!

I'll start by saying that I am a very picky margarita sipper. It can't be too sweet, but definitely not too sour... and I like to taste the tequila but not get punched in the face with it. Juan Jamie's is home to my favorite margarita in Scottsdale.

The secret lies in their homemade sweet and sour concoction made daily with fresh squeezed lemon and limes. Marry this with a little triple sec and tequila of your choice and POW! I can't think of a more refreshing drink on a hot day... or a cold day...

The \"Tres Amigos\" - 3 parts AWESOME...

The \"Tres Amigos\" is an edible trio of homemade salsa, warm cheesy queso, and authentic guacamole served with a basket of house made tortilla chips.  I dare you to find a bad combination. Salsa with the cheese, cheese with the guacamole, guacamole with the guacamole... you get the picture. ;-)

I could eat these tacos all day long...

So simple, NOT boring. JJ's serves several kinds of tacos including white meat chicken, grilled mahi mahi, carnitas and shrimp... but I can't get enough of the perfectly seasoned ground beef!! You get your choice of flour or corn tortillas. 

Each taco comes with two tortillas bound together with special cheese blend --- they keep the toppings simple with a little fresh cilantro and white onion. Garnish till your heart's content with one of the 6 homemade salsas at the salsa cart...

Juan Jamie's makes everyone feel at home. So whether you live in the neighborhood or not, it's worth the trip. You'll be glad you did and I'll bet it won't be your last. :)

With food and love,
-Ashley"}
{"text":"They just celebrated their 1st year anniversary around July 4th. They have great food at an even better then average price. The staff has always been wonderful and the owners are there all the time making sure everything runs smoothly. Tuesday nights they have a special Taco & Tequila special for $20. The standard taco meal with 2 shots of tequila to sample or 4 half shots if you prefer. One of these Tuesday night I'm going to get there for that special!"}
{"text":"This place just never seems to wow me. Been there a few times but it is always just meh. Not great, not awful. The last time I went the server seemed a tad annoyed with my table. Not sure as to why? Though she did provide good service. 

The food: Chips and salsa are good! Absolutely love that they are free, and there is a nice little salsa bar which is cool. I ordered the vegetarian tacos the last time I went and they were just alright. Kind of basic and bland. Also not a big fan of their rice, and I usually like rice from pretty much anywhere. 

One big pro for me is that they are very reasonably priced, which is nice in the expensive area of North Scottsdale.

This place is just okay, not somewhere I crave the food from, but not awful."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, and service they were all amazing! It's as simple as that I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Always always always going to pick local establishments over corporate dining, and Mexican food is no exception. Juan Jaime's is a quaint little spot next to the corporate powerhouse that is Outback Steakhouse but next door to my favorite masseuse. Atmosphere is A+, Drinks A+ (i love a variety of tequila), and the food is a solid A. I've had the opportunity to work for another local Mexican food restaurant that I won't name for respect purposes but I'm sure you've been \"UP\" the street from one no matter where you are in the valley, and that combined with my childhood filled with great Tex-Mex cuisine can tell you that Juan Jaime does things right. Mexican food is a hard cuisine to perfect due to the variety of preparation techniques, and he nailed it! Salsa...amazing! And it's not overpriced food or drink! 
I truly hope that Juan Jaime continues to provide a service and product that makes Chefs like myself feel comfortable supporting local business!!

SUPPORT LOCAL...THEY ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS!!"}
{"text":"Came here with an old High School friend to catch up.  We were there for four hours.  Prices were great.  However, we really felt like we were being pushed out by the waitress, whom we paid so she could leave. She was very pleasant otherwise and good for the first half hour.   Plenty of room in the place for more tables, usually the only reason one pushes me out.   No one bothered to come after that to see if we needed anything.  I would have opened another tab.  Stingy on the chips, no one even asked if we wanted to purchase more.  Margaritas were good. Food was so so."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised tonight.  My family was about to head for the usual Chipotle's but decided to try Juan Jaimes.  Someone had recommended this restaurant but then again someone had recommended Someburros which was awful!  We ordered nachos, a burrito, the three taco plate and enchiladas and we just loved all the flavors!  We also liked the  chips and salsa that they kept bringing.  This will be our new go-to Mexican place!"}
{"text":"MARGARITA time....I love their ritas on the rocks!!! 

Their shrimp tacos are my favorite in town. I love the salsa bar. The wait staff has always been nice. The prices of  food and drink are great. This is a great place to go with friends to eat good mexican food & kick back a few drinks.
 The patio area is nice all year round."}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is good Casual Mexican food. I like that they have outdoor dining and their portions are healthy. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Nice location - okay food.  This place took over ChopSticks according to a friend and kept some of the decor ha! I can dig - recycle!  ChopSticks to Juan Jaime's?? Go figure!  Food was decent I'm not bashing it but if I can order the same at the Baja Fresh com'on!  They have great happy hour prices and for a long time too 4pm to 8pm!  Service was lacking....and the place can get kinda loud...what? I said LOUD!  I think if you're hanging with the boys tonight for happy hour I would recommend this place -- otherwise go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"My cousin Bibi and her husband Marcos came to visit this weekend, we hung out, BBQ'ed, played spades, and dominoes, and drank some really fantastic margaritas courtesy of Marcos. YUM!  So Sunday we're all tired from the day before and hungry, so we tried to hit up Sushi Ave, but it was closed!  BOOOO!  So we were like wtf, what now?  We ended up at Juan Jaime's.  We hadn't been there for a long while since moving to Gilbert... what a disapointment!!!

Our server was not very nice to say the least.

Morgan accidentallly spilled her drink while playing with Dom (bloody knuckles, don't ask!).  The server handed her some napkins and left... didn't bother to get anyone to clean the HUGE puddle on the floor!  Then at the end of the meal charged us for the spilled drink!  ugh...

Their margaritas sucked ass... I mean seriously, they were bitter and disgusting, I didnt even drink mine.  Mind you, we did have the best Margaritas ever the night before... but these were just gross!

The food was bland and luke warm... I had the mahi mahi taco, they all had a combo plate and weren't impressed... I just really hate when you think you're gonna take a guest somewhere nice and it turns out to be shitty.  Pisses me off.

I'm never going to Juan Jaime's again.  Theysuck.com"}
{"text":"So good news they are open in Christmas eve. Bad news is guess is that they are open. 

Planned on going to Espos but they were closed. 

Ended up here. It's not terrible but let's be honest it's absolutely nothing to reccomend. 

Ordered margaritas...tasted like they were a mix. For good lords sake it's a Mexican place. Do those right. 
And they are little.

Also ordered the three amigos. Salsa. Guacamole and queso. The only thing I'd eat again is the queso. Delicious! We doctored the quac with the salsa and made it edible. It's the stuff they buy predone. 

Refried beans tasted canned. 

Ordered the burrito enchilada style with chicken. Mixed the red and green sauce on top. And cheese sauce on side. 

All sauces mixed is a good flavor. Chicken was chewy. 

Rice was bland. 

Had to ask for waters. 

Idk I wouldn't go again, my boyfriend said he would. But he had a little green today.  Not for me. 

Service was ....there."}
{"text":"Had happy hour with a friend at Juan's tonight after a long day. We have been here many times before, however our waiter Zach made our experience more fun than we anticipated.  He suggested an appetizer to share that was perfect and our service was the best ever! I highly recommend Juan's and don't forget to ask for Zach!"}
{"text":"I was in here for lunch the other day.  The first thing I noticed when I sat at the bar was that there wasn't a bartender.  Needless to say, that made for really slow service over the course of my meal.

The food itself was pretty decent.  I had the steak platter which came with rice, beans and tortillas.  I liked the seasoning on the steak and felt that it was a good amount of food for the price.

Would I come back again?  Maybe. JJ's just didn't really wow me."}
{"text":"I would rather take my business to baja fresh.   Margaritas are weak and overpriced, why would u top them off with soda water...took one sip and sent it back...they didn't even take it off my tab. ..come on. ..charging for chips and salsa.....tried the burritos and tacos...both bland and small portions. Been there four times and everytime i regret wasting my money."}
{"text":"The Queso is very nice.  Happy Hour drinks very nice.  The Kahlúa brownie and ice cream be ready for a lot of Kahlúa but very good"}
{"text":"They now have a gluten free menu. The owner moved quickly to get that done for us people who are gluten free, and I'm very impressed with that."}
{"text":"They have happy hour 7 days a week which is really awesome when you want to grab some drinks on the weekend and sit out on the patio. The chips and three amigos which includes cheese, salsa, and guacamole are really good. The prices for the rest of the entrees are kind of up there with not a lot of food for your buck, but the flavor of the food is pretty OK. We would go back for happy hour,  just wish they'd include some apps on happy hour as well."}
{"text":"I have never given a restaurant a 1 star rating. But for the life of me, I couldn't understand how this establishment was receiving 4 stars with 129 reviews. I mean, the ratings were the only reason I decided to give it a go after all! 

Carrying on, if there's one thing that gets to me, it's really bad Mexican food. Now, I understand this place in no way advertised that it was down-home cooking, or anywhere near authentic Mexican cuisine, but for what it advertised on its menu (enchiladas, tacos, tostadas, burritos and the like), I expected at least a Tex-Mex kinda meal. 

Boy was I wrong. It was just horrible. They had removed every aspect of what makes Mexican food Mexican food, and replaced it with what tasted like something you got at a gas station in the middle of no where. The \"creamy green\" sauce they serve on their burritos and enchiladas (not sure if they serve it on anything else) was hard to swallow with a straight face. It tasted like Campbell's canned cream of mushroom soup. Their beans and rice, SO incredibly tasteless and somewhat undercooked. And their house salsa I'm pretty dern sure was that disgusting Pace Picante tomato paste you get out of a jar sold at your local supermarket. 

I wondered if the waitress knew how horrible the food was...I felt badly lying to her and saying everything was okay when she came around to check on us. Because it most definitely was NOT. But complaining to her about it was not going to fix the bigger problem at hand, which was the food there is simply atrocious. 

Moving forward, I will be a bit more hesitant relying on reviews when picking new places to dine at. I have a feeling this place's 5 star ratings aren't all that genuine... Be weary fellow my fellow Yelpers. Be weary."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try this place again. Had a great time and much better service from the bartender, Brendon!"}
{"text":"Have to say that the fact that the owners of Juan Jaime's follow Yelp and care enough about their service and customer satisfaction to contact someone who has had a negative experience made me up my rating to 5 stars.  Turns out the credit card discrepancy issue was indeed my fault.  My sincerest apologies to Mr. James and the Yelpers who may have read my update and gotten any kind of negative opinion about Juan Jaime's."}
{"text":"Ordered tacos here. Chips were excellent as well as the tacos. They have a salsa bar with a lot of different salsas. Waitress could have been a bit more friendly considering it was the middle of the afternoon and nobody was in there."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go for the great staff, environment and food. Usually get the carnitas but had a burrito last time and it's basiy heaven in your mouth. So so so good."}
{"text":"The BF and I LOVE this place!  Their Margaritas are great...and potent.  We've never actually ordered the chips and salsa, but they always bring us some anyway.  Their salsas are good....but not great.  I love that you choose what filling you want in whatever menu item you pick.  Another great spot for us vegetarians.  We've only been there for lunch, but I'd like to give their happy hour a try!  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is not good! The special cheese has to be the Mexican blend kraft cheese from the store. I can make a better taco salad at home. The price is cheap which was nice and the waitress was very sweet. But the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE MEXICAN FOOD!!!  People who think this is good Mexican food make me laugh.  Very low quality food. Been here twice now and everything was just awful.  Finally learned my lesson. Never going back!  Go to The Mission in old town Scottsdale or the Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, then go here and tell me it's good!!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this spot!!!!! Excellent tacos, so fresh and kick-butt salsas. Oh and the extra thin fresh tortilla chips! So good!"}
{"text":"Wow, Ladena is fabulous as a server and made our experience wonderful.  Best happy hour today. ;)"}
{"text":"Taco Bell is better for dinner but this game lace has good margaritas. Food was poor and not a value at all. Great to have a margarita and watch a game but not for dinner"}
{"text":"I was not expecting the food to be so delicious! Some of the best street tacos that I have ever had! Amazing food, reasonable prices, friendly and crazy fast service! This place is a hidden gem. I have passed it a thousand times--so glad I stopped in!"}
{"text":"I ordered to-go from this restaurant. Placing the order over the phone was easy and it was ready within 10 minutes. I got a taco combo. The tacos were not bad. They had a nice marinade but a little fatty in some pieces. The rice I did not care for it tastes like it has pickles in it or something. So weird. The beans were good and had such an authentic flavor. Overall, not bad. I didn't love it, but it was good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm really into tequila.  Ok, really, really into tequila...Juan Jamie's has a diverse selection of tequila's (80 or so) and for me, this place is all about the happy hour special.  Two tacos and two pours of premium tequila (anything under $15/pour) all for $18.  Super cheap.  My receipt had something like a $20 discount off normal prices (even their normal prices are are on the lower end for what I was drinking).

In addition, the bartender was jovial and knowledgeable about the selections.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Great service! Happy hour was til 8?! I couldnt belive it. The margaritas were really good and the appitizer 3 dip plate is good. Was crowed a bit, but i went on a Friday. . Good happy hour place, with a great little patio that has a bar."}
{"text":"Came in and while the bartender saw us, he continued talking to 2 people at the bar that weren't ordering any drinks nor cashing out. When we finally got our drinks, they were very weak and watered down from the start. Save yourself the time and hassle and find another restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Good Mexican happy hour.  Food very mediocre, reminded me of microwave dinner, extremely salty and beans tasted like they where directly from the can (not even warmed).  However, they're happy hour is extremely reasonable, so due to limited mexican restaurants up north we'll be back."}
{"text":"First and last time coming here. Food was bland absolutely no taste! Rice and beans were trash! This is the definition of white washed Mexican food."}
{"text":"**PLEASE NOTE**

I have received a formal apology from Juan Jaime Himself in regards to my bad experience. I think that was the right thing to do, he is looking out for his business and cares what his customers think. I also appreciate his offer to come back and try again at his expense.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although I cant change my first experience Juan has gone above and beyond to make me a happy customer, that's gotta count for something. +1 star
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, where should I start!

*Note to self, if  a place is empty at lunch time does it mean only drunks eat here at night?

That would be a pretty good guess!

My daughter and I were running errands all day and saw this place on our way home and decided to stop.

We ordered a couple sodas, some chips and salsa, which by the way they charge you for, even though they serve chips with your entree and have an open salsa bar??? Salsa was OK but the chips were stale and had been sitting in their own grease too long.

I got the 2 tacos, one carnitas and one mahi mahi.(see pics)
Greasy and Bland with Mushy Meat and just plain not good! Although I could see where someone full of tequila might think these were the best things they ever tasted, if that even counts, I Think not!

My daughter ordered the small burrito, which we thought was just a smaller version of the regular burrito. She asked for just beans and steak inside. 
Well no need to waste a flash on that one, it arrived just as plain and boring as the tacos and if there was ANY steak in that burrito it must have been pre-chewed.....cause I've never seen any steak like that before and been charged and extra $2.50 for it, 
where's the Beef Juan?

What a Total waste of money!

I agree with Eugene.T

I No Likey!!!"}
{"text":"Fine place to have a great value and tasty taco meal. Tons of different tequilas. Good salsa bar with a spicy green salsa. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I wish I could leave less than one star. My husband and I came in for dinner with a few friends, ended up chatting with the table next to us. My husband ended up questioning the man next to us about a pyramid scheme company he was trying to sell. The man grabbed my husband out of his chair and tried to assault him and pulled him outside and jumped in our uber trying to fight him. We both got kicked out when the other man was obviously in the wrong and there were witnesses to prove it. The managers and staff did nothing to correct the situation and we were all kicked out. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time just a few days ago, and I've been back already for the 2nd time just 2 days ago :)

After a work event, I came here with some friends. I didn't know what to expect aside from a hole-in-the-wall bar place lol. Literally wasn't that at all.

I realized that its right smack down in the middle of Chandler. Its in a perfect little hidden location next to a bunch of good restaurants. Service was great. The place wasn't packed at all, which was a huge plus. It was laid back.

Our server (both times) was very nice. He and she came back to the table several times every 10 minutes it seemed to make sure we were good. Margaritas were 10/10. They were good, and they actually use tequila in them here. By the way its literally $4 margaritas on happy hour, which is 4pm-8pm daily I believe. I think they are $5 off of happy hour, but they are delicious and are the main reason why I'm coming back.

It wasn't until the 2nd visit that I realized the tacos were amazing. They had alot of different meat choices, but I opted in for steak. It was delicious and filling! The tacos were good, and were not just little street tacos. The trio is the way to go if you are hungry FYI.

Restaurant cleanliness 5/5
Service 5/5
Price 5/5
Value 5/5

I don't leave many 5 star reviews, but I intend to keep it this way with many more visits. LIterally my new favorite place to go now."}
{"text":"My family and I dine here at least every weekend. Great food for cheap. Service is awesome but sometimes can be slow. The cheese enchiladas with creamy green sauce is amazing. So are the chips and salsa. We're in love with this place! Yum!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great food (I had tacos, hubby had burrito with red sauce), great sangria, great service and very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is a pretty mixed bag as I suppose you could expect from a joint that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, hip tequila bar or family friendly Mexican restaurant. Based on our visit, I think they might be doing a tad bit better as a tequila bar, though there are some food highlights. When we entered one of the servers just told us to sit anywhere we wanted; I'm never crazy about that approach, but once we were seated service was excellent. We ordered a couple of margaritas to go with our meal and they were seriously fantastic; maybe the best we've ever had. I can't say the same about the meal we ordered with them. My wife wasn't super hungry, so she ordered tortilla soup and chips and guacamole. They also brought salsa with the chips. All of these were pretty good. I ordered a shrimp burrito, and it was okay overall. I will say that I was really happy with the shrimp, and the amount that they put in the burrito. Unfortunately there was no sauce in or on the burrito and the tortilla was really dry, like it was a day or two old. I ended up pouring a whole cup of salsa over the top along with the side of sour cream that they served alongside. I suppose that if we're in the neighborhood, and want a great margarita, we would swing in here again."}
{"text":"Maybe they have good drinks. Didn't have one.

The food is a definite pass. Very cheap ingredients.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"This is honestly the hardest review I've written for several reasons. The way the manager treated me first makes me super sad, and the way another family was treated as superior to my group (ostensibly because of the way they looked) is something I've never experienced before. 

This place is called Juan Jaimes TEQUILA AND TACOS. Now I don't know about you, but to me that screams \"hey come on in, have a margarita, laugh with your friends, take a shot of tequila!\" Apparently it actually means \"we cater to white heteronormative Eddie Bauer families.\" It all started seemingly well, we came in (four of us - all women, 2 POC, 1 gender non conforming) ordered entrees and drinks. We were there to exchange Christmas presents, drink tequila and have fun. Unfortunately, for the aforementioned family sitting next to us, that meant we were being \"too loud.\" They told us we should \"go to a bar\" (is that not where the f we were)? They then proceeded to complain to the manager - instead of her telling us to maybe keep it down, she asked us to leave. I honestly had no idea we were being that loud. I thought I was having a fun night with my girlfriends - that was apparently not the case.

The manager refused her name. But let me tell ya, we had money to spend, and instead of spending it there, we were rudely forced to patronize elsewhere. Now I won't speculate why this manager thought it was OK to treat a different table preferentially, but I sure can wonder. 

Juan Jaimes - why you driving away people with excess income to spend? Seems counterintuitive to me, but maybe that's north Scottsdale to me."}
{"text":"Martin, Aubrey and Brendan are awesome. Thank you! Best neighborhood bar! I'm always so happy when I come here. The staff is helpful and friendly. Thank you for making my week better :)"}
{"text":"Lunch was good.  Service was good.  Prices are good.  I would return again when in the area and I recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were coming back from Tucson and we were feeling some Mexican food. Being non- familiar with the area, I went with this spot because of so many comments of their \"happy hour\". I really don't know how this spot is... 4 stars, gotta admit that yelp failed me this time :(

Atmosphere: nice and modern, felt kind of like Buffalo Wild Wings with the bar and TVs... Maybe it's because of the name, I was expecting a more authentic environment. The waitress was fairly attentive and prompt with our water and orders

Food:
+self-serve salsa bar woo hoo: most of the sauces were decent, not really spicy for my standards
+HH blended margarita was pretty good, it was $4 or $5 and a little bit of alchy in it
+the warm queso dipping for chips was pretty good!

- so not impressed with everything else...
- dry rice with dry enchiladas and tasteless refried beans
- the \"salad\" in my bf's combo was the saddest little salad portion I've even seen...
-overpriced for the quality of food we got

I will not come back here for the food. BUT if BWW is so too crowded and you want a nice modern restaurant with a full bar and ooooookay non-authentic Mexican to watch some sporting events, this might be the place for you!"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite place in Chandler. The margaritas are phenomenal and about 4$ To boot! Fresh made sour mix and plenty of tequila. There is nothing I hate more than a super sweet margerita with little tequila and cheap premade mix. Not these ones! Delicious! Recipe for the best experience ? Pair about 4 margeritas with 2 shrimp tacos and complimentary chips and salsa. You'll smack yo mama ! Awesome bartenders , great atmosphere paired with the delicious margaritas and shrimp tacos gets 5 stars from me BOOM!"}
{"text":"I would have rather spent my money at Chipotle, enough said.   The enchiladas had a very funny, part sour, part plasticky almost bitter taste to it.  I was with my boyfriend's mom and she commented that not every place makes it like you're used to, so that was my cue to shut up and just suffer and eat it.  

Don't waste your money on worse than microwave food!"}
{"text":"Went in late on Saturday night and had the best service I've had in a while! The food was delicious and pricing was great! Plus they have awesome hours because around 12am every other place closes their kitchen. Will be returning and everyone needs to try this place!"}
{"text":"This is a new fav happy hour place for us, we've already been here twice this week. It's pretty close to our house, great happy hour and great service, both times we've been there, our servers were really cool. Oh, and the food is pretty good too, especially for being so inexpensive. 

Can't beat $2.50 margaritas, they aren't the biggest margaritas, but...$2.50, I'm not going to complain. I had a steak taco last night, it was pretty dang good, and they have a salsa bar. My fiance loved his burrito.

There is also a nice little patio."}
{"text":"Great Margarita, 2 drinks enough for me. Great chips and guac, however, the guac was a bit too expensive. If you have a few people it is worth it though since the refill is only $0.95. I got the Salad and my boyfriends the veggie taco's. A bit bland with no taste but in general pretty good and healthy."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming... I used to really like Juan Jamie's, but now that I've experienced Canteen on Mill Ave I realize it's just not that good. The margaritas are pretty weak, the chips and salsa or chips and whatever you might order are grossly overpriced and the tacos are just not all that flavorful... totally \"meh\" in every way."}
{"text":"Best service in town, hands down!  The waiter got to us as soon as we sat down outside and his timing was perfect and non intrusive during our whole meal.  The menu is pretty simple, but it has the classic taco or burrito that you can customize.  You have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but honestly it was one of my favorite salsas I've ever had.  It kind of reminded me of Macayo's, but a tad spicier... it was very flavorful, which I love."}
{"text":"We've been there twice. Both times I've walked away unimpressed. The carnitas in the burritos are tasty, so is the chicken that comes in the burritos. However the overall experience is unremarkable. There's a salsa bar with several different types of bland salsa. The service, while really polite and warm is very slow. They have good servers there, just not enough of them. I kept noticing both times how my server was working just about every table I could see. 
As for the cost, dinner for 2 plus tip, was about $30. I can get the same amount of food with meat every bit as tasty at Chipotle for $14. Considering the premium paid over that at Juan Jamie's, especially adding in slow service I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I typically go here for a quick bite of Mexican food with friends or just to get a drink. I like to order out due to the countless times I have had bad experience with one guy behind the bar. He acts like he has a hang over and he couldn't get someone to cover his shift every time I go in. LOL Decent food but small portions. I want bigger burros!"}
{"text":"Nice place. I ate at the bar. Good attentive and friendly service. Chips and salsa were so-so. Salsa was almost sweet. Got the carnitas burrito enchilada style with red sauce. Tasty. Ample fillings in the burrito and the red sauce made up for the salsa in terms of heat. 

Not a tequila drinker, but looking at the bar they have plenty of selection on that front. Could have had a few more bourbons, but hey... what did I expect. 

Overall, a nice place to eat, drink, and enjoy an evening."}
{"text":"This is a not so good restaurant in a good location with good prices. The prices and location keep me coming back, but the service is hit or miss and the food tastes like it's all from a can or package at the grocery store next door. Do not and I repeat do not get the mahi mahi. I made the mistake the first time I went there and it tastes like imitation crab meat. I now stick to bean burritos which are fine for a quick bite and I enjoy the tequila there. However our waiter today was especially bad. He was weird and gave me an attitude that I didn't want meat on my burrito and explained he still had to charge me the same either way which obviously I was ok with. He acted like no one had ever ordered tequila before and asked me if I was sure I didn't mean I wanted a margarita. He took forever to bring the items and then when he took my credit card he handed it to someone else after he rang it and I had to yell at him to give me my card. Anyway in summary I will go back just for the convenience unless I see that waiter and then I won't."}
{"text":"Had Kaitlyn and she made our first experience amazing. She filled out chips up before we even ran out and kept the margaritas coming. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not quite sure why this has a 4 star rating. Everything was average. Not bad, just average. I've been to many taquerias around the country - esp in California - that are infinitely better. 

That said, a shout out to our server - with a Patriots jersey - who was excellent."}
{"text":"Very chill atmosphere food is excellent drinks are fairly cheap wide variety of cocktails good service located in a great part of town staff is very friendly I definitely recommend coming here on a weekend."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place near a work location that I visit often so I took a trip there this weekend and happened upon Juan's.

From the outside it looked like an uppity Mexican food restaurant.  Inside the decor looked unfinished.  It lacked structure to the different areas.  Not a big deal, just something that stood out immediately.

We ordered a beer and a margarita.  The margarita had good flavor, but one flavor seemed missing - tequila.  That was fine, I wasn't interested in getting buzzed.  The flavor was good.

We ordered a mix, which gave us the opportunity to basically taste everything on their menu.  One thing stood out - the lettuce on most of the items tasted absolutely terrible.  Literally the worst iceburg lettuce that I can recall having at a restaurant in recent years.  It really altered what I am sure was normally a better product, but it covered the tacos and tostadas making them poor tasting.  The enchilada was very mediocre, or worse.  I say this because I am a mediocre cook and I make a basic cheese enchilada much better than this.

Nothing stood out as quality.  Good Mexican food is easy to find in the metro area, I'd pass this place by.

Once again, I experienced something that owners/managers need to pay attention to if they desire my business - the wait staff cannot come to the table mid-meal and interrupt a vibrant active conversation to ask if everything is alright.  It is very easy to tell if something is not alright.  Pay attention to your customers.  When something is not alright, people look around for a staff member.  Super big pet peeve when it interrupts eating or conversation."}
{"text":"Second tripwas better than the first.  Taco's are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Overall, a very nice experience.  The food is very reasonable and pretty decent.  The salsas are meh, nothing to write home about.  The service is pretty good and they have a lengthy happy hour during the week.  The music is a little bit loud at times, but seating is not a problem and there is a nice patio area."}
{"text":"With an almost two year old we tend to avoid eating out. We ventured to Juan Jaimie's one evening for an early dinner. We were immediately greeted and welcomed with our kiddo on tow. I couldn't believe how friendly everyone was. Our food was served quickly which is always a plus with a toddler. I had the grilled chicken salad and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"We went there a while ago, when they just opened up, so this might be a little dated, but ...

It was not good. SLOOOOOOW service, boring food. Maybe booze is good there but we did not have any for lunch. 

All in all, i felt kind of bad that i dragged my guys there.

\"I no like\"

{"text":"We stopped here for lunch the other day, in the mood for something a little spicy (and cheap). I ordered the grilled steak tacos and boyfriend got the carnitas. I don't normally love pork, but we each traded one of our tacos and both kinds were delicious :] The salsa bar IS a little limited, but there were two that I loveddd so I didn't really need more options. Our total bill for chips and salsa (refills included), 4 tacos with rice and beans was $15.00...sold!!! Food was great, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant with my wife, daughter and her boyfriend. It's in a convenient location from my daughter's house.
The place was pretty busy and our server was average. She asked if we wanted chips, so my thought was that we were going to get charged.
You select the type of dish you want and then the protein. I had the Burrito Carnitas, $8. It wasn't that great, pretty dry and needed some sauce of any type to keep it moist. The flour tortilla was somewhat dry because it would crack when you cut into it, so it wasn't fresh.
Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and wanted something better than fast food. 

Service was fast and efficient. The food was good, but not extraordinary, hence the 4 (instead of 5) stars."}
{"text":"My company just moved to a new office and this place is really close so because I'm unfamiliar with the area I decided to give it a try.  At first glance it seems okay and I like that they have a salsa bar but that's where it ends.  Being someone that doesnt eat meat I was basically left with cheese enchiladas or the vegetarian burrito, so not feeling like eating a half pound of cheese I ordered the burrito.  After waititng about 15 minutes the waitress and some guy from the kitchen come back to inform me that the rice in the burrito is cooked in a chicken stock so they wanted to know if it should be included.  Okay, so thanks for letting me know that I guess, but now my burrito is going to consist of some black beans and bell peppers...Here's an idea, dont call it a vegetarian burrito if one of the main ingredients in it is cooked in chicken juice!  Or you could simply have some non-chicken stock rice on hand for this exact situation...just sayin'.  On top of that they gave my co-worker black beans when she ordered refried and it seriously took 35 minutes for them to whip up and a burrito and an enchilada.  We alsomost had to just get it to go.....needless to say I will be exploring other lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"Tacos are awesome. I drank one of the best margaritas ever. Clean place. My wife loved the shrimp tacos. Salsa bar decent. But the outside seating is awesome as well. Great place I will recommend and return."}
{"text":"The name honestly says it all, it's about the TACOS AND THE TEQUILA! If you are looking for a place to go with the best happy hour margaritas, you've come to the right place! The margs are a steal, not to mention they are made with fresh ingredients and pretty strong too !!  That's a rare combo to find, so while you are filling up on said margaritas, you eat some chips and order a hard shell taco with beans and rice and BAM your night is a win win.

For the people who bashed on this place pretty hard, don't let their reviews scare you into passing up this place!! If you plan to come to JJ's (abbreviated because this place is near and dear to my heart) to get some fancy, elaborate Mexican food with tons of options of the menu, you will be disappointed. BUT ! if you come to JJ's to watch a game or two, listen to some interesting music choices, have some drinks with your friends, meet some interesting characters and then eat a taco, you won't be disappointed in the slightest  !!!"}
{"text":"The salsa bar alone is a reason to come visit Juan Jaime's! I also love the queso dip and the shrimp tacos. House margaritas with all types of fruit flavors or liquor add ins are fun to try as well. Usually low key and a fun place to hangout and relax. The bar is cool too, there is a fish inside a bottle that is pretty entertaining to watch while you take shots."}
{"text":"Awesome Mahi and shrimp tacos.  Pulled pork was great also.  The steak tacos are on the dry side and needed a trip to the salsa bar for some more flavor!  They have a kid menu for the little ones too.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by my Nurse manager & finally decided to try. I was going to Espos for my cheese enchiladas but NOW this will be my go to spot. Awesome & attentive customer service & food came out quickly. Presentation was absolutely beautiful! Packaging was also secure for my ride home.
Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"To me 5 stars are for when the service, atmosphere, food and drinks all add up to be a great experience.

Well the service was top notch....our waitress was wonderfully friendly, helpful and happy.

The atmosphere is clean and simple but that is what adds to the charm, especially in the afternoon.....when the sun comes filtering through during happy hour it really is a magical spot....one of the many reasons I love the desert.

The food was very tasty...I tried the grilled chicken tacos and my husband tried the ground beef tacos....both very good.

An ADDED BONUS to this place is definitely the extra station they have set up for you to choose your condiments. What is an even BIGGER bonus is that you are free to take home any ones you particularly like. BUT WAIT....what gets even better is that is is all prepared on the premises....and I must say delicious....there is always a huge taste difference between \"previously prepared\" and \"home made\". 

Another added bonus I must point out is their Margaritas ..... I was hesitant to order one (even though they were only $3 during happy hour) ... because I can't handle sugary drinks....the waitress assured us these would not be sweet as they use NO pre mixers...YAY....she was right ....these Margaritas tasted real! Equal levels of sour to sweet.

So service, atmosphere, food and drinks were all wonderful....hence the five stars."}
{"text":"Like the tacos and tostadas. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the lack of consistency with the food. You never know just how greasy the beef will be... sometimes it's perfect and sometimes there is grease everywhere. 

The salsa bar is a nice touch and the staff is usually great."}
{"text":"I went there thinking it would have deep fried tacos. I was very disappointed in the tacos. The shell's were fired but the was just put in the shell."}
{"text":"Good food and really great deals on drinks. Come to happy hour and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This our go to Mexican restaurant. Great people. Great food. If you want a nice quiet dinner this the place to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with the hubby after shopping at the mall all afternoon. We were both hungry but just wanted a quick bite and didn't want to deal with the mediocre chains around Chandler mall that are always so packed on weekend evenings. Didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had Happy Hour going on, even though it was the weekend. 

We ordered the trio of dips to start. The queso and salsa were both good though too thin IMHO. The guacamole was nice and thick - I am not a fan of the stuff but my husband said it was like pure avocado with just seasonings added (which he liked). Then he ordered some tortilla soup and I got a shrimp tostada then we also shared a combo plate. Overall, I would say this is really not authentic Mexican food at all but still pretty tasty. 

I would have just given it three stars but I added one more because they have my all-time favorite drink, the Michelada. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a beer mixed with tomato juice or clamato and you add lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and other misc spices. I make mine at home with Corona Light and Mister T's Bloody Mary mix. Of course it is better when done by a professional, but at most places when I ask for it they don't know what it is, even at Mexican restaurants. Then when I explain it they stare at me like I'm crazy. It may sound weird if you've never had one but is is the most delicious, refreshing drink ever. They made it perfectly at Juan Jaime's and served it in a chilled glass with sweet chilli powder on the rim. It was great! I will come back to this place again just for that drink. I was also very impressed with the tequila menu, it took up the whole page! 

Overall, the food at this place is similar to Rubios or Chipotle but the atmosphere is way cooler. There were no kids running around, and it had a great bar. It seems like the perfect happy hour place. I really liked the patio but I just wish it didn't face the street. The location in Scottsdale looks like it is bigger and not in a strip mall. But in Chandler we have to take what we can get I guess."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new spot but was mostly underwhelmed.  The food was just ok, and more in line with a quick service Mexican restaurant like Baja Fresh or Wahoos in California.  Prices were definitely in line with quality so maybe worth checking out if you want something quick to fill the hole in your stomach."}
{"text":"I tried going here for taco tuesday a couple months ago, when my friend and I sat at the bar the bartender had little interest in helping us once he learned we just wanted food. Keep in mind there were maybe 5 people in the whole place. We ended up leaving. This past Tuesday 3/13, another friend talked me into going there as it was close. There was no room at the bar so we sat outside. We ordered two skinny margaritas with a top shelf tequila, we they came out my friend had hers served in a point glass and mine in a pilsner glass.  Bartender saw us make faces and came out and said we only have two sizes in glasses, it's all I have and walked back inside. Next we order, I just got a single taco as I do judge a TACO place on how they make their carne asada. WOW was I disappointed, no clue what type of meat they use but I am guessing this is what canned dog food tastes like. The texture was wrong and taste was horrible. Knew something was wrong based on how quick the food came out. I will never return to this place. Oh the margaritas was all mix.."}
{"text":"**UPDATE** Totally earned more points in my book that the owner cares to read the reviews. The menu said they charged for chips. Its good to know that they don't. I will definitely be coming back. Overall it was a nice place.  
_______________________________________________________
This was the first time I had ever been. I found it online and decided to go to happy hour. The atmoshere was lively with a variety of people eating, drinking, and talking. The food was great. I got two tacos (steak and carnitas) which was delicious. The beans and rice are ok, I have had better. You also can't beat the cheap and strong happy hour margaritas. I was feeling good after two. The salsa bar was a nice touch. 

Now for what I would suggest. I think its crazy that you have to pay for chips but the salsa bar is free??  Also, please get more waiters. Our waiter has several tables to wait on and it took forever.  Poor guy was running all night. While the table next to us had their own personal waitress. 

This is a nice place for happy hour with freinds. Just be prepared for a long dinner waiting on the server."}
{"text":"The review is for food and how I always get tricked into ordering food here after indulging in their delicious margaritas. Do not get suckered into ordering a meal! I saw photos of the taco salad and it looked yummy I love taco salads! Goodness sakes I don't know what this was... it was a cold tortilla with lettuce, cheese, black olives, wet bell pepper and grilled steak. They no longer make fajitas and no longer deep fry the tortilla shell. WOMP WOMP. El pollo loco drive thru offers more, seriously. Thumbs down at my favorite tequila spot!"}
{"text":"One ordering tip: carnitas tacos. Period. End of story. Love all the food and the salsa bar rocks. Margaritas are usually stout and priced well especially on happy hour."}
{"text":"usually, just thinking about drinking a margarita gives me heartburn. that canned sweet-n-sour mix or whatever sucks big time. im glad to report, the margaritas here are the shiznit! they come in a really small glass but are super tasty, strong and cheap (during happy hour).

the salsa bar is good but all of their salsas are pretty hot. usually the salsa verde is not hot only tasty, but here it is one of the hottest ones. i figured out the radishes help distill the heat afterwords, though, fyi.

the mahi tacos are rather bland, but the others are good. i also like how they have melted cheese in between the two tortillas. gf said the shrimp tacos are delish - ill have to try those next time."}
{"text":"Known John James for years(Juan Jamie).  Nice to see after all these years he is still going strong.   Good and service are always top notch."}
{"text":"Went here after I got off work last Friday night and had the best shot ever!
Everyone should go and try a \"Snowball!\" it looks like a drink with the ice in it, but your supposed to chug it down like you would a mind eraser.

Definetly gets you feeling good, you shouldnt need many more drinks after that for a good night, =]"}
{"text":"What a cool place. Our server Liz was so friendly and knowledgeable. She made our experience wonderful. Thanks for the recommendations today. 

Sopaillas were tasty and the cheese crisp was crunchy and really BIG! Our tostada was packed to overflowing with goodness. Margaritas by Brendon were delicious  

Fun, casual and friendly neighborhood place. Open till 2am."}
{"text":"This place is a great, fast, clean, affordable stop. The food is also delicious! Mini tacos FYW.. Drinks are good too and fresh juice squeezed into margaritas. This our 2nd time here. Don't skip it if you're in Grayhawk!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for reasonable portions. You probably won't be taking a doggy bag home. The salsa bar is fresh, and the service is speedy."}
{"text":"Cool salsa bar and good tacos are the staple.  My wife likes it as do our kids.  This restaurant really works for us.  We are usually seated right away, the waiters and waitresses are helpful and friendly and the food is consistently good.
Every now and then the bartender is a little slow, and I wish they had a better beer selection.  Other than that, this place is one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was excellent (John).   Suggest burrito enchiladas w chicken."}
{"text":"Place was really good.  
Went here cause someone recommended it to me.  Tacos were good.  I had the charizo and eggs and the carnitas both were great.  Carnitas wasn't too spicy wasn't too plain. Refried beans are amazing. Nachos were good.  Killed it quick.  Service was friendly but not as fast. Best Arnold Palmer I had to far though."}
{"text":"Good food, great price, pretty limited menu.  Loved the salsa bar and the tacos were fantastic"}
{"text":"They're quite on point at lunch for our first visit. First concern was visibly more guests than what one server might be able to handle. Check! Thuy was awesome! Coming from CA, food fell on the healthier side of typical Mexican food. Thinking that's what North Scottsdale is all about. Nothing was swimming in sauce. And flavor profile is spot on! Skinny Cadillac margarita was simply divine! Can't wait to come back. This has to be my first non-guilty food coma. Thanks Thuy! ;-O"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Usually come here with Tori B. as she is the only reason I venture out to Chandler. They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2.50 margs, $4 Tres Olives and $1 off beer and wine. The food is pretty basic (and honestly priced a tad high for what it is). They have fish, shrimp, steak, pork and veggies. You can have these served up in a taco, burrito or salad. Like I said pretty basic. What really sets this place apart is the owner and the service. Every time I come in he is super friendly and always asks us to try new things he is thinking of adding to the menu. One time it was a spicy jalapeño corn, and last time it was a honey chipotle vinaigrette.
The vinaigrette was awesome and he even gave me the recipe (no I will not share it).  If you're in Chandler and looking for a cheap happy hour in decent environment give Juan's a try. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm usually not the type to be so critical and complain. 

I am new to the area and Yelp has become my best friend when in search for new places to try. I was craving Mexican and landed on this place. The reviews overall looked good, so I thought I'd give it a try. When my date and I got there we walked in there were quite a few customers standing around the door looking like they were waiting to be helped. After about 5 minutes we were finally helped, mind you there were many open tables so they didn't seem to be super busy. After being sat down we both just asked for a water while looking over the \"drink menu\". They didn't really have a drink menu that I saw, just a list of tequilas. I wasn't aware what was on draft etc. It took longer than normal to get our beers. We then ordered chips and queso which also took longer than normal. I was unimpressed with the queso. It reminded me of Velveeta and a jar of salsa put in a cockpot, which is good. But not something I'm looking for a restaurant. The chips were also pretty greasy. I ordered the tacos with grilled Mahi Mahi. To me, the tacos were bland. It's hard to mess up refried beans and rice. Overall I just thought it lacked flavor and the service was not that great. I honestly don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I forget which Yelper commented on the refried beans but I want to confirm and tell you that you are absolutely right. There is a bean-god/goddess in the kitchen making these beans. I'm not a bean person but I couldn't stop eating them. Soooo good!

I got the margarita which was good and three different tacos. All which were tasty. Hubs got the chicken plate and let me tell ya, the chicken was so delicious and moist. I fell in love with that chicken breast.

I loved the salsa bar also because you could mix and match your salsas to make it a certain heat that fits your taste. 

Service was good. Very attentive and informative. I recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Love Juan Jamie's and Shane!! A great place to grab a drink or a quick bite. You can even get your order to-go if you would like. I highly recommend stopping by. Great service, super friendly staff and always a good time."}
{"text":"I've been to Juan Jaime's several times - both for lunch and happy hour. I like the atmosphere here - it's relaxed, has an upscale feel to it and they play good music. Later in the evening it can get fairly busy here and the noise level definitely increases. Of course, the tequila probably contributes towards that...

The food is good - nothing super fancy, but quick and simple. At lunch I usually go for the Tacos Trio (chicken), but I've also had their burritos and they are also good . They have a great salsa bar with a lot of options. The chips are okay - like someone else on here mentioned they can be greasy at times. I would say I come here more for the happy hour than I actually do for dinner.

The bartenders stay on top of everyone and they have a very nice selection of tequilas. Happy hour prices are competitive and the crowd that hangs out here is pretty social. 

The service here is excellent - never had a bad experience. I have to give a shout-out to Kaitlyn who took good care of us today during lunch. If every place had a server like her, life would be good.

Definitely worth a visit - especially if you are looking to decompress after a long day or want to meet up with friends for a drink or two at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Fairly good Mexican food; good salsa bar with a variety of tasty salsas; yummy guacamole and queso dip.  Popular hang out even late at night after all the other restaurants were closed; good service from the waitress too!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, drinks and food.  Tacos and tequila - just what I needed on a Sunday afternoon.  Happy hour is daily with great options.  The three taco plate allows a mix and match of chicken, steak or mahi mahi and all three were delicious.

Fast forward a year later -- still amazing.   I popped by last Friday and the tacos were still amazing.   The mahi mahi are my favorite.  The margarita was delicious -- one of the better margaritas I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! The grilled shrimp tacos on soft corn are amazing and the variety of frozen margaritas even better! They give complimentary chips and salsa + flavored chiclets gum (I know, odd)."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday.   The salsa bar was nice.  The taco salad was one of the worst I've had"}
{"text":"Really good food for a very fair price. Sit at the bar, better service. I haven't tried anything here I don't like but the ground beef burrito is the best. Margaritas are so so. Ice cold beer. Good happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my spot I come here almost three to four times a week! I love chicken tacos and tequila!! I yi yi yi yi!! I also live down the street which is convenient!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch.  Very cute clean restaurant. Fast friendly service and really good affordable food. We had the two taco plate with chicken shrimp and Maui Maui.
The shrimp was awesome. Husband liked  the fish and chicken as well. Lots of variety of salsas and nice warm chips.
We will certainly be back to try some other dishes. It's also very close to my work so might be a lunch takeout option for me as well"}
{"text":"Came in late on a Sunday night with mf girlfriend. The service was friendly and timely. However, the tacos were underwhelming. I trie the carnitas, carne asada, and pollo. They were each ok but somehwat bland for my taste, leaning on the less authentic, more americanized side of the taco spectrum. The salsas were adequate but nothing truly stood out flavor-wise. Overall, an ok option if its late at night and nothing else is available."}
{"text":"I don't \"Yelp\" much but this place deserves a good review! We strolled in a few weeks ago after shopping at Nordstrom Rack and enjoyed their happy hour, and then went back the next night for dinner. This is the one Mexican place my husband and I can go to and not feel sick afterwards. Their food is super fresh and the 3 servers we have had on the 3 different times we have visited have all been great -- attentive and welcoming. After living in Chandler for 2 years now, I'm just bummed I didn't find this place sooner!"}
{"text":"The Good: 
-prices aren't exorbitantly expensive. I found them to be moderately priced perhaps towards even the lower end.
- the refried beans are truly great tasting - if you come here definitely give them a try!
- since I had the steak tacos I can say the quality of the steak is competitive with similar restaurants

The Bad:
-came in on a Sunday seemed like one waitress was covering about 6 tables by herself, took us about 5 mins after we sat down to receive the menus so the service was somewhat on the slower side (not that I minded) but I had I been very thirsty it would have been another story.
-the tortilla chips seem more on the commercial side, as in you could find the same chips at a big box store on the shelf
- food presentation wasn't bad but wasn't anything special, the taste was alright however for the guacamoli 
- interior decor was lacking, no visible television from where we were sitting as they had a small one located toward the bar

The Ugly
- I'm not trying to be nitpicky but since I remember now, my steak tacos while I was eating felt like they were missing sauces so I had to supplement them with some guacamoli and salsa I got from my appetizer course (the three amigos) because they seemed dry despite the fact the steak was moist 

Verdict : will not come here again nor will I go out of my way to recommend the restaurant"}
{"text":"As usual, great food. Consistent, authentic Mexican, not catering to trends but just the real deal. Pleased to see GOOD craft beer coming in - thank you Juan Jaime's."}
{"text":"The prices were reasonable.  The food was good.  One person in our party liked the salsa bar with the nm red and hot green sauses.  Our server was excellent.  This is one of the few places that knows how to properly make a cheese crisp appetizer."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service and a place to watch World Cup games at lunch time during work hours. I had the three taco platter with shrimp,  pork,  and beef.  All were very good.  The salsa at the salsa bar was a nice addition."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, maybe even 3x a week, just because I live close, and I honestly I have yet to have a bad experience!! Zach (or zack, however you spell it) is the most attentive, helpful, and kind server ever! Maddie is amazing also!! I wish I could remember everyone else's name, because frankly, the staff here is really exceptional! No matter the time of day or who's serving, I'm always happy when I leave and excited to come back again!! Food and drinks are always great and the staff is the best!! Love this place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Amazing chips and salsa bar. I love their chicken or shrimp tacos. Everything is always consistently good."}
{"text":"Auburn is great, very attentive and friendly. I love this place, and it's my go-to for a quick, great tasting and incredibly inexpensive option for Mexican food. (Or any food for that matter. It's funny because for less than what it would cost to drive through some crappy fast food joint, stink up your car and clog your arteries you can instead eat here. 

I love how the food is always fresh, and the eventually remember your order once you become a regular like myself. Granted I only do water because I'm a tad healthier than most, it's still very reasonable cost wise to get beverages. 

One of the best things, aside from speed, taste, Etc is they are usually open when you want them to be. Couldn't be happier as usual. Have I mentioned the water tastes of angel tears?"}
{"text":"Bartender on Wednesday night total a$$. 3 times I had to ask what beer they have on tap after he gave me a menu that doesn't list what beer they have and then Gave me an attitude 
moron should be fired. I will never go there again and will bad mouth to everyone I know"}
{"text":"1st time here and not let down! Went for happy hour, runs until 8pm which is great. Food and service were very good. We Had skinny margaritas, grilled beef tacos and grilled beef tacos. Rice and refried beans were very good as well. Server, Liz, was very nice and food was delivered very quickly."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but good food and a neighborhood vibe. I enjoy sitting at the bar for HH where Brandon  the bartender knows all the locals. During HH I can get a two taco combo (carnitas are my fave here), chips, salsa, and two house margaritas for under $20! Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It's a Mexican bar and restaurant. What can go wrong?  In this case, nothing. 

I love the chicken taco salad and the fish tacos. Marteen is always quick and generous when pouring drinks.  Try one of his Margaritas.  You won't be disappointed!  The chips are made fresh and there is a great salsa bar to compliment your meal. Beware the chips are addicting. But that's part of the gig at a Mexican restaurant. 

This is a good place to enjoy the beautiful Arizona evenings on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food at fair prices. Excellent service. But unless your into a more mature singles scene don't go on Friday or Saturday nights."}
{"text":"OK. We were starving. My wife and my girlfriend had just gotten pedicures and I had been wasting time at the Home Depot while they were being pampered. I digress. We were starving so we all decided on Mexican. The Yelping began. We decided on Juan Jaime's base mainly on a good friend's recommendation and not the reviews. We were not disappointed! Two of us had the three taco lunch and one of us ordered sides. The three taco lunch consisted of fish, pork and shrimp along with rice and beans. The pork was outstanding! The fish and shrimp were solid. All three of us had the house Margaritas and they were simply delicious. Brandon was our excellent server. My wife wanted me to deduct a star from my rating because we had to pay for chips and salsa. The excellent service (and my two Margaritas) got the star back. We will return to Juan Jaime's!"}
{"text":"Juan's is my spot! Love the atmosphere, great food, drinks, and service. Very reasonable prices allow this to be a neighborhood bar and restaurant to frequent. Love the shrimp tacos and the enchaladas."}
{"text":"THE best meals and drinks. Super low key and casual. Literally the highest quality food there is with the cheapest prices. Fast service and not annoying at all. Seat yourself. Totally chill and never packed. If this were located somewhere else it would be slammed with a line out the door. Unlike those packed places that are hype and crowded all the time, the location it's at keeps it calm. So good it's shocking every time and I go here weekly. Must go. 10/10 service 10/10 food 10/10 drinks, 10/10 environment. Fantastic restaurant. Must try the Michelada, and the 3 enchiladas one with chorizo, one with shrimp, and one with cheese, with all three sauces. Straight fire. So good."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!

Food.  Boring.  Drinks. Average.  Bartenders, chime in when when drunk patrons are making things uncomfortable.  Wish this place was worth while, but the food has no creativity and the bartenders make a stale maragarita at best.  Maybe this place is better for lunch, but after dinner, they may have sleeping bags for nap time."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, variety of salsas and their flavor was also good.  Tacos were tasty. Not a fancy place, but nice and clean."}
{"text":"Like I said omg we only keep coming back for the food ,because the service here is HORRIBLE!!! 
Until today ,,we had Liz and she is the BEST SERVER WE HAVE HAD IN 2 YEARS OF COMING HERE !!! 
Odd enough the steak was VERY DRY today too...
But hey service was FINALLY GREAT !! THANKS LIZ ;)"}
{"text":"I like the service my drinks came really fast. The waiter/bartender was really cool and friendly, he called me \"boss\"; I love it when waiters call me \"boss\", anyways. I wasn't a big fan of the dish wear, I don't like being served good food in a plastic tray but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Worst service possible. I sat at the bar at 12:32 with some friends who dais or took ten minutes to get a beer. I left at 12:55 with NO service at all. However, they did keep running by only saying \"1 second\". All I needed was 1 beer for which I had cash. My friends I met up with couldn't even get cashed out, even though they tried. I tried to tell them they should just leave since they made several attempts to pay. We eventually had to pool the cash we had so we could just leave. One server was rude enough to tell us that we couldn't be helped because they were understaffed. No apologies or attempts to help. Sounds like poor management but also poor service. I should be able to rate zero stars since there was zero service."}
{"text":"We love the yummy LaPinta Margs along with the friendly staff! Our \"favorite\" place to go for tasty and healthy burrito bowls! I get the pork and shrimp. Mmmm! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This little restaurant was quite a find.  It is somewhat hidden near a grocery store and other small businesses and restaurants.  Good food and great service.  Good margaritas as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place to hang out for drinks and pretty yummy food. The prices are  reasonable, especially their happy hour prices. My fiance is a big tequila fan so he was very happy with the large tequila menu. This place gets pretty packed sometimes so we always end up sitting outside because it's SO LOUD inside. That is my only real gripe about it. The food was pretty good, nothing amazing, but pretty yummy. It's a nice place to just hang out."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican cafe with a very limited, very good menu. The quality and portion size are an outstanding value. They have a salsa bar, a real bar, and an outdoor patio. I've heard the bar can get pretty packed late night."}
{"text":"They only get 2 stars because have good drinks and it's inexpensive. They're food is not so great. The only ones I see loving their food is the gringos."}
{"text":"My partner and I headed out for lunch and after his debacle of a pick last night it was my turn. Unfortunately my choice was closed so we wound up at Juan Jaime's as a second choice.

Overall it's a pretty decent place. I was a little annoyed that they charge extra for chips and salsa, but the other food prices seemed pretty reasonable. The service was a little \"off\" but that could be because they just opened. 

We both enjoyed the food, I had a burrito and my partner had Mahi Mahi. We'll be back to give them another try soon."}
{"text":"Great house salsa. Enchilada was great and taco was tasty. Fast service. Good tea. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Service is great and alcoholic menu is large and diverse. Food is a C so if you want authentically delicious Mexican food don't eat here. The salsa and queso dip tasted like it was from a can. The enchiladas were ok."}
{"text":"We visit Martin and Brennan - superb bartenders - weekly for happy hour.  Best house margaritas in town!  Complimentary chips and salsa are always the first thing served.. And you can add guacamole and queso if you want. 
The flexible menu allows you to choose the filling for burritos, tacos, enchiladas and salad. But the main attraction is the family feel... Where everyone knows you name."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I have had.  The black beans were awful.  The rice tasted like ketchup.  Had shrimp tacos which were just okay.  Our waiter was impatient and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him. The place has a nice vibe and might be good for happy hour but won't come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY want to give Juan Jaime's 4 Stars. They have an extended happy hour from 4-8PM (even on the weekends) which includes $4 house margaritas. Unfortunately, the food has been inconsistent our last few visits. I would stick to HH drinks, chips and salsa! If you do that, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We've been going to Juan Jaimes (Chandler and Scottsdale location) for happy hour since 2011. The food is always decent and reasonably priced when compared to the competition. We had a pretty bad experience this past Friday night, but John (aka Juan Jaime) reached out the next morning to remedy the situation. He apologized for the poor service we received, thanked us for our continued business and ensured that this wouldnt happen again. I was super impressed by his quick response and we will definitely be back to give JJ's another shot. Until then, ***3 Stars."}
{"text":"First of all, you get to seat yourself.  That's kind of nice being able to sit where you want to.  But when you think of having to seat yourself, you probably imagine a fast food restaurant.  This place is pretty classy and tastefully decorated.  Meals are cheap.  I ordered the cheese quesadilla appetizer as my main dish for $3.75 and it was humongous.  I was only able to eat half of it.  Happy hour specials are good too.  I got a margarita for $3.50.  Service was great and quick. The only down side to this place are the menu options.  There is not much to choose from.  However, it does seem like you can add and substitute items which creates a little more variety with the menu.  I would definitely come here again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of an American Mexican joint. Tacos and tequila. So I ordered - tacos and tequila:
1) ordered the 3 platter taco combo- chicken, steak and mahi mahi. 
2) house margarita x2
3) chips & salsa

The tacos: chicken was kinda dry and not really seasoned although didn't taste necessarily frozen. Who knows. The steak was mediocre and the magi was awful. Don't order it. 

The margarita: 2 house margaritas to make sure the first isn't a fluke. They're basic.  Nothing to rave about. A great place for a quick bite and drink if you're in the area. 3/5 stars is appropriate. Nothing you'll complain about, but nothing you're gonna remember. 

The chips and salsa: again, nothing amazing. Not bad"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Have tried almost everything on the food menu.  You can't go wrong it's all good but my favorites are the nachos, shrimp tacos and grilled steak platter.   If you like spicy - try the green salsa at the salsa bar.  The tequila selection is good and they have a few awesome organics.  The house margaritas are tasty and a very good deal."}
{"text":"So I tried this place based on previous reviews.  I ordered their burrito with rice and beans, normal size portions. They provide chips and salsa with several types of salsa available. The meal itself was OK, nothing over the top. 

The location is a strip shopping center, interesting décor inside with a full bar. Maybe the allure is the bar with full meals available. Not sure this is the place for me but give it a try."}
{"text":"They have a salsa bar which many selections as well as a great selection of tequilas. Their happy hour isn't bad, some good deals on house margaritas and Mexican beers. I always get the three taco plate with 1shrimp, 1carnitas and 1chicken-they are delish!!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times on a recent trip to Scottsdale.  Had great service and good food both trips.  I recommend the queso and chips but I was a little underwhelmed by the salsa.  Also, the margaritas were a little on the sweet side.  As a comparison, I absolutely loved the margaritas at Rehab Burger.  

Would I go back here again?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"So we came to this place and it's actually really good. Their salsa bar here is small but has amazing tasting salsa. We ordered the nacho Grande with no jalapeños and simple delicious. Very basic like most nachos but yet it wasn't. The for my dinner I got the tres taco plate with the fillers of grilled shrimp, grilled steak, and mahi mahi with refried beans and rice. Each taco by themselves were simple tasteful. But when you add the lime that they offer. It releases this excellent flavor for each one and made them taste better even though they were great in the beginning. The atmosphere is perfect, amazing music that plays and just awesome. We'll probably come here for more food and some possibly drinks :)"}
{"text":"$6 for 3 mini tacos. (Lunch special) Love it. Great service as well."}
{"text":"There is not really very many options of decent Mexican food up here in North Scottsdale.  When Pinata was here at this location, their food was excellent! Of course it changed owners, turned disgusting and shut down.  Sat empty for a while then we see signs that a new Mexican restaurant is moving in...Will the 3rd time be the charm? 

I THINK NOT!

You get 3 little tacos for $10 comes with beans and rice(both inedible)  We had chicken and carnitas tacos, and I got the chicken and beef tacos. We both got hard shell.  Taco bell's hard shell tacos are more satiating!  Are the meats they use pretty tasty? Yes!  But seriously? Their food comes in street sizes. It comes to you in plastic dishes.  It is run like a Baja Fresh fast food joint with restaurant prices. The only difference is that they serve alcohol and they actually take your order at the table.  That is, slowly take your order. The place wasn't busy, but our server had a very short attention span and was cohorting with the table next to us, and ignoring us completely.  
~AND~

YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR CHIPS AND SALSA???? WHATTTTT??????
This is to deter their BAR crowd to sit and eat chips and salsa all night and just drink the happy hour specials and get free chips/salsa? 
AND to top it all off, you have to go up to this baja fresh/rubios looking salsa bar and get your own.  But there are no self service chips here...YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THOSE! WTF
The salsa is just o-kay Chips-meh!

I can't wait 'til this closes down so another mexican place can take over...yet again...and maybe it will surpass this one."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour and their salsa bar has a ton of choices. Staff is usually friendly (everyone has an off day from time to time) and super responsive. It can get a little busy during happy hour, which makes it hard to find a table some times, but they do have a patio which is nice when it's not 120 degrees outside."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to JJ's since about 3 months after it opened, a little more than 3 years ago and we love it here.   They have great happy hour prices (no watered down margaritas for only $3) and they have the best salsa in town.  With two small children (3 and 1 1/2), this is a great place that we can come and experience a happy hour environment (responsibly, of course) with the children.  We always have great service and that make Juan Jaime's our favorite Friday night hang out."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us went to a mid-week HH. I have not been here in years!

PROS
Chips and salsa! They were not overly salty, other folks enjoyed the salsa bar
Queso was tasty and came with 1 free refill
HH on drinks, ~$5 Tecates
We didn't have to ask the Server to break the checks by couple


CONS
Order of beans came out incorrect, server fixed it
Entrees was just \"meeh\" we ordered taco platters and enchiladas
My enchilada was very...dainty, not a lot of green sauce and wasn't filled with much cheese

The \"A-OK\" rating is based mostly on the food, it's a chill place to get a quick bite and catch up with friends but will not be our \"go-to\" for future HH's"}
{"text":"Ervin was patient while I placed my order, as I wanted different taco fillings. Liked the grilled mahi-mahi. House margarita is refreshing. The salsa bar is very good."}
{"text":"We don't live in the area but when we are close we like to stop by.  (15 times?). They know how to make a quality margarita that is anything but weak.  Food is legit, fresh and tasty, and the salsas are fabulous too.  You can tell the owners/staff cares about what they are doing.  We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the prices are low!
That's all I can really say! The food is very fresh and it's all primarily under $10.
Decided to try this place thinking it would be a bust... But I was pleasantly surprised.
I am now eating here all the time.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you live in the area this is the night spot. I have been coming for years for Martin's Margherita. Great people work there and the food is always good. Try the platter with chicken or a steak borrito enchilada style. They also have the best tostadas."}
{"text":"Juan and Jaimes, what can I say? It's like an upscale dive Mexican restaurant - if that exists. Their menu is limited. The food is meh and the ambiance isn't much better, but yet, I still return. I will say, their house salsa is great and they do actually make it in house. I usually get the chicken breast plate and load the chicken with the house salsa which makes it so yummy. Once in a while I get chorizo tacos, but they seem to skimp on the chorizo so it's more egg than anything. The one thing they do different with their tacos here is they use two tortillas and have melted cheese in between them so it's like having a quesadilla/taco. This kitchen here is open late till like 1a everyday I believe, so if you're hungry and don't want typical fast food junk, give this place a shot."}
{"text":"This is a really great casual place, with a decent size patio and bar that opens up to the patio.  Its a fairly limited menu - mainly burritos and tacos - but they are great!  And very reasonably priced.  Our favorite is the enchilada style burrito, with red sauce.    

And they are dog friendly, so we'll often walk over with the pup.

They also have a great flavored vodka selection, in addition to lots of tequila choices."}
{"text":"I have to say that recently I went to this restaurant for a birthday celebration, we had an issue which I have to say that the manager and owner of this company has gone above and beyond for me and my family, he made the issue right and was ever so kind to listen to what was the problem was and immediately fix it. Thank you so much when I'm in the area i will definitely be back in to give it another try."}
{"text":"Really like this place... We have been going to this place for several years now and this place is always great. They always have the game on and the staff is always friendly and quick. The food is always good and the salsa bar is awesome... So are the prices as well. Mini chicken tacos and queso are always good."}
{"text":"I love Juan Jaime's.  The chips, salsa, rice, refried beans, bean burritos and tacos are incredible!

The service is also superb.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is a very solid four. Our service was exceptional. The salsa bar is great. It's hard not to give it five stars since it's so affordable, but the food won't wow you. When was the last time you would seriously give the food at a Mexican restaurant five stars? You can't go wrong at this place. The value in unbeatable for this area of North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is quite good!  The flavors of the taco/burrito fillings is wonderful.  I like that they have both lettuce AND cabbage at the salsa bar so you can fill your taco how you like.  The tortillas are some of the best I've tasted.  The salsa is hit and miss.  There's a nice selection, but sometimes they can be either bland or way too hot.  The guacamole is AWESOME.  

I've read some of the other reviews that say this place \"isn't real Mexican\".... uh, it's a heck of a lot closer to Mexican than most of the places in town.  Not sure what these other folks consider \"real\" Mexican.

My only complaint is that I have to pay for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Come here on the regular. Almost like a home away from home. Brent, Auburn, Martín, Brendan, kaitlyn and Jennifer are amongst the best when it comes to service and hospitality. They want you to walk away happy!
Don't come here with your snobsdale attitude or any where for that matter.

Oh and what places in grayhawk stay open until 2 every night? Juans Does

I'll be back tonight. 
Happy Cinco de Mayo
In regards Jose"}
{"text":"Love this place, great service, everyone that works there is so friendly. The chips, salsa bar and shrimp street tacos are my favorite, everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good service.  Came here as I'm waiting for my dog to get released from the vet. Cold beers relaxing atmosphere. Only second time would come again if I'm in the area for.some Mexican."}
{"text":"good food, decent size and price. only a 3 because i hold mexican food to high standards and there was no real stand out. Hand the enchilada style burrito, so a wet burrito also got a side extra rice and i polished it clean and could eat more. I would say give it a try but its not cheap enough to be a cheap eat but not so good that I need to go back."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a long time and the first thing I want to mention is the rice and beans. They are the closest to my moms flavor out of any restaurant. Nobody does it like mom of course but these guys are close. So why did they only get three stars from me you say? Because they're very expensive for the portion you get. Not the rice and beans but the lunch specials of two tacos with rice and beans. It's two mini tacos and boy are they small. The other complain is that they have a bad turn around and the new employees can never hang. The one female that's been there for a while is good though.
Yes food is good but portions are not IMO.

I don't recommend taking kids to this restaurant during lunch business hours. It gets packed and busy so the wait can be too much for any kid."}
{"text":"One of the very few Mexican food restaurants in the local area that seems to let you taste the tequila in the margarita!

PROS: read my intro. Also, the chips/salsa were decent

CONS: Ditch the specimen cup-sized container for the salsa, and bring a portion the patrons can enjoy

Been here once and haven't tried the food. They get 4-stars from me because they serve a good marg. Regrettably, too many local places seem to waive a cheap bottle of tequila over the ubiquitous ice cream machine-like contraption that holds the house margs, and pass off a Kool-Aid mix as a margarita.

Cheers!
RS"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Cant beat the $5 margaritas. The tacos are pretty decent and the service is average. Great spot for a happy hour with friends"}
{"text":"Cheapest place to drink in Chandler. Happy hour goes until 8pm! Such a deal! It is relaxed, with great  service, a large patio, and cheap eats. It is consistent. $20 can go a long way at Juans. I appreciate this place very much!"}
{"text":"Juan and Jamie's has average Mexican food at best, with cheap happy hour drinks and big portions. Happy hour is only for the drinks, but the food is pretty cheap to begin with the entrees all being under $10. We had some $4 house margaritas (both frozen and on the rocks) during happy hour. I wasn't a huge fan of the margaritas but my partner liked them. Food was all pretty much the same - you could get enchiladas, tacos, or a burrito with your choice of meat. I had a trio of tacos, with mahi mahi, shrimp, and chicken. Nothing was particular stand-out delicious, but it wasn't bad. It was just okay. The chips were terrible though - they were thin and overfried like something you'd get from Moe's. I won't be back since it's a bit of a drive from where I stay."}
{"text":"I had one of the best service experiences dining at Juan Jaime's tonight.  Adam, the bartender, was attentive and fun while waiting for my take out order.  The food is fantastic, but moreover the service was spot on.  Adam nailed it."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Mexican food and awesome selections of tequila! I have been here many times and the food does not disappoint. I like coming here for happy hour because their margaritas are like $4 each. They have awesome flavors too. 

I recommend the tacos trio or the ensalada. Both are really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch bite with my friends before we were off to get our hair done at Primp and Blow. Loved the green salsa best (hotter which I prefer), I enjoyed my cadillac margarita, one of my friends ordered a mango margarita and the other two-house. Considering we were going to be having a big dinner later that night, I opted to have their taco salad with chicken. Loved it!! Included with guacamole, very flavorful and filling!! Also the house chips are light, warm and crisp!!
Definitely plan to return here soon!"}
{"text":"We were there during happy hour and ordered their frozen house margarita. It was one on best margaritas I have ever tasted. Only being $4 was a bonus. 
For main entree, we ordered their steak platter which came with rice and beans and tortilla. We also ordered the pulled pork burrito enchilada style. Both dishes were amazing. Tasted authentic and the portion sizes were humongous. Both had leftovers. Their free chips, queso and salsa was very tasty as well. We opted to order guacamole and it paired nicely with chips and our entrees. 
Our waiter, Andre was one of best waiter we ever had. He was very attentive, checking on us frequently even though we were seated in their patio and the restaurant was packed. 
Overall, very happy with our meal, experience and service. The price is very inexpensive especially given the area this restaurant is located. Everything we ordered for two people came to about $30, not bad for Scottsdale for the quality and quantity of food. We will be returning here."}
{"text":"Great little taco spot in the neighborhood with good beer selections and a good happy. They have good service and a nice crowd."}
{"text":"If you are a tequila lover, this place might be for you.  They have a huge selection of tequilas and can even add some of them as toppers to your margarita.  If you are like me and don't care that much about tequila, it was okay.  For a place that touts their tacos and tequilas, they fell short on the taco side.  I tried the two taco platter with rice and black beans.  My chicken taco was delicious and flavorful, but the steak taco was not as good.  It tasted like they had put the same seasoning on both.  I did try a margarita with a pomegranate tequila topper.  It was strong but tasty.  They also had a salsa bar, but of the four salsa they had there was only one mild option and the rest were super spicy.  The prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly but scarce.  I ate here because I was in the neighborhood, but I didn't find anything that would draw me back to eat here again."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy the enchiladas I got. They were too dry. My boyfriend thought his chicken burrito was great for the price. We should've gotten the tacos considering all the reviews here recommend it. Also didn't try the margaritas but they look fantastic."}
{"text":"Juan Jamie's is the bomb!  It looks small from the outside but has plenty of room on the inside.  It has an amazing patio area and the staff is fantastic.  The food is great and the prices are amazing.  This place was highly recommended to my wife and I and we weren't led astray.  
If you are close to Chandler, you need to try it out.  If you are staying at a hotel any where near Chandler Fashion Square, this is one Uber ride that would be well worth it!"}
{"text":"Their tacos are really delicious!  I had one steak taco and one shrimp taco.  Delish!  The margaritas are also good.  I also love that they're open late night.  I wouldn't make a special trip to go there, but it's a great option if I happen to be out in that area."}
{"text":"I saw a bad review which really surprises me. I go there often, but wouldn't call myself a regular. I don't know any bartenders' names or anything. But, I've never had a bad taco, bad service or bad anything ever here. The crowd always seems chill. The patio is nice. I like the red lighting. Good for street watching too. Their food always tastes fresh and their salsa bar is very yummy! Tequilas-great selection. I believe Herradura is one of my faves. I say, can't go wrong with this spot. If you like a casual fresh Mexican kind of sporty type bar with a lot of modern touches and nice staff, don't see why you wouldn't enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best thing? Their salsas and cheese dip for chips. Come here for chips & dips & drinkies or go elsewhere. The enchiladas and tacos are ho-hum. With so many other excellent Mexican food choices in town, this place can be skipped."}
{"text":"GodDAMN this was delicious Mexican food. I will pine after it for the rest of my days. The three amigos appetizer (guacamole, queso, and salsa with chips) was so good. We left no trace of dip behind. The guac was super flavorful, the cheese was delicious, and the salsa was perfect. I had an egg and chorizo taco, a shrimp taco, and rice and beans. Every single bite delivered. I was upset when it ended. Also some of the best margaritas I've had. I had a strawberry margarita on the rocks...and then I had another. DELICIOUS! Highly recommend. I'll definitely be back next time I travel to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised here compared to yelp expectations.  Very good prices/value, very good happy hour hours (till 8), and good service (Thursday night).  Place felt like a bar overall but plenty of families in the seating area.  Food quality was good, especially queso & chips (with free queso refill).  $3.50 margarita was exceptional for that price."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed... And I really wanted to be! Because it's so close to where we live- but it wasn't anything special. 

I had the tacos... And they were just \"eh\" They have a salsa bar... Which sounds cool, but again- it's not really anything impressive. Service was fine! No problem there. We had a really nice guy serve us-"}
{"text":"Probably the most chill restaurant and bar in the north Scottsdale area. Service is top notch, elite above the rest. Brendan kept my friend and I toasty all night long with their awesome heat lamps outdoors. Greatest server, greatest bartender, greatest host of 2016. Very pleasant experience every time. Would recommend to all friends. Good food, but also just a great place to go and grab a drink with a few friends. Open till 2am while many other bars and restaurants are only open until 12am. Thanks Juan Jamie's for taking is in and making us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Juan Jaime's is just kind of eh. Every time I try a new Mexican place I have these grandiose ideas that I'm going to discover some new and exciting taco's that'll blow my little mind and make me feel like I'm eating at a little taco stand in Mexico. Well... as you can probably guess, I'm usually pretty disappointed when that doesn't happen 99 out of 100 times. Well, chalk up another dead soldier in my search for amazing Mexican food in AZ. 

Juan Jaime's turned out to be pretty average... decent assortment of various standard Mexican dishes; okay prices, pretty fresh flavor... but no 'wow factor'. With Mexican food, you've gotta do something to separate yourself. I can close my eyes and point to almost any cross street in Arizona and be within walking distance of a dozen Mexican restaurants. So why the hell do so many of them play it so safe? I guess there's nothing wrong with places like this... the food is good enough; I just feel like I could make the same stuff if given the same ingredients at home... I want to be amazed when I go out to eat, not paralyzed by averageness! Maybe the tequila part of the menu is a little more fun, too bad I don't drink. 

Who knows if I'll ever go back to Juan Jamie's... probably will just file it under my ever growing list of average Mexican spots I only eat at if I'm desperately craving some south of the border food. Blaaaaah."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place. Average everything and The bartender isn't the happiest person and lacks attentiveness, which is important when trying to order another drink for more food or get a bill. It looks like it has potential perhaps under new management."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix on business and found a local tex mex place near my hotel in Chandler area.  Glad that I went to Juan Jaime's Tacos...great food, service and fun people to meet & talk with at the bar.  I had the tortilla soup (nice & spicy) and two tacos.  All for great value.  I will definitely be back next time I'm back in Chandler."}
{"text":"Drinks were good, strong. Food: beef taco good, fish taco needs more fish, shrimp taco ok. Chips good salsa pretty standard. Staff nice."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a late flight into Scottsdale. We went there late and the kitchen was still open. The salsa was really good but the food was just ok. I was starving so I ate it all. It was not authentic Mexican food but more like Texmex. If you like Texmex then this is a good place. The only downfall was the screaming Catfight that ensued at the bar while we were eating. Two ladies fighting over the same man from what we could tell. The restaurant did a good job of moving the show outside."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are very good. The service is even better. Just belly up to the bar and enjoy great food and a great atmosphere."}
