{"text":"This place rocks. Great pizza at reasonable prices.  They have lots of choice and a good lunch special that includes two slices and a drink.  The only negative is its not a very large place so near lunch time sometimes its hard to find a seat.  Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"We love coming here. The pizza is always delicious and ready on time.  The location is very convenient to us.  Don't try ordering online though, the website is a mess."}
{"text":"Found this place a couple weeks ago and decided 'why not?'  We weren't disappointed. Ordered and got delivery within 25 mins of the call on a Saturday night at 8pm. We ordered a generic pizza (mushroom and sausage) to test it out along with the bbq chicken salad. It was delicious AND filling plus they weren't shy on the chicken in the salad. We'll definitely try this place again, maybe try a specialty pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good -- closest to NY style pizza (but healthier) that I've had in downtown so far (am still new to the area, however).  I had 2 slices of cheese, which had been sitting out but were heated and, although not fresh, were pretty delicious.  The two slice and a drink special was $7 I think and the slices were fairly big, so it was a good deal.  The place had a hipster vibe with a relaxing atmosphere, although the music was a little more upbeat than I would have expected.  The live music setup outside was a bit clumsy, as I felt like I was in the way of the musician as I tried to get inside, and the patio is kind of small so sitting outside listening to the music would have almost felt like I was up in his face, but you can't beat live music.  Overall, good experience, good pizza, easy to get to in downtown. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'd eaten here for years. Since becoming gluten-free in late 2011- I didn't think I'd enjoy pizza again. When family was visiting before Christmas we dined in and ordered four different pies. I ordered the gluten-free Provence (capers! artichoke hearts! basil!) Everyone enjoyed their pizza, and we ended up ordering a second-gluten free Provence since everyone enjoyed a slice of mine. A couple folks in my party had wine, others had beer. After we ate, we took the kids next door to Pink Spot where everyone enjoyed ice cream and sorbet."}
{"text":"I've had their \"3 Z\" lunch special a few times. Usually grab two slices (I've always gotten the daily specialty pizza) and a half salad. $7.99 and it fills me up for hours."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and salads. The arugula salad is awesome and we have tried their specialty pizzas too and have never been disappointed. They deliver to our office and have always been on time and our order has always been correct. Good job!"}
{"text":"I'm all-in with any place that touts organic ingredients, so I wanted to give this place a whirl. After two visits, I'm just inclined to say \"It's all right, I guess.\"  The pizza is more impressive than typical chain pizzas, of course, but both pizzas I tried (first being some Greek pizza and the second a masterpiece of my chosen ingredients) were pretty salty and greasy. I'm a fan of thicker-crust pizzas, Chicago-style and the like, so I wasn't super pleased with these more thin-skinned slices; but if you like that kinda thing..  Customer service here could also use work; it's not absolutely horrible, but both times I went the service lady (two different ones) gave the impression that I was holding her up or something. The second one, who I told we were going to be a second in deciding on our pizzas, said \"okay\" and stood and stared at us as we uncomfortably perused the menu. Better than disappearing, I guess, but still kind of jarring. The whole staff seems kind of \"irreverent hipstery,\" and I can't stress that vibe of \"We have something better to do\" more.  The ingredients seem pretty good, though, and there are plenty to choose from for you out there who enjoy a slew of exotic flavors on your pie. I'd recommend it over most pizza places, just say to order carry-out online so you don't have to deal much with customer service and to shy away from any oil-based sauce (pesto/olive oil whatever) so you won't have an oil rag for a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a bit frustrated. I love the pizza, but the place is always dirty; at least, the past three times that I have been here. The bathroom had mold around the waterline in the toilet and the walls in the dining room were dirty. Now I'm not eating out if the toilet nor off the walls, but it doesn't make you feel good. Today I went to sit down at 4 different tables, having to continuously move due to the crumbs on each table. So, choosing the bar across from the cashier brought me closer to watching how they prepare the pizza. The guy wears no food handlers gloves! Just hands on cheese on my pizza! No thanks! Fare Z well!"}
{"text":"At first I didn't think much of zpizza, but after going a few times and trying out a couple of the lunch specials...I'm hooked! zpizza is the only pizza where I look forward to eating the crust."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service, quality, and bowel repercussions. 2 hour delivery time, 2 day toilet odyssey. Not my first bad experience either. Never again!"}
{"text":"Love the concept and especially the entertainment on First Fridays!   Fun group of people and excellent musician."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The pizza is bland and soggy. The wings are 99% fat 1% Franks Red Hot sauce( maybe franks buffalo) the bread sticks are actually pretty good. The delivery time can't be beat. Pinos pizza is significantly better."}
{"text":"Nice lunch specials and a fun downtown location. Very close to the Van Buren and Central light rail stop. I got 1 slice and a side salad for about $8. The salad had lots of \"extras\" and was way more impressive than the average side salad. You can also select any slice of pizza you want. They have specials that change daily."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but a fantastic time with both the staff and service! I love the pizza"}
{"text":"Ok, I just had lunch there. The place is clean and the staff is friendly, but most of all, I am paying for my food, right?   Maybe I've been spoiled by the Pear Gorganzola salad at the one on Tatum, but I wasn't pleased with my pizza/salad combo today at this one.   The garden salad was actually a lettuce salad with two tomatoes. It was weak. The pizza wasn't as organic tasting as I had hoped for. I was hoping for that fresh taste, but I got a Dominos taste. Disappointed. Maybe I should just stick to the Pear Gorganzola salad. Infact, I am craving that now!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of thick doughy pizza and bland sauce. I almost always order the casablanca for me, sausage for my kid and hubby likes the pesto pasta. The salads are great, and large portioned. It is pricey but I am willing to pay extra for what I think is good food.  Not 5 stars because lately when I order for delivery they have made quite a few mistakes.  Oh I almost forgot! They now have wings, and let me tell you, they are to die for! I ordered two different kinds of sauces and both orders just came with Ranch (doh!) but even without the sauces these were the best wings I have had in a really long time. I am personally not a fan of wings because they are usually overcooked or have a strange fatty consistency and these were just awesome. I would love to try them with some the offered sauces so hopefully next time I get what I order."}
{"text":"How s the Pizza ? I,ve no Idea . After fiquireing out the web site , put in the order , get a call from the store to confirm the order , I waited 1 hour 20 minutes and its still not here . I called the store , Oh he left 25 minutes ago with 2 deliveries . Ok Cancel mine , you can imagine what its like once it get here after 30 minutes . On a Tuesday night There has to be an easier way to get Pizza than ZPizza . Gooood Bye Zpizza !"}
{"text":"Trend sucking expensive pizza, come on now 22 bucks for a medium 3 topping pizza.  I especially liked the counter dweeb taking 10 minutes to scan the two twenties I gave him.  Must have had a rash of middle aged men passing fake 20's.  I pass."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty good, especially the vegan options.  But that's only if they have them, which they rarely do.  What is the point of having it listed on the menu when I constantly get calls after ordering to see if I still want the order because they can't completely fulfill it!?  Today, I CALLED first to ask and was told they \"should\" have it.  But they called me after I placed the order and let me know they didn't have it.  This location is such a joke.  The workers are obviously unhelpful when you call in and zpizza has never responded to my emails letting them know this location never has the vegan meat.  I will NEVER recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I stopped by for lunch in-between classes to grab a slice of pizza. We'd been to Z Pizza once before and it was pretty good.  Apparently they had just opened because they had no slices out, and they told us it would be 10 minutes before it was ready. Technically they opened early, a little less than 10 minutes, so I think they were on time with preparation for the most part. The manager made sure to let us know they always try to open early for our benefit.   We browsed the local art (all 'abstract') on the walls, looked at the shop connected which had ice cream, interesting treats, and breakfast/lunch foods, but we ended up waiting for the pizza because we wanted something real and tasty (and less than $4-5 for one item).   One slice of pizza came out to about $3, which I expected since they are smaller and more specialty. The thing that made me happy was that it was a decently sized slice for both of us to share. It was the American, which was awesome. Fresh ingredients, bright colors, REAL thin crust (nice and crispy, yummy even plain), and not as much of a greasy feeling that is usually found in other pizzas that are loaded with too much cheese or whatever.   There was a little bit of a water/grease mixture that dripped off in the first handling, but that is just because of the fresh veggies and meat and cheese. If your meat and cheese doesn't have a drop of grease when cooked, something isn't right. This was in no way soggy or dense with grease. It was really a perfect slice of pizza to be honest.  The only thing that made me worried was a common nat or two flying around. With ingredients that are mixed and prepped on the open-aired counter-tops, that is a worry for me. It's not something very controllable by the employees or store hygiene, so I don't lose customer satisfaction, but I wonder if they ever get baked into the mix every 10,000th pizza. The irony is that there was one in the menu viewing box at the entry. I will stress that the place practices cleanly standards from what I observed.  All in all I know I am a satisfied customer when I don't regret spending my money and time and energy into going somewhere, which happens often. Z Pizza has a nice local, casual feel, not as concerned about a fake approach to you when you are there, and hey, they even warned us that the slice was really hot. It's about the quality of the food/time without being ripped off, and the food quality was really awesome! My fiancee and I would probably come here again for a close-by solution for hunger when we are waiting for our next class.  *If you want a more cafe atmosphere, the location on Central is good for that. They have live music near the outdoor seating weekly as far as I know, usually kind of jazzy.  P.S. Thumbs up for having same-priced gluten free options for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The owner staphan is always friendly and open to suggestions and input. The food quality is awesome! Great ingredients and even a gluten free menu! Service is the best you will get downtown. I try to get there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Bland pizza.  Not particularly horrible nor particularly good.  Staff that cared more about what's playing on the tv screen than keeping the tables clean.  But a nice space otherwise."}
{"text":"Good pizza, fresh ingredients, and lots of healthy alternative options on the menu.  The only bummer with them is that they are so popular that my delivery took over an hour to arrive.  They gave me a call around 11:30 am to let me know that my order would arrive a little after 1 pm.  I appreciated the call and I'm glad I waited.  The pizza was delicious, as was the hummus plate I got, as well.    I recommend giving them a try, your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"They apparently closed at nine tonight. But stayed open just a few minutes past so I could pick up my delicious. Crispy made to order pizza. And pear gorgonzola salads.  A Tuscan pizza and added sausage. We ordered it crispy when i go there the woman was concerned she over cooked the pizza and already had another one cooking in the oven! But i liked the one she had ready to go.  I almost walked out without my salads but she ran after me and made aure i got them.  The blonde haired older woman was berry polite ready an willing to please The place was clean My order was correct I am now full and happy."}
{"text":"Food is a tad high but the wings and pizza as well as the calzone were good. The  help was friendly and out food was HOT when brought to the table.  The music was actually decent and not to loud. The place seemed clean and they had a steady business for a Sunday night"}
{"text":"I have been debating on posting  a review for quite a while on Zpizza, I'm torn.  On one hand, their pizzas are addicting and delicious. Their (usually) perfectly crafted and aesthetically pleasing. The best thing about them is the variety. Its no longer cheese, pepperoni or sausage, they bring new elements to the table.      BUT, on the other hand, the one thing they are truly lacking in their business is genuine customer service and communication among themselves. About 2 months ago, I ordered two simple pizzas, the Thai (my personal favorite) and the ZBBQ (my boyfriends personal favorite). Because neither of us eat meat, I simply asked them for NO chicken. I have ordered from them many times, so I wasn't the least bit worried. I waited 45 minutes for it and when it arrived my pizzas were both covered in chicken, so we obviously couldn't eat them. I called and spoke with a manger just to say \"Hey, this kind of sucks!\" she then told me sorry and that I can have a free small pizza.  So, still being hungry I decided to place another order (why not?). 45 minutes later I receive the same order and even tipped the guy generously for having to come out again. Well, what to you know, there's no chicken! But wait, there's also nothing else on the pizza except cheese. Awesome.  Twice in one day on the same order. This has also happened several more times since.  For me, customer service is a big part of running a business. If you keep screwing up orders because you fail to communicate with your team you're going to lose valuable customers."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone.  I ordered the Pick 3 option: a slice of pizza, salad, and half a sandwich. All for $8.  The meal was very good and I will be back.  I have to admit I expected less from this place, but I was proved wrong.  It's not your ordinary pizza joint.  Very good food!  Pizza was thin and delicious...."}
{"text":"Love zpizza.  Where else can you get cremini and shitake mushrooms, truffle oil, capers or eggplant  on a delivery pizza?  And, the crust?  It's yummy.  I like it in wheat . .. it's a little crispier.  And, their flour and marinara is organic, which can't hurt.  And, last, the XL pizza is huge.  WTF is Dominos, Papa Johns etc all excited about their piddly 14\" pizza made out of crap?"}
{"text":"End of a long conference day and all I wanted was a pizza! Zpizza did it for me! Delivery was ridiculously fast and they had this delicious pie with sweet corn and spiced chicken.  My first pizza with corn I had in Europe a couple years back and I've never forgotten it. So if you're downtown Phoenix and need something fast and tasty give Zpizza a call."}
{"text":"Go there at 440pm the cashier in front told us sit and he would take our order. Ten minutes later brought our drinks. My wife order a glass of water and received this picture. It was in total 44 dollars. A xl pizza and 16 wings when I received the food. I asked clearly is everything in there. I asked is the Parmesan and peppers in there with napkins. And is everything good with the wings? The guy said yes. I get home excited been wanting to eat pizza and I opened my wings and no sauce. The wings were dried. So I had to make my own sauce at home lol. I called them and the cashier answered the phone. He didn't even say anything. I'm upset. You only had one job? Make sure the product is good. For Gods sake. You got a raise with minimum wage going up a few dollars in az and you still do a lazy job. Ugh! Never again will I go there. Thanks for ruining it."}
{"text":"Ordered the Berkeley Vegan pizza here recently.  Very good -- lots of veggies, and came with Daiya vegan cheese on top also!  The crust was a little but underdone, but still good."}
{"text":"In keeping with my promis to only review places that deserve 1 or 5 stars, here is a 1. This places blows... Is \"organic\" code for \"shitty\"? Seriously frozen pizza is better than this place.... undercooked dough, bland sauce... eesh...."}
{"text":"Z pizza SUCKS hands down! Management, owner's, employees and food can alllll go to hell ..save your $ and the stress form this unprofessional nasty ass'd business ....buyer be ware."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Sadly, our pizza was cold and underdone. It didn't improve, even after being put in our oven. We ended up throwing it out. Two stars for their use of organic and local ingredients."}
{"text":"When I have the craving for pizza, which isn't that often, Z Pizza is the best spot in Central Phoenix.  Our guilty pleasure is ordering on Tuesday nights when it's buy one, get the second for $5 (or is it half-price?  some kind of great deal)....and eating pizza while we watch Biggest Loser.  I'm always a fan of pepperoni, and their crust is crispy thin...the best way.  Also like the Casablanca...artichoke hearts, mushrooms, ricotta, parmesan, mozzarella...so tasty.  Great to have Gluten-free crust as an option, and the ingredients are fresh.  Yes, it's a small west coast chain...but they do it \"right\".   Friendly staff, speedy service, easy location."}
{"text":"Ask if they have the apple pie pizza. It is decadent.  We usually get home delivery from zpizza.  Yesterday we got a vegetable calzone, salad and wings. Everything was as expected and temperature perfect.  Try the BBQ wings - they are sweet, crispy and not overly sauced."}
{"text":"Zpizza is pretty good. They do use fresh ingredients. Wings are frozen and oven baked. So they're soggy, they're not all fat, just soggy as all hell. If you don't like the texture of soggy wings, stay away. I'm okay with them and they do alright when I'm in a pinch. The Casablanca pizza is amazing! They have some really great specialty pizzas. Where as many people have Pizza Hut or Papa John's as their basic delivery pizza place, I like to choose Zpizza."}
{"text":"I usually really love the vegan pizza, but today I got it by the slice and it was horrible. I got it to go and when I got home 5 minutes later, it was cold. I don't want to give them less then 3 stars because I really like the place. But I spent way too much money on cold pizza that didn't taste good anyways.  I'll probably go back, but I am never getting pizza by the slice again."}
{"text":"My family and I went there last night to celebrate my cousin  Graduation.         It was probably 20 or more of us my aunt suggested we are hispanic we weren't  to happy with the idea of going to a pizza place. But Hey surprise we got the best pizza ever Ham & Pineapple , Mexican with avacado pizza we order a big salad bowl more than enough for everyone my parents were at the bar they all got to try and pick from the draft beer , we were all very thankful everyone was very friendly and attend, a very warm and nice place to have a nice dinner with your family I will definitely go back ..."}
{"text":"Z pizza is my favorite cheese pizza ever  and I have lived all over.  I have always had good service, good delivery from this store. In the past the salads I had were relatively sparse on the toppings, but the ZBQ salad I ordered tonight was great. In the past I have had a few pizzas that were overcooked and a little charred on the crust, but overall I really like this place.  They also support local artists.  I will forever order pizza from them!"}
{"text":"They have interesting combinations like curry chicken and yams, pear and gorgonzola....sounds bizarre, but is so flavorful! The traditional choices are available as well, along with great salads and unique sandwiches. Organic whole wheat crust and fresh ingredients make for a great pizza! Friendly staff is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Short and sweet if you are looking for a GREAT to go pizza with organic ingredients and amazing quality these are your guys. Z pizza made me forget about movie night and Im just calling it pizza night now :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at 7:30...it's almost 9 o'clock.  Still haven't seen it.  Granted they have great pizza, but this is ridiculous!  Perhaps one of the other ZPizza locations in Phoenix would do better."}
{"text":"Its not offen im in the mood for pizza but this is a great option.  They deliver, it seems healthier than normal pizza (eventhough its prob not), and they have great unique pizza toppings.  Give it a shot...if you like the \"california\" style pizza you will like \"Z\""}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting the area after flying to Phoenix for surgery at BNI. We just happened to see this place on the way to our hotel and decided to hop on over for lunch.  The pizza was top notch, in my opinion. It's obvious they use quality ingredients, and their salads look good too.  The only complaint I have is that the price was a little steep. It was $50-something for one XL pepp pizza, one L pepp + sausage pizza, 3 bottles of water, and one beer. We all felt that was a bit much, but it was very good pizza.   I also liked that the next door ice cream place was connected to the restaurant by a breezeway. It made it feel more like a community place. I recommend the place for pizza."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new, and we found this small little place. Great food, the pizza was delicious ( do not order by slice, buy a whole one.. It'll be fresher and taste better). And then if you are not full, the amazing part is that is connected with the pink place, where they sell desserts and smoothies. I give it 4 stars because the employees are lacking customer service skills. But good place overall"}
{"text":"There's plenty of pizza-by-the-slice joints for those of us who work downtown, but Z Pizza stands out as the only one that consistently impresses me. Friendly staff, wholesome ingredients, inventive topping combinations and a tasty slice are enough to keep me coming back, and two slices and a drink and a drink always seem to cost a buck or two less than other downtown pizza joints.  Lately I've been throwing side salads in the mix with the No. 2 lunch combo. Fresh tomato slices, shredded carrot and red onion on a hearty bed of field greens all taste great with the balsamic vinaigrette. With one slice of sausage and mushroom, it's a filling meal with significantly fewer calories than the two-slice deal.  Sometimes I'll order a whole pie to take home for dinner (the Tuscan Mushroom is one of the most inventive tomato-free pizzas I've ever had), and it's always a hit.  Bring your coworkers or classmates here for lunch, and they'll forget wherever it was they used to go for slices."}
{"text":"Good pizza - crispy crust,tons of toppings, and some creative combinations. Stopped in when stranded at the hospital across the street and would happily go back to this location or try the other locations."}
{"text":"Good pizza great service the cashier girl is very nice and polite she has a great smile"}
{"text":"This place really needs to be trashed more.  zpizza is a fraud in too many ways.  It markets itself as a sort of whole-foods, higher-end, indie urban culture-vulture sorta place.  It wants you to think it's a cut above.  And it's none of the above.  It's in reality a corporate franchise chain, with a few tweaks to its menu to make it look a touch Berkeley.  It's in a rather inaccessible part of north-of-downtown Phoenix, but they deliver.  The prices it charges for pizza are an outrage, their ordering system goes down too often, and they deliver a cold $25 pizza and then ignore you when you complain.    The ingredients it uses are largely not organic, but they want you to think they use high-end ingredients.  If the flat flavor of their pizzas is any indication, their ingredients come off the same Sysco truck any other middling restaurant's groceries do.    One time I tried to order online, the system choked.  I called and they said, \"We're sorry we're closed - our ordering system is completely down.\"  On a Saturday evening, they couldn't do business without computers.  Wow.    Another time, I ordered an American large, and discovered that they charge a lot extra for everything you add to your pizza.  And everything comes in the most paper-thin slices, so thin you almost can't taste it. I had never experienced see-through tomato slices before, and it was also my first encounter with windowpane pepperoni.  The crust is chewy, which is ok.  But there wasn't much food on my pizza.  It was thin and meager and not satisfying.  And it cost a lot of money.  Oh, and the sausage looked like perfect little weasel droppings, smooth and brown and perfectly formed, as if by machine - or by rodent.  They have whole-wheat crust and gluten-free crust and too many salads with stinky cheese in them and fruit too I think.  So if your probation officer said you have to eat more pear and gorgonzola gluten free pizzas with extra arugula, well, you can stay outta jail one more week.  Next time (why did I have a next time?) again, online ordering is down, but they take phone orders.  I am given a 30 to 40 min del'y window.  After 60 mins I call and ask.  Am told it's on the way now.  It arrives 20 mins after that.  I grab the box and it's cold.  I mention to young street-urchin-looking delivery hipster that my pizza appears cold.  I ask him to wait a sec while I open and check the pizza.  He bolts away and into his car before I can ascertain that I have a cold pizza and cold wings.  I wonder what the delivery guy was up to all that time?  My pizza had been baked some time before.  Perhaps he had been too.  While the slices were microwaving, I called zpizza to discuss and was told manager is unavailable.  Message is left for call back.  I also left a detailed accounting on their online form, and I never heard from anybody.    Again, people, this place tries to whore itself out as a high end, even crunchy place, the kind of place you'd take your lesbian-married-with-adopted-Chinese-baby friends, so you could look just a little less pathetically uncool than you really are.  But it is just another chain using smaller amounts of the same goods as everybody else, adding a few upscale salads to the menu, and charging 40% more than everybody else.  And they have unacceptably poor customer service.  Go to Pizza Hut.  Really.  Aim low and you won't be disappointed.  Oh - and Pino's next door has good and more authentic pizza too, but you gotta pick it up yourself.  Or if you can, get Rosati's - the real Chicago one."}
{"text":"After my so-so experience a few months ago I had the chance to try zpizza again today with a group of friends. The Napoli pizza I ordered was absolutely incredible and I would have eaten the whole thing by myself (large) had I been able to! I will coming back every time that I'm in town to get some amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Glass they gave me for my wine was way dirty. When I asked for a clean one he could not find one. He had to make one by whiping it out. Then I had to pour my wine in as he did not replace the wine. The dueling tvs were annoying also.   Pizza was interesting but a bit too greasy"}
{"text":"The gf and I came for dinner on a First Friday. We had purchased a $19 groupon for 2 side salads, an appetizer, small pizza, and $20 worth of beer. It ended up being plenty of food and beer, especially for less than $20. Neither of us drank $10 worth of beer and we had leftover pizza. The place wasn't busy at all and the wait staff was very friendly. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"i love z- pizza! its so nice having a pizza place that makes vegan pizza for us lactose intolerants! the berkely, or vegan, was so good. a little bland because its made from soy cheese, but if youre taste buds feel theres really something lacking, its nothing a little pepper cant fix. i moved to sf a year ago and before i moved i went here and had their pesto-penne dish as well, and that was amazing.  speaking of san francisco, what's with the lack of vegan pizza options there?! im glad i moved back to phoenix and had the pleasure of eating z pizza AND pita jungle in my first 2 days."}
{"text":"Exotic combinations of pizza.  From to A to Z, Z pizza is Z best!!  Must try the thai pizza and the Napoli one.  I love that the pizzas are all from organic ingredients, making the flavors much more intense."}
{"text":"Z Pizza is good pizza.  Every pie I've tried has been super good, and they deliver ($20 minimum order).  They also deliver salads and cookies, which is nice if you want a whole meal or if you're having folks over and you want to serve more than just the pizza.  Just thinking about the fresh (and often organic) toppings, good cheese, and their crunchy, yummy crust is making me so hungry!  It's obviously a matter of taste, but I far prefer Z Pizza's crust to the thin floppy kind.  Let the hate mail begin."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. I always get the 2 slice and drink special. Can't go wrong with awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza here is too salty and oily.  They don't really do less cheese when asked.  Plus expensive - personal pizza plus very plain side salad = $18!  I do appreciate the soy cheese, soy burger and whole wheat crust.  And the folks are very nice.  But the pizza quality could be better.  Plus, better hot sauce!  All they have is some runny mildly hot stuff.  What is pizza without Sriracha?"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and wanted a quick bite.  Stayed at the Hyatt about .25miles from store. Called for delivery of a small pizza.  Had to order more to satisfy delivery minimum. Was told 30-40 minutes.  Over an hour later called back and was told store was closed.  Asked where my food was.... he just left.  Got the pizza and it was Luke warm at best.  No apologies for being late.  Don't recommend them."}
{"text":"Let's just say that if I could give less than one star I would.  I had ordered here once before and it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver.They had given us the pizza for freeso  I decided to give them a second shot.  I ordered on a Tuesday night (not like a Friday or Saturday) and after over an hour I called them back and they stated that they couldn't find my address (keep in mind they had delivered to me before) and I live near major landmarks that any GPS can find.  Then afterI called and  read them the riot they said that I was out of their delivery area, but they were going to go out of their way and bring it to me.  As I am sitting here over 2 1/2 hours has gone by and STILL no pizza.  Neddless to say, I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I made my first order from zpizza without checking yelp and now that i have, I'm kind of surprised by the 3.5 star rating.   We've had zpizza delivered a bunch of times now via Grubhub and the pizza is always yummy with good ingredients and quick delivery.  Can't go wrong with the zbq and they also have great pesto options. We'll keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Love the Napoli pizza.  So fresh.  Add some sausage and it becomes a meat lovers pizza."}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Domino's delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk.   But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches.  Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!"}
{"text":"The pizza is fine, and always fresh. Nothing too fancy or amazing. But it hits the spot."}
{"text":"I have really loved z pizza in the past, but the last two times I have been quoted a delivery time and it has taken twice as long, over an hour and a half both times. The first time I thought it was a fluke so I gave it another chance and the same thing happened. We will be eating delivery pizza from pizza a metro from now on. Same quality pizza and much better customer service."}
{"text":"Alex is the man! We had a great time tonight! Excellent customer service. Def will be back."}
{"text":"I know for a fact there are GMO foods at your restaurant. I knew the last owners and I know for a fact that you have changed vendors, change the portions, change from yeast, salt, water and flour for the pizza dough to some kind of enhancement packets. You can't even pronounce the ingredients. Don't lie. Mark and Julie didn't go by what corporate said. They did what is best for that store and their customer base they've had for years.  So don't blow smoke in my face. I know the truth."}
{"text":"We love this place. We eat here every year when we visit Phoenix. Very kid friendly. Great salads. Since they do pizza by the slice too everyone gets what they want. Best part is it's attached to the Pink Spot."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for Zpizza.  I loved their selection of pizza combos, crusts, and toppings - and then I tried the pizza....  Bland, cheap with toppings, metallic sauce - no wonder they offer so many combinations, they're hoping you find one that doesn't suck.  Droopy, soggy crust too - maybe they should worry less about their website and more about their food.    The kicker tonight was to find out that they don't deliver their mediocre pizza outside of three miles.  This means they don't deliver to most of DC Ranch and none of McDowell Mountain Ranch or Windgate Ranch - genius."}
{"text":"There are so many things on this menu that I love - the pizza is delicious, the salads are fantastic... and now they have beer!!!   I remember when they had room for two tables when they first opened, and now - wow - after the expansion, it's just a great relaxed place to hang out.    Wall-to-wall people over the lunch hour, no surprise!   YUM."}
{"text":"Very nice whole wheat pizza crust options, love the taste. I am allergic to white flour and don't prefer gluten free ( loaded with potato starch and sodium  sometimes unless they are made of whole grains like quinoa, brown rice and gluten free ) and hence opt for whole wheat. There are only few pizza joints offering that and hence z pizza is great for folks like me."}
{"text":"I just took my kids to Z Pizza today and had a HORRIBLE experience. A man who identified himself as the owner practically accosted my 4-year-old. My son was holding 2 plastic knives, not hurting anyone, just holding them in his hands, when the owner charged in, snatched the knives from my son's hands and proceeded to scold him. Not only did he yank them from my son's hands rather violently, he scared the b'jesus out of him.   This was an outrage on many levels...  1) The owner charged in madder than hell. He let his anger scare a young child 2) The owner should have spoken to me first. Never were my kids unsupervised, I was sitting right there. They were doing NOTHING wrong, just being energetic boys. Let me remind you: this is a pizza joint, not an upscale restaurant 3) Even after I told the owner to stop touching my child, he continued. UNACCEPTABLE. You do not yell at or assault a child. I would file criminal charges, but I don't want to put my kids through an ordeal. This man obviously has anger issues that need to be dealt with. My message to him: Stop picking on innocent little kids!  There is no PERHAPS, the owner absolutely should have spoken with me first. My child was shocked at the way he was spoken to and is still very upset by the event. The owner let his anger get the better of him. PERIOD. And for that he should apologize, not chastise"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Service is ok. When I tried to cash in on the free pizza slice on yelp check in, they tried to charge me $2.50. Something about how it rang up in the computer. Other than that, this is a nice cozy pizza joint with flavorful fresh items."}
{"text":"The good things about Z Pizza: It's open late, it's close to downtown, and they have vegan options.  The bad: It's a chain, they have like 6 parking spots, and the crust sticks to your teeth.  Seriously.  Also, I don't know if it's the type of vegan cheese or the way they prepare it, but it's just not that good.  It looks and tastes fake.  Pizza Heaven does it better.  This place gets the job done...but BARELY."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Great fresh ingredients. Good thickness on crust. Even taste good the next day cold."}
{"text":"Amazing variety of pizza. Very good crust, creative toppings. Totally worth the price. More like CPK than Papa Johns. Go for speciality pizzas, not just cheese and pepperoni. Only been once, but highly recommend the Thai Chicken and Mexican Pizzas.  Customer service is wonderful! Very nice staff!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at the nearby Blue Burger Grille (which is amazing) and have always seen this restaurant from the car. As a person who is a vegan and has always hated pizza, I never gave much thought to Z pizza. One day I was searching for some new vegan hot spots (on yelp!) and came across Z pizza.   I went to their website and to my surprise they had a vegan pizza called the Berkley Vegan. That night I called in my order and had the BEST vegan pizza of my life! Super tasty and not at all greasy. This is a must try for vegans and non-vegans too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, especially if you're out to feed a vegan. Yelp needs to make this $$ instead of $ on the price. It's well worth it tho."}
{"text":"First time here , was pretty good. It was a little confusing trying to figure out the beer thing with the bracelet at first , the manager was more than helpful in that area.( the girl at the cashier said she would come over and help with the tutorial, but a line of people came in and I was wondering how to use this bracelet) it's kinda neat once you get the hang of it , wave your bracelet at the Z at the tap you want and your tab accrues as you pour your own beer , keeping track of your ounces. Can try them all a little if you want . Pizza was good and the wings are fantastic!!!! Definitely try this place if you are down town Phoenix. Order the pick 3 and it's affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered a calzone and salad for delivery at 11:09am and it is now 12:26pm and I still have not received. When I called to inquire they said they still had 3 more deliveries and that they can give me a discount on my NEXT order. At this point this order should be FREE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had a love/hate relationship with zpizza since moving to the valley almost a year ago.  I like the idea of a healthier alternative to pizza and the salads are also delicious.  The combo with a slice, salad and drink is a great deal and I've eaten there many times for lunch or dinner.  I've always found the pizza to be OK...not great,  but just above mediocre and with the good price and great salad, I've found it to be a good option.  It's also nice that it's (usually) fast, so you can eat there in 30-40 minutes if you choose a pizza slice that's already prepared in the case by the front.  This was the driving force to my husband & I choosing to eat there recently.  We had an hour to get to a theatre show and needed dinner.  zpizza was on the way, so we decided to try it.  There wasn't a line to order and the dine-in area wasn't very crowded.  We both ordered the salad/slice combo.  While ordering, a 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 something else pizza was placed in the case.  I asked if the pepperoni slices were available (as they weren't on the sign) and the cashier said yes.  We both ordered pepperoni slices and paid and sat down to wait.  And wait we did....salads took a bit longer than usual and when they brought my husband's it was covered in dressing although he had specifically ordered it dry.  I think the guy expected him to be OK with it and eat it anyway, but he really doesn't like dressing.  He sent it back and had to wait again.  After finishing our salads, still NO PIZZA.  I went up to ask what was taking so long to heat up 2 slices, and was told that the pepperoni was not available so they were making a new pie.  I told them we picked it b/c it was already made and we were in a hurry, and they were now telling me 10 MORE minutes for the pepperoni.  I asked to switch our slices to the Napoli which was in the case, which they did.  They heated those up and served them with an apology, but a rather apathetic one.  Unfortunately, those slices didn't taste great, but we choked them down and ran out the door to be barely on time for the show.  I just don't understand why they couldn't have told me the slices in the case weren't available and that there would be a 25 minute wait.  At that point, we could've ordered a whole pizza or chosen a different place to eat.  Also, the employees all seem a little bit snobbish and don't seem to care a bit about customer service.  I think I'll be taking my pizza business elsewhere in the valley, which is unfortunate b/c zpizza is so close by."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 times from that place and got lazy service, late delivery and cold pizza and I do not recommend that place"}
{"text":"eh.  bad service.  One night my family and I went in about 40 mins until closing, and boy did they look UNHAPPY! Seriously though..40 mins til closing time and they couldn't muster up a semi-sincere greeting. Whatever.   I can't even remember the pizza."}
{"text":"Delivery is slow.  The delivery people NEVER offer or LEAVE pepper flakes or cheese.  In the case of wings they deprive you of any blue cheese or ranch sauce.  They are consistent in these omissions.  Must be a cost saving strategy....sucks"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked into zpizza less than one hour before they closed. We were greeted friendly at the door and warmly welcomed. We did not feel rushed, and were even encouraged to stay past closing to relax enjoy our meal. If our meter wasn't running out, we definitely would have stayed! They had a nice beer and wine selection on tap that is self-serve. The prices was very reasonable. We only eat gluten-free pizza, so we ordered that and it was awesome! I would even venture to say probably the best gluten-free pizza I've ever had. They had multiple size options which is rare for gluten-free. Thy also had a wide variety of toppings to choose from, and they were very fresh. Highly recommend checking out zpizza!"}
{"text":"I am disappointed in Zpizza. It used to be my favorite but the staff might have changed ( i usually order by phone). The last 3 times ( yeah...that's how much i eat there) have been not so great experiences. They have not been their pleasant selves over the phone. The lady who answers is almost always off put and the gentleman with the older sounding voice is not very helpful. How hard is it to take an order you ask? Well, apparently pretty difficult.   More customer service, less bad attitude I say. Don't treat me like a second class citizen over the phone. Just saying. Pizza Heaven for me from now on. Not to mention their delivery is VERY FAST. And the guy who answers the phone at Pizza Heaven actually seems to ENJOY his job :) What a concept   Ciao Zpizza. Our relationship is overrrrrr..  Although I must add, the delivery guys at Zpizza are super cool dudes"}
{"text":"I was at work, trapped behind the bar, and we were all out of snack chips...Staaarvving!  I really didn't want to order close to $20 worth of food to get delivered, but as I perused our folder full of menus that had delivery service, I started to salivate when I started reading the Z Pizza menu. It's a very colorful, attractive menu, and had a bright yellow sticker that said \"free delivery\" (as opposed to Mamma Mia, whom I love, but $2 delivery and $10 minimum, well, anyway, I'm digressing).  What to get, what to get, it sucks when you're just that hungry and all these pretty combinations of toppings jump out at you saying, 'pick me,' Little tomatoes with white gloves were high kicking like Rockettes with their arms linked with Mr. Mozzarella and his top hat and monocle. Wait, that was Mr. Peanut, anyway...So I decided on the Provence, which was described as having artichokes, tomatoes, capers and garlic sauce, in addition to the mozzarella and regular tomato sauce. I love me some capers.  It seemed a queer combination, but I love all these ingredients and was eager to have a little adventure. I called in my order, and the girl on the phone recognized me from the bar, and we chatted about the pizza, decided I should have a little truffle oil thrown on there as well. What arrived, still hot, and perfectly baked, was one of the tastiest pizzas I've had delivered in a while. The crust was so crunchy and the truffle oil had soaked into it, so it was like its own separate hors d'ouevre after I made my way to what I would normally call the pizza butt.  The toppings were tasty, fresh, and the combination was truly a treat. I don't know about the garlic sauce, it was a bit too much, but maybe in a lesser quantity the flavor would have melded and not been so obtrusive. I was a happy Kitty, and the next day, it reheated like a champ for a little lunch revisited. Good stuff, that Z Pizza. Oh, and my favorite was the little Kitty face drawn on the side of the box next to my phone number.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"I really want to give ZPizza 4 stars, but it's just not a 4-star pizzeria. Their veggie pizza is the best out of any 'delivery' I've had but doesn't rival Cibo or even Sauce.    The upside: Good veggie/vegan options. - You can opt for the whole wheat crust for no extra charge (the gluten-free crust is a $3-4 upcharge).  -Their California Veggie and Moroccan eggplant pesto pizza are divine.  -There's an ice cream parlor next door. - Their iced tea isn't awful.  The downside:  THE SERVICE. - We always order and pick up -- and are consistently on hold for more than 5 minutes, often times having to call back because they hung up.  - There are a few people working at this location who clearly hate their jobs. Their attitude and manner is really unpleasant to be around. I get it, you work at a pizza place and you're not that happy... but WHY take it out on the customers?   I came in the other night and watched a guy stand in line in front of me for about 8 minutes (he was already there when I arrived), while the girl at the front was on the phone. There's another register.. yet no one came up to help him. He ordered slices and by the time I told them what I was picking up, added a slice and got my drinks, he was STILL waiting. This poor guy waited 20 minutes just to get 2 slices of pizza that was already premade and in the case! That's just careless service."}
{"text":"Good food and a fresh salad!  However, what stood out was the manager who went above and beyond when I told him I had an interview after lunch.  Wearing a white dress shirt he brought me an apron so I wouldn't get pizza on my shirt.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would. First, the girl that answered had to be around my age. So early 20's. She was rude and didn't seem to pay attention or care. I was told 45minutes to an hour for delivery. An hour and a half later I call to politely ask where my order is and I was met again with attitude and disinterest. My order shows up as I am on the phone. The man on the phone asks if I can give my phone to the driver. The driver was rude as well but was instructed to give me half off my $25 single pizza. I appreciated the attempt and felt bad at sending him away as he was already here. I paid (as well as tipped the driver) and he rolled his eyes and walked away. I open the box to find not only was my half onion have olive pizza incorrect but it was cold, hard, and tasteless. I've worked in customer service for years and have never treated a customer the way I've been treated despite my polite attitude. Super disappointed. Will never be a customer again."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the prompt, on time delivery to our hotel, Hyatt Regency. We were not fond of the thin, tasteless, microwave like pizza for $20 (2 toppings on medium size). The pizza probably would have tasted better in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had an hour to grab lunch during a training, and we ended up here. Napoli pizza was decent, and the ZBQ salad was tasty, but the price was a little ridiculous for the amount of food.  Having a time limit was also a little tough, since it took forever for the salad! Yeah, the pizza was ready to go within a few minutes, but then spent another 10 minutes waiting, and in everyone's way! Outside seating was perfect for the day and provided room for everyone."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and great choices.  I love the ZBQ and arugula salad.  Love that they offer beer inside, but I would like to see some good micro brew rotations and a happy hour to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Here's a nice story for you. I've ordered pizzas online through zpizza in the past, so they had my contact information. They sent me an email containing a coupon for one free pizza on my birthday, which was coming up shortly. I went in to redeem my coupon later on a weeknight. One of the two employees working at the time told me that since the coupon came from their corporate office in California, I would have to go there to receive my free pizza. What a jackass. He was a young, hipster-looking guy. Pretty sure he was wearing a backwards baseball cap.  LOCATION: Only good thing about the place, it's downtown. Good atmosphere. PRICE: Too high for everything. Pizza's expensive, beer's expensive. SERVICE: Did you read my story above? Every other employee has been pleasant, but this guy really made me angry.   I cannot recommend zpizza because of the terrible experience I had there. I steer all of my friends away from this place. Better experience at Brooklyn's NYC Pizza or the new place that just opened up, I forget the name. Both are located a couple blocks from zpizza at 2nd Street and Washington."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the pizza here and the staff is awesome. I've tried the wings as well and they are pretty good. I haven't tried anything else but I'd expect the other things on the menu to be of the same quality. Could be a bit cheaper, but you get what you pay for, right? They do have some weekly coupons if you sign up for their email list."}
{"text":"We used the online ordering system, and our pizzas took FOREVER. Ordered at 7:15pm, and they weren't delivered until 9:30pm. The online system gave a 30 minute estimate, and when we called the restaurant, the guy on the phone said the order would be delivered any minute... 2 hours later, still no pizza. Our hotel was two blocks away, and our order wasn't hugely overwhelming--2 pizzas and a salad. When we finally got our food, it was nothing special. Maybe one or two steps up from Pizza Hut?"}
{"text":"Some things good. Some things not-so-good. Overall I'm actually a fan of Z Pizza.   Please DO NOT go to Z Pizza if you seek authentic NY style Pizza. That would be silly. Did you really expect a big Italian guy named Vinnie to toss you up a pie at a California style healthy pizza joint? If so, get real!  Please DO go to Z Pizza if you would like \"pizza style\" pizza with cool ingredients like fresh artichokes or zucchini. I also love the wheat crust or soy cheese options. Plus, they deliver to my house so fuck yeah for that.  The Yuppie Veggie sandwich is SICK in a good way. It's really good! Please stay away from the tuna salad. Yukers. Somehow it was soggy.  The service has always been pretty good although food can take a little while. Good effort!"}
{"text":"Zpizza is so good! I order on-line because I work downtown in an office and don't get to leave my desk often. They have a 10.00 minimum charge which I think is pretty normal and standard. Their pizza is so delicious! Crust is soft and flavorful and they put lots of cheese and ingredients! If you order on-line you can make special comments or tell them exactly how you want your order and they make it accordingly. Very good! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The best vegan pizza in Phoenix! The Tuscan Mushroom one too was amazeballs!   It was perfect after we did the wine walk and was a bit tipsy! I'm still dreaming of those two pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great food! Delicious fresh pizza. Service a little slow. I knocked off a star because they don't recycle. That was a big surprise for a restaurant with organic food."}
{"text":"This place always has great service and the food is good. I do think the salads are a bit pricey for what you get but you can't go wrong with the pizza. The lunch specials for the pizza are a great deal although if you go at the end of lunch hour the pizza might have been sitting there for a bit. Overall a good place for lunch and the people are super friendly."}
{"text":"Acceptable pie, with some out of the ordinary crusts/toppings (eggplant, truffle oil) for a fast casual place. A little on the pricier side of pizzas. I might try the vegan cheese/crust/toppings next time.   Two tips for the reader: -   They were not aware of the yelp check in system, but they gave me a free slice anyway  - It took almost 20 mins to get a small pizza and an order of wings out. There was one other customer in to place, but it seemed like they had several call in orders."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I held back on the 5th star before.  We've had consistently good service and the pizza is always delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent...not spectacular. We ordered a large and two sodas and the total came to $25. I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local pizza places! I love the vegan options! Pro tip: log in and order online for specials and occasionally I'll get coupons and a birthday offer in my email because I signed up. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Order was wrong and service was terrible.  Was told there was no manager working when I tried to confront the issues. Staff was unwilling and ignorant."}
{"text":"When i lived in phoenix. We came here all the time well at least once a week but usually more.. This location as well as the down town location. We generally got take away from Thomas location only because seating always seemed cramped and stifling. How ever we did enjoy dinning in at Zpizza down town. The pizza from both locations always was delicious. We loved the fact the zpizza offers whole grain. Very few if any pizza places do. Also we appreciate that they use  high quality ingredents. I only wish Zpizza were here. So i could enjoy their yummy pizza again."}
{"text":"The best pizza and service, hands down.  Stopped in for a quick bite Togo, just before closing. We were greeted and assisted immediately with a \"happy to help\" attitude (regardless the late hour). The girl at the counter was genuine and friendly, offering personal suggestions and awesome service. Our sever was fantastic!  The pizza was so vey fresh and delicious.   It was refreshing to receive great service and not be rushed out. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Never again.  I used to be a big fan of Z Pizza but stopped going for about a year.  Decided to order a pizza last night and we were told it would take an hour, but it actually took closer to two hours.  When it arrived, the pizza was lukewarm and tasted very bland with stale/dry/hard crust.  The breadsticks were also hard and stale.  I had to douse everything in hot sauce and ranch dressing to make it edible.   The man who answered the phone was annoyed that we called to complain about our pizza being nearly an hour late, but offered to give us 30% off our next order.  Will not be taking him up on the offer."}
{"text":"Sit down and grab a slice anytime! Love the rich, mouth watering taist of all their pies!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We live right next door at The Orpheum and hadn't really been there since the new owners took over. Went Friday night because we heard the most beautiful music on the patio. The manager and owner bought us a round of beer to welcome us...their next door neighbors. We got to bring our dog to sit on the patio with us while we ate the best pizza... vegan... I might add. But don't worry all the other pizzas have meat and cheese and smelled so good I could see cheating once in awhile. Not only was the food and drinks and music fantastic but we met great people on the patio as well. It's our new Friday night hangout!"}
{"text":"I only had the Berkeley Veggie pie and it was very tasty. I personally enjoy pizza about as much as I love love love sushi, so this place gets my thumbs up. Not a heavy pizza (granted we shared a small pie), and the service is very friendly. The price is pretty good because you truly get what you pay for. I would come back in a heart beat. And it's right next to Harumi Sushi which I love!"}
{"text":"I love this place. When I go to Phoenix for work I always stop in for a late night dinner. Open late and the quality is high all the way until closing time. Great selection of drinks to go."}
{"text":"The pizza was crisp and delicious. The place is super casual and very comfortable. The staff is down-to-earth and friendly.  I loved the live music from Tom Mein on the patio. It felt great to be able to sit on the patio and enjoy a downtown Phoenix sunset in the spring.  Having beer and wine for sale was nice as well. I will be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"For the downtown area this is an under rated option for food and cheap drinks on the weekends.  Live music and a nice patio adds to he ambiance.  Great option for those looking to relax and have a great time"}
{"text":"The 3 of us were all very disappointed with our experience. The counter food & drink ordering, wristbands, open tab, non-intuitive electronic drink tap pouring, return to close your tab, getting our own glasses, pouring our own drinks, all the while 6 employees were standing behind the counter - doing nothing, was a bit weird and frustrating for us. We had to ask way too many questions how their process works, that you don't have to ask at other restaurants. We did virtually all of their work, and the bill has a tip line?!?! Oy! Now, let's discuss the food. We didn't order the pizza...We got sandwiches. They were ok...practically no meat or cheese, as compared to competitors! The bread was the only good point. BEWARE: Each sandwich half has hidden toothpicks that none of us could see, that we almost broke our teeth on, and nearly stabbed our mouths with. DANGEROUS. The sandwiches were so dry, I ask for a side of mayo. The counter staff was in such as pot-high daze, it took several minutes to find mayo, only after they gave me another mysterious substance that looked and tasted nothing like mayo. There were 3 or 4 unlabeled squeeze bottles with white stuff in them. (Isn't it a health code that all containers be labeled??) We will never darken their doorstep again."}
{"text":"Don't feel like the normal Pizza Hut or Papa John's but still want something just as good?  Order Z Pizza.  The Pizza will always be good, the only down side they have is that the price is high."}
{"text":"We ordered Chicken Alfredo delivery.  Yuck it was terrible!!!  I added mushrooms, onion, garlic and Parmesan cheese and still it's inedible!  Don't order this!  We had pizza from Z's that was good, this, however, was not!"}
{"text":"I don't see a single \"negative\" review.  zPizza is the best gluten-free option in the Phoenix metro area!! It's a small family owned business in the heart of Central Phoenix. If you don't live close, come anyway. The food and service is worth the drive! While you're there, try a dessert at the Pink Spot next door. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Moroccan is in my top 5 favorite pizzas in the nation. And now that they have the self-pour wine and beer system, I'm in heaven. No more committing to a full glass of something you might find dreadful. Here you can try as little or as much of 16 beers and 4 wines as you like! The happy hour is fantastic too, especially since it's all day on weekends. If they had a location in Scottsdale I'd eat here every week!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to review this because so many people have already and most everyone says the same thing... awesome pizza.   I miss working so close to here. The lunch rush is a rush but you get in, you get out. And everyday is different, I can try all their different types of pizza. Personal faves: Sante Fe and Napoli pizza and the chicken pesto pasta.   While the pizza speaks for itself, I do have to give zPizza props for having the best specials.  Cheap daily specials, slice of pizza and a drink (or beer) for about $6, buy one get one for $5 on Tuesdays and of course, the frequent eater reward.   I like a place that offers great food and even more reason to come back."}
{"text":"I went here over 2 years ago on a date. My now fiance took me here on one of our first dates and I had pepperoni and it was amazing, but for some reason we never went back until last light. I am now attempting to be vegan (or just have a more plant based diet) and I tried their berkeley vegan pizza. I ordered it in small (personal pizza) and it was very delicious. You get a lot of veggies for the price you pay ($11) and it was vegan meat crumbles. I am very happy because I love pizza and now i don't have to say good bye to pizza, this is a very delicious substitution over the real thing."}
{"text":"Z Pizza wasn't quite my favorite pizza place in Phoenix, but for delivery, it was the best option for me since I had a ridiculous amount of vegan/vegetarian/allergic to everything friends...It's a California chain, but I don't think many people know that. As Lola M. mentioned, there aren't very many parking spots and the \"vegan\" cheeze here...might not be entirely vegan. Don't quote me on that though! The only selling points for me were the fact that it was close to my apartment, a friend of mine was the delivery guy, and it catered to those who had gluten and veg issues. My order: Gluten-free crust, Chipotle sauce, soy cheeze, mushrooms, basil, and avocado. It can get pretty pricey, but if you've got dietary woes, then you're probably used to paying a little more."}
{"text":"I (and co-workers; friends) have eaten here so many times over the last 6 years that it's about time that I write a review. Everything I've had here is great; I highly recommend the California salad, add chicken; balsamic dressing.  But every pizza I've had here is great too (a rotating selection), as is the Caesar.  I've also had a sandwich now and again and can't complain. Every once in a while the pizza has been sitting there a little while and is a little dry, but that's pretty rare, especially given the number of times I've eaten there. And hey, every 20 times you get a free pizza - can't beat that. (OK, 20 times seems a little high...)"}
{"text":"Meh. This place is alright. I always say even the worst pizza is still good pizza because well, it's pizza.   This place was alright. I ended up getting the thai pizza. The flavour wasn't bad, it seemed fresh. The only thing i really have to complain about is the service. The manager working the counter was extremely rude and treated his employees terribly in front of me. Also, my pizza crust was charred, like black. I hadn't noticed that until I had got to the drive in theater where we were taking our pizzas and couldn't do much since we were all starving by that time. Definitely would be into trying a different pizza place next time i'm in in phoenix."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the downtown crowd that isn't greasy! High quality pizza - love it!"}
{"text":"Zeeelicious!   There's nothing better than good pizza and Z sure does deliver!  Thin crust.  The type of thin that's still chewy.  None of that cracker-like, might-be-a cheese crisp kind of crust.  They've mastered the ideal pie base!  Appropriate amount of cheese.  Organic ingredients. Gluten-free options.  But the 'ZBQ' was the choice for me: BBQ sauce, chicken w/ roasted red peppers, red onion, tomatoes, cilantro and sweet corn! Definitely a taste bud tantalizer, plus this joint threw in a generous handful of red pepper flakes and parmesan sans my request!  That right there is worth a little extra doe, via tip.  Also, they've got quite a few original topping combos too: curry chicken & yam w/ mango chutney.  That'll be my next pizza splurge!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was not impressed with my pizza from Z's yesterday. I stopped in to grab two slices to go and I could not eat very much. I have had their pizza vefore at their Metro Center location and liked it but yesterday it was salty and greasy and just plain yucky. $6.00 seemed a bit pricey for two slices of cheese too!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Delivery took an hour and a half.   The pizza was yummy.   Very disappointed in the Antipasto Salad. It was supposed to have heirloom tomatoes, came with regular. Did not have any onions either."}
{"text":"Just an update real quick. I did email ZPizza about my experience yesterday... They have already responded and stated they would be speaking to the manager at the Scottsdale store about my experience & about the rude delivery driver. I was also asked for my mailing address for some certificates to make up for the service, which I told him I'd be more than happy to use... As long as I can use them at a different location.  I have to admit that made me a lot less angry about the whole situation because they didn't have to do that... So that DOES say something for the company in that they actually care about customers being happy enough to return for them. I thanked him and told him that their pizza really is the best. Bumped it up a star (for this location) due to the company being sympathetic to my disappointing evening."}
{"text":"I love this place and often stop by for the Tuesday upgrade special. Today I called in for pickup as I usually do and my order was confirmed over the phone. I get the same thing every time and they usually just use order history to confirm. When I went to pick up my order I noticed it was much smaller than normal after paying. The super nice guy at the register apologized and asked the guy making food in a hat and with glasses how long it would take to remake it correctly. He obviously heard him but completely ignored him. He asked again 2-3 more times and nothing. Finally the guy in hat and glasses (Jeremy maybe) grabbed the ticket out of the other guy's hand and just started making the pizza over again. I tried to interject and say I didn't have time to wait I just wanted the difference or a cookie or something. The guy at the register was again super nice and I apologized to him for having to deal with the other a-hole in the back. Not only did this guy mess up the order but was as rude as he could have been right in front of anyone viewing. He should be terminated and never be allowed to treat people that way or represent your establishment again"}
{"text":"Probably the worst pizza I have ever ate. The prices were alright until you find out you were better off going to little Caesars. The \"buffalo\" wings had no buffalo sauce aside from one wing and they were rubbery and had no flavor. The pizza I had requested be made fresh but that would not cure the cardboard tasting pizza with what tasted like old ingredients. By far the worst $22 I ever spent on pizza. Another over rated disgusting downtown pizza place."}
{"text":"5 bucks for a slice of pepperoni. Get over yourselves. It tasted bland and boring, I'm glad I only bought one."}
{"text":"My partner and I have something of a special needs diet and we're always missing pizza! Well, these guys said they had what we needed, and boy did they deliver! The pizza arrived hot and delicious, full of tasty ingredients like roasted veggies and perfectly melted Daiya cheese. If I found myself living in Phoenix, I'd probably be here every week.   My only complaint is that the delivery said it would take 30 minutes, but in reality it took a full hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in downtown Phoenix.  The pizza is amazing (even gluten free), the wings are right up there with the best wings I've had in the valley, and the self-pour drinks make drinking that much more fun.  The manager is also one of the most accommodating people I I've ever met.  Definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great, healthy pizza.   Zpizza has a ton of great, fresh ingredients to choose from. A lot of the sauces and toppings are organic too! Additionally the wheat crust is amazing! Oh and to top it off; they deliver.Can't beat that.   My favorite pizza here is Casablanca. I could eat entire one by myself and I am not ashamed of that. Hahaha...  It is a great place in my neighborhood when you want good pizza delivered to your home. Sometimes, you just want to stay in and enjoy comfort of your home in a company of good pizza.   Cuztomer service is grean and place is really neat if you prefer to get out there and eat!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery. Gave them the order and the credit card information. They call back and say we are out of the delivery area. What is your delivery area I ask because you delivered here the last time we ordered. His answer was 5 miles. Oh according to Google Maps we are 3.7 miles from door to door. Oh well.... he said we are not going to be delivering your pizza with his ever so snippy voice. Now that's great customer service and rudeness to boot. I guess they think they are the only pizza joint around. What changed between this order and the last is beyond me. Do your self a favor........go else where. Federal pizza is closer and has way better pizza, but now I have to go get it. Oh well Z Pizza will never see a dime of my business again. There is no need for rudeness."}
{"text":"Midday parking at this place is seriously a joke, but such is the case with a lot of swank midtown lunch spots.   Pizza was great, my East Coast hailing girlfriend gave it a thumbs up, which for an AZ pizza place is a huge kudos. We came to check out both this and the adjoining Pink Spot Coffee and Ice cream. We ate on the ice cream side, so I can't comment much on the decor of the Z Pizza side.   Good ingredients, not the usual suspects, so that is a change. I will pay for good quality pizza, so the price was in line for the quality of the food.  It did a ton of lunch business but was efficient and the staff was smiling and not hating their life, which is always pleasant ."}
{"text":"I considered giving Z Pizza one star but I thought I would be more generous than one of the staff members was to me.   In New Times there used to be a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  I saved my coupon as it did not have an expiration date.  One day I sauntered into Z Pizza and presented my coupon and ordered a soda to go along with the pizza.  I was told by the clerk that I could not use the coupon because \"too many homeless people\" were using the coupon and they no longer honor the coupon.  I am not homeless nor do I \"look\" homeless.  Instead I was told I could order a special that included two slices of pizza and a soda.  I won't ever forget the woman behind the counter who so coldly denied me my slice of pizza.  I promised myself that I would never return.  Few months later...  I thought to myself \"Self, you should really give Z Pizza another try.  Maybe it was just a bad day.\"  I called Z Pizza and asked for a delivery of a half soy and half regular cheese pizza.  In the past when I had ordered such a pizza, someone from Z Pizza was kind enough to mark which side was soy and which side was regular.  I thought the same would happen. I was wrong.  I received the pizza with no indication as to which side was soy and which side wasn't.  I called Z Pizza and asked about their soy cheese pizzas without telling them my predicament.  I was told \"Our soy cheese pizzas are so good you can't tell the difference between regular and soy cheese.\"  I proceeded to explain that in this case, I needed to know the difference and asked why it wasn't marked.  The woman on the phone asked \"How are we suppposed to do that?\"  I stated that in the past the soy side of the pizza was marked by a white piece of plastic that served as both to keep the pizza box from caving in on the pizza and it also served to indicate which side was soy.    I asked to speak with a manager after I realized I was getting nowhere with the woman on the phone.  She told me I would need to call the following day if I wanted to speak with someone in charge.  I then asked them to send me a small pizza with only soy cheese as a replacement at no charge.  I was told that they would call me back once they got the ok to make me another pizza.  They called me back and stated they would give me a small soy pizza but that it was on the bottom of their delivery list and insinuated that it was not a priority.  It took another hour for them to deliver the small, soy pizza.  Customer service at its finest?  I think not.  Not only did I have to think for them and offer my own form of compensation for their inadequacy but it was the second time that I had been treated in poor manner.    Save your money.   Come to think of it, I think I give Z Pizza just one star.  I will not bother ordering from Z Pizza ever again."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with a few co-workers, and really enjoyed it. Apparently this place is a chain (I had no idea) and they have locations in SoCal, but I've never been; maybe I'll have to pay them a visit once I get back home.  The restaurant itself is a fast-food-ish feeling place with a decent amount of seating. I ordered the 1-slice + salad combo (cheese pizza, caesar salad), and was pleased to find the slices were nice and big and the salad was also pretty good-sized...I hate it when restaurants skimp on their lunch portions. I enjoyed both the salad and the pizza -- I'm not about to claim that they were the best I've ever had, but they were tasty and filled me up, so I'm a happy camper. They also have some other interesting pizzas, such as the Tuscan, Greek, Santa Fe, Thai, etc...the ones they had on-hand today didn't thrill me, but I'd like to go back again and try one of their more unusual-flavored pizzas.  Also, I love the fact that they have their nutrition facts on their website, AND as it turns out, their pizzas/salads aren't terribly high in calories/fat/etc. That is thrilling for me. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was down in the so-called downtown Phoenix looking for lunch and came across this chain. Did anyone notice how pathetic downtown PHX really is compared to other real cities? Well, the display case at this location is really pathetic and you cannot see any of the pizzas clearly. It looks like a display case you find in a mall. The slices are cut small, but at least they are real slices and not made secret in the back. The specialty slices did not look appetizing at least at 2:30pm on a weekday, but the cheese looked average and that's what it was, pretty average pizza, no oregano in the sauce and a crust that is not to die for, more cracker-like. I think I got two slices and a bottle of soda for 7 bucks. Not the greatest pizza, but good enough for a quick, but forgettable lunch."}
{"text":"Usually, when a storefront or restaurant has signage that it is \"Under New Management\" I run.  However, a growling stomach and a few minutes to kill before an appointment next door, I decided to try Z Pizza.  When I walked in the door, I saw a turn table, of sorts, with several pizza's in it, and was even more wary. I looked at the menu, and decided to order a couple of slices of pepperoni, and a drink.  Guess what? It was REALLY GOOD PIZZA!  The crust was super thin (which I love) and the cheese gooey and yummy!  There wasn't a lot of grease oozing from the slices, and the flavor was downright fabulous!  This place as \"healthy\" pizza (ordinarily, another red flag for me...I don't want healthy pizza!) in that their sauce is organic, and they use gluten-free whatever-it-is in their crust.  I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"I have officially found my new favorite pizza place in this world.  I'm not huge on pizza most of the time because my stomach doesnt handle all the grease very well, so when I'm handed a pizza thats loaded with toppings and cheese and doesn't come out with that extra 10 pounds of dripping lard on top, I'm a thoroughly pleased little camper.    With multiple locations and online ordering, tons of topping, cheeses, bread and sauce options, this place makes it easy to get a good pie.  Its good to know beforehand that this is not a New York style pizza joint, but more of your artsy eclectic CPK type with fresh flavorful toppings and out-of-the-box combinations.  Gotta haves are the carmelized onions and the sun dried tomatoes, and the feta on top was really good too.  In my opinion, this is as close to perfection as it comes with this style of pizza. They are little on the pricey side, but it was well worth it.  I will be going back here for sure, this time getting a large instead of medium to have more cold pizza leftover awesomeness for later!"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza and wings and could have ordered from any pizza delivery place but I thought... Why not... Go one up  and get delivery from here.... I ordered wings and pepperoni pizza.... When they got here (65) mins later.... The bag that the wings were in  were translucent... Drenched in  oil.... I said \"what is this!?\" The driver said oh I must not have closed the bag enough \" when I opened the wings up.. They were soggy, covered in  oil to the brim \" and freaking disgusting!!!!!!   I'm so mad I paid $10 for these.   Also, the pizza was oily and disgusting too! They must have put about thirty pepperoni on a small pizza.. Which left it beyond soggy.   I'm mad because I never had nastier tasking and looking food than this."}
{"text":"Very good food! Great service! I recommend the California salad! Their new wings are amazing! I order delivery from here all the time, and they're super fast! It's gluten free pizza, almost guilt free pizza"}
{"text":"Always friendly, always clean, always fresh, always quick, always delicious. I go here for lunch all the time.  Especially when I crave the yummy pizza creations or the greek salad or even when I'm not sure where I want to go - I know I'll always find something I like. There are always a good choice of pizzas to get a slice from (meat and not-meat varieties) and plenty of choices for your own pie.  My favorites are the Greek pizza, the Napoli, and the one with eggplant and pine nuts.  Yum!  The new appetizer with hummus and pita is also delicious!    I like that you can get the salad and a slice lunch combo, and upgrade to a specialty salad for just a dollar more.  For a while there, I was always getting the Greek pizza and a Greek Salad.  One time, the guy at the register asked my name and when I told him he said, \"That's right, I remember now.  I knew you were the \"Greek girl,\" but I couldn't remember your name.\"  That's when I decided it was time to change up the order. =)  P.S. Go on \"Two for Tuesday\" when you can get two pizzas for the price of one (not slices) or just one for half price!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this pizza place while walking around downtown waiting for The Australian Pink Floyd show (BTW-they're amazing) to start. We were intrigued by the Organic tomato sauce sign & the fact that they had wheat dough. It was an absolute a delight! The thin pizza crust was great & the choices for interesting pizzas/toppings makes it a fun experiment & treat! The topper to the experience is that they had some (only a few, but) good choices of beer on tap & offered a great deal on ordering a pitcher vs an individual glass! It was exactly what we were looking for when we ventured out to find something new & tasty!! Only wish we lived closer :("}
{"text":"sooo good! all organic ingredients and it tastes absolutely amazing. A little pricey but well worth good pizza!"}
{"text":"My colleague and I went here for lunch.  I've had their 2 pizza combo before and it was good.  This time I ordered the meatball sub and my buddy ordered the calzone.   Forget about it!  I mean really, I wish I could forget about this visit!  First my meatball sub was lousy.  Maybe I'm comparing it too much to ANY place back east, but this sandwich was weak on the meatballs, weak on the sauce and weak on taste.   My buddy's calzone came out ice cold.  When he sent it back, they were really confused why and didn't know what to do.  So they put it back in the oven.  When it was ready, they put a thermometer in it and then displayed it to him.  How the heck is he suppose to know what temperature it should be?!  To top it off, it didn't look or taste like anything special.  Plus in another indication that they don't know how to serve anything other than \"gourmet\" pizza, the side of marinara sauce he got was ICE COLD.    Service was VERY slow and the staff was not very helpful or knowledgeable.    Stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"I went to Z PIzza out of convenience. It is within walking distance from the ER and the person who was in the ER was irrationally hungry. At 6:30 on Sunday night I walked to Z Pizza to get 4 slices of pizza because it was faster than ordering a full pizza. The slices were awful. They were old. They cost $13. They were only barely warmed in the pizza oven.   If you don't see the pizzas come out of the oven then don't expect them to be good. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"The crust here is the worse, tastes like dirt. The staff is lazy and meh and the wife of the owner writes people on yelp if she gets a bad review being very hateful, instead of changing the tastes of food and hiring older experienced staff. Pizza is pretty gross"}
{"text":"I ate here thinking it was a normal pizza by the slice place. I ordered pepperoni thinking that was a safe choice. The pizza was MEHHHHHH... but for $8 it was alright. Barro's is still better pizza by the slice...  THE BEST PART of this joint is the lady who took my order looked like she hated her life and you could see it in her mannerisms."}
{"text":"2 slices of pizza and a blue moon for 9 bucks?  yeah. the other slice is in my frig.. finished the first slice before the blue moon. that says a lot. i just don't know what."}
{"text":"All organic fresh whole wheat pizza. Kinda on the pricey side for a vegan pizza but pretty delicious !"}
{"text":"Hard to find.  Great service. Dip was good pizza was slightly undercooked.  Cool self serve beer taps."}
{"text":"There was a bone in my meatball after they burned my sub the first go around. When I brought this up to the manager he said \" well we do not make the meatballs here, they come in pre-made\". I did not receive an apology or any effort to make it right, or keep us as a customer. We will not be going there again.  It is sad as Z Pizza looks great from the outside, however the food is average at best, barring any foreign items in your meal, and the service is unorganized, and lacking any courtesy."}
{"text":"I love the ZBQ and on Tuesdays they have a special - buy one pizza at full price and get a second pizza for only $5. You can save about $15 on your second pizza with the special - it's quite the savings! Don't expect super friendly customer service here, you won't get it."}
{"text":"Overpriced, boring and dry! Need I say more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Moroccan pizza, delicious flavors!  They have a fun variety to choose from and they threw in some extra pieces of pizza for my friend because we arrived close to their closing time."}
{"text":"Good service, casual atmosphere, pizza was pretty good."}
{"text":"Cool pizza, cool place.   The best thing about this place? It's open on weekends and it's open for dinner, so for that reason it has a special place in my heart.  That being said, the pizza's not very good. The sanwiches and pastas are pretty good, but then again, myabe I'm trying to find something nice to say about this place because, did I mention? It's open late and on weekends!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot with well-priced pizza. I have never tried their pasta or salads, but those look good as well. I like that they are housed right next door to the Pink Spot, with an open breezeway connecting the two restaurants. This promotes a friendly, neighborhood-y community feel. We have ordered delivery from them before, and their artisan pizzas are way better than your typical Domino's or Pizza Hut. But I would actually advise to just eat in-store, because the delivery pizza was a little cold. Overall, a great place with a friendly vibe & lots of good healthy options!"}
{"text":"I think it's amazing that you can get a vegan calzone, pizza, or sandwich here! The vegan sausage was so convincing I was almost nervous that they accidentally used real sausage!   I'd recommend straying away from the wheat crust. It's got that subway bread smell. For $10 the calzone was larger than my face! I'll certainly be back to try it with the regular crust. The marinara itself was delicious and you can add a copious amount of vegetables without the extra cost.   Do: cheat on your diet and get regular crust Don't: be \"healthy\" and get the wheat option  One thing to note is that this is your average pizza place. It's nothing fancy but sometimes you need a good old fashioned slice of pizza. I used their check in offer on yelp to get a free slice."}
{"text":"Not my kind of pizza.  I found out after I ate that this is an all natural, organic type of pizza place.  It did tast very fresh, fresh tomatoes and toppings but I like more garlic, oregano, a little more zip in flavor on my pizza.  This was more california (as advertised, I found out later) and I like chicago style so not a good mix.    If you like organic, I bet this is all you so don't let me steer you away."}
{"text":"It is the best pizza.   Great for all types of people.   Vegans, vegetarians, gluten free and all natural.   My daughter got my husband and I hooked a few years ago and now I can say is the only pizza place that we'll go to."}
{"text":"Pouring your own drinks was a lot of fun! The quality of the ingredients is phenomenal. We had the pear/Gorgonzola salad, California salad, Thai peanut wings and the garlic chicken pizza. All of it was excellent. We will be going back and taking our friends. Pretty good selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"This place is okay for the price. The pizzas taste a lot like back home in Chicago. Love that they have gluten free and more green options. They are nice people and the service is pretty great, which earns most of its ratings.  Pizzas are kind of expensive, though. Their salads aren't really all that special.  Also, figuring out their menu online is impossible. You have to sign up just to look at it, and honestly I don't need any more emails about anything in my inbox.  I also have spent at least $5 on a meal at least a dozen times, and I haven't forgotten about giving them my phone number but my points towards a free pizza don't add up. I wish this was somehow fixed because I feel I would be close to some free pizza, but alas I will likely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Yet another place I only choose when at work, having either forgotten or been too lazy or rushed to bring in my own dinner, and want something delivered instead of going out.  Happily, I don't special order anything - and my last couple orders have been the pear and gorgonzola rustica pizza. It's tasty. It's fresh, and it's filling. I think it's overpriced for what it is, but we don't have that many decent delivery options, so I'll deal with it.  I attempted the hummus once. Small portion, way too runny and completely lacking in flavor.  The special orders seem to be an issue. A coworker ordered the turkey sandwich and asked them to hold the tomato. That apparently was translated to hold the cranberry sauce, too. Pity - she really likes the cran. In fact - anytime any of us have asked for any \"special\" handling of our meals, there has been an error.  So - I'll stick with my pear and gorgonzola when the decision to order Z Pizza is made - and hope it continues to be A-OK."}
{"text":"Well. I'm in town visiting and really wanted to try something local. This place is easy to get to and find. The food was just ok. We got a large american pizza with a Caesar salad. The salad was God to me but my friend thought it was a little fishy. And the pizza was also ok. I think it could have used more sauce and more cooking time. But all in all its wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Love Z Pizza! Seriously never had a bad pizza here. ZBQ is delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to Z Pizza with a vegan friend hoping to find something on the menu she could eat.  She found what she was looking for and so did I.  I like a good thin crust pizza & this place fits the bill.   I like this place but I have had better pizza in restaurants with nicer atmosphere and better prices.  One thing those places usually don't have is vegan options or unique ingredient choices.  Z pizza is worth a try if your curious but I'm not so impressed that I will go back often."}
{"text":"Visited this location a couple of weeks ago because it was in walking distance from the hotel I was staying at and it got decent reviews on Yelp. I was the only one in the restaurant at 7:00 PM on Monday night, a few people trickled in after me. I ordered a turkey sandwich and wings, both of which were solid. The sandwich was a bit small for the price, good. The service was friendly and fast (not sure if this changes depending on volume). There is an area to eat outside, which was great with the evening weather. I wouldn't go out of my way to return to zpizza, but I wouldn't object to returning if in the area."}
{"text":"A wonderful local pizzeria.  We ordered a Calzone and a small pizza, both were very good and the side of sause was really tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is that you pour your own drinks. Let me explain.. you go in and put down a credit card and get a wrist band. Then underneath each tap ( they have different beers and wines on tap ranging for $.50/oz to $1.25/oz for the wine) and scan your wrist band and pour your own drinks. You can pour yourself and ounce, or 16 ounces of wine or beer. I was particularly happy about the 20% off happy hour and loaded up on the \"Not your grandfather's hard rootbeer and the habanero sculpin. I didn't get pizza while I was here.. but I did get their wings- and they were THE BOMB!!! the peanut sauce and pesto sauce were both delicious! Then add the live music on the early Friday evening.. it is a great start to a weekend. check it out!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Z Pizza, and I really liked it! The workers were really patient in helping me decide which pizza slice to try.   Luckily,my friends and I came in during their happy hour (from 3-5pm, I believe). Buy any drink, and get a slice of pizza for $1, limited to two slices.   I can't remember which specific pizza slices I had, but I do remember that they were delicious :)  Like everything else in downtown Phoenix, there wasn't any other people in the restaurant. It really is strange... And kinda creepy.  -R"}
{"text":"My reasons for giving zpizza 1 star is threefold:  1. The service we received was terrible. The employees were annoyed with each other and annoyed with us. I was overcharged, then refunded and given a new receipt that doesn't even match the original total. What type of business model are they running...?  2. \"Taproom\" is a stretch. Two of the taps were out of order, and three others poured straight foam (that I was charged for)  3. It has great potential to have cool vibe, but the place was just messy and unkept the counter. Unsure if this place is going for hipster Italian pizzeria or a local fast food pizza joint. Either way, it falls short on all ends.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Z Pizza is one of my favorites in the Valley.  You get two fresh gourmet slices and a drink for $6 something.  They are always friendly as well.  Definitely try Z Pizza if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"My friend and I were first timers here. Alex was AMAZING.  Honest about his favorites, really helpful  on what we should get and overall just very welcoming. The happy hour is to DIE for. Highly  recommended for those HH lovers. Food ridiculously  good and very affordable.  The wristbands to drink 32oz is so good... beer and wine! I'm in love and find myself here a lot  more times to come! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 3.5 stars in my opinion.   Pros: The staff is attentive, they offer whole wheat selections, and the food has been good and consistent every time I have been in. The pesto pasta is fantastic  Con: I think it is way over priced for what you get. The food is good but not great to warrant their prices. Second, the portions are too small for what you pay for. Unless I am jonesing for a whole wheat pizza, (which isn't often) I will go somewhere where my dollar goes further."}
{"text":"Got me for 5 stars! zPizza Tap Room over here on 1st Ave near Monroe. Industrial cool, convenient downtown, vegan pizza (oh well...) happy hour all weekend! Pizza by the slice, 5-big screen tvs, Pizza-by-the-slice can get a little dry if the turnover is low but its downtown on a Saturday so I'm cool with it. Here's the techy side to all this: you order your food, give them your credit/debit card and ID, select either pint or 24oz mug from a cooler and pour your own beer from 20 different taps! How's this work? They issue you and arm band, you look at a digital screen above furor brand, ABV, etc., touch the arm band to the big 'Z' by the screen and you get 5-seconds to make your pour! If you're not sure about the beer just touch the screen and an in-depth description pops up! I selected a slice of tomato, mushroom, black olive, bell pepper pizza. It was a little dry but tastes good. I've honestly had better pizza. I selected a raspberry beer. Tart and fruity. I like a lot of the  orange beers out there but tend only drink one. This was very good- forgot the brand, sorry. They also have 'Not Your Dad's Root Beer' at 10% ABV. Think I'll try that next with another slice of pizza. The server was totally cool and walks each customer through the process. When I asked for a number for my table he was like, \"Don't worry man, I know who you are\"  Ric out"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to get take out pizza and salad from on a weekly basis.   Unfortunately, it looks like they have closed their doors.  I have tried calling for the past week and no one answers the phone.  I finally drove past the location and there is a note on the door stating they did not fulfill their rent payments.  I am only giving this place a 3 star because of utter disappointment, otherwise the food earns 5 stars! The Gluten Free cheese pizza was the best gluten free pizza I had ever tasted.  They used a thin rice crust with organic tomato sauce and low fat mozzarella cheese.  The place was small inside and lacked much ambiance, but made for a great delivery/ to-go restaurant.    I will miss you Z Pizza!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to the location on Hayden frequently, and this has become one of our favorite pizza places around town. The place is always very clean, the staff is super friendly, and the service is relatively quick. If you like traditional pizzas, they have the regulars -- cheese, pepperoni, etc. -- but they also have some really creative ones, such as the Mexican (includes avocados and even sour cream), the Thai (lightly drizzled with peanut sauce), and the Berkeley Vegan.  I can only vouch for their pizzas, because that's all we've had so far, but their rusticas and calzones look amazing, and I plan on trying something different each time we visit. Also, I love that the Hayden location offers free delivery and 10 percent off all orders submitted online. I can easily put in an order and pick it up on my way home from work! Voila, dinner!"}
{"text":"2nd Visit.....very poor. The slice of pizza tasted no better than frozen pizza. Disappointed with lack of consistency. No 3rd time try here. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I only go there because it's a short walk from my house and fast (and Pino's is closed for weekends). I've heard people rave about this place. It's about as good as papa johns. Pino's al Centro is almost next door. Go there."}
{"text":"We stopped in one night for pizza and beer to watch the Suns on the TV's around the restaurant.  The staff was so friendly and walked us through the entire tap process - pretty innovative and cool!  The hawaiian pizza was really tasty and reasonably priced.  We'll definitely be back to sample more beer on tap!"}
{"text":"Warning: Request crispy crust or you may receive a soggy pizza! My pizza was delivered soggy with toppings that weren't even held down by the cheese! Imagine my struggle trying to eat it! If it had crispy (or at least firm!) crust, I still would only give the place 3 stars. The flavor of the pizza was so-so, and the buffalo wings were greasy and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! Really, they make the best tasting pizza in the world, the staff are great, and they have an ice cream store built into the same shop, so you can walk through and get ice cream desert for afters."}
{"text":"My new favorite after work pizza joint! It's in a quieter part of downtown, they have fresh delicious ingredients, and they can customize the pizzas for vegetarian and vegan options. Plus Alex's amazing service made this one of my best dining experiences in recent memory! All in all, a cool spot in a hot city!   Ps: one of the few places that will validate downtown. You all are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Zpizza!  Their pizza is amazing (ZBQ is my favorite) and different than what you get from the large chain restaurants.  They also deliver and their delivery has always been FAST for me.  I also love that I can get a tasty salad to go with my pizza, which makes me feel a little less guilty ;)"}
{"text":"Looking at the last review, it must have been a \"bad manager\" weekend at Z Pizza. On Friday we ordered for delivery online. One hour later lukewarm pizzas arrived.  The order was wrong. Apparently they manually transfer the data from the online system into their ordering system and completely botched it.  We caught the driver before he left and he said he'd to back right away and the manager would call to tell us how they'd make it right.   Over an hour later, no call.   We called them and spent 20 minutes on the phone. We got no apology, just an excuse, \"We're so busy. We've got 30 people in line. All businesses make mistakes.\"  They offered to write down somewhere that we were owed a free pizza.  Seriously?! Like they'd proved their order system worked well enough for that.   Very poor example of restaurant management and customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you are in the downtown are of Phoenix, you need to get some pie here... Best pizza, cool location... great place  love this one"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, I love the crust. I took my daughter here for her birthday and she loved that there was a couch to eat on and an ice cream place built in :) The wings were good but spicy."}
{"text":"Here is a place that we love to go with the family...We tend to remortgage the house ever time we visit but hey with the current economic crisis who doesn't???  It was a place we went all the time but lately not as often, not because the food isn't excellent but because it is quite pricey.   The service is great, Hudson the manager is great, very friendly and always comes to say hello. He knows us by name and enjoys our friendly banter.  The pizza is VERY fresh, the place is always immaculate and I've never had a problem with the food. If you are looking for great pizza this is the place, if you are looking for cheap well I'm afraid it isn't.   They do have a frequent stamp program and using that will save you a few bucks in the long run."}
{"text":"I have been gluten free for over a year now, and this makes dining out quite the challenge.  You never know if the employees understand exactly what gluten is, or are taking the precautions that you ask.  It becomes this anxiety fueled worry fest, and you don't want to do it.  Unfortunately, we flew back in from Anaheim and it was getting to be quite late.  We were tired, no one wanted to cook, and the kids were cranky (one of them being gluten free as well.)  I turned to trusty yelp to find a gluten free place near the airport.  Luckily for me, this popped up.  Let me tell you, Rebecca, is amazing.  I'm not talking about myself (though admittedly, I AM amazing), I'm talking about the employee.  When I talked to her about gluten free, I ordered a pizza with chicken sausage on it.  She warned me it had gluten, but the Italian sausage did not and would be a tasty substitute.  Way to look out Rebecca, AND have a solution to the problem!  Zpizza, she needs a raise!  Seriously, give her more money to keep her happy and staying there.  The crust was tasty, the sauce was great, and the toppings fresh.  Gluten free and gluten eaters in my family agreed, tasty pizza to be had here.  I would recommend this to people with gluten issues because not only was it delicious, but I did not get sick afterwards!"}
{"text":"Wow! De-lish sandwiches!  Great service!  Great selection of beers.  The manager was easygoing and walking around talking with customers.  Great environment.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! They truly have really really good pizza here! I've been to both locations multiple times and they are consistent! It's a healthier pizza and it's gooooooood!!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I suppose I don't have much to go on.  I mean, we were really hungry (had just finished a 10 or so mile bike ride, and had another 10 or so to go), the place was dead (as in, we were literally the only customers), and it was early on a Sunday afternoon.  So three things that conspired to put zpizza in a favorable light.  Well, that and the super friendly and timely service... and the pie.  The pizza was seriously tasty.  Not the best I've had, but something I would happily eat again.  I'm looking forward to returning to try their vegan pies.  If the Casablanca (delicious and rich tasting garlic sauce- tasted like a roasted garlic paste- artichokes, mushrooms and three cheeses) is any indicator, I shouldn't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"First time customer. Atmosphere nice, customer service good.  We were only ones in the place (it was great they were open, so many other places downtown were closed). We had pizza and pear salad. Portions were very generious, salad was very tasty, loved the Balsamic dressing  - I love they do not use weeds in their salads, but good crisp lettuce (would go back for that alone). Pizza was very tasty, albeit very soggy (had peperoni & mushroom) - must eat it with a fork and knive, impossible to pick up and bite into it. Would love to see a crisper crust on the pizzas.  The lower score reflects the pizza.  Will go back, but will try sandwiches next time."}
{"text":"Z Pizza is pretty alright. What I appreciate most is that they have vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"This pizza is next level and the space is cool and chill. My wife loves her vegan pizza. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"The pizza is generally pretty tasty and the last time I went I had the pepperoni and I thought it was very acceptable. The prices are also very reasonable for the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I am a fan of zpizza and have been ordering from them for over a year. However, this location has some serious problems. First off I called in a \"catering order\", specially stating the purpose of the order and how many guest would be attending. I had picked up a catering menu for the location to help make my decision. I ask the takeout staff for 8 catering sized pizzas and a catering salad. I confirmed with her that this would feed 20 people. All well and good. Day of the event the food arrives. The takeout employee hands me the food. I look in the bag a personal sized salad... This is a catering order. We also received and paid for XL pizzas, the menu clearly states large for catering (photo included). The employee left before I was able to discuss the issue so I called the store and spoke with the manager who was rude and offered little sympathy. They then redelivered the catering salad. When I went to meet the take out employee they handed me my salad and 4 completely open salad dressing. He did not mention or apologize for the issue or mess. I am so disappointed in the service and food and being over charged!! I will never be ordering again."}
{"text":"FOOD TASTE/QUALITY:  Okay SETTING:  Nice - outside and inside seating, downtown, great location PRICE:  Outrageous   X-LARGE 1 topping pizza (Pepperoni):  $22  I live right near by.  I'd love it if this place had even fair pricing.  But the pizza is okay to good, if I'm feeling generous, and it's 2x the price I'd expect.  Despite the convenience, I just won't pay the price.  It's packed at lunch.  Great lunch specials for the working crowd downtown.  At night, it does a fair business, mostly to people downtown for sporting events or at the nearby Orpheum theater.  Maybe people just don't care about getting gouged.  But they've got to get realistic on pizza prices.  Especially for carryout, at night."}
{"text":"I've been waiting 2 hours and 15 minutes for a delivery. I keep getting a different story about why it's so late. The truth is that I just don't care why. My family is hungry!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, both regular and gluten free. Plus free local delivery. Really good tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"My sister is vegan, so any place we go to has to have vegan options. I've passed by this gem so many times and never gave it a shot. I'm glad I took the chance because the pizza was amazing. OMG, THE CRUST!!!! You know the pizza is going to be delicious if they have nailed the crust. I could not stop eating the crust; it was a perfect balance of chewy and crispy.  I got the pepperoni pizza (boring, I know), but probably one of the best pepperoni pizza's I've had in a while. My sister got the Vegan Brooklyn, and she stated it's the best vegan pizza she ever had. I will definitely be back. Everyone is also very nice and willing to make recommendations.   Plus if you're new to the location, they are doing $5 dollars off if you dine in. I don't know the exact rules, so make sure to ask.   I also did not get pizza by the slice... I'm sure its the same, but nothing beats pizza fresh from the oven."}
{"text":"It was around 6pm on my third day in Phoenix when I was (finally) able to hang out and catch up with two dearly-missed SBC alums, Lynn W and Claire! Originally, we'd set out for the dessert place next door, but I had just returned from a 10-hour day trip out to Grand Canyon and back so a slice of pizza sounded perfect...  The joint looks very collegiate and indie, full of simple designs, bright colors, and decisive lack of branding, although further inspection reveals it to be a widespread, though not yet prominent franchise.  For just shy of $20, I ordered three slices and drinks for our impromptu dinner, myself gravitating towards the simple pesto slice, as usual.  For the price per slice, it seems a tad on the expensive side, but the slice, its flavor and ingredients, is decent. The better option or deal is probably to get one of the heartier sounding whole pizzas [online menu: http://weborder3.microworks.com/zpizza/Item.aspx?menuid=2477]    Nonetheless, it hit the spot and service was very friendly.  There's a cool symbiosis of Z Pizza being immediately attached and sharing a space with Pink Spot next door. ___________________________________________ Savory and sweet in a single space! Gluttony abounds!"}
{"text":"This location sells the ice cream that was previously sold at Pink Spot (next door, before Pink Spot closed). Mind you, they charge $6.50 for a pint, which is already a little high, but worth it as it is homemade.   I frequently order from here and always make sure to get a pint of the ice cream. This last time, I placed my order as usual and what do they deliver to my house?... A pint of Ben & Jerry's! For $6.50!?! I voiced my frustration to one of the employees who said he would have the owner call me.   This morning, I spoke with Mark, the owner, who was completely rude. He stated that Z Pizza does not advertise the former Pink Spot product (Well Mark, perhaps you should tell your employees to stop telling customers that that is what it is), and that they have the right to set whatever prices they choose.   You're absolutely right, Mark... You can set whatever price you choose for a \"grocery store\" product. I can also choose to save my money as a customer and take it elsewhere. And to be completely honest, your pizza is just \"ok\" and still twice as expensive as ordering from Papa John's... Who btw, delivers in half the time it takes your employees.   Z Pizza just lost another regular customer."}
{"text":"Everybody loves pizza and it was evident today at this Z pizza, There was a line to order, a line to fill your drink, a line to get a table and a line to pick up your food.  Despite the crowd we were in and out in about 30 min. I opted for the #1 combo, any two slices, a drink all for $6.93 with tax. Not great for 2 slices if you get cheese but a good deal for the gourmet options.  I went with one of the daily slices the \"greek\" A sauce free pizza topped with feta, red onion and katmala olives. The crust here has a decent crunch too it and the chees was cooked enough. There are also some decent condiments, the standard parmesan and red pepper, granulated garlic and a franks style red hot sauce.  Once our names were called we lucked out and got a window bar style seat.  There is a nice patio which may be some use after October, but for a 110 day in August it is just ornamental.  Decent artisan toped pizzas, ok prices and fast service it is a good lunch option for a smaller group."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok....undercooked at first had to request it to be cooked for additional time.  Service was very slow....better places to go"}
{"text":"Ugh! Ordered a pizza online, got a confirmation email, waited an hour, called 20 times, rode my bike over, and found a sign on the door that said \"Closed on Easter!\""}
{"text":"This place has good vegetarian options and is organic! Try the vegan cheese and vegan toppings like crumbles or sausage!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best place to get a slice in the Downtown area.  While it is nothing like the slices in NYC (from what I remember when I lived there that is), it's as best as Phoenix can get.  The employees are incredibly kind and everytime I've gone someone has been outside cleaning.   They offer an ASU discount which amounts to $5.44 for 2 slices + fountain drink (with tax).  Also, their happy hour ($1 slices) has been moved to the hours of 3-5 instead of 2-5.  It's worth a shot -- they offer vegan as well as gluten free. And, they tell me they do deliever -- within a 3 mile radius from the hours of 11-1, M-F -- so get your lunch delivered!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say it but I have never been so disheartened by some bullshit from a local pizza spot. My wife and I have been loyal customers for 5+ years. She has dietary restrictions (gluten-free, dairy-free and soy free) and, for her especially, pizza is a treat. The fact that her small gf/df/sf pizza can run up to $35 is outrageous but we pay the price because it's the best we can get. Not anymore. Screw ZPizza. Last Friday was brutally exhausting for her and I didn't feel like being a chef so I ordered pizza early in the afternoon with explicit instructions to deliver at the time she would be home and comfortable, 6:45pm. At six o'clock, the pizza arrived. I told the driver she was early and her response was, \"well, there's nothing we can do about it now.\" Had I not been in the middle of working I would have ended the conversation differently but I let it go and did not throttle her on the spot. This is not the first, second, third or fourth time we've had problems with orders or restitution with ZPizza. We've forgiven wrong orders, late deliveries and poor delivery service before because we aren't the types to fuss over trivia. But that night I wrote a private message to their Facebook page explaining my dissatisfaction. Thus far, no response. I called them on Monday asking to speak to the manager, again, no response, no call back. It's Wednesday. I've been patient enough. Hey ZPizza! I will never speak your name well again. You have no problem taking my money but you suck at delivering what is ordered. Your dismissal of me as insignificant or unworthy of attention isn't right. Your ethics and integrity speak volumes and your representation of your brand is subpar. I'd say you're cooking up a financial shitstorm and I hope somebody will put you back on track."}
{"text":"I've been here 20+ times in the last year as my wife really likes it. Their pizza is good and they have several interesting non-traditional offerings.  We really like that they use organic and non go ingredients in their offerings. That being said, I'm not sure I can continue to get pizza from here.   I've noticed over the last several months that the service and especially the attitudes of the employees is becoming worse and on occasion somewhat hostile. Tonight was the final straw for me. I was told my order would be ready for pickup between 20-60 minutes. When I arrived after 30 min, it was ready and the girl almost threw it to me across the register. I asked for the salad the id ordered as well and she looked at me as if I had three heads. Reluctantly she walked the three feet and got my salad too. The entire experience tonight put such a horrible taste in my mouth that I can no longer recommend Z Pizza to anyone!     EDIT:  Spoke with Brian, store manager, who recently took over this location. It seems like I got caught in some transitional pains. My wife and I will be going back soon and will update review at that time. Really appreciated Brian calling me and am looking forward to seeing the improved ZPizza!  EDIT2:  We went back last week. Night and day difference!!  Spoke with Keegan on the phone who was incredibly pleasant and friendly. When I arrived to pick up my order, the bearded man who makes pizza greeted me and was friendly too. He actually looked happy to be there. The young lady who was cashier that night was still standoffish at first but slowly warmed to polite conversation. Such an improvement.   Brian, you are doing a great job in turning this place around. I feel I can recommend your restaurant again."}
{"text":"Over a week for horrible customer service...   Customer since 2007, not anymore   I basically wrote them off after talking my dad and family into ordering from them one night instead of Papa John's.  Fresh ingredients and real food right?  But after they delivered it, the pizza I ordered for dad was soggy and undercooked.  (which is alway the worst when you build a place up, finally get others to try it, and get burned!)  2 weeks ago for Father's Day, I was spending time with my dad and asked him what he wanted to do for dinner, he asked for Z's.  I tried to persuade elsewhere, but he just wanted to relax at home.  So I called up and placed an order, then ran to pick it up.  When I left with it, they forgot to put the 2 slices of pizza in the bag (I looked in it and thought everything was there)  Get home, realize they are missing so give them a call.   me-\"Hey this is Steve, I was just there, you guys forgot my 2 slices of pizza\"   \"ya, they are sitting right here\"   .....   .....    me- \"okkkkkk, well what do you guys do in situations like this....\"   \"they are sitting right here\"   .............   me- \" Ok....well we just sat down to eat, and I'm not running back up there right now, so in situations like this, what do you guys do to make this right, have the delivery driver drop them off or just refund me for them?\"    \"I will add a 5 dollar credit to your account that you can use next time\"    me- \"uhhh I think the 2 pieces cost more than 5 bucks, so can you just refund my card back the right amount\"   At this point I was already DONE with this place, who forgets food then doesn't offer to make it right, THEN lowballs you on a credit?? If you are going to offer me a different amount, At LEAST offer me MORE than what I paid for not LESS!  INSANE    \"ok I just did the refund\"   me- \"thanks man\"  that's it, no apology, nothing. He also sounded like he wasn't on point, and after the way he handled it AND originally forgetting my food I was worried about the refund.   I kept an eye on my credit card account, and 3 business days later, still no refund, so I called back up to find out whats going on.  He never did it.   Wednesday:  after 20 mins on the phone, I am told that the owner will have to call me back to investigate this and issue a refund. Odd that NO ONE there can handle this or refund my money    Friday:  Still no refund and no call from the owner, so I call AGAIN and explain it all over for the 2nd time. I was told the owner would have to call me and let me know.  later that day he does, is nice on the phone, says sorry, and that he can't refund me back on my credit card, that I will have to swing by to pick up the refund  once he is done, I explain how disappointed I am and how I waited almost 1 week and had to call 3 times for a refund, after not getting my food, getting a lowball credit offer, and being told I would get a refund and NOT, and that I now have to drive back up there to collect my refund. He has nothing to add but \"sorry\" and he is \"trying to make things better there because there has been some customer service problems\"     ------   Well earlier tonight I was riding by, so decided I would grab it (a tank of gas in my bike) so went in and asked for it  open up the envelope, thinking mmmmmmaybe they will throw something in there, like a free pizza coupon to make it right, but nope  6 bucks and 1 penny   If they had thrown a coupon in, I was already mentally ready to ask for the manager and give it back. I don't want their food, or anything FREE, and that it's the principle.   and I thought it would be BOSS to do, give it back :D   but would had scored points in my book for the effort   but NOPE  all of that, calling them 3 times, all just so I can drive back up there to get my money back   so heads up  this is how they treat customers who have gone there for years, who's orders get forgotten, and takes them almost a week just to give a refund   as a business owner, and former manager in the food industry, that isn't how you take care of your customers   such a shame, love supporting local businesses and had recommended them to quite a few people before   so if you are thinking about hitting this one, I HIGHLY recommend you look east, 2 buildings over, Pino's- http://www.yelp.com/biz/pinos-pizza-al-centro-phoenix , and try them out  AMAZING customer service, friendly, helpful, and waaaaay better food  seriously, you can see I gave them a 5 star almost 1 year ago, that's where I've been going for pizza since"}
{"text":"What more could you want in a casual pizza place?!  A variety of pizza's on the menu, other items as well.  A distinctive feeling and style.  A happy crew serving you deliciousness.  When I'm hanging around this area again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First off they were dog friendly, which is a big plus for us.  we had a groupon for four but only 2 of us showed up, and they treated us like 4.  the food was really good.  both salads rocked (ceasear and pear gorgon zola.   the pizza was tasty, and they had a surplus of vegetarian options.  finally there beer selecting was not massive but good.  no cheap domestic swill, all decent to good microbrewies.   The service was above average for a causal dinning experience. btw the way the groupon is an excellent deal!"}
{"text":"Garbage.. All if these reviews are people that like vegan organic gluten free pizza.. Show me the meat and cheese!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch in downtown Phoenix for two reasons: The food is good and I love that you can sit at the long table in front of the window and watch the light rail and traffic go by. I really dig their balsamic dressing on the house salad (it's a pretty good size) and the pepperoni pizza is very tasty, not greasy. Oh, and the staff is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Had delivery from this location multiple times. The pizza isn't lets say cheap, but with the quality ingredients it's worth it! Kind of like the Whole foods of delivery. They also have sandwiches, salads, and etc... I can't help it though with rustic pizza's and a choice of whole wheat crust I've been stuck on the pizza and I don't want to share! Next time I'm doing half and half because it's so hard to pick just one.  Easy online ordering is awesome! I also want to say the woman who has delivered a couple times seems sooo happy. It's really nice. It makes me want to apply for a job, so that I can be happy too. :)"}
{"text":"Had the provence pizza and I'm so glad I got the extra large so I would have leftovers the next day.  Pizzeria Bianco's got nothing on this place.  Interesting ingredients, delicious crust and perfectly baked (not burned).  I definitely recommend trying the hot/bbq-ish sauce they have in the condiment area on your pizza.  Not a ton but a little adds a delicious kick.  Service was good, the place was clean and the food was delicious and organic!  Looking forward to lunch today  :o)"}
{"text":"Took a stroll downtown this weekend to try Z Pizza because I'd heard so much about it.   It was delicious. I would have liked a veggie options for slices or at least some veggies on the slices, but I ordered the sausage/mushroom slice and caesar salad... Tasty.   In looking at the menu, there are many pizza combos that I would like to try in my future visits or to order delivery.   The website wasn't helpful as it mentioned that there was not delivery at this location, but there is. So next time I'm ordering to be delivered straight to the pool. Before it gets too cold that is..."}
{"text":"After putting out a twitter alert for a pizza place along the Lightrail, my fellow tweeters urged me to check out Z Pizza.  Even before my tweet, when I was at the Mayor's coffee event at the Heard Museum (yesterday), we received the Phoenix Passport Book.   My friend, Seth, told me that there was a coupon in the book and we should try it out.  There's no doubt that Z Pizza had to be a place I needed to try this weekend.  Instead of taking the Lightrail, we decided to drive.  (FYI, the closest Lightrail stop is Thomas and Central and it's only a short walk away.) We liked the friendly service and the comfortable atmosphere.  We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza and it was yummy.  We ordered the large because with the coupon, you get $5 off of a $20+ order.  The large pizza was $20.56.  We ate a few slices and took the rest home.    We sat and ate on their comfortable couch. Afterwards, the setting was so comfortable, we stayed and read our books.  I wanted to try the desserts at The Pink Spot, but I was too full.  All in all, Z Pizza had a nice atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"What a great find!  My wife and I were in Phoenix for the D-Backs/Pirates game and stopped in at ZPizza on W. Monroe (For other out of town people -- the entrance actually is NOT on W. Monroe -- it is on 1st (the East side of the block)).   We got the meat stromboli and it was really about as perfect as we could have wanted. The dough was fresh, light, soft, and delicious, as was everything inside.   We also sampled a few of the drinks on tap (self-serve taps were great -- ideal for being able to try several different brews, as they're billed by the ounce). I can't remember the names of the ones I tried, but they were dark and they were great. I'd take them over Guinness any day.  The next time we're back in Phoenix we're absolutely stopping again.  Open a ZPizza in Las Vegas! (Actually, it looks like ZPizza may have been here, but closed/left....so come back!)"}
{"text":"I won't lie, I was skeptical ordering from this place.  After a long day of painting my new apartment I needed some grub, and looking for a place that delivers to my new digs downtown I came upon Z Pizza.    I have to admit, I was not pleased by the hour+ in between order and delivery.  When the guy finally arrived, he asked me if I traditionally had a problem with delivery people not being able to find my place.  God I hope not!  I can't imagine it's that tough!  He went on to tell me that he had just made a delivery to my building earlier in the day and couldn't find the right building.  Well it says the building name in big letters on the side. . .Figure it out, especially if you get lots of orders!  On to the pizza.  At $13 for a medium cheese and $17 for a medium \"Napoli\", this is definitely on the pricier side.  And is it me, or is the \"Italian Pizza\" just a bit redundant?  I was under the impression that pizza itself was Italian.  Anyway, the pizzas were actually really good.  i liked the fresh basil on the cheese pizza, and the roasted garlic sauce on the Napoli was fantastic.  I'm sure I'll be trying their other pizzas in due time."}
{"text":"It's interesting that people love or hate this place...  I don't like that it's a chain - not necessarily cause i hate chain restaurants or anything but moreso because it's deceiving, seems so local and independent (I can get over that tho).  I've only had salad and cheese bread here - but it's been good both times. In theory, I like that everything is organic but really I'm not that much of an organic snob so I could be over that soon too.   All in all, I'd say this place is good - not necessarily great. But I hasten readers that I've never had a legitimate slice of pizza from here. So maybe I just need to give that a try.   Their tea is good!"}
{"text":"5 star service and 2.5 star pizzas .. 3 stars overall. Just across the street from work I find myself coming here too often for the diet I claim to be on.  The benefit of ordering in ahead of time is always a plus. The food is almost always done in 5 to 10 minutes. The service is top notch and I cannot tell you the number of times the staff has stopped me from ordering some cold stale pizza by the slice   I wish they had more healthier options and more vegetarian options to go with the menu.   I updated it to 4 stars because I was just told of all the wonderful veggie goodness I cab now spend my money on ! Guess where I will be going for dinner !"}
{"text":"Pizza is so-so, good hang out place just next door. Weird service.  Went there today, had pear and walnut salad, that was good! The Lime Chicken sandwich was ok."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat in d town. Good and fast service during lunch. The Waiter was good about making sure everything was fine. I usually don't like eating pizza but this place wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the BBQ wings. They always arrive piping hot and the sauce is amazing. They have a wide selection of pizzas. A nice natural crust that is not too thin and crispy, not to thick and doughy. The toppings taste fresh and delicious. The sauce has a very good blend of flavors. I like the American and the Italiano pizzas the best. The calzones are a little greasy, but still tasty.  Delivery times are usually at least 45 to 50 minutes. However, I don't mind to wait for something good."}
{"text":"Went in with date for dinner, our first time inside the restaurant on Thomas and the place looked clean, but not any special decor or anything.  I did order wings and pizza (large) with traditional toppings and two beverages for $35 and paid upfront.  The wings were covered in sauce and turned out well done on the inside but somehow the skin was wet and soggy.  Gross.  The pizza was a thin crust which is good, but it too had lots of \"juice\" under the center of the pizza making it soggy and the juice looked like black water.  Gross.  A waste of $35!  A side note, the service was so poor from the cashier dude that thinks he should be given a tip before the food is even served.  He also made a verbal comment out loud that he was working for free.  I am sure zpizza has quality ingredients, but the wings made us both sick for the night which means another lost customer telling a hundred others not to visit this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Zpizza and visited this location for the first time tonight. It was about 6pm and the place was completely empty. We placed our order and I proceeded to get a drink from the soda machine. The dr pepper was empty and was told that they were out but that was after I heard what appeared to be the owner saying \" I dont even know how to work this thing\".  The pizza took longer than usual to make and it appeared that this was mostly a delivery takeout location. The door said new ownership and it appeared that they have no idea how to run a restaurant.  Some younger teenage/college age kids came in and were helping out behind the counter but they were dressed in tank tops and very short shorts which didn't seem terribly sanitary.  There was some preprinted displays on the table with some information about giving feedback online . We asked a young scantily clad girl behind the counter about the displays but she was obviously clueless about what we were talking about and said as much .... We will only order takeout from now on but I think the health department needs to do some training because no one wants to see some gym rat looking young guy handling food while his underarm hair is showing !!  Food is great but otherwise they need serious help !"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizza spots I've eaten at . They claim to be organic which is to good to be true . I highly recommend this place . The staff there is great too"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. I wish the pizza wasn't so expensive, but I understand why it is. I love the Hawaiian and the California Veggie."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Had the pear gorgonzola flat bread and salad, and my friend had the original calzone.  All was delicious, the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"The rating is because of the gluten-free crust. Anyone who is gluten-free knows pizza is tough to come by. This is my third shot at a gf crust, and it's a ton better than the others. Thin, fairly crispy (not easily done gf) and good. I got the napoli (tomatoes and basil), and they have a bunch of other specialty pies. Very casual and they do slices. A definite pizza stop downtown."}
{"text":"These folks are my heroes. For over a year after first moving downtown I suffered by ordering Pizza Hut for delivery, thinking it was my only option. A neighbor enlightened me. I called Z Pizza. The first time they delivered something to me, I almost wept with joy. You have to understand how much pain and pizzatorture I went through before seeing the Z light.  Not only do they always deliver on time, but their food is among the best I've had anywhere in Phoenix that delivers. I select something different from the menu almost every time I order, and I've yet to be disappointed. The delivery drivers also tend to be cool dudes."}
{"text":"Excellent concept, well executed food, incredibly welcoming manager.   Happened to walk by this great establishment when in Phoenix for a conference and came back multiple times. They've got a pour it yourself tap system that allows you to try their variety of beers/ciders and wines. You get a bracelet that connects to the tap and can see how much you are pouring and stop whenever you like (whether that be 2 oz or 24oz). I enjoyed the patio with a large group and the manager was so welcoming and helpful. The boys loved the pizza and I was so pleasantly surprised with my arugula salad, which was simply perfect. Everyone I interacted with here was so nice and patient, they are really doing something right with this place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pesto chicken pasta. Took 25 mins.. Cost $10.. And I'm still hungry. Portion was small for the price. Won't be back. The pizza is ok but better options in the area for less."}
{"text":"I always end up having them deliver so I haven't been inside but the pizza is great! The Thai is my favorite. I love being able to get pizza that isn't horrible for you!"}
{"text":"I cant attest for the pizza but the salads here are pretty decent. I had the ZBQ Salad which was super fresh and tasty! The Mr had one of there new rustic pizza's which he said was pretty good. I swear, he needs to start Yelping as well! Anyhoo.. very good for a quick lunch.. PLUS, they totally carry Sweat Leaf Tea.. good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Only 2 Stars: Z-Pizza on Thomas: Haven't been here in a while because we have been going to the nearby FIRED PIE at Park Central instead, which is waaaay better!  But I received an e-mail for a free small pizza for my birthday, so we decided to return to z-pizza for that. I ordered the Thai Pizza & was disappointed....  The peanut sauce lacked any yummy flavor, quite bland, & it was missing one of the toppings that it was supposed to have....no carrots. I complained up at the counter, & to compensate, they gave me a free drink. That was nice of them, but they should have told me up front, & not assume that I wouldn't realize that one of the toppings was missing, because I used to get the Thai Pizza all the time & I remember lots of carrots on it!  There was hardly any red onions or bean sprouts on it either!  However, there was a fair amount of chicken on it.  I will not be returning to z-pizza again.  FIRED PIE, here we come!~  Also, the chairs make a LOT of noise there when they're moved around...annoying!"}
{"text":"I truly feel like an idiot, I truly do.  Spending so much time in California I would have THOUGHT I would have heard of this place but no, I was too focused on Paisanos in Hermosa Beach to actually realize that there were other DELICIOUS pie eateries around.   Only until I mosey on into Phoenix and start noticing these places and the always crowded parking lots surrounding them.  And, only until my cheap ass is offered a complimentary 14\" pizza do I actually try the joint.  AWESOME, simply AWESOME!!   If your a meat lover, GREAT, if your a cheese lover, GRREEAT, and if you are a veggie lover GRRRRREEEEAAATTT! (That was my Tony the Tiger voice)   You won't be disappointed, other than the bill, buy hey, fresh quality stuff is worth the Washington's, even if we are in a recession.   Put it this way, you can get the crust baked with Truffle oil for Christ's sake, how BADASS is that??"}
{"text":"deliciouso....great crispy, slightly burnt edges. they weren't frugal with the toppings and were more than willing to add or take away any sauce or topping as we wanted. very friendly staff and quick. cool artwork on the walls, and extremely reasonable for the middle class foodie.   several valley locations so check one out in a neighborhood near you. then head next door for a tasty ice cream treat."}
{"text":"ALERT ALERT!!! the food here has made me sick  with food poisoning twice now. the second time 06/30/14 i had to go to the st josephs emergency room. bad  creepy attitude from the night employee courtney or casey.  i believe she tampered with my food. the manager dave is an absolute disgusting human being. noone willingly apologized, very reluctant to give refund. i do not recommend to anyone!!!! - Registered Nurse"}
{"text":"I always like to stop in here and get artichokes pizza, they have really good toppings here to choose from."}
{"text":"Soggy gluten free pizza with a steep upcharge for gluten free. They don't tell you about upcharge or what it is. It was about double what is usual. Apathetic staff. I would not chance it if I were celiac. Shared kitchen. Staff really could not be bothered to speak and seemed genuinely irritated that I would ask a question about the sauces on some of the pizzas. They never even asked if I wanted a beverage.  Pizza not worth price. Sauce has best gf pizza. I would buy a frozen  gf pizza at a store before having this again."}
{"text":"It's pretty tasty stuff! They offer some interesting pizzas and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh. Sometimes if you go in at kind of a slow hour and get a slice, it'll be a little on the 'meh' side. The calzones are pretty good, they'll fill the craving if you have one.  Honestly what I am a big fan of at zPizza is their sandwiches and salads. They're flavorful, fresh, and the bread is awesome. The salads have interesting combinations and are a nice size.   Hit Pink Spot next door afterward for maximum gluttony."}
{"text":"**FINAL UPDATE**12/11/14 I never received a reply from Brandi Babb. I would consider this closed after this much time. This company is horrible even at a corporate level.     10/23/14 I was able to make contact with the corporate offices of Zpizza. A woman named Brandi Babb sent me an email asking how she could help. I have detailed to her all of my updates and information about my experience and how little this location has done to make the situation right. I will post her response once I have received it.   UPDATE 10/18/14 I just received an email from the BBB advising they still have not received a response over a month later. BBB has closed the case and states this will have an \"adverse\" effect on ZPizza's rating. I was provided horrible service and even worse product and still, I was not refunded. Great job ZPizza. You've shown what type of business you really are.    UPDATE 10/10/14 I just got an email from the Better Business Bureau and they say ZPizza still has not responded to them. ZPizza also has not made an attempt at contacting me. BBB will give them more time to respond before closing the complaint.    UPDATE 09/17/14 I have filed my complaint with the Better Business Bureau today. I waited over a week for zpizza to call back and they didn't. I called them 09/16/14 and spoke with a nice girl named Harley who gave my information to the GM. The GM called me back on 09/17/14 and left a voicemail and didn't give his name. He defended what Sean, the manager in training, told me and said they won't refund me since I waited until the next day to file my complaint. He said \"this is the end game\" and declined my refund request. They've wasted more money responding to my complaints than the pizza is worth. Update coming soon....   UPDATE 09/10/14: I contacted corporate and they have forwarded an email to the owner resolve the issue within 48 hours.   UPDATE 09/09/14 ZPizza is making it impossible to get my refund. The manager, Sean, said, at the time of my call, that it's been \"almost 24 hours\" since I was there so they can't refund. I went to ZPizza right after work to submit my complaint. It had been maybe 17 to 18 hours. He says the sauce is organic so it evaporates into the cheese. He says the pizza was cooked even though it was cold and the vegetables were raw. I am waiting for his callback since he has to check with the owner to get approval for a refund. As a business owner, why hire a manager if you give them no power? They offered me a free pizza which I declined. I hate this place and don't want to eat there again. I want my money back. Next step is corporate and then the BBB.   -------ORIGINAL REVIEW-------  What a terrible experience. To order, it took the order taker at least 5 minutes because he didn't know the computer. He was dressed differently from all the other employees. I'm guessing he was a supervisor.   I specifically asked him if he would call our name when our order was ready. He said yes and said it'd be ready in 15 minutes. We waited 25. When I got tired of sitting around, I walked up to the register and the man seemed surprised and very quickly handed my order to me. It had been ready for an amount of time but we were never called.   Got home, cheese was rubbery. Ingredients were undercooked. Also, NO PIZZA SAUCE. What's wrong with these people? I put it in my oven for 10 minutes and it looked better. Taste was a 2 on a 10 scale. Again, no sauce. I would have gone back but, after waiting 20 minutes for my order, I was starving and didn't want to turn a simple pizza trip into a one hour ordeal. I posted some pictures of my pizza for the skeptics. I read good things about this place and am greatly disappointed. Over $20 for one large pizza and this is what I got?"}
{"text":"I tried a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese from zpizza on Sunday. It was just ok. Pretty dry as there was not much sauce under the cheese and extra cheese didn't quite reach the real extra cheese level to me. If my pizza was extra cheese, I'd hate to see what a regular amount of cheese would be. My last bite seemed to have all the sauce I wished would have been in each bite. At $18.95 (including tax) for a one item with extra cheese thin crust 14\"  pizza, definitely not worth the price despite all the organic claims on the box. However, as organic goes, this wasn't bad by any means. Service was good, they quoted me 15-20 minutes and the pizza was hot and ready when I arrived. The price alone will prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that thrilled to go to Z Pizza, because I had remembered having it in Scottsdale before a ton of them shut down and was not a fan. However, I was severely hungry and in a rush to get to a show, so I decided I could tolerate it. Was happy to see the menu had seemed to be revamped since my last visit many years ago. My family ordered a few different things at the counter, and they were delivered pretty quickly, even faster than they had told us, which was awesome since we were short on time! We got garlic bread and the arugula salad (without walnuts) to start. The salad was absolutely delicious. The caramelized onion with the parmesan and arugula was a terrific flavor combination! The garlic bread was soooo good too, yummy cheese melted on top. Only complaint was that the marinara sauce was like cold. Not even room temperature. Like fresh out of the fridge cold. Thought that was a little odd. The meat eating portion of my family also shared some kind of lime chicken sandwich which they loved, and a chicken sausage, which was also eaten pretty quickly haha. For my main meal I got a veggie calzone. I must say, this was the only thing that I was really disappointed with. The crust was very good, but it was just super watery from the ricotta. Also it was like overflowing with red peppers. I love red bell peppers, but it was just totally overpowering. It was served with icy cold marinara sauce as well. Weird! If I'm in the area I will gladly come back to Z pizza, as all the food (with the exception of the veggie calzone) was super good, customer service was good too."}
{"text":"I cannot comment on their food because it never arrived.  Despite multiple phone calls and repeated reassurances the pizza was never delivered. I canceled after 2 hours. Invest in a place that actually invests in their customers. This is not such a place."}
{"text":"After placing an order online through Grubhub and buying a Groupon, I came to discover (only by driving down there) that this location is no longer open."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly! This is my go to place for a little bit more formal type of  hang. Their wings are delicious, and their chicken pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to even compare Z Pizza to NY pizza because they are completely different. For lunch Z Pizza is a decent choice...the times I have been there service is quick and there is plenty of seating to be had. The parking lot is really small and fills up quickly, but don't let that deter you.  The first time I went for lunch I had the pasta with grilled chicken, pinenuts, and basil pesto. For the most part it was a good dish even though the pasta was a tad overcooked. It wasn't an overly large portion, but was the perfect amount for lunch.  I believe the pasta and a drink was close to $10.  I have also had the Moroccan pizza (pesto, feta cheese, pinenuts, and eggplant) which was very tasty although it could have used a bit more feta. For a slice of the Moroccan, a garden salad, and a drink, it was $8.  Some of my coworkers who I dine with also enjoy the calzone (you will have to wait about 10 minutes for it though) and the Santa Fe pizza.  I'm not really a fan of gourmet pizza, but for a lunch spot downtown it is not bad. It's not my first choice but not a place I drag my heels to go to either. The one good thing about this Z Pizza location is that they will deliver at night to the State Capitol which we had them do once this fall when we were working late."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent. I had one issue with a mis-marked pizza out of their display case recentlyof \"by the slice\": it was chicken barbecue which I cannot eat (I HATE chicken barbecue pizza) but the sign said \"Neapolitan\" too late as I had already taken it home.    I went in (May 20th) for a birthday lunch, and was disappointed in the experience. Me and my sister were enjoying our pizzas and one of the staff, seated a full two tables away watching television in the dining area- for some reason was listening in to our conversation! then joined in of his own accord. We politely replied with small talk and went on speaking more quietly to ourselves, which he then later again opined on of our comments which were not of his concern. It was very awkward being forced to entertain a person that I hadn't planned on speaking with. I am sure he thought he was being \"friendly\" but most paying customers do not appreciate the staff interrupting the customer and joining in their conversations.   The cashier also refused to enter in my phone number which gives the customer a free large pizza when they've spent a certain amount there. I wonder if he input someone elses number?   All of the staff seem to have tattoos all over the place- their arms, legs, what have you. Tattoos aren't cool anymore but I guess they are permanently stuck wearing them."}
{"text":"It's good but not extraordinary. Service is always great, food is always made fast. It's definitely better than your average pizza, but compared to some of the pizza out there, I've become desensitized to gourmet pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped in their last night right before I hit up the Jamie Foxx concert at the Dodge Theater. It's a cute little place. Very, clean and quite quiet on a Thursday evening. But then again it was technically after hours (7pm) in the downtown area so unless major is going on it just may be like this all the time.   The guy that took care of me was really sweet. I wish I would have gotten his name. He was patient as I was trying to decide on the only slice of pizza I wanted. LOL In the end I choose a huge slice of piping hot pepperoni and for under $3.00 for my slice, not to shabby.   I sat myself down and watched some of the college football game and enjoyed my wonderfully delicious slice of pepperoni pizza. I swear their was pepperoni in ever bite. It wasn't greasy and the crust was just perfect. He even checked up on me to make sure I didn't want a second slice. My mind was screaming YES, YES but alas I was good and politely declined.  Very friendly, very clean, great prices and damn good pizza. They have tons of specials so you can't go wrong. Check this place out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"good pizza, especially with the soy cheese and fake meat options.  great addition to the area."}
{"text":"The service is beyond excellent and amazing, Alexander tended to my family as if we were already friends and made sure we were satisfied with our choice of beers and easily tossed aside what we didn't like with no discrepancy. Very happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here. We got the wings and Mediterranean Platter. Took about an hour which was expected but we noticed we didn't get the hummus. When I called they said the driver tried calling to tell us they were out of hummus. He didn't call. He didn't tell me when he handed me the food at the door."}
{"text":"Soo yummy!  I agree with the fact that parking can be a pain here, but its worth it.  Or, what a lot of people don't realize is that they deliver!  The pizza is a little pricey, but for the different toppings and styles they make, it's totally worth it.  Personally, I don't really like red sauce, so it's nice to find a pizza that doesn't have that as its main ingredient.  Come here (or get delivery) if you are looking for a non-traditional pizza that you want to really enjoy!"}
{"text":"After coming to Z for the last 1.5 years, I have to reduce my overall score. This is long overdo.  Not sure what has happened there but the pizza is just not the same as before (see last review).  Issues are quality of pizza and price and my experience tonight solidified my less than stellar review.   Ordered to large pizzas: one Greek and one plain cheese, plus a salad for pick up. Total bill was about 45 bucks! Say what? Cough cough...holy cow!  Got home and low and behold, another feeling of my hard earned money being spent on less than average fare. Pizza dough was chewy and dry. It used to be amazing. Rest of pizza was bland and tasteless. It used to pop with flavor. See the theme here?   I just can't justify spending this kind of $$ on this quality of food. While pizza may not be the cheap alternative to feeding a family any longer, there are a dozen other places I'd rather go, spend half as much and get a pretty decent pie.  So long Z Pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this location and I was impressed. I ordered two half salads and a small Provence pizza with chicken sausage.  The pizza was cooked perfectly, and was not soggy at all, despite being delivered. Growing up on the east coast in NY, I am used to and prefer thinner crust pizzas. If you like thin crusts and organic ingredients, ZPizza will not disappoint.   The salads were good too, but they were nothing special.   Overall, I am happy I gave ZPizza a try and will order again!"}
{"text":"Z-Pizza (and Carlos) came through for me in a big way during a recent late night work day. I was going on my 13th hour at the office and my hunger pangs were really getting the best of me and the only thing I had in my overhead was a couple sleeves of instant oatmeal and a pack of Cup O' Noodles. I'm soo tired of oatmeal for dinner and I wasn't feeling the Cup O' Noodles either.  My office is downtown so late night delivery options are almost non-existent and being that I was on command center duty, I could not leave my post so it had to be delivery or nada.  Sad thing is, most of the eateries in my downtown nook roll up pavement between 8 and 9pm.  After calling all my favorite daytime eateries (that were still open at 9pm)which either don't offer delivery or stopped delivery at 8pm, I was just about to give up and settle for those expired sleeves of the oatmeal when I thought to give Z-Pizza a try. Sure glad I did! Technically they too were no longer delivering for the night but Carlos was so nice and said he would do it for me. I had my order in and it was delivered within 20 minutes. My salad was crisp and cold and my pasta & meatballs were piping hot. Carlos was just as friendly in person as he was on the phone and thanks to Z-Pizza I was a happy well fed man."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale this past weekend and looked up a couple places with vegan food.  I was very excited to find out that zpizza offered vegan cheese.  I was extra excited that there was a restaurant.com gift certificate available for $25 off $50.  It sounds like a lot to spend, but if you get 2 pizzas and a salad, it's about that much.  We got a vegan cheese w/ artichoke, mushroom, and olives and a ZBQ for the meat eaters.  Also got a salad w/ balsamic and the hummus platter.  Everything was very good and everyone who took part in this meal was very satisfied.  I'd highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent menu with numerous options for apps, salads, pizza and more.  The crust is so good and light.   Parking: This location at W Thomas Road has maybe 5-7 spots for parking. However, when we were there, we noted most folks get to -go pizza.   Service:  Fantastic and friendly!  Also, I used a Groupon. Some restaurants are weird with Groupons, but this place was so so friendly!  The man who had made our breadsticks and pizza was always asking if we needed more wine and/or beer.  So friendly!  Food:  I have ordered pizzas here before. The crust is light and tasty. It is light weight but filling.   I ordered the arugula salad, which was a bit heavy on walnuts but ok. The Caesar salad looked super tasty.  The mushroom pizza was light and interesting.   We ordered the parm breadsticks and finished those rather quickly.   The menu indicates that individuals can order gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian as well!   Price: Great prizes for what one can get. Lunch specials are very cheap."}
{"text":"Honestly Dominoes may be better. Pizza was bland and the chicken wings were soggy.  The bread sticks were good but overall I wouldn't eat there again.  Sorry Z Pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. The ZBQ is so good. I normally order a half ZBQ half pepperoni and ricotta pizza. Always fresh. And delivery time is quick. There's no reason to go anywhere else for pizza. I love this place."}
{"text":"We live near Z Pizza and have ordered it a number of times recently - it's good - but the reason I'm leaving this review is because I just tried their gluten free pizza tonight, and I'm totally a fan!  I don't have much to compare it with in terms of gf, but I had a third slice ...I just wanted more!  My rating isn't 5 stars because I thought they skimped a bit on the sauce ...but you know I will definitely be back for the gf and I appreciate that they offer it as an option."}
{"text":"The food is much like all other zpizza locations- always good, always fresh and always pretty standard size/taste/portion-wise, etc.   I usually always get the same thing at zpizza, but usually go to the Downtown Phoenix location near CityScape. To my knowledge, I ordered the same thing as usual and with my order and another usual entree, it seemed to be $5-10 more than the CityScape location....which is weird.  The staff is really unprofessional, had awkward \"night out\" stories that they were loudly telling in front of customers. I had to walk up to the counter and wait to get a box, as I was being seemingly ignored, but one of the employees was eager to help me once he noticed me.  It is conveniently placed near/connected to a dessert/cafe that looks cute, too, but I did not try it.   This place might be better for take-out or delivery, but I'm not sure. It just wasn't as good of an experience as other zpizzas that I have been to."}
{"text":"Well I wasn't blown over but I wasn't disappointed. The pizza is excellent, try the santa fe pizza but ask for extra corn, the staff isn't overly friendly or rude...indifferent maybe what they are or maybe I caught them on a bad night. The decor seems lacking but if you are going to pick up your pie or get it delivered this place may rank at 4 stars. Its a pizza place with a unique twist. Try it out. I'd go again it may not be my first choice but I'd go back."}
{"text":"It should  be call \"S\"pizza for all the salt they put on their pizzas, we ordered them with light sauce, thin crust, etc. and still was soooo salty we had to throw them away after we ate a few slices. We had tried ordering the same style of pizza from Dominos and Pizza Hut and they were way more edible than what we ordered from Zpizza, We wish more establishments were more aware of the dangers of too much sodium on the products the sell..."}
{"text":"Ah, Z.   +1 for the cheap lunch specials +1 for the friendly service and the cute guy at the register with long-ish hair +1 for being open past 6pm in downtown phoenix.  Pizza isn't amazing, but, it's not meant to be.  The salads are pretty delicious, from 2-5 the slices are only $1, PLUS they deliver within a 2 mile radius and don't charge!   If you order enough times (like me, apparently), you get a free large pizza.    Oh yeah, there is alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is quite cool! I love that you can serve your own beer and try all the beverages they have on tap. Everything we ordered tasted amazing. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered the casa blanca and mexican pizza  for lunch in the office. Even on a Sunday, the food was fresh,delivered fast and SOOOO filling... literally I had one piece and was full!"}
{"text":"I love mom and pop shops and especially when it's pizza! It made it even better that they have a vegan option! It is a pretty small establishment though; cozy, but I think I'd rather get my food to go each time because it would seem to be claustrophobic if there were at least 5-10 more people there. Located in midtown, so it's in a great location!   I went with my mom for lunch and it was surprisingly no one else in there (kinda had me skeptical) but I still wanted to try my first vegan pizza. I set my sights on getting ONE slice of pizza, but apparently they only offer the vegan slice if it is one of the pizzas of the day, otherwise you have to buy the whole pie. I was a little disappointed but my mind was set on the pizza so I just ordered the whole pie anyways, and not regretfully!  It took a little longer than expected to get our pizzas since we were the only ones in there but I guess you can't rush perfection right? My mom ordered a slice of the American pizza and a slice of the Bacon Spinach Mushroom pizza and I ordered the Berkeley Vegan pizza. All of the pizzas smelled really good! My pizza was so impressive, I feel like I could get used to vegan pizza and not miss cheese at all! Although the cheese is clearly not the same texture, it tastes more like a thick \"sauce\" than the hearty cheese that most know and love. Besides the cheese, all the other flavors were there and went well together! You could (almost) not taste the difference from a regular pizza. My mom really favored the Bacon Spinach Mushroom pizza with the white sauce and artichokes, she said both were good but that one was REALLY good.   I really enjoyed this place and wouldn't mind coming back again to order the vegan pizza, it will just take some getting used to the \"cheese\" texture! Customer service was great, they were helpful and I love when the staff makes suggestions. Although the cashier seemed a little new and took awhile to ring up our order, I appreciate everything the workers did to make it an enjoyable first visit."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Service was subpar. They gave out table numbers but you still had to get up and pick up your pizza from the counter. We got wings as well which were very weird. Soft (mushy almost)  and not much sauce.  Probably won't return, but who knows? Wasn't terrible enough to disregard this place forever."}
{"text":"Last week, my friend and I went to Z Pizza and had some great thin crust pizzas. She called in the order and asked about the crust being gluten free, which it is. (That was only for a FYI purpose, not because we wanted gluten free). When she placed the order the person let her know that something we got as a topping was not gluten free, which was totally OK with us. She got a call back later from another person letting her know the same info. That is a good customer service touch and we both wanted to give Z Pizza a shout out for taking care of their customers. Plus...their pizzas are really yummy!"}
{"text":"Z Pizza is definitely in the a-ok realm for me.  I like that they have wheat crust available and that is centrally located.  Other than that, I think the prices are a bit high and the ordering system/counter area always seems awkward.    Because of the awesome amounts of gourmet pizza available around town, Z Pizza seems to be one of the only places that you can get a quick pizza to go and not have to end up with a Hot and Ready.  Just an a-ok, middle of the road pizza place."}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Z Pizza and now I can't get enough. I really enjoy the variety they offer but my favorite thing is the pesto sauce!  They rotate through different pizzas that you can get by the slice each day or you can order your favorite full size pizza.  My Kids live this pizza. My picky eater says it is the best pizza she has ever had."}
{"text":"Love Z pizza. Didn't know it was a franchise. They have anchovies, goat cheese, artichoke and all those delicious toppings you won't usually find at big chain pizza stores. Can be pricey though, 3 large size pizza's set me back 56 bucks."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to meet here, I've been before to the place next door (the Pink Spot where they have homemade ice cream, desserts, salads, wraps,ect...)  We sat on the ZPizza side and ordered a veggie pizza with no olives. Service was quick, friendly and helpful. I love a crisp, thin & tasty crust...and this was pretty good!    I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The hubby and I finally made it out to Z Pizza over the weekend.   I ordered the Moroccan and my husband had the Greek pizza. Both pizzas were very tasty. The carmelized onions and pine nuts on the Moroccan were simply yummy!  I think the prices are a little high, but the pizza is pretty good.   There weren't many customers in that night which made for a nice and quiet dinner. The feel of the place seemed pretty laid back to me and I felt comfortable.  The serivce was fast and friendly.   They have a small, but great drink selection, offering Sweet Leaf Teas, Blue Moon, Stella Artois and of course fountain drinks.  I will definitley be back to try their other pizzas out."}
{"text":"Wow, love this place wish we had one of these in CA. Had the turkey sandwich, was wonderful. The pizza looks great, can't wait to come back. Love the beer! You pour your own beer,  Yes! You can do as much or as little as you want or try them all out. I like the Z brew!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain, especially since it wasn't the manager's fault. But if you can't make the delivery at least call so we can decide to cancel the order. Over an hour and a half late, food cold. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Calling all VEGANS! Been dying to try their Vegan pizza and today I finally did. I'm actually still eating it while I post this... and man oh man, it's phenomenal. Since transitioning to a vegan diet, pizza has been what I miss the most (well, besides hot wings). Honestly, you wouldn't guess this was vegan if you didn't know it. So much flavor. Crust is awesome. Service was fantastic also... younger kid served me and was so polite. I will for sure be back to dive into this pizza again! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I did receive a message from ZPizza and was sent the $10 gift certificate. Thank you."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Their Napoli pizza is a vegetarian dream!  I've stopped in and eaten at this location several times and it is always clean and the pizza is hot.  My work has ordered pizza from here for dinner and it arrived hot and tasty.    They have so many different options.  If you're bored with your regular pizza joint, give Z a try."}
{"text":"I have always loved Zpizza. I haven't had it in awhile since the location near me closed and then I became a Vegan and pretty much swore off Pizza.   I heard that they now have a VEGAN pizza and are serving it by the slice this weekend! (5/14-5/16) I went in for a slice and left with 4! It was pretty damn Delicious!  I cant wait to go back and order up my own Vegan creation, Like the ZBQ No chicken, sub vegan cheese, I might just die!   All hail Zpizza for making pizza possible for Vegans!"}
{"text":"I am a first time customer.  I ordered online.  I called in 25 min after I ordered to ensure that I had given them my gate code. At that time I asked how long before it's delivered the young lady said 20 min that they were waiting on the wings. Well 30 minutes later I called and the driver still hadn't left. I was then told that they were making an exception for me because I was out of area that they deliver as if they were doing me a favor. Again I placed the order online.  When the food finally came another 20 min later (totaling an hour and 35 for what was quoted as a 45 min order) the food was burnt to a crisp Cold and hard.  There was nothing cheesy about the cheesy bread at all.  And when I immediately called the manager Brett said 20% off my next order. I spent $44 bucks on the worst food I've ever ordered with bad service like hell I'm ordering again. Woooow!! Definitely thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Pro: Pizzas are tasty and unique. They have their special flavors that you can order compared to other pizza companies especially if you want them gluten free. Their pastas are not that bad either.  Con:  They are very expensive if you want to order a whole box of pizza. Their area of delivery is also small which can be a big hassle since their parking is also small."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Thai pizza sans chicken.  Wow.  Yum!  Anyone that puts bean sprouts on their pizza and can pull it off with flair and taste has to be given kudos!  Great veggie pizza by the slice...there's always one meat, one veg, and cheese...perfect!  Cozy spot to have a beer and grab a slice.  Plus, they usually have a special for two slices and a beer...so even better!"}
{"text":"I really think ZPizza is great! I love the hundreds of choices they give you in creating your pizza! They have the best variety of pizza toppings, sauces, and crusts to choose from! My favorite pizza creation is on whole wheat crust with organic tomato sauce, soy cheese, jalapenos and  veggie sausage on top. It is so good! I also do not feel as guilty eating ZPizza as I do at other pizza joints around town! Thank you Zpizza for being so delicious and great!"}
{"text":"Z Pizza you are nothing special.  Rubbery salty crust.  Your whole pizza is merely so so and your slices border on abysmal.  Staff didn't seem to care if I was there or not.  The owner was there and that was more important than my late lunch order.  Ok you're organic.  Guess what?  I don't care.  When I want pizza I don't want to feel like I am making a healthy compromise.  I only want something tasty and unhealthy.  That's why I'm eating pizza instead of a salad.    Ok you have gluten free options.  The only thing sadder than that is a fat kid with no money staring at a bakery counter.    I don't buy your hype.  Your food is so so at best.  I will continue to order elsewhere."}
{"text":"The husband was so excited about the gluten-free pizza we had last week, that he asked me daily ever since to get another one.  I finaly relented.  So we called and ordered the exact same pizzas: one large SAUSAGE and mushroom and one large gluten-free pepperoni.  The girl on the phone informed us that gluten-free only comes medium. What?!?!?  Then she tells us that the order totals $4 dollars more than last week. ???  Then we start wondering, who was wrong? Was it the guy last week who allegedly gave us a large gluten-free that my husband loved and somehow didn't get sick from, and a onion and mushroom instead of a sausage and mushroom?  Or, the chick who seemed to be on the ball this week?  The order came rather quickly, which was nice.  My pizza was correct this time, and it was just as mediocre as the one last week but with the right ingredients.  The husband's pizza was indeed a medium and it only took one bite for him to realize that the pizza last week was NOT gluten-free.  This pizza had the crust that he anticipated last week, not good.  Not good to the point that he stopped eating the whole slice, pulled off the cheese and pepperoni and fed the crust to the dogs.  We are extremely pleased and incredibly surprised that the gluten-full pizza did not make him sick.  But, the pizza is dissappointing and not worth the $20 for a large pie.  At least now he has realized this, and we will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Trapped downtown on a Sunday and not much open but this.  I ate my meal which is about all I can say.  Staff is indifferent to whomever is in the building (and you will get all kinds!) and the pizza and pasta are mediocre at best.  But hey; what else is open?"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a groupon but unfortunately I can't even use the groupon because the staff never seems to not want to serve. The first time I went I was told that the restroom was out of order, not a big deal...but they did suggest for me to go the restaurants near by and one that is half a mile away to use the restroom. I go outside to the near by ones and all the restaurants where already close. I figure while I do all the walking around and look for the restroom by then they already would have taken the order...but when I got back from restroom adventure it turns out that haven't even taken the order yet. ( my husband was inside the restaurant while I was gone) so we left.  The second time I went there I couldn't order because once again no one takes your order. So I left again. I'm just hoping that groupon refunds me. :("}
{"text":"I'm about to write a review for a restaurant that I've never actually set foot in. Don't report me just yet! I've had their food many times, but solely via delivery to my place of business on multiple occasions.  The pizza offerings are fairly typical, but they do it right. Salads, pastas and sandwiches are also available. I ordered a tuna sandwich from them recently and I'm sad to report it was very disappointing. The bread was stale and the tuna was dry.   \"Well that's what you get for ordering a tuna sandwich at a pizza place!\" you might be saying. I wanted to see if they could pull it off. A for Effort is all I can say. I'd easily order their pizza again at the drop of a hat, though.  Someday I'd like to go in and see what Z Pizza looks like... dare to dream."}
{"text":"Been here twice, loved it both times! Had some type of thai pizza the first time. Very tasty! Second time had a salad, plenty of food for a decent price. And the service was fast! The staff is very very friendly and makes you feel welcome. I brought my dog both times and both times they gave her water. They weren't even scared of her (Great Dane). It's that kind of thing that makes me go back. Probably not my favorite pizza joint, but a good variety of pizza and great location for sure."}
{"text":"Cheese pizza has probably been my favorite food since I was a kid, so my pizza reviews tend to be pretty tough.  I've eaten at Z Pizza a few times, although mostly out of necessity because the pizza shop next door doesn't take debit cards!!!    Z Pizza has a great atmosphere, the staff is always very friendly, and they deliver in a timely manner downtown.  However their pizza is not my favorite.  There is something about their sauce that I just don't like, and the pizza is always pretty greasy.  I can usually make it through one and a half slices before I have to put it down because it just isn't \"scarfable\" to me, which a good pizza should be.  Their salads are pretty good and they have a decent vegetarian selection across the board.  One plus is they sell Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and how can you possibly go wrong there?"}
{"text":"So cute! Live music and self serve alcohol, best combination and such a nice atmosphere! Good people and wine, sign me up! Thanks Alex"}
{"text":"being honest the review is mainly done based on a take out order that I was able to try at a volunteer event from VPA. They brought the veggie, cheese and salami pizzas.   Yes you can definitely taste the difference in the cheese, but if only they could improve a bit more the dough....that would make me feel more happy. I'm a bit picky with the dough and love the thin crisp style. Better if you use whole wheat!"}
{"text":"Organic pizza...that about sums it up for me. Good when hot but gets cold quick and kinda loses its will to be eaten...Good pizza if you wanna go healthy. Johnnys is next door to get a good chicago dog!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming, both professionally and food-wise. May have been better had it not arrived cold and soggy (from sitting out, I'd assume). I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow this place is really on top of things.  We walk in and no one even acknowledges us. After a few mins we ask if we are to be seated or we seat ourselves.  \"Go seat yourself.\" - cashier  While sitting in a completely empty restaurant, a few employees see us but none even come over to ask is what we want to drink or even give us a menu.  Fifteen minutes later we go to the cashier and ask if anyone is going to give us a menu or at least bring over water. He doesn't say anything and just hands us menus.   I say \"No, we're just going to leave.\" His reply is \"There are menus on the tables and I told you to order up here.\"   \"No you told us to seat ourselves, not to order up here. Also there isn't a single menu on a single table.\"   Once again, were the only people in the whole restaurant. The employees literally outnumbered the costumers.   With such stellar costumer service, I'm sure this place will be out of business soon."}
{"text":"Burn-outs and hippies bring pizza and sandwiches right to your door! (I am fortunate enough to live near this location).  At first it was annoying that I would place the order online with explicit instructions for where my apartment was located only to find that the hippie delivery guy from Z would call my cell phone (sometimes I'd hear it ring and sometimes not) for further information.  Hijinx invariably ensue as I verbally administer the same instructions over the phone.  Now I just come to expect that when I order delivery from Z Pizza the guy who brings it to me will have blazed one up in the car on the half mile ride over to my place and will need some help getting to the door.  And then, the order surprise! Until they fixed the online ordering system you truly never knew what would actually be in your custom calzone.  Now it's at least got the right ingredients, although they interpret them a little loosely sometimes (last night, for example, I requested sauce, sauce, and more sauce and they gave me only one tiny cup).   I love the calzone with wheat crust (I love that you can get wheat at all), the turkey sandwich with cranberry, and my husband loves the Santa Fe pizza (which I personally find a little revolting).  The food is tasty and they bring it to my house.  I like that.  It's better than ordering from Pizza Megalopolis or some other insanely corporatized chain.  Even though Z is a chain they \"keep it real\" and operate like a mom and pop.  Plus they keep our local Granola Crowd employed so they can turn around and spend their cash at other local spots.    Gotta love the Z."}
{"text":"The pizza is so good. The redesign of the store is too! Why is the music so bad? I can't bear to sit here any longer...I don't know if I'll come back to eat here. Awful bro country...ugh. Ruins my appetite."}
{"text":"Coming from California where the ZPizza concept was started this ZPizza franchise is among the best run and highest quality. Having run restaurants it's not easy but this husband and wife run a great shop. We've been here many times and is my son's favorite place. Try any of their pizzas, as they are all really good. If you happen to go on a Tuesday you buy a pizza and get the second for $2."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff & helpful. good food & very good value. Salads are great! Place is well kept, clean."}
{"text":"Both times I called, I spoke to the owner, Stephen, and his condescending response and tone on the last call was completely unacceptable.  My order was over 20 minutes late from the delivery time advised (1:50pm). I called the first time at 1:59pm, offered to come pick it up and was told he is on the way. Then, I called against 2:10pm and instead of just letting me (the customer) know that he will call him (the delivery  guy) to see what's going on, said \"let me call to make sure he's not been in an accident\" so I asked him if deliveries are made by car to which he responded, \"...depends on whether there is one or two orders but I will call to make sure he hasn't been in an accident (again!).  He said this twice on the same call.   When the delivery guy came he stated he doesn't drive to bring the orders - he walks because it's in within walking distance. Being the owner and knowing what orders come through the restaurant, he would have known that the delivery guy was not driving.   Either way, please tell me, at what point is it okay to make the customer feel guilty about calling to check up on an order that was 20 minutes late from the scheduled delivery time by using such a tactic?   This was my first experience in ordering food from ZPizza for delivery, never had a pick up order done but have visited a few times in person - with no complaints. After my experience with this situation (and it was not the fact that the order was late but how it was handled), I will never order anything via phone or online and will never set foot in ZPizza again especially the one on Monroe Street, Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love being able to get a slice of pizza whenever I feel, but I wish that they had a waitress that wasn't as condescending during the entire order process. Strictly transactional, doesn't really talk to you, and sends you off on your way with some fine vegetarian eats. I really love the food there, the salads even are amazing, and with better service, it would have been a 5 star. They should be lucky they don't work for tips!"}
{"text":"$1.65/ oz. for salad.  I bought a pear and gorgonzola salad to go. Price: $7.04.  I was shocked at how small the salad was and complained. They could do \"nothing\" about it.   When I got back to my office, I weighed the salad.  With paper plate, plastic cover, and the small plastic container of dressing on the side .....  7.2 ounces.  When I had finished the salad I weighed the plate, etc. They came to exactly 3 ounces. So the actual salad weighed 4.2 ounces.  That comes to about $1.65/ounce.  A ripoff."}
{"text":"Okay, there is absolutely no reason zPizza should be dead on a Friday night.  The pizza is amazing, the staff is amazing, AND you get to pour your own beer or wine.  What's not to like? We stopped in on our way to a game because we had a Groupon.  We will be returning because of all the reasons I mentioned above.    We thought we had already found our favorite pizza in AZ but we may be rethinking that now.  We decided on the American.  I'm really picky about sausage on my pizza, but this sausage was delicious! And did I mention the crust? Oh my, that crust! It's nice and crispy on the bottom and although thin, not thin enough to be considered a thin crust. I'm not sure if I've ever had pizza crust that perfect and delicious.  And there are SO many delicious sounding options available.  Vegan? No problem! Gluten free? No problem! Meat lover? No problem! Just want a slice? No problem! And everything is so fresh.  I honestly can't wait to return.    Then, of course, there's the beer (and wine if you want it). You are given a card and you can just go to town.  You can do tastings. You can pour a glass or two.  However you want to do it.  Just pay based on what you drink.  You really are doing yourself a disservice if you're in the area and don't stop in.  Just saying..."}
{"text":"Wonderful little pizza place full of personality. Service was outstanding, food was fantastic, and beers were FULL. Great music playing and awesome lighting. Very sweet, helpful staff with knowledge of menu. Perfect pizza date night for a Friday night. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I really like the joint, but the food is hit or miss. The staff is very accommodating & I dig the location & the vibe inside is cool."}
{"text":"Pour your own beer!? YES PLEASE! I love that this establishment is advanced in the way how you drink. You pay for what you drink. Is it expensive? Well, that depends you lush. I, a lush as well, drank 1 FULL glass of wine and two beers that came out to $19 dollars. So roughly you're paying 6.33 per drink. So really you're paying the average price for a beer. But the plus side is you get to taste over 10 different beers and they change the taps! So if you love variety, this is the place. The ambience is cool as well. The outdoor patio is roomy and has a great view of the downtown area.   Now lets get down to the food. The pizza was excellent! We paid $25 for a x-large half carnivore half veggie pizza and it was exquisite! Crunchy yet gooey. The perfect consistency. I would definitely come back but during happy hour, 3-6 pm weekdays. Cheaper to drink and eat then. hee hee."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience trying zPizza for the first time! Purchased a Groupon to go with husband and two friends and it was a phenomenal deal. I would recommend purchasing one to try it out. We are definitely adding this to our list of favorite pizza restaurants so thanks Groupon. My favorite thing about zPizza in addition to the delicious food is the self serve beer taps. We were a little confused at first but our host showed us how to use the taps. You pay by the ounce so you can try different things. I tried the pear cider and the hard root beer. They also have wine. The prices are very reasonable and about $8-$10 of pour per person got us each two large glasses and we were feeling very nice! The hard root beer is awesome. The Groupon came with side salads which were Cesar and what I appreciated about them was the fact that they had just a touch of dressing and it wasn't too strong. We shared pizzas and the one I ate was a mushroom pizza with three types of mushrooms. It was very fresh and flavorful. Tasted gourmet. Crust was thin but not too thin and burnt. I would say right in the middle. The location is convenient in downtown Phoenix and they have a nice outdoor patio. We will be back! Our guests had a great time and our host was so friendly and explained everything to us."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked into the restaurant to the moment i left, I felt the food and the service lacked passion. The gentleman taking the order was very monotone and it seemed like the staff just got out of a meeting where everyone got in trouble. I ordered the meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. The food came out within 10 minutes which was great but when i took a bite of the meatball sub and the pizza, It was bland. It needed salt and pepper. I will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Good pizza ... they deliver to downtown ... cute restaurant with TVs and the local paper for your enjoyment ... two slices and soda for something like $4.99 ... nice addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Sadly Z Pizza is currently the best slice in downtown. It's \"just fine\" pizza and they have reasonably priced daily slice specials.  Take note: This place gets some serious lines during the weekday lunch periods (proof enough these are the best slices in the vicinity)."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad....the lunch deals are great.   You can pick 2 or 3 items.  Pizza, salad or small sandwich.  Prices were great compared to the area.  Food was good and service was fast.  Went pizza and salad combo."}
{"text":"The pizza is very delicious and the ingredients are fresh. The gluten free crust is good."}
{"text":"Great pizza with awesome staff! Ordered the veggie and the Thai chicken. I was happy with the veggie but would return for the Thai! Great customer service."}
{"text":"i hate going to places that i can goto near home, in Phx for the Cubs games.. but my daughter wanted pizza and we saw Z and had to go becuz we know how good it is. I like this one alot better then ours."}
{"text":"Z Pizza is one of the best places I have discovered. Mainly because I don't like tomatoes, and Z is not totally about tomatoes either. There are so many items on their menu I have not been disappointed with, from Pesto pizza to cheesy bread to salad!! All of them tomato free.  The best feature though I have to say is their insanely easy to use online ordering. Being in the user experience industry, I'm frustrated with online ordering 95% of the time. Z makes me happy though. I actually sometimes miss them if I don't order occasionally. You can customize any item with almost anything you can think of and it's very easy to walk through. They also let you know up front if you are too far away for their delivery services so you don't sign up anyway.  I love you. I love you. I love you. And your use of fun ingredients like bacon and pine nuts and mushrooms :)"}
{"text":"I started going here after our son was born at St Joe's hospital a few doors down.  I like the atmosphere and that there are some more exotic pizza options on the menu than most other places.  Probably still not as healthy as a grilled chicken salad, but the ingredients lists make me think I'm eating healthy.    We order delivery now and then, and have always been well satisfied.  My only critique is I wish there were more specials and deals.    Yesterday our family received a soggy mess of a pizza that we ordered from a well known national chain located not far from Z's Thomas Rd location.  Maybe they're not a local Arizona business, but Z's is my pizza place of choice whenever there is a location close by!  Never again will we order from those other guys."}
{"text":"I like this place even if it's a chain. It is pricey (or at least more pricey than the other guys) but the pizza is great with topping options you can't get anywhere else (sun dried tomatoes, ricotta cheese, capers, etc)."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a tasty gluten free pizza for lunch. Had the highly rated Pomo earlier this week and can't help but compare. I've got to say the GF pizza at Zpizza tastes better--sauce is better, cheese is thicker and more delicious, and finally the crust has a better texture (good combination of doughy and crunchy). Only problem is that I wish there was more to eat of the lip smacking good pizza. Not sure some of these folks are complaining about as far as service, I have found this place to be consistently attentive, quick and kind. Looking forward to checking out their live music Fridays and self pour taps sometime after business hours."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Nothing to write home about, but it's a busy little place with quick lunch service.  They had lunch specials and I got the 2 slices with a drink.  The salads looked good too and I overheard a lady saying her salad was really good.  The sandwiches looked ok too-sort of Jimmy Johns-ish."}
{"text":"No doubt the pizza is excellent here, but the service sucks! The first time I went there, there was a line outside the door. To their credit both registers were manned, but when it came to be my turn, the cashier (Asian female) decided she didn't want to do any more work and just wandered off. When she decided to come back, she spent the next 15 minutes chatting to her friend on her phone. Eventually she decided to serve me and got the order wrong. Gee thanks for nothing lady.   The second time I decided to call the order in. Hello Z Pizza, can you hold? Can you hold some more? Hello can you hold? Unfortunately they don't wait for you to answer before putting you on hold, so you are SOL. I began the call when I was a 30 minute drive from the place and finished the call in their parking lot. I walk in expecting the place to be slammed, but no, it's dead. More employees than customers and guess what, they're chat, chat, chatting away - with each other.   This place would be great with an effective manager in place. Or maybe just any manager"}
{"text":"Deserves its place at the bottom of your Yellow pages listing for Pizza. Wishing it were \"ZZZ Pizza\".  --slices on display better suited for a museum of ancient antiquity; --a FRESHLY made pizza (oh HELL, you didn't think I was gonna let you serve me that faded crap I coulda found in the corner of my little brother's dorm room, did you?!!!), two beers and a small salad for $50???!!! several four letter words come to mind, just for you. --finished dough little better than a microwaved Starbuck's panini. --greasy crust wishes it could rise to deserve a Peter Piper Pizza box.  --BLARING commercial TV (yes, that means commercials) invades your attempt at conversation while... --staff stand idly doing nothing. --unclean restrooms make you wonder how clean the kitchen is.  shame on all of you (no, not you, YOU. yeah you know who you are) who told me I _have_ to try Z Pizza: you really need to try this great restaurant nearby called \"Diamonds\"."}
{"text":"some of the specialty pies are ok, but the slices are overpriced AND OH DEAR LORD DO NOT EVER ORDER THE WINGS. they are the worst wings i have ever had. not crisp at all, im pretty sure they were cooked then left in hot storage. gummy, gooey, these are not words a wing afficiando wants to hear."}
{"text":"Whenever I order pizza, it's almost always from Z Pizza. Everything is fresh and delicious and the wait is never long.   I really enjoy eating there as well because of all of the options they have available. From vegan pizza to sub sandwiches, whatever you may be in the mood for, they've got it.   I'm actually on a personal mission to find the best pizza place in town and so far, Z Pizza is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"The pizza was good delivery pizza. The wings were affordable and 87% chicken fat on a bone. The wings were a soft, greasy mess that I ended up trying to roast off in the oven."}
{"text":"I had to go into work a little later later than usual on Sunday, and in my mistiming I forgot to grab the sandwich I made for lunch. With such a limited selection of places in downtown Phoenix open on weekends, I figured Z Pizza to the rescue.   When I arrived I was very disappointed to see the slice selection was limited to cheese (which I did not see any slices of ready), pepperoni, and sausage and mushroom. Not having the time or desire to have them make me an entire pie, I decided to settle for a sub combo (subs, chips, and a drink). I went with the super sub, which was pretty much a typical Italian grinder. Nothing special, but not bad.   I still give Z Pizza credit for being open on Sundays. But next time I decide to stop in on the weekend, I'm going to have to take the time to call ahead."}
{"text":"I love window shopping. I love window fooding. Yes, I will spend my meals not people watching, but food watching.   What's great about Z Pizza is that you can order by the slice AND choose from their ready made pizzas on display. But be warned, everything looks good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. All organic. Tastes great and even offers.wheat. dough. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff. Cute little spot. The mushroom pizza was so delicious and the root beer-beer was awesome."}
{"text":"First time being here and it was obvious to most of the patrons so be prepared when you come! There was only one menu along side where the line forms so it was a bit hard to take your time making a decision.   The crew seemed a bit lost and hectic (maybe because of busy lunch hour) but were very friendly.   The pizza was great! A lot of options that were unique or you can build your own. The prices were a bit steep though just for a pizza. There was a $5-$8 lunch special.   The ambiance was very trendy and the outside seating area was perfect for people watching. Although they had two TVs I wouldn't recommend for watching the big game or anything. The mood was a bit too relaxed for that.   Overall, the pizza was good and the service was good. I would recommend it if you're looking for more trendy versus money saving meal."}
{"text":"The first time the pizzas were awesome and we felt like we finally had a solid pizza spot especially since they could deliver, but the second time it was just okay. The wings weren't cooked all the way and had no crisp. The barbecue pizza was decent but nothing to brag about. Where doing to give this place one more chance. Will see what happens."}
{"text":"Nasty and cold. If you're not ordering pizza that has been sitting under the heater for awhile, then you'll be waiting for quite some time to receive your order. My mistake of ordering pizza that has been sitting for too long because it was gross."}
{"text":"Amazing place! With a great atmosphere and very kind employees. I had a wonderful experience last night. The food was outstanding as well. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I like this place and the layout of this establishment is cute and clean. As far as the pizza goes, I've never been dissapointed. I like their pizzas better than Domino's. They are next to the Pink Spot and they have free WI-FI.  It's a great place where it feels like you know everyone even though you're just there.  They also deliver in downtown phoenix, so it's great for me..  Bottom Line:  Comfortable. Comfort food, comfortable people, and a comfortable layout. Everything I need is right there."}
{"text":"I have to give this pizza joint some credit. I've been coming to this place a lot, so it's time to give them my yelp review.  This place is within walking distance from my apartment and I usually get their salads. Not the usual salads that you get from other pizza places. Salads here are different and a lot more creative. I usually get the Arugula and the Pear Gorgonzola which are both equally tasty, healthy and delicious.  I also love that they have gluten-free crust and vegan ingredients. My niece can't have wheat, so having this option is important. I'm glad more and more places like this are serving gluten free foods.  The slices of pizzas that have been sitting there are not that good though. Go build your own and have it freshly made. The Vegan pizza with gluten free crust is quite tasty and delectable.  Prices are reasonable, establishment is clean and the staff is pretty nice.  Overall, I have to give them 5 stars for having great prices for tasty slices, edible salads and the reasons I mentioned above!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, and each time, I fall in love with this place a little more.  Today I had a slice of the bbq chicken pizza for the first time.  Wow.  I've had bbq chicken pizza one other time, many moons ago, and the taste almost sent me to the bathroom.  But this?  This right here?  Oh my.  Sweet and savory and spicy all at once.  And of course I love their crust with the bit of garlic at the end.  It really made my day.   I also had the Napoli for the second time.  I think this might be my favorite...wait no, the Casablanca is my favorite...no, the bbq chicken...DOH! Seriously, I've never had this type of pizza, meaning thin crust gourmet.  I'm used to the big, pan crust pizza pies.  This is a treat, though it will not replace my love for pies.  It will be a new love affair. Last thing, I'm continually impressed with the freshness of their ingredients.  I've never had tomatos so sweet or mushrooms that I would eat by themselves.  Awesome stuff."}
{"text":"We tend to order the Napoli and add pepperoni.  My ideal pizza is more along the thinner crusted east coast variety than the thicker pan pizza approach.  Z Pizza makes it the way I like it.  The crust is great.  There have been a couple of times when the pizza seemed a little greasy, though.    I also make pizza at home and have gotten pizza dough from Z Pizza -- this when Trader Joe's decided to stop selling dough -- and will now always buy my dough at Z Pizza.    Ordering delivery over the internet works flawlessly."}
{"text":"Seriously pour your own beer and wine on tap and pay by the ounce. So innovative!!!!  Great service and you can scan a barcode at your table and order from your phone. Bags (cornhole) on the patio. This is downtowns best kept secret for sure."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent pizza joint. A little bit out of my price range to make it a regular habit, but worth the splurge every now and then. You get what you pay for right? It's almost always super busy when you go, so we made it a habit to order ahead of time. Still have to wait in line to pick it up, but at least it's made already. You can really tell the difference between this place and your regular neighborhood pizza assembly line."}
{"text":"Although our piza and salad was delightful, we had the Pear and Walnut salad and the Pizza Napoli, the staff was kind of smug and unfriendly!!  We called before going, at 8:45pm, to see how late they served and were told 10pm.  We arrived at 9:35.  The girl said, \"you know we close at 10 right?\"  We told her we would eat quickly.  She replied, \"I have to mop the floor, but we have a big party back there so you should be alright\".  I found this a very unpleasant way to begin our visit here.  I mean it wasn't like we walked in a 9:55 and expected 5 star service.  After all, it is only pizza and salad.  Anyway, I let it slide.  Then, when the guy brought us our pizza, I had noticed a \"New Times, Best Pizza Winner\" sign, so I asked him if they had won this year.  He smugly said, \"Oh, I'm sure several years\".  I thought that was a crappy way to answer my question, since I am very familiar with these awards and didn't remeber them winning ever.  Apparently they one the reader's poll once back in 2007.  Whatever.  I might go back cuz the salad was bomb."}
{"text":"I love Z Pizza!   I go here all the time with my coworkers. They have great lunch specials. I always get a slice with a salad and drink for around $7."}
{"text":"I wanted a slice and a salad after 9 p.m. on a Sunday. zpizza fit the bill. At $12, it was a little steep, but the food was decent. The staff were friendly but seemed a bit shocked to see anyone walking in. I also overheard an employee telling a delivery order that pizza would take more than an hour to arrive, but they might have just been short a driver."}
{"text":"This was the 7th stop on the dine around.   I'd give it 3.5, but due to our \"dine and dash\", I can't completely qualify my experience just yet. We came here for the napoli pizza and waited a few minutes for a fresh pie to come out of the oven. I really liked the feel of the place, and the menu was pretty expansive and looked good.  Oh, I do have to say the guy at the register was super nice, and so was everyone behind the counter. We got our slices and I haven't had many white pizzas, but this was really good. The crust was delish and the ingredients were really fresh. I'll definitely hit this place up again in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible service, came in on a Sunday with my husband and two kids. Ordered one she's fine and waited for 30 minutes, my kids are so impatient we came up to az and they didn't even put the pizza in the oven while there was only three other people sitting in the pizzeria. Clearly they're not ready to cater to the public. We were so irritated at that point that we did not want to stay there, we asked for a refund and left. Apparently were not the first family of the day to ask for refund Because of their poor service. Definitely never going back there again"}
{"text":"My new'wings to go'joint.   Ordered 2 dozen wings~ barbecue & naked~. Baked to perfection."}
{"text":"Chronically late with GrubHub orders (30 - 45 mins), accepts GrubHub orders past closing time, leaving me to wait.. where's my order?? GrubHub listed phone number is disconnected. Get your act together!  Will not be ordering from your store again!"}
{"text":"How I love thee...Great for the vegetarian and vegan. A little pricey but worth the extra cash when you're used to getting crappy pizza. I rather pay extra for the good stuff. Delivery is fast and they always found my apartment, even in the alley. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Fresh ingredients and flavorful crust made this small yet inviting places my favorite near office go to!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot when the Pink Spot was next door. Management must have changed a lot because they don't even have a menu to look at when you order, and they didn't even understand the types of items on the menu. It said \"select sauce\" and there were two different marinara sauces and we wanted the one with more spices. It was called \"robust\" sauce and I don't know why she didn't understand me, but she took the menu from me as if I was wrong. The pizza was slightly undercooked and wayyyyy too expensive. They also had a deal for an XL pizza at a L price but she didn't offer me it and we were stuck with our smaller subpar pizza. Seems like quality has taken a dive over the years."}
{"text":"For the price, for the niche, this place is good. I enjoy the 2 slice 20 oz drink lunch combo. I like to keep it simple here, the ingredients are good, simple good ingredients will always pay off. This place isn't the 5 star pizzeria but it sells slices and delivers to my doorstep. Stick to the pizza and enjoy the price and convenience."}
{"text":"I  hate you, Z. It's over between us, for good this time. I am never patronizing your venue again.   The pizza you delivered was a complete mess. Did someone drop it? I want to know who the guilty one is. The driver, maybe? He didn't say anything.  I was stupid for not checking the order before paying and TIPPING, but you will not get me again. That was the last straw."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday afternoon the guy that was there was very nice. Place was empty. Decided to get a slice while waiting for my pie. A girl was available to take my order then she put my slice on a plate. I asked her to please heat it up she said it just came out of the oven, I touched it with it was cold. She then pitched a huge attitude grabbing the slice with tongs placing it in the oven for barely 45 seconds. Again grabbing it out with the tongs angrily, toppings falling on the floor. Needless it was still cold and half the slice I ordered. Get rid of her."}
{"text":"What I am about to say is going to be both hard to believe and incredibly shocking, but true. Completely, utterly, and brutally honest. Ready?  I would rather Z Pizza than any other thing on this planet. More than food, fame, wealth, love, sex, beauty... need I go on?  I have heard some less-than-stellar things about Z Pizza, so I have been giving my business (not THE business) to Pizza Heaven, but one fateful night I took an elevator ride with a Z Pizza delivery man who explained that they have both gluten free crust AND vegan cheese. It was awkward being that I had a Pizza Heaven equivalent literally right in my hand, but the delivery dude handled it with poise and handed me a magnetic business card.  Well, today it is rainy and I'm drunk and I was hungry and I didn't want to drive, so I gave Z Pizza a chance and I am so happy I did because my life changed today.   Let me repeat that: MY LIFE CHANGED TODAY  This pizza, despite it being abnormal in every way possible, was the most delicious culinary specimen I have put in my mouth in MONTHS. Get the Mexican (sans chicken and sour cream, of course)... you owe it to yourself. You really, seriously do.  I love this pizza so much that in future trysts, I will fantasize about this pizza instead of my lover. I really will.  I hate this review because I cannot even articulate the words to do this pizza justice. I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!  Oh, and PS... when I ordered they told me 45-60 minutes and it was here within 30. That's better than finding a rich guy that dresses well, doesn't have mommy issues, and is straight up hung.   Did I just say that?"}
{"text":"Phoenix has some of the best pizza in the world (oddly enough), and this chain simply doesn't hold up to the competition. In fact, a few steps down the street is another pizza joint which easily blows Z away.   I first had Z Pizza in Long Beach and I thought it was pretty good. That was in Long Beach. It just doesn't cut it against the many unique pizza bistros that litter the valley.   The pepperonis were a little flavorless. The sausage was decent, but nothing special. The crust was fine. The cheese and sauce were also nothing special. It's nice that there's a connected ice cream shop if you want to eat a bunch of cheese and bread and grease and then chase it with a bowl if sugar and cream.   To be honest - while I was eating it, I couldn't help but think that it was extremely overpriced. Right down the street was a better pizza place using better ingredients and costing less. I actually felt like I would rather be eating Peter Piper Pizza if that says anything.  The place was pretty clean even though it was busy. The staff was nice and friendly as well. It's not bad pizza at all - it's just nothing special."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. The customer is what is lacking. Hey if you want to order a pizza online and pick it up, make sure you check periodically to see if it is ready. I waited 36 minutes for my pizza which was in the warming oven. He response I got was ,\"oh I guess it got lost\". Thanks for wasting my lunchtime Zpizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, they are fancy.  Z Pizza received my attention after received a door hanger.  Z-Pizza his really opened my trust to direct marketing.   Also check out their website its really clean.   Open late, this is a rare trait in the valley my thank yous to all restaurants open late for those late night munches."}
{"text":"Staff was super nice! The pizza was delicious, one of the BEST gluten free crusts I've had. My kids even enjoyed it, they both ate 3 pieces which never happens considering they are 5 & 3. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am surprised by some of the negative reviews for Z-Pizza. I've been coming here since I was in high school and have never had a bad experience. They have great lunch specials, and the ingredients always taste fresh. It's also pretty reasonably priced for what you get. I usually order a small pizza and a salad, which comes out to $12-15 depending on what I order, and I can get 2 meals out of it depending on how hungry I am.  My favorite pizzas are the Santa Fe, Chicken Sausage and Arugula, and American. There's also a good selection of toppings if you want to build your own. I love that you can also get any pizza on gluten free crust, which is actually really good. The salads are great too, especially with the chipotle ranch dressing.  I've also recently become a big fan of their delivery. You can order online, there's not a delivery charge, and there's no minimum order. It always seems to come pretty quickly.   My only dislikes are some of the non-pizza items. I got an order of Parmesan Flatbread Sticks a week or two ago and they kind of tasted just like plain pizza crust. The wings are also pretty bad. They don't really have any sauce and have absolutely no spice or flavor."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 rusticas for delivery using their buy-one-get-one promo online. They had a great deal on rustica pizzas, but somewhere in the fine print (after our delivery) we realize that the 2-for-1 offer was limited to 1 order only. This caused lots of waiting time as the delivery boy cleared it up. They honoured the 2-for-1 so we were happy. Pretty good pizza. I like the crust. The curry chicken yam rustica and the Mediterranean were my favourites. Nothing super amazing but definitely better than your run-of-the-mill pizza joint. A great price if you get a promo deal."}
{"text":"Pizza here is delicious and service is awesome. My favorite pie is the Casablanca minus the mushrooms and add sausage. Delicious!  My food was ready to go when I was told to pick it up, which is something most pizza places can't seem to get right."}
{"text":"Young girl at the counter needs to learn some customer service... I continue to come cause it's convenient and sometimes tasty..."}
{"text":"So bummed usually very good but tonight my pizza was watery and not done in middle. Ur delivery is better than this . Had to try n rebake didn't work ! Yuck"}
{"text":"FOOD: The pizza is a little thin for my liking but it tastes great and the sauce is yummy. I had to blot off the grease with a napkin becuase it was a little much for me. The salad was fantastic. The salad is composed of mixed greens- no the yucky iceberg you usually get. Even the basic salad that can come with the pizza was huge. I could have just ordered the salad.    AMBIANCE Nothing special about the inside of the place. There are a few TVs that you can watch while you eat- if you like that sort of thing.   The only major drawback was that they kept the doors open (it was nice outside) but there were gnats all over the place- kinda gross."}
{"text":"Z PIzza - wow you let me down!!  We eat zpizza somewhat regularly, Not my favorite but the wife likes it so if we are having pizza this usually it.  In phoenix for business, went to grab lunch at the 53 West Thomas location.  Service: the service was ok, a young man that was very eager to help us took our order quickly.  Order: I ordered the California salad, trying to eat light for lunch to combat the 118 day heat of the day. The order came out quickly and they called my name.  I picked up the food and after a quick glance..realized there must be a mistake. I think you gave me a side salad I mentioned to the manager. He looked at the salad and stated no that's the California salad. I mentioned the price as a question. \"This is 11 dollars?\"   His reply \"no, wait did you get a drink?\" Me \"yes\" Mgr \"then yes 11\"  The salad contained roughly 1.5 cups of mixed greens, 4 slices of cucumber, 1/4 of an avocado, 2 narrow slices of tomato and a few black olives. Easily contained in a side salad bowl.  I didn't want to make a big issue out of it, but I did advise him this seems like a very high price for a very small and plain food, and that zpizza may get the better end of the deal today, it would be my last visit.  BTW Mr. Manager - you probably shouldn't serve customers very small portions and then justify the price and the portions while holding your personal salad that looks like it would fill the grand canyon. You should treat your customers the same way you treat yourself.  My co-worked also felt the same way, to the point he had to pick up lunch two on the way back the office."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! They were out of vegan cheese so I went without cheese and they gave me an extra topping and a free vegan cookie!  Fast service even though I showed up 45 minutes to closing."}
{"text":"I like to think of Z Pizza as the pizza chain for people who think they are being healthy and \"cool\" when they put fresh veggies on a pizza. I ordered a couple times when I used to live at 3rd street and Thomas and they would deliver to my house. I have to say, when they opened this location, I started thinking back to all my previous experiences and wasn't really that excited about this one opening, but it is something new nonetheless.   I went in for lunch one day, and ordered a couple of slices, with a drink. It was like $6 and I was extremely..... extremely dissapointed. The girls behind the counter were very helpful, but that seemend to be the end of it. The pizza came out very quickly, which made me wonder to begin with but the damn things were still somewhat cold... and rock hard. It was some of the shittiest pizza slices I'd had in a long time. Most places are just warming up already made pizza, and at a lot of places it still rocks. NOT HERE.   I'm sure the experience might be different if I ordered a whole pizza, but they wont deliver to my house 5 blocks away so I'm not gonna try. Hey, dumbasses, buy a $75 bicycle with a pizza rack on it and offer to deliver to local homes and businesses within like a half a mile. I GUARANTEE you will make your $75 investment back in a couple weeks or less.   I have a totally indifferent opinion of the place, but would give it 4 stars if they got a bicycle delivery system in place."}
{"text":"Good pizza. The pizza that has artichokes and fresh mozzarella on it is amazing. Was a bit hesitant with it but they came through with a job well done."}
{"text":"Z Pizza, oh, how I love thee! What can I say? Fresh ingredients. Good service. Not terribly expensive. If you're looking for a quick pizza fix look no further than Z."}
{"text":"Love the gluten-free options and late hours, thanks!"}
{"text":"I  have been to this establishment before and i was obsessed. The pizza was solid,  and I was super amped to eat here again tonight. OMG, can you say  totally grossed out by this place. The chick who was cooking did not have a hair net on, and she was freely shaking her hair over the food. WTF! Are hair nets or even hats for line workers  a thing of the past? No gloves either.... And to top it off, she took her bare hands and touched her hair......right in front of the customers and continued doing her thing. What the hell? I am never eating here again...yuck"}
{"text":"Love the gluten free aspect. Pepperoni or Veggie is my go too. By the slice, when available... Seems like someone new is always at the register and is slow as molasses. What's up with that Z Pizza? Get on the mailing list. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Z pizza is outstanding value for gourmet pizza. I usually go here for lunch as I work downtown and its just a quick walk. For 7 bucks you can get two slices and a soda not too bad. On average there are about 6 speciality slices to choose from. Today I ate the Moroccan and the Italian followed by a single slice of pepperoni. The staff is super friendly and the little pizza place is nice and clean. This is a good place to enjoy lunch and have a view of the light rail. It makes you feel like you are truly in a metro! Pizza is a little bit buttery, the slices are thin and the toppings are fresh. Good Pizza!"}
{"text":"Damn good pizza at a fair price plus you can get beer or wine!!!!!! Really what more can you ask for when eating pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great atmosphere! Don't take my word for it? Stop by and find out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why people don't like this place but I love it.  I am so happy they put one downtown finally.    Their sauce is a very sweet marinara.  If you don't like sweet, I can understand why you wouldn't like the pizza.  You can get about 4 different kinds of mushrooms on your pizza as well.  The topper is that you can get ricotta cheese on any pizza or calzone.  I personally always get a calzone with ricotta, mozzarella, black olives, portabella mushrooms, and italian sausage.  It is the most wonderful calzone ever.  The wife usually gets a pasta or a peperoni pizza.  She loves both.  The Thomas location also has an ice cream shop attached to it which is nice.  Usually the staff is knowledgeable and the cooks are consistent.  The Thomas location is also usually full of doctors or nurses which always makes for interesting conversation."}
{"text":"You rawk my chain Z. Can I call you Z? Like when I'm hanging with Oprah and I call her O. She gets a kick out of that. Listen. You goofed up a little a few weeks ago and omitted the sausage on my pizza. I was cranky and rattled off an email to corporate. Just cuz it wasn't the first time. And, well, it was my time of the month. I'm in the biz so I wrote a constructive, non-cursing email. Not only did I hear back from the owner...turns out we hang in the same circle. So, last night I took advantage of a discount, ordered my za, spoke with a very cool, helpful manager and got the pizza of my dreams delivered. Along with some sweets from Pink Spot...see review below...pizza and ice cream sandwiches...DELIVERED...in Phoenix...merits and update, a shout out and when I win my Academy Award, I will mention you. Z. Later."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars on the pizzas, but THREE STARS on the service. I waited 15 minutes to be greeted and to get my order... Her having a conversation with her co workers being drunk last night was more important I guess.lolz  Anyways.  The Moroccan pizza with the best pizza I've ever had, who knew to put pine nuts on your pizza:)) The mushroom and cheese pizza was mediocre. But it was still good, we sat in the pink spot side. Which was the ice cream shop. Super cute, love the environment. I love all the books :))  I end up getting the cappuccino crunch ice cream. It was magnificent. I shall come back for that!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. I ordered two slices for lunch and it was delicious. They have lunch specials and a variety of slices to choose from. Within walking distance from the light rail and ASU downtown campus. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just went in to grab a small pizza after a 12 hour work day. Ordered a Casablanca WITHOUT mushrooms. Girl behind the counter even repeated it to me.....when I picked it up they repeated again NO MUSHROOMS and even opened the box to look at it...get home, SURPRISE!!!! MUSHROOMS. Baked all into this pizza. Thanks for the fungus. Make sure you check your pizza before you leave....."}
{"text":"First time I had ZPizza in a while. Customer service was horrible. Started when we walked in and not one person greeted us. I was ready to order and the girl that helped me seemed like I was bothering her. I order two slices of pizza with no drink. (I wasn't not aware of their specials.) I found a table and waited for my food. When the girl came with my food she dropped the food off and walked away. After the same thing happened with my friends, they asked why I didn't get the lunch special (that was two dollars cheaper for the same food including a drink). This made me angry that the girl who took my order did not mention this."}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco. I made an order to surprise my boyfriend who lives in Phoenix and they did it perfectly. And my boyfriend said the pizza was really good. I am really pleased with their service"}
{"text":"First of all, the pizza and salads at this place are great.  Very innovative, fresh and they just taste really good.  I've read some of the other reviews and they talk about it all being healthy/organic, which is true, but they have the run of the mill stuff too.    The biggest reason for my 5-star review though is that we always get tremendous service when we go here.  A while ago we were there and they had just put a wonderful looking pizza on our table...we coudn't wait to tear into it.  Then my 2 year old kicked the table really hard and the pizza fell on the ground.  Inside of about 3 seconds they came up and helped clean it up, and then put another one in the oven for us at no charge.  We didn't even get an ounce of crap from them about it!  I was very, very impressed and we now make this place part of our routine when we can because of it.  The fantastic pizza and salads are just a bonus, as far as I'm conerned!"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a place that delivers late Downtown. Z Pizza saved my life! I was really sick at home and needed to eat but could not leave my bed. I didn't want just pizza. I noticed Z Pizza had salads, sandwiches, etc. I was able to order online.... adding/removing any ingredients I wanted. They delivered within 30 minutes and the food did NOT taste like take-out. My calzone was fresh and amazing...as was my salad.   I highly recommend dining in or taking out from Z Pizza! They make life easy, and might I add, HEALTHY if you'd like. You can substitute veggie burger crumbles or wheat crust on pretty much anything. Last but not least: the staff was incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! I can count on ZPizza for a healthy, quick and cost effective lunch in a clean and friendly environment.  The menu has many options aside from tasty pizza. They never disappoint and I'm glad they are a stone throw away from work."}
{"text":"This is, in fact, a 2.5 star review and the only reason it's not lower is because I have had a moderately pleasing experience here prior to the most recent. Said most recent experience was about 20 minutes until close on a Sunday night. I suppose we chose the worst time to go, but the pizza they served us and that we paid about $30 for had probably been sitting in the warmer for 4+ hours. So in other words, it should have been in the garbage hours before we got there and in no fewer words than necessary, epic fail Z Pizza.   I do wish success for this place as it is a nice addition to the downtown area, but please implement some quality control. I will give them one more shot, though."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about here. Ordered a couple pizzas one Saturday afternoon, walked to pick it up and literally waited another 45 minutes when they told me it would only be 15. Pizza was a bit pricey for really nothing spectacular. $40 for two pizzas. I noticed most people in there eating were ordering it by the slice, so maybe that's a better way to go. With many more pizza selections in the area, this place is just mediocre."}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, it's extremely difficult to find good pizza here.  I live less than a mile away from Z, and I'm grateful to have found it! I love the toppings!  They even have a white pizza, which nobody east of Lake Erie seems to know about! The staff is always friendly.  I like going there by myself, reading the paper or New Times, and chatting with the staff while I wait for my order. Yes, price is higher than most, but I'm willing to pay for it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm......piiiiizzaaaa.....  I got the Groupon and tried this place out for the gluten free pizza crust option. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but pretty darn close! I ordered the Italian, which has a hefty portion of artichoke hearts and black olives and I would have devoured the entire thing on my own had it not been for that pesky husband of mine.  The gluten free crust is an extra $3.00...be forewarned if your hardcore about keeping gluten free though. They aren't very careful it seems about cross contamination and I'm not positive, but think they might have used the same cutter on the regular pizza's as mine and there was flour everywhere. Kind of defeats the purpose of eating a gluten free pizza IMO, but I'm willing to take that kind of risk. I like to live on the edge."}
{"text":"I placed an order on z pizza's website. Holy confusing! adding individual ingredients to your \"cart\"? I ordered the napoli pizza, so I couldn't understand why there were so many items in my cart. When I went to pick up my pizza, my order wasn't ready, and as it turns out, was sent to the Peoria location. Luckily, the restaurant was completely empty, so they whipped up my order in about 15 minutes.  We ordered the pear and gorgonzola salad which was really good, and actually a decent size for splitting between two people. We also ordered the napoli pizza which was ok. It has a garlic sauce instead of a red sauce, with basil, and tomatoes. To be honest, I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor. Reading some reviews, it had been compared to Pizzeria Bianco, so I had fairly high expectations.   However, it's convenient (yay for delivery!), organic, and they do sell pizza by the slices. So I'll definitely be back and plan to try more of their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Gluten-free, vegan pizza. Friendly, helpful staff. Exciting topping options like shiitake mushrooms and zucchini. Awesome. The crust was a little overcooked."}
{"text":"This location for zpizza is really fun!  -they do this beer wristband thing where you pay for 32 oz of beer and they have about 15 taps on the wall where you can self serve yourself beer. the taps measure how much beer you've poured. so you can mix and match beers however you like and they have some really cool/fun beers that I'm sure change regularly. when we went there was a neat habanero beer and an alcoholic root beer, yum! -happy hour from 3-6 is 50% off shareables (appetizers). I got wings and bruschetta for $8, a steal!  the wings were delicious. even though they were baked, not fried they tasted awesome. they did take quite a bit longer to make than the pizzas though -there's cornhole on the front patio -lots of TVs to watch games (and the Oscars was on when we were there :) ) -really friendly servers!"}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as everyone says it is. I've never had a problem ordering from here. It's not the best pizza hence why I don't give it a 5 star rating but it's better than order Dominos and Papa Johns. It gets the job done when I'm craving pizza but don't want to go to a sit down restaurant. We usually order pepperoni pizza and the buffalo wings and pick it up."}
{"text":"I never thought I could find pizza like this in Arizona!! The Mexican pizza is so good!! They have great beer on tap!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of Z's locations. For lunch, they are great. Affordable and good food. Salads are fresh. Staff is friendly. Their menu is creative, more than just pizza. Not the best pizza ever or anything, but definitely a good choice."}
{"text":"We've done Zpizza with a few groupons so I've had the opportunity to taste the mexican, italian, santa fe, thai, and a few of our own concoctions.  I love the different sauces you can choose from - the chipotle pesto is surprisingly not spicy, but instead extremely flavorful and my favorite. My other favorite is the garlic sauce.  They seem to be skimpy on sauce and I don't even like much sauce on my pizza to begin with so extra sauce might be a plus.  The one thing I struggle with is the \"ambiance.\"  If you're looking for just a great pizza that offers unique combos, flavors and even gluten-free varieties, its the way to go.  But, the store is what it is... a small pizza place with a few tables and lack-luster atmosphere.  I suggest pick up or delivery.  But. all aside, still one of my favorite pizzas around!"}
{"text":"What a JOKE !!  I ordered 2 pizzas online, on a Sunday night.. On the website, they promote that if you place an order for over 25.00 you will get 5.00 off.  The total for my order was 29.00, and at check out, they did not take off the 5.00.  I ended up calling the restaurant, and the manager told me the discount could only be applied with online orders.  I explained to him that I DID order online, and they did not apply the discount. He said there was nothing he could do.  Nothing he could do??? YOUR THE MANAGER !!   YES.. there is something you can do, you can give me the 5.00 off that you ADVERTISE on your website!!   I left a message for the owner to call me and of course days passed and no one contacted me. The place is run by a bunch of morons... I will never eat, or set foot in that place again.  Truth be told... there are much better places in the area for pizza.  This place needs a lesson in customer service!  A JOKE !!"}
{"text":"i wouldn't spend my money here any more.  food is average  This is odd but I've eatn Zpizza four times, three of the times its been take out from the hospital where we all threw in to get a few pizzas but my last experience was at the Thomas location and there was a girl employee that seemed to cough all over peoples pizzas and she didn't cover her mouth, gross (she must be a smoker)   Good bye Thomas Zpizza, never again"}
{"text":"First, let me say, when it comes to Pizza, Z is probably the best in Phoenix.  Second, their service is terrible.  We have been going there for quite some time and they have gotten worse and worse. If you put in a n online order good luck on getting what you requested. They are all baked and can't read an online order to save their lives.   When you call to complain there are never any managers there so they don't give a shit.  Great pizza, terrible service."}
{"text":"it sure beats pizza hut. they embody \"california\" style when it comes to pizza. think california pizza kitchen with a hint of conservative. their z bbq (aka barbeque pizza) was yummy. they really try to incorporate those zs- bonus points for self promotion & hidden subliminal messages to the human subconscious."}
{"text":"The self-serve beer system they have here is very unique. The serves is the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars. It wasn't \"bad\" it just wasn't anything worth mentioning.   I love being able to try so many different kinds of beers on my own.   The pizza was good and the BBQ wings were outstanding. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"I know there are tons of other great pizza joints in town, but the Z is ranks very high on my list.   For starters, I used to work in the Qwest building less than a block away so I have a plethora of experiences with this location...and all good things to say about this particular loc.   They're always on time for one. I'd call in my order before lunch on a personalized pizza and it was always waiting downstairs in the lobby no more than 25 min later. They always got my order correct, although sometimes I'd get kinda topping crazy. I'd add like 8 toppings and they always get it right.  Zero complaints with prompt service here. I tried a few other locs around town and it's whole different ball game. So take this from me that this is the solidified location."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Crust is thin, flavor is good, prices ok. Ideal for a quick bite."}
{"text":"O M G!!   So today our main guy called in sick so we had to bring in another person who could fulfill his duties. It sounds impressive, but it's just a really cool title. So, anyway, this other guy, Patrick, decided to buy us all lunch on his corporate card. While I'm not one to take advantage of the company's hospitality, I was more than willing to forgo the Curry Chicken Sandwich I've had the past two time (flippin'' out of this world for a sandwich, with the bread slightly on the dry side but no soggies is a good thing) and opt for the calzone. Please, someone kick me in the nuts! Even though I had to wait an hour for my allotted lunch time and the calzone wasn't at its optimal temperature, I swear I leaked just a little during my first three bites. Oddly enough, I opted for the veggie version of this Italian classic which surprised one of my coworkers significantly--she thinks she's converting me to the meatless way of life but have I a different story to tell. Sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes melded with my roasted garlic sauce and mozzarella and ricotta cheese [in all fairness, I think the ricotta was added in error but I'm not complaining!]. While I'd normally take 45 minutes to finish any meal at work, this sucker was gone in under 15 minutes. :sigh: I almost needed a cigarette after that experience. Thank you, z-pizza, for allowing me to experience at work what only the bravest of souls have already--an orgasm."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place at a street fair and it is pretty good NY pizza. I figured if it could be that good at a fair the restaurant must be wonderful! BAD mistake since I am now addicted to this place.  I love their chicken and Yam Rustica pizza, for a change in pace.  Good place for the foodie in me, bad for the waistline. They have just opened a \"Pinkspot\" ice cream in the same store and the Tahitiian Coconut milk sorbet is outstanding! If coconut is not your thing they have A Kuaui Pie ice cream that is good too.I Don't understand the bad reviews.I am from Ny and pretty Picky about pizza and this place is pretty good for Phx standards. ( not Ny but who is in Phoenix?) Not everyone likes Good Ny pizza so that could be why some people did not like it. Also the rude service comments, really surprised me. I go here a lot and I am treated like family on every single occassion. I have never had bad service or bad pizza here, not once!  WOW! I wonder if the bad reviews are written by people who have vested interests in other pizza places? Sorry for their bad experience but if you Do like Ny pizza( not everyone does I agree)  you should  try it out. ( Probably not the Rustica, since that is not very Ny but get their slice special, which is a good deal. They have a 2 slice special and a 1 slice with a salad both with drinks and under 6 bucks!!!!!!!_ the only bad thing about the specials you have to have what they already have premade. Sometimes I like a choice but to have their pizza is a good trade off. Happy eating."}
{"text":"Z Pizza I love you.  Screw Bianco's.  You are the best pizza joint in my book.  Every time I go, I get something fresh and delicious.  I used to always make custom calzones which were always to die for, but I mysteriously switched to pizza one day, and I haven't looked back.  After a bark at the park day I decided to try some of their pepperoni pizza that they had out and it was sooooo good.  That's all I get now.  The pepperoni is just perfectly spicy and the cheese is delicious and gooey.  Isn't that what pizza should be like?  Oh yeah, the crust.  I don't really like pizza crust unless I can cover it in ranch, but there is something about the crust here that is so good.  It's light and kind of fluffy.  It's substantial but not too thick.  Yum.  Plus, I can walk to this place from my house in like 5 minutes.  Score.  Thank you ZPizza for opening downtown, you made my dreams come true."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I was a first time customer and my lady had been before. I ordered a beer, which was definitely good, but I also ordered the calzone which was not good at all. I asked for sauce on the side, but it was filled with sauce. I don't love chunky sauce, so I use it sparingly. With it inside it was almost a waste. When I got to the middle it was cold. I was so disgusted by the entire experience. My lady told me to send it back, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for another. Nice location, bad product this time."}
{"text":"One of my top pizza joints!!! Always friendly service and never lets me down! Today I came in on free upgrade Tuesday and I didn't know it was till it was offered to me! I was so surprised! I just love this place so much! I came around 6PM and the two guys were super cool! You guys ROCK!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this cute little pizza shop forever and we finally took the plunge last night. I grew up on Papa Johns and Pizza Hut living in a small town and while I love those too, I also like the fancier, more simple pizzas that come from Cibo and the like. I wasn't in the mood for the fancy types of pizza and Pomo doesn't deliver so we decided to give it a try. After looking at the menu, I was excited to see that it was organic and seemed like a fairly healthy choice when pizza typically can wreck a diet.   We ordered the Pear and Gorgonzola salad (large), a small American pizza and a chicken sausage Rustica pizza. Ordering for delivery was quick over the phone and the total came to $30. That's a bit steep for delivery considering the regular chains have some incredible deals now but oh well, I decided it was worth the try! Estimated delivery time on a Sunday evening was 30-45 minutes.  I was pleased that the pizza's arrived much faster, probably closer to 20 minutes. The salad was large and for $8.50 it was pretty good. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was a bit sour but it complemented the salad pretty well. As for the pizza's, neither was that great. I had requested extra sauce and my first piece of American basically had all the toppings slide off when I grabbed the piece and the dough was undercooked. I thought because their crust is advertised as thin and crispy that it could have handled it but it didn't even come close. The overall flavor was decent but the presentation reminded me of something you get at a pizza buffet. It looked like a highly processed pizza to me and I know Papa Johns is way better if I'm going to go that kind of route. I had one piece of the chicken sausage pizza and did not like the sausage at all. It looked really processed in this weird oval shape and didn't like the flavor at all. Overall that pizza, minus the arugula (because since when is peppery lettuce so vogue?!?!) was pretty bland.   Sadly, we won't be ordering pizza from here again but I might swing by for the salad sometime. One star for the salad, one star for the fast delivery."}
{"text":"I went to Z-pizza with a groupon now coupon the other day and was very impressed. I got the Berkley vegan pizza and it was truly a GREAT vegan pizza. All of their pizza smelled so good and I am now IN LOVE with their wheat crust (they also offer gluten-free crust). This place is a must-try for any vegan or non-veg pizza lover.  I will definitely be back!!!"}
