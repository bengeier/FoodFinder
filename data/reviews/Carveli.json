{"text":"Carveli provides the ultimate in comfort food.  Their pizzas are of the heftier variety, with thick crust and abundant cheese.  My personal favourite is the Greek-style bean soup, or Fasolada. It's always accompanied by their made-in-house lightly fried pita bread triangles, perfect for dipping.  I'm also a big fan of their pita-based sandwiches, the chicken brochette in particular.  Served with a massive helping of tzatziki sauce, it's a messy treat.  The meat is not as tender as that served at Marathon Souvlaki, but the fresh pita is far superior.  The two main issues I have with Carveli are that delivery times can be exceedingly long, resulting in less-than-hot food upon arrival, and that the restaurant itself is a bit of a dive.  Do not go there looking for ambience, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Be careful, because once you tried their fried pita triangles, you'll keep going back for more!   If you're in the mood for some tasty Greek or Italian food, this should be a top choice. It's a cozy place off the beaten track on Cote St. Luc road, but it's worth it.  They have a rich thick Tzatziki sauce and tender chicken in my favorite, the souvlaki pita.   My suggestions:  Souvlaki plate or pita Veal Parmigiana"}
{"text":"Had delivery at a friend's house a couple weeks ago. Soup--good. Salad--good. Pita--good. Chicken...not great. Still, I would consider ordering in instead of going."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Carveli's for almost as long as I can remember, 15 years at the least.  I can always count on their delicious Fasolada bean soup and pita bread, that I consider to be among the finest soup and bread (bread-ish product) I've ever tasted.  The soup is easily on my list of top soups (list to come later).  Carveli's has been an institution on Cote Saint-Luc Road for many years, and with their long hours, reasonable prices, and delivery, it's no surprise.  I live nearby, so I've never tried the delivery, but as you can see in other reviews, there have been a lot of satisfied customers.  Owner Mike is always there with a smile and a handshake when I arrive, and waiter Spiros is on hand with colour commentary about the food choices.  Carveli's always makes me feel at home, it's hard to put the feeling into words, but there's a real warmth every time I visit."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was very disappointed with my experience. I ordered delivery and it took a little over 2 hours to arrive even though they are located very close by. When I called to ask about my order the man who answered was very rude and sounded annoyed that I was asking about my order that was 2 hours late by that point. I ordered their gnocchi with meat sauce. When the food arrived it was hot (at least) but very disappointing. The meat sauce itself was alright and did have some flavour but the gnocchi was actually inedible. It had zero flavour and was so soft and mushy it looked and felt like mashed potatoes or paste. Although maybe I just chose the wrong item to order, there was nothing good about this experience aside from the fact that the portion size was big and the price was reasonable and I really don't think I would every try this place again."}
{"text":"Whoaaaaa, the best pizza in Montreal, right HERE!   Ordered a \"Carveli Special\" pizza (pep, bacon, black olives, onions, cheese, mushrooms) and it was really really GOOD. They don't skimp!   We also ordered a fry and their fries are also unique and really GOOD. We found that the price was more than reasonable for the food we got.... it was so GOOD.   We'll be ordering there again!"}
