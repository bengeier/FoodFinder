{"text":"We ate a late lunch here yesterday. I was really hoping the food would be good as we just moved to Charlotte, and have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. Sadly, it was without a doubt, the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The only decent part were the chips and salsa. I ordered the three tacos. One fish, one chicken, and one beef. I'm not sure what was going on with the chicken but it tasted more Chinese than Mexican. The other two were so bland they could have been plain lettuce and I wouldn't have known the difference. My mom ordered the same thing except with crispy taco shells. The taco shells 100% came out of a box, most likely from BI-LO or Harris Teeter. It was honestly embarrassing. The rice and beans, Uncle Bens rice, and a can of black beans. Zero flavor! It was horrible! We ordered two margaritas. I think they were made out of a pre made margarita mix. Actually the margaritas from Costco (made with Agave wine) are far better than these were. My mom and I aren't big drinkers but we do enjoy a margarita with Mexican food. There wasn't a hint of tequila in these drinks. We ordered two shots of tequila to put into our drinks so they weren't so sweet. The gallon of salt in the wound = the bill!!! OMG, $63 for two meals, and two drinks!! The drinks without the additional shots were $7.50 each, the shots each, $6.25 !!! Do not waste your time or money. You will be disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff!  Huge menu for such a tiny place.  Great margaritas, excellent, somewhat authentic food for a decent price.  Check the chalkboard for daily specials...they're usually real good."}
{"text":"October of 2009, this restaurant gives a $100 gift certificate with no expiration date to a Catholic preschool for a charity auction. June 2010, we gather a group of people and try to use it. The owner says he will not honor it because he now gives out gift cards, not paper certificates so he does't consider it valid any longer and the only thing he will do is give a discount depending upon how much and what is ordered (something about the fact that they have higher margins on some menu items). No matter what logical arguments we made (i.e. no expiration date, it was donated as a charity auction item that someone paid money for, we had a big group that is now extremely upset with his restaurant, etc.), they wouldn't honor it. I really can't understand their business practices and question their values, ethics, etc. Will NEVER eat at this restaurant again and would suggest others do the same out of principle."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but pricey. When I compare the amount of food to what I get elsewhere, the price is too high.  Also, the restaurant is very small. My husband does not want to return for that reason alone.  Overall, I prefer 1511 down the street. Larger portions cheaper prices and roomier atmosphere."}
{"text":"my friend and i decided to go here since it was close to trader joe's and it had an outside patio area. they were doing some sort of road construction (with a crane, putting up store signs) right beside us throughout our entire meal which was really loud and annoying. this, of course, was not the restaurant's fault but it really affected the ambiance. also, it is right next door to a dog grooming business so there were people and their dogs coming in and out.   we were the only people eating outside since it was pretty hot out (we wanted to smoke) and the fan they had on the patio made it feel pretty comfortable. the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is right in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to look at. i had a quick look at the inside and it seemed small and dark but cozy.   this place is not cheap. we joked that putting the word \"cantina\" in the restaurant's name allowed them to raise prices (as if it were somehow fancier than your run-of-the-mill mexican place). the chips were decent; the salsa was excellent. the taco salad had WAY to many beans in it and it was overpriced. my friend had the fajitas and it was a tremendous amount of food. there was not enough room for her to really prepare each fajita at the tiny outside table.   my coronas were 4 bucks each and her margaritas (standard size) were each 8 bucks. the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor. the coconut margarita was an interesting flavor but still not worth the price.  the service was ok, nothing great.  the lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again. i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse.  overall, charlotte has better options for mexican food that are cheaper and have better atmospheres."}
{"text":"I was here in Jan '13. I paid $1.00 apiece for a small spoon on sour cream. None was offered for my grandsons cheese casadia.  I ended up paying $30. for two chicken toco's, beans & rice, 2 soft drinks with no refills offered  and 1 plain cheese casadia. A little pricy. The rice was dry as well. I won't be back. Before the remodel we used to go there often. I really loved the people & the service was great. But for the past couple of times the service was poor and the food not so good."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my 9-year old.  The minute we walked in (the place was empty) it felt as if the staff was bothered by our presence. Since noone came over to seat us we just sat down at the table closest to us.  There was a guy sitting behind the register counting money. After 5 minutes or so he got up and brought 2 menus.  Food was ok, but nothing special.  It was another challenge to get the guys' atttention again to get the check since by now he was focused on the soccer game shown on the TV.  I don't think we'll be back - why waste time and money on a place with questionable service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.... very modern food and not to mention delicious. Try the Cafe con Leche.. that is our favorite... but everything else is very well served."}
{"text":"Had heard about this place for years.  I believe recently they expanded their restaurant into the shop beside them in the plaza.  Have to say the food was excellent but the ambiance left a little to be desired.  Although I never visited before my understanding was it was very cozy.  The new space while probably welcomed by regulars needs some work.  The massively high strip mall tin ceiling was just a huge echo chamber which made everything loud.  Lighting was harsh too.  Not exactly sure why it felt that way, but very bright for a restaurant.  The food was the star here.  Some of the freshest true Tex-Mex you could ever ask for so much better than the typical fast casual chain Tex-Mex.  Fix the ambiance and I could see this easily moving up to a 5 star place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch recently in a group.  We paid separately and the server cut our change.  For instance mine was 11.61 and the server only gave me 8 dollars back.  He didn't even acknowledge it.  Its ok though, we took it out of his tip.  The food seems to be going downhill also.  Chile Relleno tasted like it was from the microwave.  It will be a while before I go back."}
{"text":"First impression was a table that was sticky and a filthy pair of children's menus. It was downhill from there. Our waiter's visits were few and far between, sodas had far too little syrup, and my enchiladas were cool to cold on the ends and warm in the middle. But that's not the most egregious offense. To cap everything off, after almost finishing the meal, my son noticed an ant crawling across his plate. When asking for the check, I mentioned this to the waiter, who's response was something to the effect that, \"...these things happen.\" A brief apology, too much paid for dinner, and we were out the door...never to return."}
{"text":"Mmmmm....Mexican! One of my absolute favorites!   This place is located in a shopping center right next to the Trader Joes.   My friends and I decided to grab a quick bite after work. We were seated right away and ordered our margaritas while we reviewed the menu.   The margaritas were delicious, so I was able to get a coconut and strawberry mix!   They had tons of specials everything from tacos to fajitas.   I opted for the beef chimichanga which was loaded with yummy well seasoned beef. An adorable and delicious tortilla boat filled with the refrained beans which were delicious. The were almost pur√©ed, very smooth and creamy.  The rice was a little crunchy, but everything else was great.   Our waitress was great and the food was reasonably priced. So I'm sure to be back again!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Saturday. Menu is limited but a few lunch items.   Chips and salsa were good. I had 2 tacos with chicken an soft corn tortillas. The chicken was good.  The rice was dry and crunchy and the beans were okay. Kids got a cheeseburger and chicken tenders, not the average choice at Mexican and they did not like.   Overall, for the price, it was just okay and we will keep searching for 'the' Mexican spot."}
{"text":"Love the new space since they expanded the resturant back in the summer! It is so nice not being squeezed into the tiny little space where you were sitting mere centimeters from the table next to you.  We arrived at around 6:30 and were seated immediately (yay, no wait).  I noticed that they had added a couple of new items to the menu.  I was tempted to try something new, but ended up going with the mole which covered a ginormous chicken breast.  Their mole is very thick and rich - it was good, but not quite as delish as the last time I had it here.  David had a combo plate which came with a choice of tacos, enchiladas, rice, etc. He was pretty thrilled wih his chicken tacos.   The service was good - our server was quick and efficient and made sure we had everything we needed.   Our tab came to around $41 which included an order of cheese dip for our chips, 2 entrees, and a beer.  We did well though since we had bought one of those coupons where you pay $20 for $40 worth of food."}
{"text":"Se√±or Tequila is nestled in the small shopping center of Piper Glen. Nothing too fancy. A few outside tables, a decent three-sided bar, tables on the inside, free chips and salsa....the works.   They've got your standard choices of lunch specials ranging from tacos, burritos, chimichangas, and rice and beans. The one menu item that makes this place shine forth is the chile relleno. Holy eff...a flavorful creation that makes anything else I've ever had named \"chile relleno\" pale in comparison. It's not even fair. The breading they fry this thing in is perfectly soft, sweet, and mellow. So subtle, but the texture takes the lead. The chile itself is very mild. Stuffed with cheese and topped with a few different styles of salsas. I can't event begin to tell how magical the flavors are. It's one of their signature dishes and is easily the best thing on the menu. I'm pretty sure you can eat 4 of them. They are medium size and come with rice and beans.   The service is always friendly, the margs are great (and huge, and the prices are very fair. You can't go wrong with a sturdy Mexican restaurant like this one! One of my favorites in town!"}
{"text":"Returned on a week night after we had a great experience several weeks back.  Not sure if it was a bad night for the staff or a trend, but not thinking we'll go back anytime soon.  Food was lack-luster.  Service was horrible.  Everyone seemed \"bothered\" by us.  Asked for guacamole with our chips and it was a chore to get those.  They came about a minute before our food arrived-10 minutes after ordering because apparently only one person could make it!  Portions were small.  My partner ordered fajitas and was given 4 tiny tortillas with about a teaspoon of sour cream and guacamole for topping.  When he asked for more tortillas, he was told he would be charged for them.  When he commented on the lack of toppings to the hostess, she sent over the server again, who did nothing.  As we left, we talked to the guy behind the register as the server did not come back to get our check after leaving it (she was busy conversing with other staff).  We asked for a manager, but we were told there wasn't one.  The guy behind the register apologized, and then the server came over to talk to him as she suspected we were complaining.  The conversation went on between them in spanish so we just left.  We both felt the staff couldn't have cared less, and ignoring us by conversing in spanish amongst themselves was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Guess business is so good these days they don't care about ALL their customers.  For the money, go elswhere and at least get mediocre service."}
{"text":"Great for meeting friends for a quick (sit down when you arrive) meal.  Good mexican with healthy choices.  Best chimichangas in town.  Plenty of mexican beer, tequila and mixed drinks. Wait staff has never disappointed us.  We visit once a week."}
{"text":"My family arrived at this strip mall tex-mex at about 7pm on a Friday night.  Seating was quick and the \"joint was jumping\"  Let me start by saying this is THE LOUDEST RESTAURANT I have ever been in.  After the expansion, I guess they like the acoustics, because there was not a shred of fabric anywhere to absorb the sound.  Appetizers and drinks arrived right away and the simply apps were good (guacamole and cheese dip).  Our orders for entrees were taken at 7:15pm and that was where the wheels came off.  Main course finally arrived at around 8pm and my order was flat-out wrong.  Maybe it isn't such a good idea to have two menu items that sound so much alike (Tacos al Carbon and Tacos al Camarone) in a noisy dining room.  Took an additional 10 minutes to get the right entree while everyone else ate.  Food was generally tasty, but the fixings with the Fajitas and Tacos were lean (no cheese and only enough sour cream etc for 1 tortilla).  My son though the Burrito Fritto (Chimichanga) was amazing, though.  We did not drink for a change, so that certainly may be \"undiscovered country,\" but all in all it was a disappointing experience.  A place like this is not really intended for a 100-minute dining experience."}
{"text":"My prior homestead of 11 years was located directly behind Senor Tequila, which has been in this small shopping center off of Rea Rd long before Trader Joe's and the yoga pants crowd took it over, and I used to eat there semi-regularly, always enjoying all that they had to offer.  I had not been for several years and decided to stop here for dinner on the way home tonight.  I was thoroughly unimpressed, which made me a little sad.  Coming right after work, I got there around 5:30 ish on a Monday night.  There was a gentleman sitting at the bar and 2 other tables were seated.  I was instantly greeted by a young man who promptly seated me, he turned out to be my server and was very nice, attentive without hovering, but I expected that since the place was basically empty.  I had not eaten here since before they expanded - the seating area is clean and well decorated, and the tables are nicely spaced instead of being slammed on top of each other.    The food was by no means bad at all - the flavors were fresh, well presented - there was nothing offensive about anything, it just wasn't anything special.    The food: Tortilla chips - may have been fresh but I didn't think they were particularly tasty. Salsa - tomatoes, onions and cilantro.  Tasted fresh, which was nice, but nothing special.  No real oomph.  Queso - for almost $6, I was expecting cheese dip so good that my toes curled.  Oddly served in a metal lidded bowl, it was fine.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, just fine.   Shredded beef chimichangas w/ rice and beans $13:  The rice was a little hard and tasteless.  The beans were very smooth and served in a small fried tortilla cup - I did not care for these at all.  I was served two thin chimichangas cut on the diagonal for 4 pieces, with a small amount of queso and a small amount of tomatoes and onions sprinkled on the top.  Again, they tasted fine, but nothing special.    Everything was a resounding meh.  I have always enjoyed Senor Tequila and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing tonight.  For the cheese dip, chimichangas and a soft drink, my total was $23, not including the tip.  I won't be rushing back, preferring to go to Azteca... or even *wince* On the Border (eek!)."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mexican!! More authentic than other places in the area I have tried.  I've eaten here twice, once for lunch, once for dinner, and neither time did I leave wanting to kill myself!!  (Which I think is very important when it comes to Mexican)  Like the name says, the Senor knows tequila, so def try a marg.  They have a bit of a rush at dinner, so go early or later."}
{"text":"Dinner for Lunch today:  Chips, Salsa, Sweet Plantains with Cheese (what Plantains with cheese, where have I been).  I have never left this continent, though I have had Plantains in Louisiana in a Haitian Dish and many South American Restaurants and a few Spanish Restaurants and I have never had Plantains with cheese.  Before I scraped the cheese off I snapped a photo and tasted one, ummmm, OK I'll leave the cheese on!  Steak with Chimichurri Sauce and Garlic Sauce, Sausage, Potatoes, Peppers, Spinach and Rice.  I'm not a big fan of any of this food, though all of it was better than Three yelp stars and the service was perfect.  I would eat here again, ONLY because there are too many places I like better, I'll stick with the places I like more!"}
{"text":"Far overpriced for the quality of food you receive. Many other great options just a few miles away.  That being said, it is more \"authentic\" than some Mexican restaurants, and the margaritas weren't half bad."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. We each had the chicken fajita a decent sized portion, unable to finish. Pleasant tasting; nothing remarkable, but certainly ok."}
{"text":"It was good food but a bit pricy. The restaurant was very nice looking. Goo place to check out but not the best Mexican food. Margaritas were awesome."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a little bit out of the way for me but since we were meeting friends who live off Rea Rd. this was the perfect place to meet up. I have been here just one time before and both times the food and the drinks were excellent. Although Senor Tequila is located in a strip mall, they have recently expanded and the space inside is beautiful and spacious. Sitting outside on the tiny sidewalk still feels a little bit odd, however.   Sometimes, I can be swayed to love a Mexican food place even if the food is a little bit lackluster, IF they serve amazing chips and salsa. Unfortunately, the chips at Senor Tequila are light, crispy, and freshly made but they are not salted. I hate that. Thankfully, my food has been so delicious both times that I have eaten there that I will overlook the chip issue.    My second favorite part about a Mexican restaurant is, of course, the margarita! Senor Tequila does not disappoint. They are a nice size and have great flavor. The four of us all had a drink and an entree and our total bill came to just under $90 - for the taste and quality of the food, I'm ok with that. If you find yourself near Piper Glen, head over to Senor Tequila!"}
{"text":"The margaritas here a ton better than the ones that I drank at On The Border, I really prefer a spanish person to make my margarita rather than a gringo who looks like he has been working the bar for less than a week.  The shrimp fajitas here were great, the shrimp were huge.  It didn't taste too Americanized like a lot of the Mexican places in Charlotte.  I would like to come back, the only problem was that I prefer to have the tails pulled off my shrimp when I order fajitas."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to try out their $5 lunch menu.    I ordered the tostada and was not disappointed with how the food tasted - it was not spectacular, but it was not bad either.  It was only one tostada, but I was surprisingly satisfied after the meal.    My wife ordered the burrito bowl, which had a good amount of food, but once again was nothing special.  For $5, it wasn't a bad deal.    We took a look at the regular menu, however, and were surprised at how much more it costed.  The only thing that gives this place 3 stars instead of 2 for me is that we only had to pay $5 for otherwise mediocre food."}
{"text":"We sat outside and enjoyed a nice dinner. The margaritas were just ok, I was hoping for a little more kick. The chips were fresh, but the salsa was a little runny for my liking. My Mom and friend enjoyed their burrito and tacos, but I thought the fajita was a little plain. A lot of chicken, but only onions, maybe one pepper and one tomato. A little disappointing."}
{"text":"I have nothing but compliments about Senor Tequila. Delightful food, and with the remodel, there's a lot more seating indoor and at the bar. I loved the bartender, who seamlessly poured massive margaritas, cervesas and those old-guy-in-his-50s mixed drinks.  In terms of vegetarian entrees, I yield to the \"Chiles en Nogada,\"  which is essentially the lunch special chile relleno masquerading ever-so-successfully as a dinner portion. Every bite is amazing and it's a disappointment to finish!  My husband went with the \"Ropa Vieja.\" A Cuban dish to die for. (Or don't, since you'll definitely want to go to Senor Tequila as soon as you can!)  Weekend dinnertime can be crowded, and for good reason. Take my advice: go during off-hours and enjoy a margarita the size of Rhode Island and indulge in the most delicious chiles rellenos known to mankind.  Please, don't thank me. Just enjoy a true South Charlotte gem."}
