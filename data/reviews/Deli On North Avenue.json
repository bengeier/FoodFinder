{"text":"I work and live down the street and decided to try out this place yesterday. Feeling under the weather, I ordered the vegetable chowder thinking that it would soothe my throat. But, it was tomato based so, I called to clarify. The kind gentleman who answered the phone offered me a free soup the next time I came in. 

Today, I convinced my coworker to order sandwiches for the office. I am saving my free replacement soup (Italian Wedding) for dinner but, I ate the Turkey Avocado Bleu Panini and WOW. It was DELICIOUS! The flavorful avocado, perfectly seasoned turkey, delicious cranberries, and perfect bleu cheese was amazing. I'll definitely going back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The owners are so super nice, and the sandwiches and soup are delicious. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"One of my fave sandwich places in the Burg. Really awesome people who work here. They remember your name, give great recommendations, and still stay friendly when they are crowded. Love the mulligatawny soup! Bring it back!"}
{"text":"Best deli in town. 
I usually get the chicken pesto panini on Italian bread. Ã‰ meraviglissimo.
Nothing beats a fresh sandwich. 
Friendly staff. 
Good selection of bottled beverages, healthy and otherwise. 
There's a park across the street or tables inside."}
{"text":"The chicken and artichoke panini is to die for.  I have never tried anything else!  The guys who work there are great, too.  My only complaint is that sometimes they close early and they aren't open on Sundays."}
{"text":"Work in the area and treat myself to a mouthwatering sandwich here every once and and while. The Caprese sandwich is really unbelievable. It's so good. The pesto they use taste like fresh basil leaves and is not garlicy which is a good thing for me, I know others would disagree. The bread is hearty and fresh. And the mozzarella is divine! Sandwiches come with a pickle which is a treat. The sandwiches are a touch on the steep side but you won't be having a big dinner if you go here for lunch. The sandwiches are massive. This place gets really busy around lunch so it's a good idea to call ahead with your order even if you're just getting one sandwich. It really gets bumping. The staff is super nice. On the Northside looking to treat yo self, stop into this little deli! Oh, and they have adorable penguins painted on the window now. Makes me smile every time I walk past! Thanks for brightening up the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very, very good. My go to order is the Tutti hoagie. As the name implies, it has everything. This is a very small place, and very casual. A great spot for lunch. I've tried many of their sandwiches and I've never been disappointed. That said, I would probably avoid the soups. They are typically underseasoned, or often more sweet than they should be. That said, over all, this is a great place to eat lunch that's not a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Great friendly little deli in North Side.  I got the half turkey and cup of chicken dumpling.  I wasn't thrilled by the soup but the sandwich was solid.  

Pros: everyone loves a local deli! I love when places have 1/2 sandwich and soup options. Fresh meat. 

Cons:  Interior leaves something to be desired, soup wasn't stellar, strange hours- I feel like this place is never open. 

Overall: If i am craving a sandy in the neighborhood I will stop by. 

I am not sure if these place does breakfast but I think they should! Who doesn't love a egg and cheese after a long night?"}
{"text":"I went in for the egg salad... which they were out of.  There was also quite a line (which is always a good thing). 

However, I ended up with a lovely veggie panini and chips.  The panini was full of fresh veggies & cheese and I was able to select the chips I wanted.  A pickle spear was included as well.  I also picked out a chocolate chip & macadamia nut cookie.  Everything was delicious!   I'm definitely planning to head back to get that egg salad!"}
{"text":"First time, will be back! Owner was super friendly, the area was clean and comforting.  Food also was delicious!"}
{"text":"This cozy spot is my neighborhood deli and a great, friendly place to grab a sandwich. My friends and I - even the foodies - enjoy the well-made fare. 

My only comment is I wish they had more seating; sometimes it gets busy during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I'd like to call this place a Hidden Gem, but it seems like the word is already out. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but once you touch down, you are always greeted at the counter by name. My go-to sandwich of late has been the hot pastrami sandwich. It is served hot, on a marble rye bread, loaded with lean cuts of pastrami, cole slaw, and a \"deli sauce\" that really ties everything together. Seating is limited inside the venue, and parking can be tricky, but the price combined with the quality of food your getting makes everything worth it. Its been my spot for a few months now, and i don't foresee that changing. Awesome !"}
{"text":"The \"Jason's Cajun Panini\" is honestly one the tastiest paninis I've had. And they're super friendly and cheap. $7 for a whole delicious Panini ain't bad."}
{"text":"I had read reviews saying that this place has the best chicken salad in the city, so I had to give it a try. This is finely shredded chicken, the perfect amount of mayo, seasoning, onion, and celery. I also maybe see a tiny bit of egg chopped up in there? Either way, it was delicious. And that pickle on the side is amazing!"}
{"text":"I noticed a sign the day before I decided to go in that read \"Chicken and Sausage Gumbo\" being a little apprehensive the next day I went in and the place smelled incredible. I ordered a small gumbo to take with me back to Fed North to eat lunch.

I opened it up and could tell by the sight of it that it was not actual gumbo. It may or may not have had ingredients that is used to make a gumbo. This is more of a soup than anything else. It had none of the flavor, color, or textures that I associate with the gumbo I am use to back home. I don't wanna be that guy, but I was born and raised in central Louisiana for 30 years. Please learn how to make an actual gumbo or stop listing what you sell as a chicken and sausage gumbo.

That said. I will be willing to try something else they may offer when I find myself near and around AGH. Sure smelled tasty in there, but not that gumbo. Do not eat the gumbo."}
{"text":"Great deli! I loved their curry chicken soup which was the soup of the day. I also had a half egg salad sandwich on rye with it which had minimal mayo and very tasty. The deli had many interesting and delectable sounding sandwiches, panini and wraps on the menu.  It made The day when I found The owner to be so helpful and very customer oriented.  I would strongly suggest trying it."}
{"text":"Mediocre sandwiches, good selection of drinks and chips. My beef and blue cheese panini was dry and didn't have much flavor, but the beef was juicy. There isn't much parking around, and it's in a sketchy area."}
{"text":"Over the past few weeks (maybe even months), I can't tell you how many times I must have told my boyfriend that I was craving a good Reuben. We were in the neighborhood this past Saturday, and we worked up quite an appetite walking around. First we tried going to the North Shore Deli but it was closed, so we settled on the Deli on North Avenue.

As we were getting ready to walk in the door, I noticed the Reuben was their special sandwich featured on the board outside the restaurant. Just to come clean, I've never had a Reuben that was made from someone other than my dad, so I was feeling a little unsure of my choice. My boyfriend ordered their version of a sauced-up Italian sub, the Tutti, and that would be my second choice if I wasn't already craving a Reuben in the worst way. It was about an hour until close and the store wasn't busy, so our food was ready in no time.

We got our order to go and ate at home with the smell of our fresh sandwiches teasing us the whole way home. My boyfriend got a foot long and saved half of his sandwich for later, but I downed my Reuben at the speed of light. The thousand island sauce was sweet and complemented the saltiness and tanginess of the sauerkraut SO well. The bread was also perfectly toasted, and there was a generous portion of meat on it, too. For less than $20 for both of us, I was impressed. We'll certainly be back next time we're hanging out on the North Side, because you can't go wrong with a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful. Their sandwiches are always delicious and enormous, and the quality of the meats, cheeses, and toppings is much higher than most. The prices (around $7) are fantastic, considering the quality and quantity. Plus, the staff is beyond friendly, and makes sure that your lunch is perfect. They really care about getting it right, and it shows."}
{"text":"I'm new in town and live down the street. Checking out the neighborhood, I found this little deli and stopped in for some sandwiches. The prices are right (specialty subs are about $8) and the soups look pretty good to me. 

The staff was super nice and ordering was easy as it could be. The food also came out pretty quickly. 

To my surprise, the subs are huge and really filling. Also, quite delicious. 

As far as a deli goes, this one is great. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place almost everyday since living in North Side. Since it closes at 5 I've never had the chance to eat here. 

I drove by today and ended up ordering half a sandwich and a soup. The owner greeted me with a pleasant smile and was very polite. 

I got the turkey bleu sandwich. It had bacon, bleu cheese, smoked turkey breast, avocado and honey mustard. The soup I got was the wedding soup. 

The sandwiches came out warm and just the right amount of toppings. All of the flavors complimented each other well. The bacon was great with the mustard and I loved the sweetness from the honey mustard topped with the creamy avocado. I fully recommend this sandwich to anyone who stops in. 

The wedding soup was okay, nothing I'd ever rave about or recommend. It was lacking a lot of seasonings mostly salt. The meat balls were flavorful and there was a good amount throughout. The broth was a little oily, the soup seemed watered down to me. 

I couldn't give this place any less than 4/5 because the owner was so kind. I love little local places like this and would love to come back to support their shop"}
{"text":"Delicious tuna salad sandwich on Italian bread, I love me a tuna salad sandwich just like how my mom would make it and Deli on North served it up! Super nice, friendly guys working the shop and my chocolate chip, coconut cookie was moist & yummy!"}
{"text":"It feels like home, by home I mean New York. The place has a very Manhattan vibe and style to it. Pittsburgh doesn't have much in the way of parking lots but it's not as busy as Manhattan so finding parking in the day is fine. When I walked in I wanted a egg sandwich, but this isn't the kind of place you go to for a egg sandwich, you come here to get a really healthy fresh made specialty sandwiches. This place is clean, I mean really clean and that says a lot about the owner. Speaking of the owner he was at the counter and greeted us as we walked in. This guy was engaging and intelligent, he truly enjoyed what he was doing and that's making great food. He gave us a free sample of a pizelle, which he said is family made recipe he makes there fresh daily. I must say it's different but I enjoyed it. My sandwich was perfect, I truly enjoyed it and everything is reasonably priced. I would recommend coming here if your in Pittsburgh, and want to feel Manhattan's vibe and style."}
{"text":"I work near by and have visited for take out 3 times in the last week and this is a great sandwich shop.  I've had the Muffaletta, American Club and the chicken salad.  They were all spectacular and would gladly order again, the chicken salad is also some of the best I've had.  It had a nice black pepper component which I liked a lot.  They use Boar's Head meats on all the deli sandwiches which is always top quality.  I'm looking forward to trying the Cuban on my next visit.  This spot far out ranks the near by Eco Bistro, Bistro to Go and Dominic's in the Sandwich game, I will be a frequent visitor from here on out."}
{"text":"The first two times I had a sandwich from the Deli On The North Avenue my Wife picked them up and I had not gone.
both times I  had lean pastrami on rye with mustard.
Deli On North Avenue had Boars Head meats which are my favorite.
The sandwiches where amazing and I would definetly recommend Deli.
I have gone there myself Two times after and think this is probably the best deli around.
The Two times I went I ordered a reuben on rye which was totally amazing.
Probably the best I have ever had.
I can say without a doubt that the staff is amazing friendly and fast.
And I highly recommend Deli On The North Avenue for all your sandwich needs.
You can be sure I will be going over and over again."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the Deli! The staff is very friendly, especially the owner who was working the counter while I was there! I had a delicious chicken pesto panini with a cookie. My young son enjoyed a cheese sandwich. It was the perfect spot for a quick lunch before heading to the Children's Museum or the park."}
{"text":"Awesome little stop. Came here between two meeting and this place truly hit the spot! Dead on hit the spot. Chicken salad kings !"}
{"text":"Fresh!!  Stacked quality meats!!  Fresh quality toppings!! Fresh thick soft bread with a nice crust!!  Fresh, fresh, fresh!!!!!!

Professional employee and super clean establishment. They built my sandwich with love. No slapping it together. It was a masterpiece!!

Loved their quality choice of drinks. No typical fountain drinks. 

And the price, very fair!"}
