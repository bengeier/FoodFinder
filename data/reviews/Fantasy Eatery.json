{"text":"this restaurant was originally near midland and finch and was famous for good food at low prices.  they have now moved up north and the quality of the food actually got better.  unfortunately, prices have also gone up north as well.     what stood out in tonight's dinner was the \"ice bath sweet and sour pork\".  with me, I usually dig in right away as soon as the dish touches the table.  with this particular dish, you actually have to wait about 5 minutes  to fully appreciate the dish.  the waiter/waitress should have mentioned that to us.  it is basically your regular sweet and sour pork dish that is placed in a big cup covered with ice.  by letting it sit there for about 5 minutes, it will crisp up the skin even more.  the pork was actually pretty good already when it first came out but, 5 minutes into it, the pork got even better. this is a pretty good dish.  also have to mention the beef cubes in bird nest dish was done very well.  good flavor and a generous portion of beef as well.  all of the dishes we ordered tonight was very well prepared.  no complaints at all.  keep in  mind, this is only the second week it has opened, portions and quality maybe different a couple of month down the road.  will I come back... yes.  this is by far the best chinese restaurant north of major MacKenzie.   my rating might change when I come back next time."}
{"text":"Honestly, the much popular Ice-Quake Sweet & Sour Pork is not even worth it, especially at $11.99. The ice is supposed to make it more crispy and it did, but also made it much more chewy and hard which I didn't like.   Also ordered the baby mustard veggie with garlic and Singapore fried rice. They were both alright. The portions were fairly big. This restaurant serves a complimentary beef/veggie soup at the very beginning and red bean soup dessert. Most Chinese places don't do this. Food is pretty expensive here though. I really can't justify paying around $9 for a plate of veggies.  Overall, I guess this is an alright restaurant if you don't mind paying a bit more. I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A few family and friends recommend this place to me for their signature dish Ice-Quake sweet and sour pork. I think it's quite good and it certainly is different from how other Chinese restaurant prepared it. For the added bonus, I got to try a fresh steam crab for free. I sat beside the owner of the restaurant and they kindly offered us to sample their famous stream crab.   Another bonus, the service of both staff and owners are excellent, attentive. However, I think they forgot to serve us their free dessert after the meal. Anyways, I am happy with this restaurant and our family have had such a good meal and time in this Victoria long weekend."}
{"text":"Went for afternoon tea during their grand opening month, since they opened relatively close to where I live in Richmond Hill. Below average experience for me. Food was not great, and the HOT milk tea was luke warm at best. We didn't even receive the 10% discount that was advertised. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't aesthetically pleasing... It's a bit of a hole in the wall. They take cash only- but the food is inexpensive yet fabulous. I highly recommend it.   I usually can tell that an Asian restaurant is good, if everyone in the joint is Asian but a few people. It's authentic. :) They are open really late which is a plus!"}
{"text":"The old one at Scarborough was a lot better.. food is kind of slow.  Service is not bad since they only have two servants. Looks like they lack of server during Friday night."}
{"text":"Such a horrible experience! Never again! Ordered a pork dish, 90% of it was fried tofu, barely had any actual pork in it!!! I walked out to go get cash to pay for the meal when my girl friend asked to get the leftovers packed. She barely ate any of the chilli chicken she ordered, but somehow all the chicken had magically disappeared when I checked the packed food once we got home. These people need to learn the meaning of integrity if they want to be successful. I felt cheated and insulted by this restaurant!! Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Food is extremely oily, and severs are rude. not the cleanest looking restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not a place for huge groups, but a small party of 4 would find a good fit here. The dishes run smaller than other chinese restaurants but they have more specialty dishes. Also, they have really good prices. $1 soup, $6.99 lobster after $20 spending..   I especially like their fish soup veggie bowls as well as the Fried Sliced Chicken with Pepper.   The only negative thing I'd say is that the service isn't the best and there's always a wait. But for this price, it's worth the wait.  P.S. they're open till really late at night too!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. The service was okay. Everything was just okay but there wasn't anything outstanding. This place was better when it was in Scarborough. The food is decent but not something I would think or crave after I'm done with it."}
{"text":"I live in Scarborough so I was familiar with the old location of Fantasy Eatery. In fact, I was so familiar with it because my father had an obsession with the place and we'd find ourselves dining there biweekly. I was never a fan of the food there. To me, it was lackluster and bland, it had the problem every Chinese food restaurants seems to have (you know... when the majority of the food tastes the same and drenched in some brown sauce). Leftovers often became indistinguible come the following day. Fantasy Eatery to me didn't stand out at all; it was a cheap joint that had mediocre food.  Upon learning that the Scarborough location was closed, my father was heartbroken. After some researching online (thanks Yelp!), I was informed that there was a Richmond Hill location. For Father's day (we were a few days late), my brother and I decided to surprise my dad with a one hour car ride to try out this familiar unfamiliar joint.   We walked into a bright, colourful but small room which hosted about 20-30 tables. We were quickly seated and given menus. Talking to our waitress, she later informed us that they were in fact the same company as previously nested in Scarborough. The menus seemed different yet held lots of the same dishes as the Scarborough location. We glanced through and found quite a few dishes we wanted to sink our teeth into. In the Chef's Recommendations category, the Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour Pork drew our attention. Flipping through we order a noodle dish, a fried rice, Beef Rib with Teriyaki sauce, Tofu & Fish, Green Onion & Ginger Oyster and Deep Fried Pumpkin. We had 7 dishes (+soup & dessert) for 5 people and it way more than enough.  The first dish that appeared at the table was the Beef Rib with Teriyaki sauce. I'm generally not a fan of beef ribs because they tend to be really chewy and hard to eat. However, the meat was super tender and didn't have the tough pull that you usually struggle with eating beef ribs. The sauce wasn't overdone and the amount of teriyaki on the plate was a nice glaze rather than a heavy thick sauce. I got really excited after this first dish, I didn't have much expectation for Fantasy Eatery in the beginning but this place was starting to look up.  The Tofu & Fish came at the same time as the Shrimp Fried Rice, I had a small bite of fish and it just wasn't my cup of tea. It wasn't bad but it wasn't a dish I particularly enjoyed. The fried rice was nothing special so moving on.   Next we got the famous Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour pork. I was real excited for this one since I had never had it served this way. Ice cubes were placed onto of the cooked pork so that the temperature brings out the crispiness of the pork. It worked. The pork was nice and crispy while the inside stayed juicy. My only complaint was that the temperature differences between the pork that didn't touch ice compared to the pork directly touching the ice confused my mouth a bit. My brain wasn't sure if I was having a cold dish or a warm dish which threw me off a little. However, the dish was brilliantly done, and very delicious.  The Fried pumpkin was a new dish that I wasn't familiar with at all, I actually wasn't aware it was ordered until it came to our table. But when it landed, I was eager to try it. It was lightly battered, well-seasoned and pleasant to taste. The texture of the seasoning felt strange on my palette as it had grittiness to the bite. It was a new sensation but it wasn't bad. I did enjoy this dish and I would like to have it again. Oysters are usually a staple that my family orders when we're out celebrating. So the Green Onion & Ginger Oysters was definitely not a new dish to try. Fantasy Eatery's version was delicious. A little more battered than I like but overall the taste and texture was fairly delicious.  All throughout our meal we had absolutely fantastic service, good food, and an enjoyable meal. The price had definitely gone up since the previous restaurant but so has the quality of the food. I do wish that when Fantasy Eatery was in Scarborough, it tasted like this. Even though it's a really far trek up North for this place, I'm sure I'll be back... one day."}
{"text":"This location has had a lot of Chinese restaurants come and go but this one has to be the best one yet! It is pretty small so the place fills up quickly. The quality of the food is great and the portions for the price are reasonable.   What surprised me was the amazing service that they had! The waitress asked us if everything was good and we mentioned that the friend rice was very dry and overly salted compared to the last time. She immediately offered to make us a new one with no questions asked. We told her she didn't have to and felt really bad but she did anyways and was still extremely friendly and pleasant.   The ice bath sweet and sour pork is a must try.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very very delicious!! I'm especially impressed with the pineapple fried rice!!!! The eggplant with curry was also exceptional!!  The decor is nice too.   And there's free soup included!! Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"horrible meal here tonight, birds nest was stale and unedible, battered fish with egg yolk is supposed to have the yolk incorporated into the batter around the fish and not deep fried separately (lazy chef), not to mention it being rather oily, worse was the soy chicken which they forgot to put the order in (or kitchen forgot) and 5 mins later they rushed out the most rubbery dry chicken overly drenched in the thickest 1/2 bottle of overly sweet soy I've ever had, absolute joke of a dish.  I vow to never return again."}
{"text":"The classic Fantasy Eatery from midland/finch area is now up in Richmond Hill. Food still has that quality Wok cooked goodness. Cool location. Cozy. Recommended for dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  This evening I specially enjoyed the seafood congee! I could taste all the ingredients that went into making the meal! There was an absolute harmony in the combined flavors of cilantro and ginger roots. The description that came to mind was \"heavenly\".  I guess if you're looking for highly quality, authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go! Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"The food is reallllyyyy good but the restaurant has bad lighting and washrooms are kinda gross"}
{"text":"First time walked in a restaurant and came out without order anything. I used visit this restaurant before they moved to here. I came far away because I want to try the ice sweet sour pork. Very disappointed with their servers. The reason why I decided to walk out without ordering because no one came over to take my order, and I was siting in a small room and got ignored. There were 5 tables in the room, one table left before me because of the slow service, then I heard the table beside me complaint about slow service as well."}
{"text":"Super friendly and courteous. Service was only second to the quality of the food. We started with a seafood soup and the mains were sizzling beef with onion and ginger, ho fun with soya sauce and chili chicken. The portions are large and great value. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling with this restaurant (3.5 stars).  We tried a couple dishes... the iced sweet and sour pork, and the crispy beef brisket with curry sauce.  These were interesting twist on classics.  But I'm not sure what the ice is meant to do... perhaps quickens the cooling to what end.  I've had the same dish elsewhere fresh and not had issues with the crispiness.  points for trying something new.  I really enjoyed the crispy brisket... the crispy coating reminded me of the texture and flavour from deep fried taro dumplings.  The brisket was nice and tender and topped with a hot curry sauce.  innovative... I like the new texture on the outside and the soft brisket on the inside.  The Shrimp fried rice was a bit bland... needed a little more seasoning... atleast on the shrimp... perhaps adding some fried dried scallops would add another layer to it.   The service experience was lopsided... waitress was not attentive... and dropped off dishes as if saying she really didn't want to be serving us... but the waiter was much better and tried to anticipate our needs.  Overall a good meal.  Will want to try some of the other unique chef creations."}
{"text":"I love this place...owner is friendly and the food is great...clams with black bean sauce the best and deep fried shrimps and their homemade hot sauce! Excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm having a crisis here. I thought my countless mornings of Dim Sum and evenings of Peking duck and Chow Mein would have naturally given me enough experience with this type of cuisine to qualify me as an adequate judge of Chinese food. If people are saying this place is average, am I crazy or ignorant to think that this is some of the best Chinese food I've ever had? Has there been exceptional Chinese food surrounding me this whole time, just slightly beyond my culinary sight line? HAS MY LIFE BEEN A LIE?   Crisis aside, three things really stand out for me at Fantasy Eatery: creativity, presentation, and service. Fantasy Eatery has dishes you'd have trouble finding elsewhere. Some got mixed reactions, but others were loved all around. My standouts are:   1) Deep fried curry beef brisket: Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The dish was just flavour with a side of curry.  2) Iced sweet and sour pork: Beautiful, and the quality itself ranges from good to exceptional (I've had it 3 times). The pork remains warm for a long time and the melting ice washes away some of the sauce, making it less heavy than traditional versions of this.   3) Fried \"milk\": Ok, this one is a bit weird and some people didn't enjoy it that much. It's basically like the Shanghai dish with scrambled egg whites, crab meat, broccoli, and a yolk on top. However, they make it with milk and mango pieces (but it's still savoury). The milk makes everything so creamy and rich. While some people thought the mango was odd, I quite enjoyed it.    4) Fried rice: simple, humble, and delicious. It's hard to mess up fried rice, but Fantasy elevates it. By putting some crispy pieces within it for a mix of texture, it makes this fried rice just that much better.   My next standout was presentation. From the food to the decor, this place really departs from the traditional Chinese restaurant where budget is king. This usually means shabby carpet and chipped plates. Fantasy is bright, interestingly decorated, and clean. Lastly, service was fantastic! They've been nothing but professional and courteous. When we pointed out that a spotlight was too bright, the person in charge climbed up on a chair and fixed it for us right away.   People keep pointing out that the Scarborough location was much better. Well, if this is what it's like now, then that one must've been extraordinary. Whatever it is that I missed, I don't care. I will blissfully and ignorantly continue to eat the sweet and sour pork and fried rice at this location.  (65/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"typical ingredients, typical dishes, small portions, not worth the money hope you can last till Christmas."}
{"text":"Fantasy Eatery has been a main staple for Chinese food for years before I even had a driver's license.  It's in that CORE group(Korean Grill House, Keung Kee, and Dumpling King) of Silver Star Blvd back when there was limited Asia fare in Scarborough and Silver Star Blvd didn't exist beyond north of McNicoll.  Even though there are unlimited Asian restaurants nowadays it still remains a popular place but has calm down since then.  It might be because even though it has the background and flavours that Cantonese know and LOVE so well, it hasn't really transitioned well to the health trend revolution.  Another downfall is the line-ups during the rush that can make any patient person go across the plaza for an alternative.  Aside from the flavours that I like, they also do late hours in a region where only a few other places open late so if you GO FOR TEA or Karaoke and still feel hungry after 1 or 2 am, this is a great option.  This is not a FANCY spot to take a date dressed in formal wear.  Come casual and come relaxed.  It has a fun & silly under the sea, Little Mermaid-style setting almost as if it is a Kindergarden.  The pricing is very VALUE-oriented but then the dishes are the Small-to-Medium range.  What surprised me from a recent trip is that the Black Bean Little Neck Clams were humongous unlike what I have been used to all these years when they come in pea size portions.    There are always items listed as specials that are wallet-friendly to BELL-CURVE your final bill on a downward trend.  The Sweet-Sour Pork is better than standard here and they have Chiu Chow Congee that I love to replace the Bowl of Rice option."}
{"text":"Third time here, and received the worst service.  Arrived before another group, and waitress was preparing our table.  Another group came in and spoke to the owner and he gave our table to them and told us to sit at a smaller table.  We left.  What a terrible way to treat your customer, food is not the greatest, but with that kind of service they won't last long.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!"}
{"text":"Really strange decor setup. At first glance, the menu is boring and you wonder why your relatives or friend made you drive 35 minutes for the usual. Then the ice bath sweet and sour pork arrives and so does the deep fried brisket and curry. Perfect. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"The only real upside is the nice renovation to appeal to the young people in the area (i.e. Richmond Hill High School students). The food is rather pricey, and while the plates are unique, the serving size is kind of small. But what I really dislike is the MSG and odd parts in the meat dishes (e.g. the chicken congee is entirely chicken neck). However, back to the ambience, the decorations are tasteful and suit the \"fantasy\" theme, and are plentiful without being too crowded. The free wifi double rooms are also a huge plus. I hate to see this place go; it's the only Chinese restaurant in the area, and the price is somewhat understandable due the competition; it shares a plaze and mcd, bk, swiss chalet, popeyes, cora, subway, timmies and many other eateries. I guess I'll give it one more chance (the atmosphere alone is worth going to with friends), maybe it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Very clean and decent service. Sadly the only good thing in here was the ice sweet & sour pork. I really wish I liked the crispy beef & mango with cream but I couldn't. The crispy beef has great flavour in the curry and the batter for the beef is very nice and crisp and hot but all that was inside was fat.  The mango and cream didn't have any issues really other than the fact that it wasn't very good in general. I guess it's just not my taste.  Overall, if you're coming here just stick to the ice sweet and sour pork. It's not soggy and fatty like so many places make it.  The decor in here and very nice and eccentric with purple velour/ chrome chairs, white brick walls and cute chandeliers."}
{"text":"Solid place! A popular dish is sweet and sour pork with ice which is just as good as the regular sweet and sour pork. I find the ice there to make the skin crispier and it is still warm. Other reviews said the portions were kind of small, but I find it just right for our family. The food tastes quite decent too.   The restaurant is located right next to the rainbow cinema theatre. There are not any other chinese/oriental restaurants around the plaza I find and it can be just busy during dinner hours, but not too busy making you want to switch restaurants. The decor of the place is cool, maybe it's just my style though. I liked the rustic designs and how they decorated the bar, and the fish tank of the fish people at the restaurant may order... although you cannot see the fish, that can be a good or bad thing. It's covered with fake grass and the surface has a few decorations to make it look like a lily pond. I do find there can be a few flies in the restaurant which can be a nuisance to deal with at times."}
{"text":"No service for sure but can't complaint for a $6.99 lobster when you spend over $20!"}
{"text":"Very good value.  Their lunch specails are very tasty and you get a lot for about $7.  We used to get take-out all the time from there for lunch.  Whe they had crab for $10, 13 different styles...I think we went there 2 times a week for 4 weeks straight!!!  One thing I've noticed though...they seem to use a lot of oil, so you have to ask them to go light on the oil when they are doing any of the pan-fried dishes.  If you like congee....they give you a really big bowl of it for $8....enough for 4 people.  I usually get the fish congee...there's gotta be at least an entire fish in there.  Now that's a healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"No Lie, the food is delicious here. However, the prices are outrageous. Their lunch specials depicted in old yelp photos show lunch special prices from 6.99, 7.99 and 10.99. However, being a frequent visitor, I often just get their satay beef rice noodles in soup (because it's the cheapest). Last week, I had time to try their lunch specials. I ordered the Curry beef brisket with rice and it was 12.99. Sure, it came with a soup, but the portions and the lunch itself was pretty much on par with anywhere else.  Their curry was lacking for me. It only had the kick but no curry taste to it. It was so disappointing. However, the beef brisket was delicious. Soft and tender. MmmMMM. But, it was the curry that was the let down.   In the past, I know for a fact that their crispy spicy beef and fried rice dish was delicious. Service is also not the fastest. I would call ahead and give about 15-20 mins for take-out.   Other than that, I would definitely visit again, but, definitely not for lunch. Lunch specials at 12.99 are just tooo much for me!"}
{"text":"Lunch special 2.5 stars Dinner 4 stars Overall 3 stars  I dined at Fantasy Eatery once for lunch and once for dinner.  My lunch experience was average, yet the dinner experience was enjoyable.    For lunch, we ordered a Beef Rice Noodle Stir Fry ($8) and a Singapore Noodle Stir Fry ($8) from the lunch special menu.  Both came with a hot coffee or milk tea.  The Beef Rich Noodle Stir Fry had a beautiful light soy sauce color which I appreciated.  The noodle was salty.  The Singapore Noodle Stir Fry had a rich yellow colour.  The noodle was potent spicy.  There was a lot of curry power.  Fantasy's chef was not shy from using condiment.  Both dishes didn't have much meat.  The noodle portion was barely acceptable.  For dinner, we ordered an Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour Pork ($12) and a Scallops Stir Fried with Prince Mushroom ($18).  The Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour Pork was exceptionally well made.  The surface was fried to a slight hardness but the batter coating was thin.  The meat was tender yet not fatty.  The flavour between sweet and sour was balance.  The meat was well marinated.  The ice added a flair to presentation.  As well, for some pieces, I felt a coldness when the meat entered my mouth, yet the meat was hot when I bite into it.  This was an interesting sensation.  The portion was sufficient.  The Scallops Stir Fried with Prince Mushroom tasted delicious and fresh, but the overall portion was a little small.  The scallops were thick.  The quantity was barely acceptable.  There was insufficient quantity of prince mushroom.  The amount of celery far exceeded prince mushroom, so Fantasty might as well include celery in the entree name.  For $18, I expected more.  You would think that I would recommend ordering the Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour Pork but not the Scallop Stir Fried with Prince Mushroom.  Well, the star of the Ice-Quake Sweet and Sour Pork, meaning the truly well made part of the dish, is the sweet and sour pork.  The ice adds a lot to the presentation but only a little bit to the experience.  I didn't read the menu thoroughly, but if you can find a simple sweet and sour pork entree, minus the ice-quake, on the menu for a much lower price, I recommend ordering it instead.  You don't need to pay $$ for the ice."}
{"text":"Not you're typical Chinese food, they actually go to the next level with certain chef recommendation dishes such as sweet & sour pork with ice, deep fried beef with curry sauce, fried rice with crisp taste, and fried chicken stuffed with sticky rice. I highly recommend all of them as the flavors, texture, and combinations are unique.  As for the other common Chinese dishes, they are all good and similar to other restaurants...can't complain about anything...service was good, better than you're standard Chinese Restaurant...if anything, it is cash only.  They do have 2 separate party rooms that you can reserve for about 15-18 people however you need to spend at least $350. It is rather hard to find in the plaza as it's situated right at the corner of the plaza, just look for the TD back.  Would I recommend...yes...btw, decor is also unique with chandeliers and pink flowers on the walls...not your typical Chinese decor."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the results here. Small little place and gets busy fast.  Meal began with some soup which was a nice start. We then get our first dish which was the beef tenderloin and after that, everything just went down hill for us. The beef dish tasted good and the meat was soft and tender but we found the dish a bit small for $12.99  Then we get the sweet and sour pork $11.99 - served with ice cubes which are suppose to make the outer layer more crispy. The ice did its job but I don't like eating cold meat. This is one of their chefs special here and probably a signature dish here but I have had way better sweet and sour pork at places that don't even specialize in it.   Next came the deep fried oysters in honey garlic sauce $14.50 for eight oysters - the oysters looked big at first glance but they were actually very small since the batter made them appear large. Tasted more batter then I did oysters.  We then got the Fantasy chow mein $14.99 - DO NOT RECOMMEND - Presentation looked nice with the crispy chow mein stacked like a tower but looks can be deceiving. The sauce on the bottom was really salty. There were shrimps, squid, scallops and sliced pork with the sauce. The chow mein that was in the sauce was super soggy and salty. We even saw another table order it after seeing how cool the presentation was and we wanted to stop them from making the same mistake we did but everybody has different tastes so maybe they liked it? I doubt it.   The final dish we ordered came which was the snow pea $14.99 - I love eating snow pea but these were a bit old as the leaves were tough and what really disappointed me was that it was sitting in so much liquid. It was like scooping leaves out of a pool of water.   Meal comes with dessert and I'm not too sure what it was but it simply tasted like sugar and water to me heated up.  Service suffered a bit due to how busy they were but acceptable."}
{"text":"The decor is horrible. It is absolutely unsuitable for a Chinese restaurant. They also use Comic Sans for their menus, which are also bad on the eyes.  The food is good for the price (mostly because my standards are set very low). The fish soup was somewhat bland, and the fish in it was all bone and no meat. The fish was nice, but not worth the price (it was ~30$). The beef was good, the noodles were good, the beans were good, and the bok choy was literally just bok choy. It was satisfactory, though.   Service was fine. Nothing to complain about there.  Nice place, just don't look around you, though. Don't stare too hard at the menu either. 6.5/10"}
{"text":"This was hands down the worst experience I have ever had at any Asian eatery. I walked in to a scowl from the waiter (owner?) That should have been my clue to do an about face and leave, but I thought, hey let's give the guy the benefit of the doubt. I was presented a menu after inquiring if takeout was offered. After perusing the menus, I settled on a B8, stated on the menu BBQ pork, with preserved vegetable fried rice. The lunch special I ordered came with a choice of Hong Kong style milk tea, soup or pop I believe. I was very specific to ask for the milk tea, I'm a big fan. I was told it would be about ten minutes, paid, thanked the man and sat to wait. A short time later another guy walked in and ordered a large takeout order, I wasn't upset he got his order before me, whatever. What did upset me was 20 minutes later when my order was ready, I didn't get my order correctly. I was given \"soup\" that is in quotations for a reason. I asked for my milk tea and the guy just pushed the bag at me and said, \"soup, okay?\". I didn't have time to argue, so I left with my order. When I opened the order, the soup was a muddy coloured mess, smelled weird, and had some weird chunks of vegetables, I'm only guessing. I did taste it and it was bland, flavourless, horrible and disgusting. Didn't finish it, needless to say. The BBQ pork with fried rice was fried rice with BBQ pork, little teeny tiny pieces. Again, no care, or passion for this shitty rice, and as I poked around I found something slimy looking at the bottom of my container (spit?). I would not recommend this place, unless you speak Cantonese or Mandarin. Your money won't spend the same. Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is took over another chinese in the corner beside TD bank....decor inside is fancy with chandlers and crystal balls hanging from the ceiling, kind of like a old fancy western style place with serves cheap chinese food  $6-$8 lunch specials that will for sure full ur tummy, a lot of aunties and uncles at this place but hey I don't mind  Service is good, has ur typical food selection as all other HK cafes"}
{"text":"This place used to be in scarbs where i went for late night eats after partying. So glad it moved closer home. Family goes there once a week. Great place!"}
{"text":"What a great hole-in-the-wall place.  Entering from the parking lot side, this restaurant looked like it was a drug front.  After entering the 2 sets of doors, the restaurant on the inside was not too shabby.  They have fake grass as their wall trimming decor, very unique I must say.  We ordered a few dishes to share with white rice, like a traditional Chinese family meal.  We had the battered shrimp, beef cubes in a basket and eggplant.  They gave us a complimentary broth soup and one of my friends also ordered a mango bubble tea.  Everything was delicious and authentic.    They don't take card payments so make sure to withdraw cash first."}
{"text":"2.5  I've always heard good things about Fantasy when it was in it's old location in Scarborough.  Finally decided to give this place a try.  Needless to say, it didn't quite live up to the hype.  Pros: Meals come with free soup and dessert Staff are friendly  Cons: Food is very salty Service can be slow if place is busy  Came here on a Saturday night for dinner.  We came around 6 which was a good idea because the place filled up rather fast not to much later.  When it fllls up, the place gets rather loud and hectic.  You're not coming here if you want a quiet dinner for 2.   We ordered the Deep friend spicy pork chops, the beef tenderloin on metal plate, and  the braised tofu.  We get the complementary soup not too long after we order.  I notice it's a little too salty, but as its complementary I don't say anything, not even to my GF.  We then wait for about 20 min before anything else comes.  You notice that when it's busy, it can take a while for things to come out.  The staff are pretty friendly though and answers our questions with smiles.  The first dish that comes is the braised tofu.  It comes with the some broccoli and about 4 or 5 mushrooms.  I bite into the tofu and the first thing i note is that it's super salty.  I note this to my GF and she agrees immediately as well.  The beef comes out next and it comes smoking.  It has a nice look to it and smells great.  One bite in and..  it's super salty as well.  GF agrees immediately too.  We do disagree on which one is more saltier, lol.  Finally the pork comes out and yes, it's salty too.  We've never experienced something like this before.  We gave some of the tofu to our little one and afterwards she needed water badly.  She guzzled the water out of her sippy cup faster than I've ever seen.  That's how salty it was for her.  My GF went to Fantasy when it was in Scarborough and she says it was a lot better when it was there.  Based on my one experience, I would have no choice but to agree.  The amount of salt in the food made it harder to enjoy the meal.  The conspiracy theorist in me believes this is done because they want us to buy more rice and drinks, lol.  If you like your food saltier, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of Times Square furthest from the intersection but along Highway 7, Fantasy Eatery's specialty seems to have been seafood, but we ordered whatever caught our eye on the menu and ended up with:  Taro Sausage Pot $9.95 Tong Choy with bean curd $10.75 Clam in Hot Soup (mis-titled on receipt???) $7.95 Oxtail with Red Wine $10.95 Roast Duck and Taro $10.95  Only two dishes made it to the \"I'd order it again\" list... the clams (not the usual black bean sauce version) stirfried with ground pork (great flavor!) and the oxtail dish.  The veggie dish and the pot were both okay.  But the duck dish... what was with the taro???  It was duck on one side of the dish and taro on the other, with the taro cut into these huge chunks.  Not appetizing and not tasty.  The duck itself though was fine though.  Each bowl of rice was $1.50 apiece.  Both hot water and tea were provided as we sat down.  Service was okay on the whole, although whenever we were looking to request something, all the servers seemed to disappear from our end of the room.   At one point, I think I overheard an employee telling a customer at the neighboring table that they had redecorated recently.  Since I've never been here before, I'll just take them at their word.  Same with the signs that they have posted here and there telling us that they do not use MSG.  They have those machines at their doorway that you can stick in a $2 coin and receive some kind of toy in a plastic bubble.  Did you know Angry Birds came in those now?  Also, for a party of up to maybe 6, if you want some semblance of privacy, there is a small area by the bathroom with room dividers around a round table."}
{"text":"Fantasy Eatery was our go to joint for late night fare when it used to be located in Scarborough.  Want a full meal cheap at 2 am in the morning?  Head to Fantasy. It was a definition of a dive but has transformed itself from a cocoon to a butterfly in Richmond Hill.   Gone are the all night hours (they close at 10pm now), dirt cheap eats (still good at $10-$20 per dish but no longer $5-$10) and the inattentive service....well as least some things hasn't changed too much:)  The food is good here, excellent wok hay flavour and taste.  Really enjoyed some of the signature dishes such as the sweet and sour pork in ice bath and the fried beef brisket with curry sauce.  There seems to be a sweet spot with the sweet and sour pork as you need to eat it a little after it comes out but before the ice melts to get that nice crispy texture.  The portions are definitely larger then when it used to be in Scarborough but then again you are paying more.  Overall its a pretty solid place to get good food in the area.  4 out of 5 from me!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall late night dining option.  We use to go more often but they've changed the decor a bit and also raised there prices significantly from before so I have to give them a lower rating.  Also consistency is not the same as before as we noticed sometimes the food quality is off.   However if you feel for the munchies at 1am or so, there is not much better! Basically they serve all the Hong Kong favorites but some of our favorites is the Chicken with Ginger in Hot Pot, Stir fried Clam and Chili Chicken. Service is fast and typical of most HK diners."}
{"text":"Pictures look a lot better than it tastes...beef brisket noodle had tough brisket, tomato and cream sauce rice had under cooked rice, ice quake sweet & sour pork was just ok - I didn't really get the ice part but it looked cool.  Some item on the menu they ran out of - no tofu at all and no vegetable spring rolls at all.   Tung Cho vegetable was good."}
{"text":"So good. Deep fried pork intestines and Deep Fried lobster was amazing.Noodle dishes were all top notch.   I've been here a few times and every dish has been amazing."}
{"text":"This place is Really. Good. The first time I came here I was prepared for some mediocre chinese food (because come on now, no one can compete with my Mom's food) but this restaurant is above and beyond. We normally order a lot of the chef recommendations and they are always SOOOOOO DELICIOUS and interesting. For example, I was never impressed by the sweet and sour pork at ANY restaurant; it's always too fatty, too soggy, the sauce wouldn't be good..bleh. BUT HERE...they add ice on top (and I wish I had a photo but I intelligently wiped my phone clean an hour after eating) and it ACTUALLY DOES make the pork wayyyyy more crunchy! The crunch factor really made this dish (which I never knew was possible), plus the pork itself was all meat (not a slap of fat) and who knew it would taste good when it's cold on the outside and warm on the inside? Another dish I really liked was a vegetarian dish; I think it had mushrooms and was wrapped in some type of tofu paper into a little dumpling. Super interesting dishes and super delicious. Everything we ever ordered here was great!  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some quality chinese food (which, let's face it, you don't exactly think of quality when you hear \"chinese food\"). It has made my \"fantasy\" for yummy chinese food into a ..... Reality ;) (I try I try)."}
{"text":"DEEP FRIED CURRY BEEF BRISKET This was the restaurant's second signature dish. The curry was served separately on the side instead of being poured on to the beef to prevent the fried briskets turning soggy. I personally prefered eating the fried brisket on its own since I'm not a fan of curry, but even the the brisket was seasoned and not tasteless. The texture for each piece was inconsistent - my first piece was tough and chewy whereas my second piece was tender. The beef brisket however was fried nicely with a good crisp.  SWEET AND SOUR PORK Out of the oridinary, this sweet and sour pork is served in a pot with ice. The idea is that the ice is to keep the fried pork crispy preventing the sauce from making it soggy - quite an interesting idea. People commented saying that when you get to the bottom pieces it tastes too cold but I thought it was a refreshing chilled crispy meat taste.   At this restaurant I was pretty much just interested in trying these 2 top signature dishes - in my opinion, they were mediocre and nothing too special but it's just the new concept in the way the dishes were served that made it interesting. As for the other dishes at this restaurant they were mediocre as well. Overall I found this restaurant overpriced for their dishes."}
{"text":"It looks like I'm the 7th reviewer for this place, which is extremely surprising considering how long this place has been around for! It used to be a staple for asian families during the evenings and clubbers late into the night as it opens extremely late (4am?).  The food here is DELICIOUS and extremely CHEAP. The menu is vast and I haven't eaten anything I didn't like. Congees, noodles, rice, and all kinds of stir-frys. Their seafood dishes are probably the best to get, and my favourite is their pork neck stir-fry. All the employees have been working here forever and are super nice on their good days ;)  The last time we were here was with 8 people, and the food was about $10/person INCLUDING TAX AND TIPS. We were all stuffed.   I hope this place stays around forever!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Fantasy for over 15 years at the Scarb location and was sad when it closed.   A friend told me it is now in Richmond Hill,  which was a bit of a drive, but deffinently worth it.   The food is as tasty as B4 and larger portions!  Very nice decore and the usual wonderful service, although I did miss the original servers. So happy they are open again"}
{"text":"the food here is soso, I have been here for a few time, and If there is an other Chinese, I will not go here,the drink is really bad, and they charge at a high price than the avg."}
{"text":"What's better than chinese food when you're drunk at 3am?   Fantasy is my go-to place when it's late night and I want something cheap and good at 3 am. #38 chicken,.. STRONGLY recommeded.  They also have specials such as $10 lobster and crab when it's in season.   Unlike most chinese restaurants, the portions here are smaller which means you can order more variety !!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at Fantasy Eatery. Lunch Special from $6.99 serves till 3 pm.  Try to arrive early for lunch because some items might not be available if you come right at 3 pm:  Soup of the Day or even Milk Tea.  Beef Fried Noodle ($7.99) is small in portion definitely a lunch size as I could finished the whole order by myself and more. I was expecting a really good wok hay dish but it lacks that high temperature caramelization.   Both quality and quantity of the food were not up to the same standard as the old location.  Milk Tea though creamy and smooth but served warm.  The crystal balls and chandlers looks a little out of place since they are the leftover deco from the previous business. But since it is a \"Fantasy\" Eatery, everything goes? Includes the Swan decoration at the front door.  I will definitely come back and try other items. Hopefully they would be better.  It is sad how Fantasy Eatery is no longer it's Scarborough hole in the wall neighbourhood eatery. Maybe Richmond Hill neighbourhood has less compettion and people here are willingly to pay more for less?!"}
{"text":"After visiting the \"New\" location of Fantasy Eatery up at  Richmond Hill, I now realized how lucky I was all through the years I have been eating at Scarborough location. This may looked dated and feel like a hole in the wall, but it screamed value and quality.  Lunch Special from $4.99 includes a drink. Or a combo with noodle and congee for $5.75.  Portion is huge. Our combo can feed two of me (congee and beef fried noodle). We even ordered another soup noodle that's comes with hot beverage.  The Beef Fried Noodle has good wor hay with the outside charred a little but still soft inside.  Maybe Scarborough is really a land of cheap delicious food and once they moved north to Richmond Hill without much competition, everything just change.  Too bad the new Fantasy Eatery is not the same anymore even with the same name."}
{"text":"Great food but absolutely horrible service. Our 7pm booking wasn't ready until 7:30pm because the first person ignored us. That same guy wouldn't acknowledge our order later on, resulting in a double order, which they took back but charged us anyway! Another woman kept muttering rude things under her breath to other customers and then later to us."}
{"text":"I went in mid-day for take out. I ordered Fried Rice Noodle with Sliced Beef in Satay Sauce. I waited 10-15 minutes for the food. I noticed after I had already left that I was charged a couple of dollars extra, but it was too late by the time I realized. The food was alright. There wasn't as much sauce as I would've liked, and it wasn't evenly distributed throughout the noodles. The portion size was good though. I will return since the location is convenient for me."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars cause, they really have good improvement, good service, better than old location (midland) ..reasonable price and large portion of food. Remember make reservation, last time I wait more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"Got taken here after a long day as a group by a friend who knew the owner. I had heard lots of good stuff about it years ago, especially their Scarborough location, but never made it til this past month.   Unfortunately, I don't have too much good stuff to say about our meal, except that service was average/good. The food was nothing great and even bordered on horrible. We ordered quite a few dishes because there were so many of us, but the only dish I liked was a simple chinese greens w/garlic dish.   We had a variety of meat and seafood dishes chosen by my friend and the owner/his friend, surprisingly to me. I expected some really good stuff because of that. I found most of the dishes with sauce were WAY heavy on the cornstarch. Things just felt like a great big gloopy mess! Another dish we got was pork with Thousand Island dressing. I dunno, I found that weird and not so tasty. Another was tofu and eggplant. Disaster. We had a dish that came in a big shell but had lots of veggies and not enough seafood in my opinion.   Sorry, with the selection of good food found under a 10 min drive of tbis place, I wouldn't come back."}
