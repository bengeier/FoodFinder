{"text":"Elote and chips w/ salsa and guac (hot) to start. Solid starters.

Tacos were alright (cold nopalito tacos were great). The pan seared cod and mussels were alright.

Margaritas were great.

Service was great and restaurant atmosphere was nice.

Would visit again for drinks and apps."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. From the food to the staff to the drinks everything was great. Had a chance to speak to the general manager. I don't comment very frequently on Yelp, however this establishment warranted multiple five stars. We had the carne asada as well as the chili relleno. Both platters were top-notch. They have an amazing happy hour as well as cocktails to Dazzle a pallet.

Definitely need to stop by as you've never been here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots in town. The food is fresh and tasty and the meat is tender. My favorite part is the atmosphere of the outdoor patio. The fireplace, the rustic charm, hanging lights, large high tops, and so much more make it such a unique outdoor section. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First visit to Ladera and the hubby and I were highly impressed! We sat outside on the patio and had no wait to be seated. Our waitress was pretty prompt to bring out some water but took some time for our drink order (no biggie). We ordered the guacamole and salsa appetizer - they freshly make the chips and it all was so good. We ordered a michelada and Mango La sagunda drink and both tasted fantastic. The food was awesome. We'd gotten their during \"brunch\" till 2pm and wasn't aware they'd have a different menu then I'd seen on their website. It was nice to find out they had drink specials on a Sunday but was looking forward to their regular menu. Any who we ordered the Steak Ranchero and Enchiladas De Pollo and definitely wasn't disappointed. We will absolutely return again!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Check. Food: Check. Service: Check.

Aside from an awkward parking situation (located two lots down), we had an amazing time at Ladera for dinner! We walked into a charmingly appointed patio replete with string lights, succulents and greenery, and corn hole set up!  Service was friendly and efficient.  We ordered the five taco platter and shrimp salad.  The meat in the tacos were flavorful and juicy and the corn tortillas slightly sweet.  We also ordered the house margarita and specialty blood orange  drink: strong on flavor and alcohol!   All in all a lovely time at a lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed with the food. That said, the ambience is quite good, and the drinks are actually very edgy and tasty. we actually gave this place a second shot, and the food was somewhat better. I know that they have only been open some time, and I do hope that they get better as we live in the area and would love to frequent the place often."}
{"text":"I can't stop talking about how amazing this place is!!! Everything we tried was to die for: the elotes, the ceviche, the carne asada plate, and the pan seared cod & mussels. The service was prompt & friendly. I definitely recommend sitting on the beautiful patio! I seriously wish I could eat here everyday. \"I didn't know food could make me feel this way\" - my gf. All around awesome experience."}
{"text":"We have searched for a good Mexican restaurant since moving to Phoenix 9+ years ago and we finally found one that has great food as well as a nice atmosphere. The food was great, service ok, and as I said, the atmosphere was pleasant. My husband got the 5 taco platter to sample them and said it was hard to choose a best. I ordered the barbacoa which had a great smoky flavor. The churros are delicious too."}
{"text":"We loved the environment, food, and service. We have been in Scottsdale for 10 years, and this is our new favorite Mexican Restaurant. Go for the fish tacos and the barbacoa."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing!!! We are super excited about the location since it is just a bike ride away- great for date night!!

The guacamole was delicious!  It has orange piece which really tastes very good!  The elotes were great too- corn!   

We will venture here again for sure but we do recommend a few changes. 

Staff more is my first recommendation. On a Saturday night there needs to be more personal attention to your guests. We had more interaction with the runners.  My second and last recommendation is hire more kitchen staff.  It took 40 minutes for our appetizers to come and another 40 for dinner. 

Clearly, the restaurant was packed. Over staff for the first few weeks to make the best impression possible. The community and neighbors want this to succeed!!!


Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Only been once, looking forward to going back. The drinks were delicious. Some of the dishes that our group ordered were out of this world others so so. Love music and the fireplace on the patio definitely added to the ambiance.  Can't wait to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Real Mexican pozole and great micheladas. Great patio vibe. Inconvenient parking. Looking forward to returning when the weather is cooler."}
{"text":"A new, trendy Mexican restaurant opened on Central recently. For those of you who liked Corbin, you should give this place a try. It's totally different food and ambiance but both are awesome. They have a happy hour, I believe 4-6 pm, and you can get great appetizer and a glass of wine ($6). The fish and mussels dish I got, was a little spicy but oh so yummy. Staff and bartenders were all super nice, friendly and helpful. Overall, wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's graduation from ASU with a large family dinner at Ladera Taverna. It was perfect! We had a party of 20. Sat on the beautiful patio. The service was superb and the food was delicious. It was the perfect venue!!!"}
{"text":"WOW !! I don't write YELP reviews...live in the neighborhood and tried it...first time 3 wks ago...they were still on the \"shake down cruise\" and staff was still learning the ropes...a bit disappointed...but the FOOD was original, flavorful, creative and worth it !!

Decided to give them a second try...G-R-E-A-T !! They have the rhythm down !! Staff efficient, but don't hurry you...Have tried several dishes in 3 more return visits. Like it at 3:30-4:00 before the crowd shows up...but I have to say people all around us ENJOY the food, service and atmosphere! The Manager Steve  appreciates feedback / suggestions !!"}
{"text":"We have been here for both brunch and dinner. The brunch menu is fantastic and well priced. Flavors are amazing! I grew up eating traditional Barbacoa when I visited family in South Texas, and this is probably the closest to that taste I have found in the state of Arizona. So good!

For dinner, we came with our entire family, 15 of us. We showed up early for Happy Hour and it did not disappoint. Drinks are great as are their agua frescas. They got everyone's order right and everything went on seamlessly. Definitely adding Ladera to our rotation. The patio is amazing and so nice to sit at!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was decent. My friend and I were annoyed that we couldn't mix and match the tacos and had to get three of the same. Our waiter was in our face and asking us if we needed something every 30 seconds which seemed like overkill. I loved the decor and setting. Hopefully the waiter and taco situation will get sorted out in time!"}
{"text":"This place has the best house margarita around. The bartender Mathew says he has it down to a science and by the taste we agree! My wife and I ordered the posole and the mole. both were delicious and the portions were very generous ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & Food.  The El Santo cocktail is delicious.  The Chile Relleno was very good.  Tasted the trio of salsa and the carne asada ....well done here too.  I will be back in the near future!  One item of note...the music seemed a bit loud...we could barely hear one another at an inside table."}
{"text":"Amazing service and posole is a must try! This place is fantastic and the outdoor patio is so beautiful at night. Full bar too!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and really tasty carne asada steak.  Also try the salsa trio. We've been here three times and the only one time we received subpar service was when they first opened an they were working out their kinks. Their food however, has always been really good and their drink menu was extensive."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here- it is fannnnnntastic! Full disclosure, it's in my neighborhood so, yes, I want it to succeed. But they earn their keep.
The atmosphere is upscale casual. The patio is one of the best in town- no view, but a great fireplace, plenty of shade, outdoor games, patio TVs, and oversized tables. The bar is great, and a tequila stock that will either make one happy, or shudder- depending on if you like tequila :)
I've been able to sample a few menu items and drinks. The menu prices are a little heavy, but that looks to be the norm these days. The tacos are outstanding, and the nachos (Slope-style, w mole) are a must-have. The quesadilla is so-so. I've had a couple of other items, and while they do t stand out- I DO remember thinking, very good. The drinks are very good too, good draft selections, and the mixed drinks are muy beu√±o.
We always have a good time here!"}
{"text":"What a great place! The chips, guacamole, salsa, and pozole were amazing! Service was great, too!"}
{"text":"Update: YAY! You guys finally got it right! I had written a review when they first opened and gave it 3 times before I decided because I wanted to like it so bad. I decided to give it one more go for brunch and it was great! I went again for dinner and again, so much better now than in the beginning. I'm not sure what you changed, chefs perhaps or just listened to all the reviews but it's finally a place I like to go especially since it's walking distance and I love the ambience! Oh and be sure to go on sunday or Thursday because they have an awesome live musician!"}
{"text":"Our first time here! Delicious salsa & guacamole! The 5 taco platter.... my husband really enjoyed! I always like to start with positive! I on the other hand had a quesadilla and added Barbacoa which was way overly salted!
I took them to go but accidentally forgot and  didn't go back, which resonates  how salty they were.
The service Tony gave though and the music will bring us back just maybe not to order barbacoa!"}
{"text":"Very good for brunch and superb coffee. Strongly recommend the huevoes rancheros and a $4 mimosas is a steel..."}
{"text":"I gave one star because the decor is beautiful.  Parking is bad.  Waited 5 minutes before a hostess, make that 3, showed up at the front to seat us and the other people behind us.  Our waiter was awful.  He gave one lunch and one dinner menu, which wasn't apparent at the time and I was told I couldn't order what I finally picked.  I say finally because it took forever just to look up the translation of each food item from Spanish to English.  It was more than your ordinary Spanish.  Yes, our waiter was gone that long.  The food was delicious, but over priced for the little there was of it.  Oh, did I mention that we never did get our appetizer, either.  The music was non stop blaring horns, which made conversation nearly impossible.  I hope it improves, drastically."}
{"text":"Planning to visit one of the restaurants I've had bookmarked..we headed south. We passed Ladera on our way and took note. When we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant we originally planned to go to, we noticed the attire of the patrons was a bit casual for what we had planned. So we went over to Ladera and was seated right away. The restaurant is gorgeous! And the ambience was sexy. Cocktails and food was delicious. Some of the best salsa I've ever tasted. Tacos are great and the roasted corn is to die for. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Beautiful restaurant patio dining with out of this world authentic Mexican food. I would definitely come back! Everything we tried was so good!"}
{"text":"Such a good pick! The bf and I had both never been, and let's be honest... when I'm not hangry,  his world is muuuuuch brighter. 

We sat at the bar, and matty was our bartender. He was super great. But here's the breakdown of what we ordered:

Drinks: I had the Telenovella. Super delicious cocktail of Chile vodka, ginger, pineapple and lime. He had the NMT hefeweizen. It's from North Mountain brewery, and one of the best hefe's we've ever tasted. 

Appetizer: the queso dip. Small yet perfect amount of queso with homemade chips. You can totally tell the chips were a fresh batch, they were thick and not salty. The queso was a wonderful blend with the perfect amount of spice and flavor. 

Entree: I had the 3 shrimp tacos. So flavorful, and with the green chilli sauce it was like heaven in my mouth. I seriously did a little shimmy after my 1st bite. He ordered a quesadilla with barbacoa. I'm not a huge red meat fan, but a few bites of that and I was back in heaven. The meat was tender,  juicy, flavorful and balanced well with the cheese. 

Dessert: bc we checked in via Yelp,  we got free churros. They are mini (like the length of your middle finger) and filled with caramel. So. Dreamingly. Perfect!!!! We asked and that's the only way they are served, meaning you cant order them without the caramel filling. 

There also happened to be live acoustic music playing, so the vibe was really chill. The decor is awesome and there is an outside patio with misters. 

For $50, we felt like it was well worth it and will definitely be going back. Soon & hopefully for brunch"}
{"text":"Very cute place with a wonderful patio. Excellent service and nice selection of drinks!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a perfect patio. The drinks and food were delicious! The service was excellent. Parking kind of stinks, but otherwise a great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved the beautiful patio as nice as it gets!
Very central Mexican menu which we liked. The Siveche was fantastic and so we're the beans. I had the barbacoa beef entre and is was great. The tortilla chips are to think and almost stale. Change the recipe and it will be a five star"}
{"text":"What a great place I would hurry up and get there before it turns really high so you could sit on their patio at night it was awesome the weather was just cool enough but they had a lit fireplace going to get a little bit of them warm really cool you start off with the guacamole which was pretty good love the pepitas Anna had something sweet and it couldn't figure that out now for the chips and salsa forget about him not very good chips too thick and hard and the salsa was kind of tasteless both the green one was pretty good also had the ceviche it was good but different not what I'm used to light flavored no fishy taste very well put together I had the chile relleno which was probably the best one I've ever had in my life it wasn't fried in batter but some places but the stuffing and whatever puree they put under it was so good creamy flavorful all the vegetables cooked perfectly nothing much just all out fantastic tried the Molle as well it was okay taking head too much something wasn't very balanced in flavor would not recommend it just something off about it our server was okay little slow but it was at the end of the night I'm sure he wanted to get his side work done to get out of there but overall a fantastic experience definitely will be back for that chili relleno"}
{"text":"Guacamole: Good, but severely lacks spice...like zero (supposed to have Serrano peppers). Orange was awesome, but not enough grilled onion. Comes in a tiny bowl with a ton of chips. Needs more guacamole or maybe even a small side of salsa with it. 

Margaritas: Meh. Mix wasn't great.

Chili Rejnos: Dry. Not a $19 dish.

Carne Asada: Meat cooked perfectly. Fresh tortillas. Mexican corn was a bit bland. Beans were WAY over seasoned. Pico de gallo had more spice, from the raw onion than the guacamole from the serrano peppers.

Servers still have \"first day jitters\" and are still learning the menu, but was really trying. 

-----

Stopped in for lunch on Friday (2nd day)  Food was fairly good, the staff was clearly trying to find their grooves.


Edit:  I've checked in twice (from during the first week) and I'm still \"The Duke\""}
{"text":"3.5-4 Stars for sure! Parking can be a problem mainly street parking, evidently they have a lot a block away but I was lucky to find one on the street ironically there is an empty parking lot right next door chained closed.  The best guacamole! Huge chunks of avocado and orange chunks great flavor.  The carne asada tacos were okay the meat was salty and dry lacked flavor.  The highlight was the Chili Relleno, which was fantastic it was like a gourmet version of what you would get in a usual cookie cutter Mexican food restaurant in the valley, chipotle cream sauce was wonderful served with hominy rice (wasn't overly warm but still good).  Fun gothic revival decor makes you think you are in a Spanish mission, great patio for perfect weather like tonight."}
{"text":"We've come twice in one week! Once for brunch and once for happy hour/dinner. Both great! We've heard mixed reviews but live near by so wanted to give it a shot. The brunch was awesome. I had the breakfast nachos.(I don't remember what it's actually called) it was sooooo good! My husband had the American breakfast(boring) but he liked it. For happy hour/dinner we had drinks (all were good) the guacamole/salsa and chips(yummy, the salsa was a bit spicy but good quality) then we had the stew w an egg(it was also very good). My husband got the carne asada tacos (great) and I got the pork entree(also so good!). Overall we're thrilled about our experience with ladera and are thrilled for our neighborhood addition! Will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I chose this place to host my monthly Meet Up group's Sunday brunch mainly because of the live music advertisement.  We also haven't had a Mexican food inspired brunch so I decided to try it.  We were a party of 12, 2 of the 12 were vegans or vegetarians.  There weren't many options for them to choose from.  One person ordered the breakfast burrito with no meat, added corn, fajita peppers and potatoes.  When the burrito first came out it had nothing but pico and eggs it in.  I saw the server right the other items down so maybe the kitchen folks messed that one up.  I can't remember what vegetarian dish the other person ordered. 

Everyone else was pleasantly surprised with what they ordered.  No one sent anything back, a few of us had enough for leftovers.  We were pleased!   I hope I'm quoting this correctly.  The white sangrias were pre-made.  The red sangrias were made to order ... I believe.  It could be the other way around, I'm not quite sure but one of the two are pre-made and purchased.  They're not pre-made as in made earlier in the day when before the restaurant opened, but purchased from a store of some sort.  

Also, from where we were seated we couldn't really hear or see the acoustic guitar player at ALL.  Like at ALL!  Perhaps they could have him or the band in a more central location in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm soooo beyond thrilled that this spot is finally open! I've been anxiously awaiting the opening and was so please with our first visit! 

The staff is super friendly and upbeat and the food was fabulous!! It's a little pricey but honestly in the long run it's well worth it!! 

The cocktail list is AWESOME and you can tell the bar manager put some love into it! Another aspect of this place that didn't disappoint was the salsa tray! Who doesn't love getting to try a variety of delicious salsas with fresh homemade chips! 

Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to give it a try and, man were we impressed. Upscale and pleasing decor, with a very relaxed vibe. The patio is comfortable and spacious. They utilize the space very efficiently over what Corbin's was. But, the real star attraction is the food. We split a bowl of Pozole and had three tacos (chicken, asada, and pork). Everything was tasty and very authentic Mexican cuisine. Next time I'm going for a dish with mole sauce. Btw, we met the head chef Jorge Gomez. We are impressed with his knowledge and skill as a fine chef. I think you should give Ladera a try."}
{"text":"This is such a great Mexican food restaurant, love everything on the menu! The bloody Mary's are amazing! The service is great! The atmosphere of the patio area is great for outdoor dining specially on a hot Arizona afternoon. Love the music that they play over the speakers. Parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. A friend brought me here for the first time while I was pregnant And my oh my! I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere while eating delicious food. I took my hubby here for the first time tonight & it was just as good as I remembered it. My 9 month old son loved nibbling on the corn bread, guacamole, braised beef. :) we ordered the 5 tacos platter, barbacoa, and dulce de leche with vanilla bean ice cream. All were soooooo good! So glad this place opened."}
{"text":"I wish my group could have gotten a 5-star experience! Let's see what happened that made these stars drop off...

1. We had to constantly ask for water; at one point we pulled over a different server and asked him to bring us a pitcher
2. I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to a cocktail (although I must say - it was delicious!) and after 2 sips, sent it back, and switched to a simple beer. When the bill came the cocktail was still included. If I was going to be charged for it, I would have given it to someone else sitting at my table.
3. The table split the bill, but 1 person got charged an extra $21.00. The problem was solved quickly when pointed out, but if the server was initially confused she should have verified with us.
4. 1 person had a plate full of leftovers, and when the server came to clear it she asked if she could have a box. The server offered to box it for her. My friend said \"are you sure? you have a lot of plates...\" but was reassured it wasn't a big deal. The box was never brought out, and we found out the food was thrown away. 
5. We got the free churros with the yelp check-in and when they finally came out my friend picked one up and burnt her finger so bad it left a blister. I wish they would've given a heads up that they were scalding hot. Maybe if the table had water she could have cooled off her skin quickly....:)

All the events individually weren't a big deal, but when it all happens during your first impression it certainly taints the experience (especially when it's your birthday...). Overall, everyone enjoyed their food...when fingers weren't being burned or food wasn't been thrown away. The patio atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. You have to park in a dirt lot, but it's better than driving around the neighborhood looking for a spot! I'm sure the experience was a fluke, maybe we'll come back after the blister heals."}
{"text":"Wow. Just WOW! We had delivery thru uber, so it was a little cold, but it didn't even matter- this food is incredible. We ordered off the brunch menu and shared the mole enchiladas, French toast, chicken enchiladas, guacamole, and Barbacoa quesadilla. Everybody couldn't say enough positive things about the food. The salsa is chunky and the freshest I've had in recent memory. The chicken enchiladas were cheesy but also hearty with savory, simmered chicken. The French toast was unique and unlike anything else in town (but make sure you're a coconut fan). It's clear they put time and skill into these dishes. I'm so thankful this place is in our neighborhood---we will be back!!!! And now, I'm going to go enjoy this Saturday food coma. :)"}
{"text":"A beautiful bar and restaurant. A large and inviting patio, too. However, the food was diappointing. Especially since this is owned by the \"Vig\" restaurant group. Chips and salsa trio are alacarte. The chip are fresh and warm, but, the salsa disappointing. Even the spicy was bland and quite mild. The green salsa was downright boring and jar like. The chili Releno was really small, more like an appitizer than an entree. We had the Cobb salad which was quite good with really fresh ingredients. However, the dressing was boring, too. It needed some zip including some salt, which is not served at the table. We also had the Ceasar steak salad which was very good. The steak was excellently prepared, but, the salad was extremely overdressed, almost drowned. The waitstaff was friendly and efficient. All i can say was everthing was o.k., nothing special or notewofthy. We certainly expected better. P.S. the mens bathroom was filthy. Papertowels overflowing on the floor and even vomit on the floor(at least that is what I think it was). They need staff to regularly check these..."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time. I love myself some great tacos and great margs and always looking to try out somewhere new. Ladara did not disappoint!  My date got the el santo, which was incredible. I opted for the house marg with the added paleta, which was a nice treat on hot Phoenix evening.  We both got the carne asada tacos which were full of flavor!  Only wish is that they came with guac, but will make sure to order that as an app next time.  Awesome dinner, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican.  The outdoor patio was great. Drinks have great variety and interesting flavors.  Appetizers tasty.  Tacos filling and flavorful.  Service was unfortunately slow."}
{"text":"I normally like ladera.  They have some good dishes. Last night was a bit of a fail.  The crunchy fish tacos were made from a cheap river fish ( tasted like catfish) and was not crunchy.  The shrimp taco was even worse. I took one bite and knew that the shrimp was bad!   Other than that, the barbacoa, grilled chicken, and even the quesadilla is good."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service great atmosphere . The only reason i didn't give it five stars is due to pricing and portions. Slightly overpriced and no complementary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a business trip and sought out some Mexican food.  Found them in Yelp.  Their outdoor courtyard was awesome.  Great style and decor.  Had a cool vibe.  Tried the taco sampler plate and it was fantastic.  I think I liked the fish and carne ones the best! The service was on point.  I told the front desk staff at my hotel to add this place to their recommend list!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The patio is great! Big fire place, comfy/cozy seating, and an area to play cornhole! The food, drinks and service are really great. I keep ordering the 5 taco plate. Need to try something different next time but the tacos are so good!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place and it is good, I order the chilaquiles without eggs so the portion was small, coffee was warm, my daughter order the mole enchiladas portion was pretty good. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and we were fairly disappointed. The food is expensive for Mexican food but we knew that going in and had heard good things about the restaurant.

The first thing we found out is they \"charge\" you for chips and salsa!? This is the first of hundreds of Mexican food restaurants that I have eaten at that charge for chips and salsa. With the high prices of the food you would think you would at least get chips and salsa for free.

In regards to our food it was just decent but nothing spectacular. We ordered the chicken burrito and nacho's. My burrito was a very large portion size and decent. The nachos however were very soggy and had a large piece of fat mixed into it, disappointing. We did get an order of the churro's and they were amazing, some of the best ever.

Lastly, the service wasn't great. We asked for more water over and over, it took 10 minutes in between to get the water jug filled. Even asking for the simplest of things like a straw were difficult for our waitress. The management and hostess staff were very friendly, though. I wish the wait staff took a page from them."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is great! We went on a Thursday night & they had live music. The musician, Miguel, is so talented. Aside from the great entertainment, their food is to die for. We had guacamole & salsa plus the street corn as an appetizer....DELICIOUS! For dinner, i had the chile relleno & my husband had the mole. He loved it, i loved it, so much that we came back that Sunday for brunch, since Miguel also plays on Sundays. Brunch was great. They have $4 mimosas, can't beat that :)"}
{"text":"Great covered, outdoor patio.  Definitely a hip place.  Food was great!  Service was phenomenal.  Took the kids, and they loved it.  We left totally stuffed.  I highly recommend the Churros which were hot and filled with some sort of caramel sauce."}
{"text":"Found this spot on a trip to AZ in the middle of a neighborhood. It was like an oasis with really trendy decor and good food. We had the tacos and carnitas which were tasty and hot the spot. Live acoustic guitar and singer was a nice touch on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was awful. Went during brunch when it wasn't super busy so we didn't expect it to take that long."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere! Steak ranchero was to die for and the pollo enchilada was amazing. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I have given 4 stars as the food and setting is great . Had dinner here and the young man explained the menu and was very attentive, decided to try brunch today ... food was good service sucked ... no spoon for the coffee , waitress checked in once waited a long time to place order....impression I received was that serving was beneath her and she was doing us a favor ....she definitely does not belong in the service industry."}
{"text":"Went here on a date the other day and it was wonderful. The food was great and the price was even better. The staff is amazing and very attentive."}
{"text":"Poor service waited for an hour for chips. Lack off staff to support customers. Don't even ask for a drink, it will not come. Rather go to south Phoenix and get great food and better service. Way to expensive. $14 for enchilada? Give me a break, never again."}
{"text":"Wexican Food.  Came by after a funeral with a group of 7.  The ambiance was cool.  Great patio and decor.

Fresh made chips, good salsas, and guac were all pretty solid.  The Santos drink was money but they fit every single bit of ice they could in the short glass.  Maybe got 4 or 5 sips out of it and it was gone.

The tacos were bunk.  Rotisserie chicken tacos (bleh) and flank steak carne asada will never substitute for the real thing.  C'mon people we are in freakin Sunnyslope there are carnicerias on every other corner. Step up your game!

The elote was also whack.  Lacked flavor and was very plain.  The michelada was alright.  It started really good but went down hill after I added more Tecate to it.

The service was bad.  For some reason our waitress was not feeling us.  I'm not sure why.  She was the only one on the patio and from what I could tell was friendly with the other guests.  From the jump she didn't seem to like us.  We had to ask for chips three times. 
Took forever to ask us for our drinks.  Not friendly or kind.  Luckily for her I wasn't in charge of the tipping.

Would never come back and never recommend.  Way too many places near here that put out amazing food with a smile."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and I still have the same issues...poor service.  Yes, the patio is fantastic.  But the house Cabernet is one step before vinegar. We ordered happy hour Puerco tacos.  I wish the waitress would have explained it wasn't really tacos. It is a skillet of mediocre pork and potatoes with an unnecessary egg on top served with chips.  We waited and waited for our wine.   There are so many good things about Ladera.  It isn't the parking, it's the patio.  Live music on Thursday was a treat.  Thumbs up for Miguel.  I think it can be so much better."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It's really nice and has a huge outside patio, great girls night/ date night spot. GREAT Latin music! I had the pastor tacos and they were really good, margaritas are super yummy and the service was great"}
{"text":"Stellar little joint in the Sunnyslope area.  The patio is darling and we came right after Thanksgiving - I pity the employee who had to hang all those ornaments from the ceiling (looks fab though!).  

Drinks were fantastic and the food was delicious.  I had the fish tacos and they magical - magical in the sense that they are more than the sum of their parts.  I can see the physical ingredients but they must have tossed fairy dust on it because I wanted ten more (even though I was so very full).  

The queso was delicious and they were kind enough to make a second order with less spice for my mom.  I had a fried banana chocolate chip ice cream deal for dessert and it was bizarrely delicious.  

Service was great and my parents have declared we MUST go there when they're in town again."}
{"text":"I was truly skeptical at first since I'm so used to home cooked Mexican food. I'm so impressed by everything! I love the music and all the plants in the patio.

Amazing food & drinks and we got to meet the awesome chef Jose who is behind all the magic. The sangrias and micheladas are yummy. We got the chilaquiles, guac, mole enchiladas, and barbacoa hash (all really great). 

Great customer service and prices are worth it. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and love the atmosphere.  Combine the ambience with the excellent service, and it quickly has become one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Tara our server was great !! We had a lot of questions and she was so patient and informative. Food was really good. I could use some more spice but the flavors were great . We had the guacamole, corn, french toast, caesar salad and steak ranchera. the french toast was sweet but delicious. and don't forget the churros! 
they have $4 mimosas and good sangria. the ambiance was fantastic and service from the entire staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Finally tried Ladera and so glad we did, it was great service and delicious food. Started with the three salsa & chips, Carne Asada tacos & Halibut ceviche all of it was fresh and flavorful. We then ordered the Pozole & Pork Carnitas as our entrees both were very good. The decor is gorgeous. We definitely will be back to sit on the patio by the fireplace."}
{"text":"Best patio, best margaritas, and the best happy hour! Where has Ladera been all of my life?! Don't skip the street style corn- we ordered it off of the cob and it made a tasty dip for their tortilla chips. Tacos are all fab but what makes the meal is the mouth-watering cinnamon churros. There might be butterscotch in the middle but we devoured them too fast. It is heaven. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican brunch I have ever had!! Gorgeous patio ambience, fire place, bistro lights, corn hole, and seating! The food is delicious with great flavor. Brunch is on point with $4 mimosas, bloody marry, sangria and even Micheladas! Can't beat the price and amazing service! I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Although we got to Ladera late with only 5 minutes left until the kitchen closed to order food because we had just flown into Phoenix our waiter Matthew was so welcoming and nice. We both ordered tacos and the salsa trio, everything came out quick and was so good!! The venue is also very cool with an outdoor seating area with games to play."}
{"text":"I'm a strong believer in recovery.   And had the server Seth and manager not been great at their job, this 5 stars would have been a 3.   I must say that alllll of the food was delicious.  The shrimp and fish tacos were some of the best I have ever had..I'd recommend them over the chicken or steak tacos.    The queso was really good and the three salsas they have all had great distinct flavors

The restaurant had a great atmosphere.  The bar made some really tasty margaritas w a nice punch.    

The churros were the best I have ever had

Some areas were slow but again manager and server made it all worth it.   Very excited to come back.  Def one of the best and most flavorful Mexican restaurants in PHX 

It's a cute and quaint place tucked away in north central PHX.  This place puts Mission to shame"}
{"text":"Just great!! Great happy hour prices, great food. The scene can be a bit crowded at the bar..but not so much where you want to push people out of the way. The outside area is a cool weather only option..I went when the sprinklers were down in July and you can pretty much kiss any outside enjoyment goodbye. 

This is defiantly a place in my rotation and should be considered a place to bring new folks, or folks in a group setting. 

I attended an event there and it went off rather swimmingly."}
{"text":"I give this review in hopes that the business reads the concerns and critiques of its patrons. Being it's in our neighborhood and inviting ANY upscale business in the area, I was beyond elated to watch the birth of this restaurant. We waited months and months for the place to open, ending up making it in on our anniversary with my wife. The place is GORGEOUS.  Worth going just for the ambiance. The service was pretty good. Our server was really friendly and kind. The drinks were top notch and we'll be back for those alone. The food, meh. 16$ for some pork with super dry, but soggy, and stale (I know it sounds weird. Couldn't figure it out myself) but over all inedible tortillas. Not very plant based friendly (which is fine, can't win them all) but left my wife with very minimal options. The chips served with the guacamole were obviously not made in house and were relatively stale.  10$ for that (though the salsa that accompanied it was amazing).  Over all, a good date night place for drinks and maybe an appetizer. But we spent a lot of money for pretty subpar food.  I want this business to thrive, it's a selfish endeavor for I want our neighborhood to grow. I hope the business can as well."}
{"text":"I don't give out five's easily but with terrific service, an amazing outdoor patio area, and food that isn't your typical rice, beans, and gobs of cheese, this Mexican restaurant delights the palate.  My husband loves the five street tacos but from their unique guacamole to an array of medium priced drinks (great deals at happy hour), this place rocks the Sunnyslope.  Their parking lot is a little bit odd--you have to walk from a lot away, but hey, after all the food you eat, walking may be just what's needed!  Please do try their chili rellano's if you want a healthy rendition--not a lot of cheese, but plenty of favorable vegetables wrapped in a hatch chili.  Yum!  I've liked it so much that I've ordered it twice now..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great tequila list! Food was good, had the pork shoulder which I thought was ok, the carne asada was fantastic and the whole red snapper was awesome. Best dish was the hominy rice and beans!!! (Mix them together, trust me)"}
{"text":"Great food,service, atmosphere. Love the El Santo and the quesadillas fritas! Perfect little addition to the growing community of good places to eat in Sunnyslope. I highly recommend this restaurant for brunch on the weekend or anytime really."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!  What was previously Corbin's is now a trendy, modern asset to Sunnyslope.  The owners, also of the Vig, know how to maximize the use of their space.  What was a wasted outdoor area before is an AMAZING covered patio.  Their happy hour menu is affordable and tasty.  I had the taco sampler.  This way I know what I want to order the next time.  And the frijoles, laced with BACON, yum.  Our server, Haley, was helpful and fun.  The birthday dessert of fried bananas with ice cream was decadent, but not free as we were led to believe, but still worth the price.  We will be back...many times."}
{"text":"I ate dinner with my daughter and girlfriend last Saturday night at Ladera and Adrianne did an awesome job! Great table presence, great job connecting without being intrusive, and good recommendations/answers to my questions about what to eat.  Just as importantly, she did a great job treating my daughter as she would any other guest.  Simple stuff when we think about it, yet so often it gets missed in the hospitality industry.  The MOD came by and did a table check and made a little conversation--but not too much, and not canned.  This is also a place where you can find just about any tequila you would ever want!

Food was great. I appreciated that the only options for kids weren't a bean burrito, quesadilla, and chicken tenders. My daughter got the carne asada tacos and loved them--especially the guac that came on the side! My barbacoa was off the charts, and the girlfriend's 5 taco combo was killer too."}
{"text":"Bueno  Bueno...from the moment we sat down we were treated royally and the flavors were divine.  Our appetizers of street tacos and AMAZING guacamole accentuated our margaritas.  yummy.  The Cobb salad was superb w moist chicken and avocados.  The chile rellano was uniquely delicious.   The churros were a surprise w warm chocolate mousse and caramel centers.  wowsy.  we worked off our dinner playing  Corn Hole. Katrina is a rock star waitress.  superb night."}
{"text":"Score another winner for the crew at Genuine Concepts.  The same people that brought The Vig, The Womack, Cobra Arcade Bar, Little Woody, Deli Tavern, Linger Longer Lounge and The McMillan to the valley now have a Mexican food concept in an often overlooked neighborhood in CenPho.  My Mom wanted to grab dinner together after work but wanted something close to her home.  Ladera had been on my to do list for awhile so on a Wednesday night it was off to Genuine's Mexican creation.

The location of Ladera at first glance is one that should be ideal.  On the southeast corner of Central Avenue and Alice, Ladera resides just a block north of the popular walking and biking trail along the Arizona Canal.  The Murphy Bridle Path (another popular walking and running trail) ends just a few blocks south of here as well.  Yet despite the plentiful pedestrian and car traffic that travels through this area, no restaurant has been able to maintain staying power here.  Previously it was Corbin's that opened and subsequently closed here, and two other restaurant concepts failed prior to that.  Will Ladera be able to break this trend?  Well, Tucker Woodberry has been known to create comfortable inviting spaces and Ladera is no exception.  On the outside, a huge patio with an outdoor fireplace and even an artificial turf area for cornhole toss.  Inside, dim lighting from overhead chandeliers with brick walls and a fully stocked bar.  But the prominent dark wood accents inside and outside leave little doubt that this place is a Woodberry design.

My Mom and I enjoyed the covered outdoor patio this time around on a perfect spring evening.  The dinner menu at Ladera follows a fairly traditional Mexican playbook of tacos, tortilla based appetizers, enchiladas, full meat plates, as well as various sides.  My Mom and I shared their chips with salsa and guacamole dips.  Ladera's salsa is fairly run of the mill, but sets its guacamole apart by incorporating orange slices (of all things).  Barrio Cafe's extra guacamole ingredient is pomegranates, so I guess oranges are Ladera's thing.  It certainly gives the guac an extra fruity acidic element, but its fairly subtle.  For my main dish, I wanted to sample a variety of flavors.  And what better way to do that than a taco platter.  Ladera's Five Taco Platter are flour tortillas containing five different fillings.  Carne Asada (Beef), Pastor (Pork), Pollo Asada (Chicken), Shrimp, and Fish.  Each with their own unique toppings to compliment the meats and made very much like you'd find from a neighborhood taco stand or taco truck.  The tacos were all outstanding and the meats were cooked perfectly on each.  My favorite of the bunch was probably their fish taco with cabbage, cotija cheese, cilantro, avocado cream and remoulade.  For dessert, I used my Yelp Check-In to get a free order of their Churros.  A half dozen 5 inch churros with a caramel sweet cream sauce topped with pomegranates on the side.  Fantastically delicious with copious amounts of warm cinnamon on the churros themselves and the cream sauce added a sweet, smooth, savory element.

Total cost for the app, entree, dessert, a house margarita (because one must), tax and tip came to about $40.  A little bit on the steep side considering the portion size (especially given that I got the dessert for free).  The chips here aren't free unlike many other Mexican food establishments in town so that may be partly responsible.  That said I really don't have many complaints about the quality of the chips, the rest of the food or of the restaurant itself.  The venue looks like it can pack in upwards of 150-200 at full capacity, making it ideal for big get togethers and it so happens there were a couple of those going on the night we were here.  Whether Ladera reverses the curse of this seemingly idyllic plot of land remains to be seen overtime.  But as an upscale Mexican restaurant option for the mostly upper middle class residents in the area, Tucker Woodberry's concept appears to be well positioned for the long run.  And of course I've probably now jinxed it (sorry, Tucker)."}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped foot at Ladera, we were in love. The place is gorgeous. We sat outside on a hot summer night, and we were comfortable and amazed by the beautiful decor.

For starters, I ordered the elote. You can never go wrong with elote. It wasn't too heavy on the sauce and cheese like some elotes which I loved. We had the guacamole which was just okay - a little bland for my taste but still worth getting. For my main dish, I had the cochinita pibil which I loved. It came in a mountain of pork deliciousness, warm tortillas and the best black beans ever. It was a huge dish. It tasted just as good the next day. My boyfriend ordered the chiles rellenos which he really enjoyed. For a vegetarian dish, it was amazing. I tried one of their carne asada tacos which I thought was just okay - it was a little dry so I think I would definitely stick with their main dishes next time. I had their delicious margaritas too.

We loved this place so much that we came back a few days later for brunch. Definitely get the chilaquiles and the barbacoa hash. They are both amazing dishes. My sister ordered the french toast. It is not your typical french toast. It had coconut which I am not a fan of but I was surprised at how delicious it was. My sister's boyfriend ordered the burrito which he loved as well. 

If I could give half stars, I would definitely gives this place 4.5. The service was great. Everyone was wonderful and attentive despite the busyness. The prices are great and worth it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every nice patio. Food was okay. My group thought it needed a little more flavor. It was good but needed a kick. My plate was the best, gorditas of barbacoa. We did order dessert, churros. They were good up there with the ones from Barrio Cafe."}
{"text":"What a great find! Loved this place, we will be back! Great atmosphere, outdoor patio with comfy fireplace. Full bar and tequila bar at your disposal. The menu was refreshing and unique. Not your tiered old Mexican fare. Must try the churros!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent customer service .  Excellent happy hour and live music on the weekends for brunch"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Menu. Exceptional cocktails & delicious food. The vibe is right. Hope this place continues to go strong!"}
{"text":"First off the decor and ambiance are awesome. Patio is really something, especially in AZ. Very neatly done.
Drinks are ok and so is the service.  I wanted to love it, I was super excited about it and took some friends there (none of us have ever been), but food was meh. Portions are fine, however nothing stood out. I had a chicken dinner, it could have been juicier, beans were ok...overall lackluster. My friends had tacos and some pork dish, I forget, nothing spectacular. I'll go back to see if I missed something."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, good food!! I had the enchiladas verdes and they were fantastic !Service could have been a little friendlier."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Ladera.  The patio is large and comfortable, they have an extensive stock of tequilas and the food was excellent.  The ambience was casual and I found conversation with my companion very easy in spite of the size of the patio and proximity to Central Avenue.  This restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood and I will return."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Really cool atmosphere and the staff is so sweet and welcoming. We ordered the nachos and I 10/10 recommend!! Delicious food:)"}
{"text":"A really cute neighborhood bar & Mexican restaurant with updated classics! Very delicious! I had the 5 taco sampler so I could try each type: Carne asada, pork pastor, pollo asada, shrimp and fish - very tasty. The service was okay - waitress wasn't very friendly. The outdoor patio is sooo pretty, very open with little lights on the trees. My only feedback is to allow mixing and matching of the tacos - I wanted the 3 taco plate but not all the same kind and the waitress said mixing wasn't allowed. Give your customer what they ask for when it's something simple like that. Guacamole and OG margarita was fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Cool building,love the patio! Great cocktails fantastic food!  Customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Everything from service, ambiance and food is fantastic every time we are here! 
Order the bloody Mary's extra spicy!
Group of ten of us and we were all  attended to with every need, we never had to wait with an empty glass."}
{"text":"Terrific Sunday brunch. Nice variety at reasonable prices. Superior service ( thank you Sam). The sauce on chicken enchiladas was perfect. Both my son and I we were very pleased. Super music selection fit so well with the warm Hispanic flavored surroundings. We felt like we could easily have been in Mexico City. Looks like the parking issue is \"almost\" resolved with a lot next door. All in all one of the finer Phoenix eateries."}
{"text":"I love  this place and am so happy they have moved into the neighborhood... The ambiance is inviting and engaging. The staff especially the sweet,beautiful and very attentive server with the awesome earrings and great smile...Unfortunately I am not  recalling her name at this moment she knows who she is:) adds to the chill experience to unwind after a tough week at work.
The menu offered totally delivers on many levels... especially if you are a fan of this cuisine...The only negative for me is that the cocktails consist mainly of ice... 3 sips of the margarita and you are left slurping. I was a bartender for many years... Rene's, Shugrue's both in Sedona.... but really these cocktails were 3/4th ice. I get not wanting people to get comatose but I think a bit of an adjustment is in order other than that keep up the good vibe!
."}
{"text":"Had my bestfriend's birthday dinner here and everything was exceptional! The pricing shows in their menu and I would say is affordable. The ambience at night time was perfect as well and the servers were attentive and friendly. I really recommend trying out this place and we're definitely coming back. **just a side note: The taco+burro on the menu doesn't mean you get both, it means choose between taco or burro."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere.  A must try place.  The ceviche is delicious, I crave it.  
Brunch is tasty and the sangria is perfect!"}
{"text":"Hip hip hooray! Quality food, gorgeous atmosphere & great service!!!
This is the best Mexican dining experience in the valley!! We shared the 5 Taco Platter and savored all the varied yumminess. This is the BEST GUACAMOLE with tiny bits of orange segment plus a sophisticated spice blend. Happy hour rocks!!! I predict that 2018 is the year for great times at Ladera Taverna y Cocina! Trust me nothing else compares, and we've been searching Phoenix Metro for 14 years."}
{"text":"Great mole enchiladas. Comfortable, modern patio. Had a great time here this afternoon. Thanks."}
{"text":"Wow - we had a great time, great service and great food. Our waitperson, Carline was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations that we really loved.  
We started out with a pair of Paloma cocktails that tasted very refreshing in the hot summer weather. While sipping our cocktails, we munched on the outstanding guacamole with pumpkin seeds and oranges that was super creamy and delicious. 

For our entree, my wife had a good shrimp burro (aka burrito) and I had a marvelous chili relleno with barbacoa on the side. The relleno was different (and better from my perspective) from most rellenos. It wasn't battered and deep fried, it was char grilled only. The STAR of the show was the barbacoa. It was tender, spicy and very flavorful and layered. Best barbacoa I've ever had. I Highly recommend it. 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time having brunch here I  had the Mole enchilada Shaved corn our waitress Adrianne was  awesome we will be going back"}
{"text":"Not only incredible food, but an absolutely amazing atmosphere!! Its a stunningly beautiful restaurant & the food is beyond delicious. This is our new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour a few weeks ago and had a great experience...definitely worth a be back visit!  We sat at a table in the bar and had great service...beautiful decor too.  I enjoyed a pinche paloma cocktail and we shared the elotes (amazing), pork in green chile with a sunnyside up egg (tasty), hominy rice, carne asado tacos and conchita pibil tacos...all reasonably priced for happy hour and a perfect light dinner!  Next time we'll sit on the large patio and enjoy the beautiful weather!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© took me to Ladera the other night for my birthday, and I love this restaurant! We made it in time for happy hour (Mon-Fri, 3-6p) and were able to get so much food for a great price! :) 

For appetizers we got the Guacamole and Queso Fundido, both were so good! The guacamole is interesting because it has pepitas and oranges - which is actually really good. I especially loved the cojita cheese on top, and you get a ton! The queso was amazing, too. Whatever cheese they use is delicious!

My fianc√© also had a couple of the Margarita En La Casas which he thought were really good, and strong.

Next we ordered one of each taco on the happy hour menu: Pork Pastor, Carne Asada, and Pollo Asado. These were all good! The Pollo Asado is good if you like a lot of toppings, and the Carne Asada is better for someone like my fianc√© who likes just the basics on a taco. 

Next was my favorite part of the whole meal, the dessert! We got an order of the churros (free when you check in on Yelp! :)) and they were to die for lol. Probably the best churros I've ever had. Beware though the filling is hot af and my mouth still hurts two days later haha. 

The atmosphere and service at Ladera is great as well! Can't wait to go back sometime, I can guarantee we will just for churros!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. We live less than a mile away and have enjoyed the ambiance and vibe. Ordered a new item tonight and was seriously disappointed. It was some sort of queso dip that had all sorts of \"stuff\" in it and it hardened quickly. 

It would also be nice if the taco size grew over time and the soda and draft beer wasn't flat.

Improve each day!!!"}
{"text":"YELPERS BEWARE: FALSE ADVERTISING!!! Ladera promises free churros with check in and then charges you $3 for them. The coupon literally says \"free churros with check in\" and then it shows up as $3 on your check. When we asked why we were charged, our waitress said that she checked with her manager and it was their policy. Ladera, why even have this coupon available if you are not going to honor it?"}
{"text":"The ambiance is terrific: live music, misters and twinkly lights outside. Cocktails are inventive but the food is only good (not great). The guacamole has pineapple chunks-- not traditional but truly delicious. The tacos al pastor had raw red onion that really took away from the otherwise delicate flavors. The fish tacos were unfortunately fishy."}
{"text":"One my new favorite places.  Great staff, Sam is amazing.  The food is fantastic and drinks are lovely!"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Ladera for a while. We love the Vig - one of their sister restaurants and we had a gift certificate so two great excuses to go out. The decor and ambiance is 5 stars all the way. We made a 5:30 reservation and they were totally cool when I texted them and asked to move it to 6:00. We sat outside beside the fireplace. 
Our server was a bit confused about the IPA options when my husband asked - he said they had three but then couldn't remember what they were. He brought one to the table and then my husband noticed that there were other options not even mentioned. I had a cocktail which was very nice. 
For an appetizer we ordered green chile with chips. The chips were housemade and tasty but the green chile was super watery with big chunks of potato in it. I'm sure some people like this but it's not my style. My husband ordered the taco platter and I ordered the chile relleno based on our servers recommendation. And then... we waited. After being seated at 6, it was about 7:20 when our food was actually delivered. The server kept coming back and saying, \"what? your food isn't here?\". I know they were busy but there was not a lot of accountability there. When we did get our meal, we had two distinct experiences. My husband's tacos were cold having sat for a long time before they were delivered but my relleno was top notch - very good. The manager was alerted to the fact that we'd waited almost an hour and a half to eat and he was genuinedly apologetic and removed our food from the bill - a class act.
I would like to say that I will give Ladera another try but the reality is that there are so many fantastic restaurants in Phoenix now, that it may be a long time before I make it back."}
{"text":"Excellent find!  Great service and the food is outstanding. Lovely outside patio dining. Our waiter was so great with suggestions and making sure we had everything we wanted and needed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Discovered that finding the best Mexican food can be done by searching for best margarita on yelp. It is 4 hours later and I am thinking of going back. The margaritas were great (coupe deville) as I was lucky someone else in our group ordered and shared it. I loved all of my drinks for all very different reasons, the (something) Aztec made me want more of the amazing creativity of the bartender. Next was the¬ø Porque No?, minty, refreshing and where did it go. The Telenovella was equally as good, and as expected spicy, sweet and should have lasted an hour, but when it was gone I wanted a \" to be continued\". At this point, I have not even written about the food, or service, which I do not think I will be able to do justice. The restaurant was immaculate, the servers were friendly, and attentive. Tony our server was impeccable and made sure our orders were correct (we had one member who gets ill if he eats cilantro). The 5 taco platter was amazing. The problem was that it made me want 12 more tacos. The shrimp taco was the best ever, and everyone at my table agreeed.Shrimp at a Mexican restaurant is usually awful and overlooked . I wish I hadn't shared it.  Seriously, I wish I hadn't shared. The carne asada was amazing, and had a smoky flavor. But can we talk about the shrimp again. Or the cocktails. Did I mention the quacamole, salsa or chips? I should have. Don't forget to get them or the puerco en chile verde. The crispy banana was heavenly. The manager stopped by at the end to check to see if everything was to our liking and he was a spitting image of his restaurant, meticulous, classy and joyful."}
{"text":"Great food.
The Classic Margaritas can be less icy, but they are good.
The elote... omg! Is the f* bomb!
We enjoyed the ambiance, live music for 5 de mayo. Really nice staff, the bartenders are super nice.
We had the Cochinita: fantastic, so tender, so good.

We will definitely go back and try other things from the menu
Highly recommended for a date night or refresh yourself in the middle of the week!
Cool cool!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time at Ladera the other night. This place has the cutest outside patio and the perfect ambience! 

We ended up ordering their house margaritas with serrano pepper bitters and it was so flavorful without being overly spicy. We also ordered their appetizers. Highly recommend the queso fundido, salsa, elote and guacamole ( Listed in descending order of what we liked). For dessert, we ordered the churros and we were not disappointed! Definitely a good way to end the meal.

Overall the service was great and our server was very attentive. I would definitely go back to try their entrees and other drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday, the food was amazing. I had one of their burritos and it was phenomenal. We also tried the guacamole and chips, tres leches cheesecake and churros - they were also really tasty! Would definitely recommend this place! Need to come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Most definitely want to come back to try everything else on the menu....foodie approved"}
{"text":"So thankful to have this amazing spot right up the street! This new spot is beautiful- so much work was put into the renovations here. The patio is amazing with a giant fireplace to cozy up to on chilly nights.  Per our servers recommendation we tried the cactus tacos and they were surprisingly awesome. The skinny margaritas were nothing short of exceptional. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu. This is quickly going to become one of my new favorite happy hour spots. This ownership group has successfully done it-AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Aside from the slow start on the service.  We were sat immediately on a Friday night and it was crowded but not crazy. After sitting for about 5-7 minutes with no greeting nothing, our waiter finally came over.  From then on everything was very good.      Large waters, excellent drink menu.  I ordered tecate and the wife had a hot spicy margarita.  Beware u get chips which are excellent but have to order them and pay for the salsa which is kind of ridiculous. But the chips and salsa are excellent.   3 types. All good.  I ordered the 5 taco plate didn't need more than 3.  My fish taco and carne asada were great.    Others decent. My wife ordered a two enchilada plate and I had to help finish them.  The sauce was about the best I've ever tasted     My two kids had steak taco and a burrito     All in all this place was excellent.     But warning, it's pretty fancy pants inside and the price reflects it.    For our family of four it was 95$ with tip."}
{"text":"Poor service. Given menu but not a hello. No water. Bad cocktail. Didn't even ask if I wanted food. Basic bar menu. Hope dinner service is more welcoming. Really tired of bad service with these \"concept\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance, and service was great. However...the price of the tequila I drank was very sobering."}
{"text":"Delicious food, awesome cocktails, and gorgeous atmosphere!! Our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place was great. It is very upscale Mexican food so if you want everything covered in cheese and deep fried, this is the wrong place! We ordered the margarita, chips and salsa trio, elote, barbacoa, cochina pibil, and free churros for checking in! 

Margarita- so good! Not super sweet, enough tequila, only $5 for happy hour.

Chips and salsa- chips were good, nothing amazing. The salsa was realllly spicy. Almost too spicy for us to even eat. The red salsa was the best one! 

Elote- omg so great. I love elote and this was the best I've ever had.

Barbacoa- huge portion of delicious meat served with corn tortillas. The barbacoa was so tender, juicy, and flavorful. 

Cochina pibil- same thing as the barbacoa- served the same way and equally delicious though I think I liked the barbacoa a little more. 

Churros- mmmmm!! They were filled with caramel or something and came with this super fluffy chocolatey whipped cream. Really good! I would definitely order these again. 

The waitress was great and the manager came by a few times to make sure we had what we needed. The atmosphere was really nice. I can't wait until it's cooler so we can enjoy their adorable patio!"}
{"text":"Thanks Ladera for such a wonderful brunch on Saturday!! This was my second visit, the first was a Yelp event they hosted that was phenomenal! So I had to bring my hubby back for a delicious brunch to share this fantastic find!! Amazing service!! The meals were beyond sublime!! Our tastebuds were definitely awake and happy!! Mimosas for $4 doesn't hurt either! Our server Matthew was super attentive and friendly! This will be one of our new hangouts due to the exceptional outdoor patio as well!! Beautifully appointed and a perfect place for gathering large groups!! Check them out!! Only challenge is parking, but they're working on that!! Worth the effort for Sure!!"}
{"text":"Great food wonderful atmosphere but needed a warning about the pork tacos!! Soooo spicy!!! Other than that it was a really nice experience."}
{"text":"I'm honestly very confused by the Arizona Republic on their review regarding this new Genuine Concepts restaurant, I've only had good experiences here. I've been here quite a few times since they opened and have tried a lot of what's on their menu, their food is amazing. Despite living in Arizona for 18 years, this is one of the only restaurants I've been to that serves authentic Mexican food that I truly enjoy. The tacos (especially the pollo and carne) are outstanding, never too heavy and always meet my expectations. The pollo entree is out of this world, chicken is extremely tender, perfectly seasoned and comes with side of fresh made tortillas.. YUM!! The nachos are huge.. literally a pile of tortilla chips, meat, cheese, guac and so much other yummy goodness on one plate, would definitely recommend ordering this when with a big group because it could easily feed 10 people as an appetizer. The quesadilla, although may sound pretty basic and standard was seriously one of the best I've ever had and you wanna know why... cause it's fried and topped with salsa and guac! Now to the desserts... I've tried all 3... multiple times. The fried banana being my favorite, it's amazing, comes with side of ice cream and the mix of the 2 is simple and tastes amazing. The fried ice cream and churro are also 2 desserts I recommend, so yummy! The ambiance of the restaurant was very cool, lots of seating indoor and outdoor. Friendly staff, amazing food, and a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Good restaurant aesthetics, food was meh. Ordered the corn appetizer, which lacked that distinct cotija flavor. Did the taco plate (5 tacos: pastor, asada, chicken, shrimp, fish), the pastor and fish were excellent but can't say the same for the rest. People were great, like I said it is a good looking restaurant, but could use some work in the dishes."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Music was great! French toast was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  The cocktails were unique, not sweet like most places.  

I had the 5 taco sampler - beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, and cactus!  She had the chili relleno - this is not the traditional style...grilled, stuffed with veggies, etc.  Way more healthy.   All tasted great.  

The patio is awesome!   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!  The food,  the atmosphere,  oh and the service! Fabulous! My friend and I went for happy hour.  The $5 cocktails were so refreshing. I had the El Santo, like a margarita with whiskey. So good! And we ordered the carne asada tacos with a side of elotes,  seasoned corn. It was all delicious! The carne asada had great flavor with caramelized onion,  and was served on handmade corn tortillas. Also,  we had the churros for dessert.  They are filled with this amazing caramel sauce,  and served with an incredible tasting chocolate sauce and bits of pomegranate. Just wow!  Our server was Tony.  He was so attentive,  personable,  and took time to answer our 20 questions about the cocktails and food. The best service I have had in ages! I will definitely be back soon! Ladera is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican eatery tucked away off of Camelback Ave. Our second choice for dinner because the wait was too long elsewhere. Surprised there was no wait here. Not your ordinary Mexican fare. Upscale without pretension. Gourmet
But approachable"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. I know there are so many great restaurants in the area but the service, decor music on a sunny Sunday afternoon was awesome. Miguel was playing great guitar from many genres and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I keep fluctuating between 3-4 stars...
The decor of this restaurant is stunning and in keeping with the Spanish theme. Outdoor patio with romantic lighting, and the inside is just as cozy.

The staff is friendly and the bartenders do a great job.

I was excited to get the margarita with a full paleta inside, but was disheartened to find out they use the store bought Outshine popsicles you can get at the grocery store. They should definitely partner with a local Paleta maker like Paletas Betty. They should be able to find a good vendor, even if it's the Mexican brands found at Food City.

The elote was dry and not seasonal, but the toppings that made it elote were absolutely delicious! 

The Cochinita Pibil and Barbacoa were outstanding and well seasoned. The tortillas were definitely not house-made which is a huge bummer, especially in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I get together for brunch on a regular basis and to keep it interesting we've been trying out different Phoenix restaurants.  I will hands down say that Ladera Taverna will become part of a regular weekly rotation.  In terms of value, taste, ambiance and service, I can't say enough about my experience here!  

The patio is absolutely gorgeous and well suited for those Sunday morning conversations with friends.  A number of us started off with the $4 sangria special; the drinks were huge compared to a lot of other brunch spots where you pay $6 for little more than a tall shot glass.  For the same $4 you can also order a mimosa, house margarita, bloody mary or michelada.  The sangria was tasty without being too sweet (several of us ordered a second round which means my friends must have liked them too!)

As for the food--yummy is the only way to describe my Chilaquiles Rojas, and I'll be the first to admit I'm usually a straight up bacon and eggs kinda guy.  The black bean accompaniment was the best I've ever tasted. I would order this again and again again!  As for the Barbacoa Hash, two friends got that and were quite pleased.

Finally--our servers were friendly and attentive.  If I could give Ladera Taverna's brunch a 6 or 7-star rating I would!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere! We went for Sunday Brunch and my hubby got the. Real fast burrito and said it was one of the best he has ever had. I had AMAZING posole and my son, who has eaten carne Assad EVERYWHERE said it was excellent. The chips  and salsa trio were very good also. 
We will go back for the happy hour! Parking is not great but there is a lot about half a block east of the restaurant with plenty of space. 
They hit a homer in with the decor too. Just beautiful and I could sit on the patio all day!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great drinks, and amazing food. The head chef and creator of the menu came and spoke with us at the bar and gave the the history behind many of the dishes. Just about all of them are family recipes"}
{"text":"Parking is horrible. Atmosphere is good, but $8.00 for chips and salsa seems crazy high."}
{"text":"After having this place bookmarked for a while and repeated recommendations from my roommate, we finally when to Ladera the other night and I'm so glad we did :) their patio is so cute and pretty and the food is delicious! The atmosphere was perfect for a warm and sunny weekend night. 

We made it in time for happy hour, and they have really great deals so we took advantage and just ordered off that menu. First, my boyfriend had the house margarita and I had the Pinche Paloma. He really enjoyed his and said it was pretty strong. Mine didn't seem to have much tequila in it and was a little more carbonated than I like, but still good. 

For an appetizer, we had the guacamole with chips, and it was super tasty. They put a lot of cheese and pepitas in it which I really liked, and they give you a good amount with tons of chips (and free refills), which was nice because a lot of places can be kinda stingy on that lol. 

Then, for dinner we split the pastor and carne asada tacos. This was one of those places where once I was eating them, I was like, omg this is why I love tacos so much - they were amazing! It was hard to decide, but I think the pastor were my fave - I loved the pineapple pieces on top.  

Then, for dessert, we had the churros (you get a free order when you check in!), which have a salted caramel in the middle and come with a chocolate/whip cream sauce. Those were excellent as well :) I would definitely recommend this place if you're into tacos, and I know we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"GREAT happy hour! Select $5 cocktails and discounted apps. Love what they did to the building and how they expanded and integrated the outdoor space. And I'm super happy about the parking lot, which is well lit and easily walkable. (I HATE forced valet and I'm so glad they didn't take that route!)

Here's what I thought about the items we had on our happy hour:
~ trio of salsas ($5) all were heavy on the lime; we liked the variety and the chips
~ elote ($5) seemed equivalent to 1 ear of corn, cut into thirds, which help with sharing. The aoli was more apparent than the cojita -- messy but good flavor.
~ green chile pork  ($7) delicious - not enough tortillas! It was very soupy so it was hard to stretch the tortillas by packing them with the chile. Fortunately, the chips from the salsa trio were able to get the job done! 
~ carnitas tacos ($7) the shredded pork melted in your mouth! Great flavor! 
~ carne asada tacos ($7) excellent quality steak, still pink, super tender! A personal favorite!
~ El Santo ($5): think margarita meets a whiskey sour. Would definitely get this again! 

We didn't get the nachos but I'm already planning my return -- they looked great!

The cocktail menu had a lot of drinks on it that would make a good nightcap. 

The guys did it again with this upscale neighborhood tavern! So grateful to have them in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A friend recommended this place and km glad he did. I've only been there for dinner and it's very good. All tacos are delicious, my favorite is the rice. Margaritas are awesome, atmosphere is great especially when I have my two kids, it's very kid friendly, customer service is ok but waitress need to be a bit more attentive! This is my new spot and can't wait to have brunch here because I heard it's also delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining at Ladera, and it's by far my new favorite gourmet Mexican restaurant!  The most authentic Mexican food besides my own!  Loved the atmosphere, and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"My mom was in town and wanted a good place to eat with Mexican food. All of our norm spots had wait times and didn't want to wait with two little ones so a friend recommended this place and we went. We started off with the Sangria Tinta and guac! Really tasty with a hint of citrus flavor and the salsa had a real KICK to it. My hubby ordered 1/2 chicken and my mom and I ordered the pollo Asada burros but with shrimp. My mom loved hers...me not so much. The crema wasn't my cup of tea. The kids ordered chicken and rice and quesadillas. Our waitress Tera was the BEST! Very down to earth and great energy! Please ask for her. Oh a got the churros for dessert...another winner. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! My friend and I are in Phoenix for a business training and decided to look for a place to eat. This place is amazing!!! I wish we would have a place like this back home!!! Staff super amazing and friendly. Food looked and tasted delicious. I ordered the nachos and they were sooooo tasty. My friend ordered the enchiladas and he was happy too. Amazing feature is that they have a love singer. He sang beautifully. Everything is great about this place, from the decor to the food oh lalala absolutely highly recommended. I left this place with a happy face and wishing I could come again soon."}
{"text":"First time going on Saturday, Food and service was amazing, the carne asada tacos had great flavor and the salsa each had there own unique kick, definitely going again."}
{"text":"5 stars!!! It was delicious! I had brunch here today. Love the ambiance. Our server was Tony who was friendly and attentive. One of the chefs came to our table and checked on us. Customer service was great! Now for the food, I had chilaquiles and French toast( I was starving ). Loved my orders. Food is authentic, the only I didn't like were the black beans with my meal-everyone else loved it though. My sister had the barbacoa and my bf had a burrito. Everyone was beyond satisfied. Our bill was cheap. I'm coming back next week for brunch."}
{"text":"I want to give 4 stars but I can't. 
The ambience is stunning, patio area beautiful and very inviting. Inside was just as perfect and finally a restaurant where you can sit inside and have a conversation. 
Food was delicious for 3 out of 4 of us. The guacamole and chips were outstanding.  3 of us had the Cochinita Pibil tacos, which are 3 small tacos in a soft corn tortilla. No sides come with any of the tacos. The other person in our party originally ordered the chicken mole but switched when he found out that it was just a leg thigh and wing for $25. You should get a whole chicken for that price.  Instead he went with the Rellenos and it was good but super spicy. 
Why not 4 stars? I think they are a little pricy for what you get. Service was good but when we received our split bill it was off. If we hadn't caught it we would had paid $20 more than what the bill actually was. It was corrected but the charge had already been put through so now we have to wait for the credits. 
I will go back again because I would like to give them another chance and see the restaurant be successful but I do think they need to adjust their prices just a little."}
{"text":"Met a client here for dinner.  It's part of the Genuine Concepts family of restaurants, and since I like The Vig and other places of theirs, I thought I'd check out Ladera.   Plus, it was in her hood.

We sat outside, which it was a windy day that day.

I had the manhattan, which I gather was with house whiskey.  Dunno.  UGHHH!!  So I asked for a manhattan with Bulleit Bourbon.   She had a happy hour margarita.  UGHHH!   She didn't like it either.   I told her to send it back but she didn't.  She did ask for them to put in more of whatever they sweeten it with.  When she got it back, she said it was better but she still didn't really like it.

I ordered the COCHINITA PIBIL from the menu, but I noticed on the bill it said puerco pibil.  I don't know if that's the same thing.  She ordered the happy hour pollo tacos and a quesadilla.

Mine came with a side of black beans and I asked for flour tortillas versus the corn.

The food was bland.   It needed some sort of kick.  She said her tacos lacked umff as well.  I told her maybe it needed salsa -- or something!   She asked Sarah, our server, for salsa.   She said it helped a little.   I was thinking that's what I should have had as well.

I took most of my meat dish home.  Since I have salsa, I added some of that to it.   It seemed to give it a little boost.

I think they are trying to be a Richardson's, which I do like the flavoring of their foods.   It just lacked flavor -- or something.

Sarah was pleasant and professional.   I think this is one of the Genuine Concept restaurants I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Great service, I had the delicious 5 taco platter and a margarita while they played an eclectic Mexican playlist on the pretty patio. The manager was very friendly, I will be headed back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the Pastor tacos I ordered! Loved the margarita and ambience, especially the beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem! It's right by our house and is absolutely some of the best Mexican food we've eaten. Very authentic. The place and ambience are great. 

And my gluten free boyfriend can eat here without any worry or issues!!! Come and check it out, there's rarely wait."}
{"text":"Met a group for Sunday brunch. We sat on the patio. Nice surroundings with wonderful live guitarist performing in the background. Service was outstanding. Had a wide variety of cocktails.... my favorite was the pepper vodka with lime juice, a nice alternative if you don't want tequila. 
The brunch menu had a lot of choices. Food was served timely and HOT!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Our server Terra did an amazing job with the big group of people we had, I clouding kids!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space. Yet in a city full of amazing Mexican, they seriously lack on the food front. Since I live in the area and want to see them do well, in spite of a below average initial experience, I  been twice now. Shrimp salad first round. And shrimp tacos the second round. Shrimp are soggy and chewy. WAYYYYYY too much cream on the tacos. Rice was clumpy and cold. The servers all seem like they have stage fright. Nobody confident or welcoming - across the board. I feel like they did an A game on decor and sent the C team in to run it. Come on Genuine - this place won't make it on looks alone."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food the barbacoa plate was delicious as well as the shrimp salad, we enjoyed the lovely patio and live music"}
{"text":"What a great find! The atmosphere is so warm and cozy tucked inside this little neighborhood. You walk in to a little oasis with outdoor and indoor seating. Great friendly service and the food is fantastic from the street tacos to the entrees. Barboaca  was so flavorful and tender.

A definite return !"}
{"text":"I don't miss chain food, but I do miss the service standards. Sever was unprofessional for the prices at this restaurant. Also, on a hot summer night outdoor seating is tolerable only if the misters are left on. Unfortunately someone turned them off halfway thorough our meal and by the time we saw an employee we were so hot we just wanted our check no opportunity for a second beverage or dessert. Ceviche has something on it that tasted like perfume or soap. Carne asada was excellent."}
{"text":"Holy moly. 
This place was SENSATIONAL! From start to finish - first impression, decor, service, food and drink. 

Arriving at the restaurant, there was parking out back which was lite and clearly marked. Ladera is right on the corner - from the outside it looks very sleek with a beautiful stone doorway and black iron detailing through the front. Inside was even more stunning (please note my photos to see it for yourself)!

When we sat down, we were greeted by a very pleasant server, Katrina. We all started with margaritas - two blended and two spicy on the rocks. She was knowledgable and read our table very well which I feel is a very important (but not always present) quality to have as a server. We started with some guacamole and street corn which were both visually appealing it also so incredibly delicious. In fact, every single dish that hit our table was beautifully placed with undeniably delicious flavours. Katrina gave our table some time to order mains as she could tell we wanted to chat and catch up - thank you!

My boyfriend and I shared the ensalada de cobb and carne asada. Again, the flavours were out of this world! If I could break the 5 star rate scale, Ladera would be up there! Drinks were always full, the food was spectacular and we even got free churros for checking in! These perfectly warmed churros were filled with caramel and chocolate fillings. We all agreed that they were the best churros we had ever had!!!!!

On our way out we stopped to play a couple round of Corn Hole. I truly mean it when I say this restaurant couldn't have knocked our socks off any more."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my colleagues and this place is a gem. The ambience, the architecture, the music, the service, the food...all of it was amazing. It was like being transported to a beautiful restaurant in Mexico. The guacomole is the best i have EVER had in my life!

I don't remember the name of our server but he was really friendly and informative. I would definitely come back AND recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional.  The food is wonderful, the restaurant is stunning and the staff is spot on.
Oh, and you must sit on the gorgeous patio. 
I love  the Tijuana Caesar, the barbacoa and the posole is the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This is legit Mexican. We had the chile relleno and the barbacoa with the elotes as an appetizer. Very delicious. Comfy and trendy outdoor patio. The music is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, check!
Great menu, check!

Finally a restaurant that understands carne asada doesn't need to be well done.

Fantastic chips, great guacamole with hint of citrus.

And finally, any Mexican style restaurant that serves Margaritas that don't contain some sort of sweet and sour mix, rocks in my book...

Worth a look, I promise."}
{"text":"Delicious food, inventive and tasty cocktails, attentive service... really great patio too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great ambiance and really good food.  I'll fly back from Boston to visit again."}
{"text":"I checked out this place at 7:30 on a Saturday.  I was by myself and quickly found a spot at the bar.  Service was excellent. I quickly ordered a delicious margarita ($8) and some chips and salsa.  Unfortunately this place charges for chips and salsa ($6) which I always find extraordinarily cheap.  The chips were solid (almost too hard) and not very flavorful.  The salsas were all excellent and I ate almost all of them! I was between a few dishes and the bartender suggested that I try the stuffed poblano.  It arrived so quickly I couldn't believe it!  It was a great option if you're a vegetarian (which I'm not) but it was very flavorful although perhaps a bit lighter than what I wanted because I was sort of hungry.  The atmosphere is what makes this place.  Not my favorite Mexican spot but I will check it out again."}
{"text":"Exellent food and friendly atmosphere. The guacamole is outstanding and the micheladas refreshing. Good for families and and a fun bar. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was fine. I've done brunch and happy hour and like I say, it's fine. Given a choice, I'll walk next door to Timo. That's better than fine."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and atmosphere- one of our favorite neighborhood spots.  Our server, Antonio, whom we've had several times,  is excellent! Thank you for always making our dining experience exceptional"}
{"text":"So far everything I've had has been amazing!! The Mexican corn on the cob is one of my favorites. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in the restaurant is BEAUTIFUL!! I has a very open layout with patio seating! Perfect for a Fall season dinner while in the open area and a fresh breeze hitting your face while you sip on a delicious margarita!"}
{"text":"Vacationing in Arizona has become a preoccupation for me because I want to move to the west coast. I explore food web-site to find cheap eats, food market and fine dining. I found  Ladera Taverna y Cocina while searching online Mexican food"}
{"text":"Finally real Mexican food in Phoenix!!! There wasn't a single item that we ordered that wasn't amazing. We loved the guacamole with its unexpected flavors and textures. The house made tortillas were warm and delicious. I have never in my life been wowed by carne asada, but this was above and beyond good. I love that Central Phoenix has this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this adorable little slice of heaven! It reminds me of many places in L.A. but with less of a crowd, and kinder people!!! This is my official Brunch Spot here in Phoenix now! It's cute, affordable, food is good and the live music is just awesome!!! Great to bring friends/family that are visiting from another State.... try em out!"}
{"text":"Had the guac and chips to start, very good (minus the oranges and sunflower seeds on top..) then the carne asada burrito very Good! New favorite."}
{"text":"Really great food and service! They have a very nontraditional menu, but all of it was too notch! I wouldn't head here if you're looking for a standard burrito or tacos, but this is a great location for casual-fancy brunch or date night!"}
{"text":"This Modern Mexican Restaurant is as good as you'll find in Phoenix, Scottsdale or Arizona for that matter.  The restaurant can offer just about everything...  Reasonable prices, great appetizers and drinks, great good, amazing ambiance and excellent service.

Go here!"}
{"text":"This place was a home run. Outdoor seating had an awesome atmosphere, the service was very attentive and fast, all the food was really great, but the chicken tacos were excellent. If I lived near Ladera I would be there every week or so."}
{"text":"My husband and I went yesterday to celebrate our 5th year anniversary. We love this place. Very cosy, great service, clean & the food, drinks, desserts are amazing. Is our third time visiting this restaurant. First time we were passing by and stopped, second time we were celebrating our engagement and this last time celebrating our anniversary."}
{"text":"This place has a cute atmosphere. Great for a date night. For drinks I had the mezcalada which was really interesting. It was basically a pina colada with a slight smoke flavor/after taste. My boyfriend had the margarita and mentioned it was a little to tart for his taste. I had the chile relleno which I loved and I think it's a great vegetarian dish. My boyfriend had the taco trio: al pastor, carne asada, and pollo asado. He said it was just so-so. For dessert we had the fried ice cream which was very sweet and yummy and most definitely shareable. Our service was sub par."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Authentic just like mom made. You have to try this place. The food is amazing and the vibe is just as amazing. Had the best date night ever here with the hubby. You will not be disappointed. This place is great for friends, family and date night. The service is great and eveything is home made just right and the homemade tortilla top it off. I can't say enough good things about this place. I can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambience is perfect, both inside and out. We were seated next to the bar, and the night lighting inside isn't too dim, and not bright at all; sexy and romantic. 

The mole sauce was on point, just wish they added a side of veggies of some sort instead of black beans and rice. 

The Relleno my girlfriend got was also delicious and spicy. Very clean dish (vegetarian). 

The cocktails were very tasty (lots of mescal drinks, and allot of mescal brands to choose from). The michelada I got was decent. 

Definitely would come here again to try different dishes and cocktails. Perfect place for date night."}
{"text":"Great patio design and atmosphere. Our waitress on the other hand, is what made my first time experience, not a pleasant one.

We were a table of 5 among 4 others tables that were in use, out of the entire restaurant.

During our stay, 1 XX beer & Titos/diet took 35 minutes. And and our checks took 15 minutes.

Our table asked personel and had to find our waitress on 3 different occasions.

Food was great, patio layout was great, but my tables service was extremely bad. She apologized over and over, 2 different occasions during our stay but I figured after the first apology, she would make us a priority.

Aye ya ya. First experience was not a good one."}
{"text":"Ladera is a place I stumbled upon on Yelp while searching for new Mexican restaurants. Reviews are good and pictures looked decent, so naturally, we had to give them a-go. We've since visited twice and have found a few pros and cons from our experiences.

We always order their guacamole, which I'd say is fine for the $6.50 happy hour price, but not quite worth the regular ten dollar price point. We've become particularly hard on guac in the past several months after establishing our \"gold standard,\" so it takes a lot to impress us. It's just good, straight-up, standard guacamole. Furthermore, their elote, which we ordered shaved, is decent - helped by the addition of the extra ingredients as usual. Their puerco en chile verde is okay, but is best enjoyed with a spoon.

Both times we visited, we ordered six tacos, sampling their carne asada, cochinita pibil, and nopalitos, which I've actually never tried before. All tacos are decent quality, although what's unusual is that I remember the asada being spectacular on our first visit - having that lovely smoky meat flavor that we both associate with good asada tacos. The second time around, the meat was a bit bland and did not taste anywhere near as good as the first time. My girlfriend and I were both a bit baffled as to why. I'm not sure if this was due to a change in recipe or simply just chalked up to inconsistencies. Furthermore, sides of charred and refried beans are just okay.

For dessert, we've had their fried ice cream, which consists of chocolate chip ice cream, corn flakes, kahlua cream, and a bit of spiced honey. The dessert is topped off with a miniature churro that's filled with cajeta. We love our fried ice cream and definitely were pleased with their clever little take on it. We've also ordered their stand-alone churros, which come with a bit of Mexican chocolate for dipping. They are also decent.

Overall, I see this is a cool little restaurant. Their patio looks nicely designed, with live music playing that's piped throughout the entire restaurant (including the restrooms). Server was very friendly.

Are there better places out there? Definitely. But I still see them as a respectable option.

Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! We live down the street and rode our bikes up to the restaurant. Great outdoor patio, great drinks, awesome food. Definitely a place we will visit again. I'm hoping their brunch is as good as their dinner!"}
{"text":"Loved the patio, drinks were great, food was ehhhh I guess it just wasn't my style of Mexican. Very modern."}
{"text":"was looking for a mexican restaurant with great yelp reviews and this was the winner. 
The doors are wide open and it was freezing inside because we sat right next to the door.
they charge for chips and i couldnt believe it. You DO NOT charge for chips at a mexican restaurant. horrible business decision. I guess they know there food is so good they can do whatever they want.. the churros and the mexican corn are both some of the best ive ever had and the chile relleno was different than any other ive had being that it didnt have breading but you dont screw your customers and charge for chips!"}
{"text":"Absolutely as beautiful indoors as is outside!  

Immediately happy to be here, Beer me!  Modelo Negra draft and Taco Platter please. Service is friendly and helpful. Long drive on a beautiful day, rewarded with a great patio, tacos and beer... what more could I ask for?  Tres Leches?  Yes!  But I passed and opted for another beer.  Today's mission:  Provide comfort.  But first, get into character. 

Do:

5 TACO PLATTER- Asada, Pollo, Al Pastor, Shrimp & Fish...  perfection!  
MODELO NEGRA Draft

Next time in town, I'd do it all over again."}
{"text":"Why have I been driving by this place?  It's so flipping tasty I can hardly stand it. Restaurant week brought us in however, we will return. 

The guacamole is so super yummy. Mango and some sort of nut accompany this dish amazingly well. The appetizers were the ahi mango salad and the chicken tostadas. The salad was amazing. The mango was so crazy good with the ahi I can't even describe.  the mans chicken tostadas were fresh and loaded with goodness.  They alone could feed a person for sure. 

Main courses. The green corn tamales were smothered in a nice pork and pico and cheese. The stuffed chili was so dang amazing. The use of the fresh veggies and the smokes taste of the chili oh my. 

On to desert...I'm still to full to eat it but know we brought the flan and chirps he to enjoy. Our waiter was awesome and very knowledgeable of the menu. 

This place is going on the rotation and note we won't be driving by all that often."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Muy Bien! Their tortilla chips are perfect and with it you can order the \"3 salsas\". The salsa are intense in. Good way!... two are very spicy and one is mild. I love the Rejeno fo my meal. If you live them, this one is a huge Chile at $13 and worth every penny. My wife gets the tacos, mix and match. Every time Im there I have heir best drink, El Santo\". A bourbon drink thats Mmmmmmmm! Reserve a spot in the patio.
and ask to sit by the fireplace! They have a great guitarist that plays often. I could go every day. You need to try!"}
{"text":"I have come here a couple of times and like the variety of the menu.  The food is not strictly Mexican and you can find variations on things like green chili and street corn.  BTW the street corn is die for!  

Also the patio feel and decor are awesome. You feel like you can take your time and enjoy their ambiance.  Definitely one of the places that if you have company in town that wants Mexican but not necessarily heat (they have those options as well) this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"We started with the queso and it was great. I had the 5 taco plate and my wife had the enchiladas both were excellent. We finished with the churros which are filled and served with caramel dipping sauce!  So good!"}
{"text":"Ladera is a modern Mexican bar and dinning experience, tucked away on the less congested north end of Central Avenue. From the moment you pull up and see the beautifully designed, yet modest, exterior you know you're in for a treat.

This past Sunday I had the pleasure of enjoying a crisp Mimosa, their Triple Salsa Chips, and the ever so rare Coco Leche French Toast ... all while sitting in their grand patio as the live tunes of their local guitarist, Miguel, blessed the atmosphere with the sounds of his guitar.

The Mimosa:
Traditional as far as Mimosas go. With so much attention to detail, I do wish they added just a bit of flare to this morning cocktail. Perhaps a freshly sliced orange would have taken it to the next level, for me. But overall, it's what you would expect a Mimosa to taste like :)

Trio De Salsas:
Embrace the culinary side of Mexico with this great appetizer! You won't be disappointed. They serve their salsas with thin corn chips that aren't overly salted, like in so many other restaurants. They let their salsas do the talking. This treat is made up of three salsa bowls; their Salsa Roja, their Salsa Verde, and their Chile de Arbol. Each one a joy to toss around in your mouth while you wait for your main dish. And mine ... was something very different. Their salsa roja was fresh, slightly chunky, and wasn't overly spicy. Just enough to make your mouth sweat. Their salsa verde was a bit bright. Fun to dip and even better tasting then most salsa verdes I've had elsewhere. And finally, my fav, their Chile de Arbol. Oh man, the flavors were on point. One taste of this, and instantly I was taken back to my grandmothers house in Monterrey. Yummmm!

Coco Leche French Toast:
Made up of cajetea (dulce de leche), toasted coconut, and coconut streusel. This was a rare treat. The sliced bread weren't too thick or too heavily sweetened, but rather nicely balanced. A great blend of flavors going on that take French toast to another level. Epic!

Okay, okay. I know you guys might be thinking, \"Who reviews a Mimosa and French Toast at a Mexican restaurant?!?\" Well ... to keep it simple ... this guy! Lol. I do plan on revisiting this lush gem of modern Mexican cuisine tucked away on the far north end of Central. Who knows, we may just bump into each other on my next adventure out to Ladera ;)

Salud!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last evening and had a wonderful experience. Was with a group of four and everything everyone ordered was absolutely delicious. The customer service here is also stellar! Would highly recommend for a date night as well as it has a very lovely, intimate ambiance. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Service and atmosphere were both great. Cocktails and cuisine was even better!! Had the guacamole, salsa trio and street corn to start. Then we had tacos pastor, carne asada, and barbacoa enchilada. The enchilada was literally melt-in-your-mouth amazing. We will definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone about the ambience- very well done, welcoming and patio is beautiful!  Servers were friendly. Took a long time for drinks. I ordered a frozen margarita- was surprised to find out that the frozen margarita was bartender's choice, which tonight was a smoky mango? Not for me but the waitress happily took it back. Thick tortilla chips. Salsa trio was good.   I do agree with previous review about tortillas, definitely the thick corn tortillas you buy in a grocery store. I had heard portions were small for the price. Guacamole was very tasty but I do have an objection to paying $10 for what appears to be less than one cup. My partner had the chile relleno which he liked, I had the Tijuana Caesar, which was good, although it said it was to be dressed with jalape√±o ranch, but I received a vinaigrette. Definitely would skip the pork verde as it was watery, bland and had very few chunks of pork in it.  The eggs, both on my salad and pork verde were undercooked and still jelly like.  A lot of these things are new restaurants jitters, which may resolve in time, except for the portion size, which I expected having heard from 3 different couples, but still not a good starting rep."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food in AZ is a dime a dozen. But, one that has good food, good atmosphere and good service, checks enough boxes for me to give them 5 stars. I usually sit at the bar and the service is always great. My wife and I even got an entire lesson on Tequila, of which they have many. It was like going to a wine tasting but with Tequila! The patio is nice and relaxing with a roaring fire and you can even throw bags!!! The only dings I can come up with is that the cafe lights over the area where you throw bags makes it hard to play, and they charge for salsa. But, who goes to a Mexican place to throw bags, and the salsa is actually worth the charge. 

Start with a tour of their tacos. Pastor is my favorite. The machaca enchiladas are also amazing. 

All in all...it's a great place to pop in for some tacos and beer, or a nice relaxing evening of sipping tequila. The area is really coming into its own."}
{"text":"Awesome salsa! Good food, good drinks, good service. Great outdoor seating and very nice bar. Only downside is the offsite parking lot."}
{"text":"After several visits Ladera has become a favorite. Indoor and outdoor seating are comfortable. Food is central Mexican without heavy cheese and sauce but not short on flavor. Guacamole is special. 

Service is friendly and unrushed. Great casual dining. Go. See for yourself."}
{"text":"New local spot that we are so happy opened near us. Service is great and friendly. Have been three of four times now and has not disappointed. The happy hour prices and drinks are great. Solid tacos and salads. Get the seared shaved corn and chips- fantastic. Sunday brunch menu is strong- chicken mole enchiladas rule"}
{"text":"My first time going to this hidden little gem, and it was delicious. Everything from the service to the great tasting guacamole more than met my expectations. I would highly recommend this place to any food enthusiast or anyone who loves Mexican in general. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Wow. I can't really believe how I was treated when I was in the restaurant.  I really like many of the other concepts like the vig, linger longer, and Womack.  

However, I must say that the attitude from the hostesses and staff feel very LA.  If I wanted attitude I would have stayed in la where attitude was the norm and the reason for me leaving.  

The atmosphere seems cool and the menu looked good but honestly I did not even give it a chance.   My business will go where I feel comfortable and wanted."}
{"text":"quiero dejarles saber. este lugar es magnifico. delisiosos tacos presios razonables . buen servicio al cliente un ambiente unico para pasar un tiempo agradable con amigos y familia lo recomiendo a todo el publico general si te gusta la chatarra y no quieres gastar mejor quedate en tu casa solo digo para la gente que no sabe  ladera te miro pronto grasias"}
{"text":"Stopped by this cool looking restaurant with great reviews for a quick bite to eat. It wasn't busy, waited a minute to get seated and then sat at table for 10+ minutes without any acknowledgment other than someone dropping off two glasses of water.  Got up and left, very disappointed."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon my lady and I were in search of a patio and margaritas. After a quick search of yelp, we settled on Ladera. Arriving at the restaurant, we were surprised to not see any real parking lot. Maybe this changes during busier times, where they open the vacant lot next door to them. On this day however, street parking was available. Walking in, Ladera is gorgeous. The shaded patio with the fireplace; the reclaimed wood; all of it sets the tone for a wonderful experience. Our host quickly came up and greeted us, warmly bringing us to our seat, and brought us water. And then we waited...and waited. I didn't have my stop watch running but I would venture in the neighborhood of 10 minutes for anyone else to acknowledge us. Eventually, our server came and took our beverage order, as well a couple appetizers. Both of which came out fairly quickly. My Paloma was wonderful, my date's margarita was dreadful. When our server came back she graciously took the drink away, later she would inform us that the manager had tried the drink and had agreed that it was incorrect and that it would be taken off of our bill. For the food, we had the street corn, the salsa trio, and a quesadilla; all of which were tasty. However, if we get the street corn again, I'll ask for the \"on the cob\" preparation. I'm pretty sure they used frozen bag corn for the, \"shaved,\" version. All in all, we had a fine experience. The environment was gorgeous, the food was tasty. Our service was slower than I expected and I was surprised by the lack of management presence in the dining room. We'll probably be back at some point, but I don't think anytime too soon."}
{"text":"We found a gem on Central! Amazing guacamole, beautiful ambiance, and overall one of our NEW favorite restaurants! A must try!"}
{"text":"my husband wanted to take his mom out fo brunch on her birthday so we stumbled upon this place. At 1st I felt uneas"}
{"text":"Hells ya! What a great Mexican spot. Food was killer and the drink menu was spectacular - frozen cocktails with Mezcal...say no more. The Gorditas with Barbacoa and the Posole soup made the meal - fresh chips and house-made guacamole were just as good and set the stage. Fresh, and very true to form - Mexica Cuisine. I felt like somebody in that kitchen really did their homework on the items, menu content and took the time to bring out the best of what \"Mexican Food\" offers,  not the same old nachos, half hearted tacos and flautas routine. Flawless execution if you ask me. Portions were huge and I left feeling like I had two dinners ...technically I did. 

Service was great and the atmosphere is authentic and well done. Great ambiance and a terrace that makes you want to sit and chill awhile. Want to head back soon for brunch. 

Very happy this place is nearby. A+"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awesome. We had a group of 20 that we needed to get in ASAP and they were super accommodating. The 5 taco platter  was awesome. Good sampling of all the tacos. The salsa and guacamole were also super good. 
We sat inside but the patio looked beautiful. Lot of space, definitely good for groups. They also had live music that was really nice to listen to. I would definitely come back here and recommend this place. 
The churros were amazing as well. Super fresh and soft. And the cream that came with is was whipped cream and caramel. Fantastic overall"}
{"text":"A BEAUTIFUL way to spend a Sunday afternoon for Brunch.  The huevos rancheros and chilaquiles are so delicious!  And the churros made my birthday brunch perfect. Ladera is a treat so treat yourself!"}
{"text":"So went here on a Saturday night at 5:45.  Was told it was a 30 minute wait.  8 empty tables inside and 2 empty tables outside.  Asked about them and wasn't given an explanation just a 30 minute wait time.  Waited until 6:10 and still 10 empty tables.  Lots of people standing in bar area could get a drink.  Needless to say we didn't try a single drink or dish because we left."}
{"text":"Ladera is such a nice, fun exquisite place to just relax and enjoy a nice White Wine Sangria, and a must have is the Carnitas Tacos, I've had the Carne Asada, also very good, but my preference is the Carnitas"}
{"text":"We had a really good experience at Ladera for a group of seven. Every single of of the staff (Hostess, Waitress (Haily), Waiting-staff, and General Manager were very friendly and helpful. The drinks were tasty with a twist - nicely done! Food is definitely an A+. Everyone of us were satisfied with our order. Let's talk about ambiance. We were really impressed with it's spacious setting and structural appealing, inside and outside. In particular, the patios has a play-area (like a kids-zone), then a \"formal\" dining area with a lovely fireplace. We are especially glad to have Ladera in our neighborhood...bringing up the trendiness and new-concept of dining. 
We highly recommend this place, and we will come back very soon. Kudos & Happy Dining !"}
{"text":"First time at this place, between hostes and waitress we waited about 15 min... after this situation manager noticed about our waiting time and apologized, he didn't charged for appetizer and dessert. Cool environment, delicious food, good drinks, amazing guacamole and churros! Would definitely come back to this place not because of the free appetizer or dessert...just because they cared about clients and did everything possible to makes us happy that night! Thank you for your service! We really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Most of the food and drinks were quite good but the Chili Relleno was just warm, unevenly heated, and the filling was average. They also forgot to prepare one of our orders as requested. We ate there on a Tuesday night and although not very crowded, they seemed understaffed and service, while pleasant, was slow on all fronts including getting seated. Liked the decor."}
{"text":"In Phoenix, options for authentic Mexican food are EVERYWHERE, but this place was memorable to me on so many levels.  First things first, the food and drink options. 

My husband and I sat at the bar for Happy Hour and indulged in some Elotes (which is just yellow corn) but fancy and flavorful. You can request either on the cob or shaved. We opted for shaved which had a drawback: all the flavors while merged together, get lost in the water coming off the corn. If you got this dish on the cob you would have concentrate bites of flavor.  It comes with chipotle aioli, chili powder and cotija cheese. It might have been spicy or had a kick if left on the cob but I got the gist of it and would get it again. Shaved makes it easier to scoop onto tacos!

Next we got some tacos.  2 per order: Carne Asada and Cochinita Pibil (Braised Pork).  Very good although the tortilla (small) didn't really do anything for me outside of holding the delicious meat. 

For a drink, I went straight for Gin, specifically the Porque No? Which is made with fords gin, st. George chareau aloe, mint and kiwi.  So REFRESHING! All parts were in harmony. I had 2.

A final comment on this place. The bartenders are very friendly and full of information if you're looking for things to do around town. Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"Came here today for Brunch. Guitarist playing. We were seated near by. 
Ordered our drinks plus guacamole appetizer. Waiter said he would have water delivered. 
Sure enough.... guacamole shows up. No plates. No silverware... not even the water. 
This I just don't understand. How does it happen that an appetizer is ordered and delivered and no beverages are delivered? 
I got up.... took the silverware off another table . Asked another server for some plates and at least water. 
She was so nice and of course brought them. Our server never said a word. No apologies. 
I really like you Ladera!! But you need to really TWEEK your service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is something special! I've been here twice and my goal is to try something different everytime me and my girlfriend come. They gave the best Guacamole I've ever had in my life. And there tacos and desserts arento die for. Customer service here is always wonderful, and the one we is extremely nice and obviously invests into buying njce things for the atmosphere here"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican restaurant in town. Period. I literally haven't had Mexican this good in Phoenix, ever. Thanks for a great night!!! Had green chip pork, elote shaved off the cob, tried mole, pastor, and a beer.... amazing food, literally amazing. Great job."}
{"text":"Used to be Corbins, but gutted and remodeled.
Food was ok on a cold and rainy January night, but to be frank, nothing very creative or terribly interesting.  It was like a Cantino Laredo or some such bland fare that you can get anywhere really.  

The menu was really boring I thought.  The usual stuff, guacamole and chips for $10, 
\"street\" type tacos, typical dishes such as half a rotisserie chicken with latin infused herbs and spices.  Had the Baracoba with beans.  It was nice but it didn't come out too hot.  Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for table to be dried as it was still damp from being wiped down, skinny jean bearded hipster waiter was nice enough but he was lacking in checking in.

Had Churros, he didn't tell me they were filled with Dulce sweet sauce stuff inside.  Didn't care for that, asked if in the future can the churros be made w/o that sickening sweet sauce stuffed inside.  He checked and said no......FROZEN, pre made Churro alert******

Booth Tables are this awful fake leather material that leave marks and are hard to keep clean, bad idea alert******

House margarita was fresh but lacked a buzz!!

Pretty place, may go back to have a drink and some appetizers at the bar next time but not rushing back in general.

Generic, boring, but at least its not a old gutted out building anymore so that's a plus in that area of Sunnyslope.

Was expecting better food and service.  Pretty place though.

PS I miss Corbins."}
{"text":"I don't really pay too many higher end Mexican food spots much attention but if their like Ladera maybe I should. Cool layout, indoor/outdoor with a massive bar in the back filled with tons of spirits. Pretty traditional menu however we had the snapper and it was perfect. A whole snapper with different types of citrus and herbs cooked perfectly. The elotes were awesome along with the guacamole (which was some citrus and nuts/seeds mixed in too). If you're more traditional try the Barbacoa, it's perfect, comes with cornbread, beans and rice with Hominy, and homemade tortilla. Great food, ideal for a date."}
{"text":"The service is just awful. Our server was sweet but was was so slow! And usually you can count on bussers or support staff to help but they were worse!! We asked for utensils and napkins, no joke, 5 times and to 3 different people?!!! And good luck getting water!
3 of us ordered $14 salads that were swimming in dressing and the tacos were less than impressive. We have been drawn in by that wonderful space outside but it's not worth the money and the wait."}
{"text":"Wow! The atmosphere and the food are really out of this world. I had the mole and it is spectacular. The sides are stupendous. Try the black beans, they are made with bacon and chorizo. Seriously had to take them away from my wife. The drinks are wonderful as well. Please stop by and have a great bite to eat...."}
{"text":"Love it! Came from out of town looking for great mexican food and I found it. Very traditional and very good portions for the price."}
{"text":"Have been here before and thought it would be a great place for happy hour, I was sorely mistaken. The atmosphere was amazing, food was good, if you could actually order it. Service was horrendous. We were told they could not split the check based on the number of people, which the server conveniently changed 3x. (first for parties greater than 20, then 15, and finally we were told, not for our party of 8!!!). Pricing was not marked and we had to ask multiple times for the cost of drinks, so people who needed to leave, could at least leave cash. We were charged $30 for chips, salsa & guacamole, which they offered upfront, as if it was complimentary! We asked several times for more salsa and chips, which we never received. Our bill was totally messed up at the end of the night, and we were grossly overcharged."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come try it and just haven't made it out, so glad we finally did ! 

Well today is Mother's Day and I chose this place.  I LOVE good, AUTHENTIC Mexican Food, truthfully I have few Mexican  places I enjoy, I usually prefer cooking my own. My favs are chilaquiles for breakfast, enchiladas and sopes. 

Ladera has it all!!! My mimosa and chilaquiles were AMAZING! I want to come back and try their mole enchiladas and sopes...actually I want to try everything on their menu!! I'm a foodie for Mexican food. 

The service was great, ambiance perfect for brunch  with the relaxing patio, misters and LIVE acoustic music...just how I wanted to spend my Sunday morning brunch with my 3 boys and hubby on the patio enjoying a game, sipping on mimosas and enjoying the day. 

Great value! Prices are seriously cheap!!! 

Thank you Ladera for creating such a great place and bringing true Mexican food in a beautiful authentic setting!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was nowhere to be seen half the time. Took 15 minutes to bring out our drinks, she never offered if we wanted refills. The food was super greasy, I've had better Mexican food elsewhere. The atmosphere is cute, but the staff is not helpful and also rude."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for a party of 5. We sat at a table (for drinks only?) on the patio. Not once were we offered a drink. A large party of about 6-8 couples let their children run around in the game area throwing bean bags at each other. Then they took cushions of the patio furniture and had pillow fights with each other. Meanwhile the guy playing guitar and singing put up with these kids running close to his equipment. When we complained to the hostess she told a man who said to the kids \"I don't know about the pillow throwing guys\". It was a playground and the parents ignored their kids. We saw a table of 2 next to the kids that got up and left before their order was taken. 

Our server was attentive and very nice, the drinks were good, the food amazing. But because of the running screaming kids I will give only 1 star. It really ruined the ambience. Manager really should have put a stop to it."}
{"text":"They nailed it from all aspects!!  Incredible ambience, we sat outside in June and the misters made it comfortable.  Tasty margarita and the tacos were outstanding!  Calabacitas (vegetarian) were yummy!  And the churros were so yummmy.  Coming back soon - you should too!"}
{"text":"The carne asada is amazing!!! It is truly on par with a gourmet \"Morton's\" steak just already cut in bite size pieces! The bartenders are amazing super friendly and extremely attentive. The chef knows how to cook no matter what you ask for and is also appreciative of your patronage! This is by far going to be my new go to!!!!! Keep up the great work and amazing food oh and let's not forget the outstanding patio and all around atmosphere"}
{"text":"I came here last night for their friends and family night. I was completely blown away! The food was 100% top notch. I was with 4 other friends and we had numerous drinks, appetizers and entrees. There was not one complaint about any dish from anyone in our party. Even the beans were so good, I am sitting here at my computer, eating my leftovers one bean at a time because I don't want them to ever end.
We tried the guacamole, elotes, fried quesadillas for appetizers, pollo asado, cochinita pibil. Everything was fantastic.
I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food! Great service! Amazing kids menu and bomb churros!"}
{"text":"Last night me and my homies...sexuals met up for dinner and the spot formerly known as Corbins.  Okay, so we pull up and the first thing I see is valet parking, which usually sets my douchometer into overdrive.  I think to myself, DAMN, why must we always have to efin valet my 1997 Toyota Corolla!  That feeling of annoyance quickly dissipated when we saw a self-service parking lots a few yards up from the restaurant.  To valet or not valet, the choice is yours.

As we approached the restaurant it was nothing like the old Corbins, this place has had a total make over, totally cool vibe with great enclosed patio area.  

We were seated outside on a high top, and folks details are my thang, this table was large enough to hold several plates, entrees, drinks, jackets, phones, emotional support animals and our drama.  Anyways, I loved the big spacious tables.  Speaking of details, my friends and I had a great evening of conversation, largely because there wasnt music blaring forcing us to yell at each other (TACO GUILD), again little details like these influence our dining choices with friends.  

Our server was truly amazing!  Dang, I forgot her name, but the young girl with the nose piercing, you were amazeballs!  

Now to the meat and potatoes (or um carne y papas) of the review.  The food was the icing on the cake.  Every entr√©e and drink we had enjoyed at our table was fantastic.  I ordered the Barbacoa beef, holy cow that was efin awesome.  My other half ordered the carne asada skirt steak, that was just as good, if not better.  Our orders came with homemade tortillas, we had both corn and flour, and they were good enough to eat on their own!  Every person at our table not only enjoyed the food, but the drinks and ambiance.  To get 5 fickle gays to all agree on food, drink and ambiance is like getting 5 women to agree on a single bridesmaids dress.  I cannot wait to come back for happy hour and to try the Mole and nopalitos tacos."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood restaurant. Guacamole and ceviche outstanding. Cod and mussels entree was amazing. Great value, great food, service and a wonderful evening out."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and never had a bad meal! Outdoor patio is the best place to hang out with a group of friends on a nice night. The inside is also very accommodating with a reservation."}
{"text":"This was a great hidden gem! Great live music(not too loud). The food was amazing! Everyone loved their dishes! Mole was really good! Cod and muscles was very tasty! Guacamole was very flavorful. I would recommend to friends and come back again."}
{"text":"I have been to Ladera 5 or 6 times now.  Best patio around!  Food is great but service is slow and just not good.  I was there for brunch Sunday and it wasn't too crowded, but my waitress was slow and would just disappear!  I had to track her down for drink refills and our check. This is the 3rd time I have been there and the service has sucked.  I really want this restaurant to survive!!   I hope the service staff becomes more attentive to their guests!  Restaurants like Hillstone and Mora make service their priority!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Ladera twice now and really enjoyed it. The patio is beautiful with wood beams, red and white lights and a large fireplace. Excellent ambiance with fun music. A great place for date night, girls night out, or bringing out of town guests. Everyone from the hostess, to the bussers, server and GM were very welcoming and kind. You can tell they wanted to make sure we were happy with our dining experience. 

On to the food: The guacamole is a must - great flavor with orange segments. I discovered the magic of orange segments at the old gallo blanco who until they closed, used to have my favorite guacamole in town... ladera's is probably even better! The elote, cochinta pibil, barbacoa enchiladas and Caesar salad were all very tasty! I really loved my margarita too. You can order it with a small paleta  (popsicle) in it. It doesn't quite melt but adds a hint of sweetness to cut the limey tartness. I recommend the orange popsicle. 

I can't wait to go back and try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food. Decent service. Went there with a large group and they did a pretty good job. Ironically they screwed up one order - the guy getting the bill.  He had a good attitude about it so wasn't the end of the world. Definite recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ladera is located just South of Central and Dunlap in Phoenix, parking is odd in the sense you need to self-park a bit down the street a lot over from the restaurant.  Restaurant very clean and a modern take on the Latin vibe.

My girlfriend and I went for Happy Hour to try out a new place and was pleasantly surprised, as we all know I am bit of a Mexican good snob.

We tried to Guacamole which was refreshing and delightful, the corn aka Elote was amazing.  We also split a taco plate I liked the Carne Taco as it wasnt over seasoned as some locations try to do. 

Side note; be cautious when outside on the patio on this day it was a bit windy and an umbrella feel over on to our table, the restaurant did bring us out new dishes and drinks no harm no foul."}
{"text":"We went there again last night for dinner.  This was our 3rd time coming here but the first time we were too lat to get parking which is a couple of blocks away unless you want to Valet which we do not.   The next time we got there for brunch and last night early enough for happy happy hour.   Parking wasn't much of a problem those last two times but it is a walk, even for handicap parking.  There is a parking lot right next to the restaurant but they don't own it so you can't park there.

We were early enough to take advantage of the happy hour menu which has some nice options.  We got the guacamole and Cochinita Pibil tacos which were both good, especially the tacos.  The guac was pretty good but they could leave out the caramelized orange for me.  The chicken mole was really good, light smoke taste cooked on a rotisserie.  The white meat was a little dry which was my only complaint about that dish. You also get a little bowl of charro black beans cooked with chorizo and bacon!  We also got the pan seared cod & mussels  with chorizo in a nice broth which helped the chicken that was a tad dry.  Overall an excellent dish.  

When I was there for brunch I got to try the Barbacoa Hash which I also enjoyed.  Despite being a lot of potatoes in there I didn't leave hungry but we also go the guac and Ceviche.  The Ceviche was also really good.  

I have to give them kudos for having a dark beer!  They have a really nice nut brown ale which is hard to find these days.  Usually can't get anything darker than an amber.  Wish they had a porter or a stout but the nut brown is good.  

Both times we sat at the bar and service was not a problem. The only minor issue was the setting sun was right in our eyes for a while.  They have a very nice outdoor seating which I'd like to try next time I go there.  Plenty of heaters and a nice, big fireplace to keep you warm on a cool evening like last night."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot... casual, classy, nice patio, kid friendly, perfect menu, knowledgable staff... hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, laid back but contemporary.  Matt was an excellent bartender and found me the perfect tequila I would like.  Love me some mole and their mole enchiladas are excellent."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. 

My boyfriend brought me here for a date night, and I fell in love with this restaurant. We came a little earlier in the evening so it wasn't busy, but as the evening progressed, it became evident that this restaurant was a local favourite. Service was excellent, and the food was incredible. 


Food: Oh my goodness. The flavours, textures, and presentation were out of this world. We ordered a lot of food, and for the quality of the ingredients, the price was entirely worth it. For people who complain that Mexican food is too greasy for them, check this place out. Ladera serves high-quality Mexican dishes that will knock your socks off. We ended up with: 

--Guacamole: Careful eating this delicious dish first. You won't be able to stop eating this and may end up being too full to eat anything else.

--Elotes: Mexican street corn. Toasty, creamy, and sweet. Delicious.

--Ceviche: SO fresh. The fish was inherently sweet. Well done Ladera. My only complaint would be the citrus seeds that I ended up chomping down on. A little bitter, but hey, I'm glad it's fresh.

--Cochinita Pabil: HOLY MOLY. This melt in your mouth slow roasted pork dish was incredible and a huge portion. Well worth the money. Get it. 

Drinks: Marguerita with a Paleta (popsicle): This was such a cute idea. My drink wasn't mixed properly however, and I ended up with a few super salty sips. I wouldn't order this again. 

Rob. W. got the Michelada: It's like a bloody mary with Mexican spices mixed with a beer. Tasty! 

Service: Dijen. Without a doubt, our server Dijen was the highlight of the evening. He was the perfect blend of character, charisma, and genuine kindness. He was the most attentive server I have ever had, but was not overbearing. When our waters were low he would be immediately present, when our drinks were finished, he cleared them away. He was knowledgeable about the menu and made our night something special to remember. Thank you. 

Ladera, you are my favourite restaurant in the Valley. Thank you for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with Ladera, so I'll go ahead and jump straight into my favorite.

The burrito! Or should I say, burritos? My go to meat for any burrito is al pastor, but as soon as I read, \"pineapple slaw,\" I was immediately turned away from it and went to my 2nd favorite, carne asada. Why the hate with the pineapple slaw you might ask? Well, it reminds me of pineapple on pizza, which is sacrilegious in my book. You know who you are, you pineapple pizza lovers. You might as well put strawberries and apples on there while you're at it. 

Anyway, I can't even begin to describe how amazingly flavorful and full the burrito was. Your typical asada burrito is usually a safe bet. Nothing amazing, but satisfying at the very least. THIS? This just set my standards so high that I probably can't enjoy an average asada burrito the same way anymore.

Allow me to tell you about the al pastor one we ordered. I was sitting at the table when my girlfriend surprised me with ANOTHER burrito, but with al pastor. Often times my reluctance to try something new usually pays off, but this time it backfired... well, not really. I ended up sharing two burritos, so who's the real winner here?

The al pastor burrito was even BETTER than the asada one. The pineapple slaw really works well with all the other deep flavors going on inside the burrito. We couldn't finish it, but it tasted just as good as a microwaved leftover.

Aside from the 2 burritos, their street corn was also pure flavorful goodness. I have a newfound love for cojita cheese as well.

It pains me to know that I will most likely not visit Phoenix for a very long time, but if Ladera is still around, and I genuinely hope they will be around, then you can bet your ass I'm making a stop here as soon as I'm back."}
{"text":"Great food at the old Corbin's location. Completely remodeled with a great new open feel.  Service was exceptional.  Food is great.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Try the Barbacoa and the Telenovela (cocktail). The guacamole and salsa is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Very beautifully designed, warm and inviting.   For being open only a few days when we went, they seem to have it together already!   I normally think a new restaurant needs a few weeks to a few months to work out the kinks, but I was impressed.  Paul the bartender was friendly, helpful and fun to chat with.   A great addition to the North Central/Sunnyslope neighborhood.   Look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING. The food is unbelievable! We came for brunch this time and I ordered a white sangria which tasted flawless and the barbacoa hash. I couldn't be more pleased also with our server and staff! Very friendly people! We enjoyed our food so much that we wanted to recognize the cooks and were fortunate to squeeze a picture in! If anyone is looking for a rich tasting Mexican restaurant, Ladera Taverna y Cocina is the spot!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegan, the pickled cactus tacos will be such a nice change of pace for you to enjoy! Can't wait to have them again! Ask for the pink cocktail that tastes like Otter Pops in the side. Chips and salsa were wonderful, as was the guac.

Our waitress, the one who enjoys chasing tequila with pickle juice, was one of the best I've had in months. Thanks dear! 

The patio was perfect. The DJ playing on Sunday afternoon had the vibe down to a science and the big roaring fireplace was a fabulous touch. 

I'm so happy we went! See you all soon!"}
{"text":"A friend and I tried Ladera for a few late night snacks. Ladera has interesting options, though I do feel their menu is a bit pricier than I would expect. Many of the items we tried were very tasty - the elote was tasty, the nachos were large and awesome, the tacos were tiny and less awesome. The drinks were alright, but not the best ever. I would definitely come back, maybe for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful. Went on a Sat evening and the outdoor area is gorgeous. Drinks are excellent and very well priced. Our server was so nice - Adrianna i think her name was. She was very helpful with recommendations from the menu. She was right the gucamole was amazing! I normally dont get guac from restaurants but its good. So good i caught myself thinking about it the other day at work. The tacos were delicious- the shrimp and carne asada were my favs. There was a singer outside  ( may 5th) and he did an amazing job.  I am a sucker for live music. 
Overall this place is 5 stars- they have a parking  lot, great service, great food, drinks are not pricey, beautiful design and decor."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We had the guacamole and salsa with chips. Amazing!!! Had a hint of spice, cilantro and oranges. Hot fresh Tortilla chips. House margaritas only $4 during brunch perfectly complimented the guac and chips. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here on yet another Taco Tuesday expedition after reading rave reviews. I need to take a moment and thank Yelp and all the reviewers for being such a big part of discovering great restaurants around town. This little gem is tucked away from all the hustle bustle of the city. It is actually in a rather quiet part of Phoenix, which is a pretty nice change from the usual. The decor is exceptional.. the weather complied and we chose to sit on the patio. It transports you straight to a five star resort in Mexico. They have a giant fireplace, myriad of beautiful succulents and cacti, a small lawn in the back with some chairs, a live singer.. pretty darn close to a perfect outdoor ambience. They have a reasonable selection of tacos and drinks on happy hour. I started with a Michelada which I thought was quite great! My friend ordered a couple of Al Pastor tacos while I ordered one each of chicken, shrimp and Al Pastor. To be quite honest, I could've easily done without the chicken and shrimp tacos. They were quite disappointing.. chicken especially. It's probably one of the worst chicken tacos I've had so far. Why the four star ratings then? Their Al Pastor is the bomb! Quite possibly one of the best of its kind so far. Next time, I would order three of these without even looking at the menu. The meat is crispy on the outside and beautifully tender inside. Truly fantastic! They also offer free churros with a Yelp check in. They are served with a side of ice cream.. these were also pretty great. In spite of the abysmal chicken and mediocre shrimp tacos, I left feeling quite happy with the place overall.. which does not generally happen with me. Definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"We recently tried ladera for the first time a few months ago. We loved it so much that we've been back several time and love bringing friends!

They have live music a few times a week and we love going there for taco Tuesday! We actually celebrated my birthday there this week! I always get the taco platter and margarita. The crispy fish taco and steak taco are my favorite but they're all tasty! At the end of our meal, our favorite waiter brought us churros with a birthday candle!

Always a great experience! Family friendly. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is going to be one of my favorite spots from now on. The patio is perfect. I had the pozole and Holly cacao drink; everything was delicious! And the service was outstanding. I'm definitely going back to try everything on the Menu. And the Churros let me just say you'll get obsessed! Yumm"}
{"text":"Ladera is by far the best Mexican food since we arrived in Phoenix!  The service with Tony was ridiculous good and even the GM Dijon came and checked in on us!  If you are looking for a great restaurant with an unbelievable atmosphere come here!"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh - Did I forget to review this place?? Shoot. Met some friends for HH and dinner a few weeks back. Service was efficient and helpful, and the outdoor patio was divine. Of course this was in April.... But, the chips and salsa/guacamole were some of the best ever. I liked them even more than some of the popular combos around town. We all ordered a variety of different tacos and the chicken mole. Tacos were all good, every last one of them. But that mole! Loaded with sweet, nutty, spicy flavors all over a gi-normous half-chicken. Leftovers!!! Really delicious stuff and fresh yummy tortillas too. We skipped dessert but maybe next time. Oh, yes. There will be a next time."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem,  very Comfy and cozy place,  we feel in love with,  we will be back.  Thanks Tony for great customer service.  Try the tacos and guacamole delish!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was super cute inside. Patio is beautiful I preferred it. Music is like my moms Pandora - all Spanish and we love it. They have Mexican loteria and that was fun to play. The place was nice and let me bring a cake and flowers prior to reservation. Five stars due to long wait for drink refils and return of staff to table. Food, drinks made up for it excellent. Barbacoa hmmmm shrimp tacos delicious, street corn perfect. Guacamole fresh."}
