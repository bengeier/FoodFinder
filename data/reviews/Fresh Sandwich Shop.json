{"text":"Love this place!  I'm addicted.  I have been there 3 times so far.  The first time it was pouring rain, POURING!  So I pulled up the menu on my phone, and phone in saying I was just outside but was going to wait to come in; they offered to bring it to me in the car when it was ready.  (No I didn't accept.) Anyways food is so fresh, and amazing combination of food.  My favorite so far it the Chipotle Chicken, OMG the olive bread is amazing that they use for it. Please go and try it out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is great but they make up their own hours. Good luck finding a time they are actually open!"}
{"text":"O M G New find for found here as top-rated restaurant in Aurora. Daughter was like 'duh, dad, of course Fresh is amazing' Fantastic sandwich made with local Hurst bakery yummy bread along with a coleslaw salad that maybe surpassed (look at you coleslaw!) Great find. New regular stop"}
{"text":"My favourite sandwich shop in Aurora! The most delicious sandwiches but the only issue is the hours. They close very early."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey club. The woman at the til was very welcoming, and explained the order process with a smile. The sandwich was so full of meat and veggies that I finished the second half for dinner! I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Recent adventures into gluttony had severely hindered my capacity for food appreciation and consumption. Feeling the first pangs of hunger today in almost 48 hours I knew I needed something fresh, not fast, and something wholesome.   Local was my cause as I had much to do today, and local answered the call today in the form of Fresh Sandwich Shop in Aurora. Located off of Yonge street nestled across the road from the LCBO (West side of Yonge) I entered in here on the recommendation of local pals who swore by this spot.  Entering it has a similar look to many similarly named sandwich shops in Toronto. White, clean with splashes of green abound  to remind you that your about to eat fresh and clean. Hmmmmm there is a hip-hop song that goes something like that isn't there (So fresh and so clean clean)... i digress.   You have two options upon ordering your meal, pick from any of their 13 pre-made sandwich options OR you can use their checklist to select you order options exactly as you'd like it made.   A big plus for this location is that all ingredients are locally sourced and freshly brought in on a regular basis, AND they take the time to make their proteins in house (they roast actual turkey for their sandwiches, smoke their own pulled pork, etc)  Pro-tip: All pre-made sandwich options also double as salads.   Today I opted for the Turkey Brie sandwich on the recommendation of the staff on hand. It is supposed to be the most popular option with most customers.  The sandwich was served on multigrain bread was dressed with: Turkey breast, brie, arugula, sprouts, carmelized onions, tomato, cucumber and roasted garlic mayo. Kinda odd that as healthy as it was the sandwich was served with a handful of kettle chips on the side (a small salad would have been a much more consistent option).  Another plus is that all options are around $10, so great value for lunch on the go. Will be back for salads on the regular."}
{"text":"During my recent search for a lunch place near work, I came across Fresh. I was really excited to try it. It was easy to find, and the restaurant was clean, and bright. The person on cash was nice and explained the menu. Everything looked really good. I ordered a chicken club with coleslaw. Came out to be $14.25, and took about 5 minutes to make.   It was smaller than I had expected for a $14 sandwich; even the portion of the coleslaw was small. It was the right size for lunch, but it boggles my mind why a simply assembled sandwich cost $14, when there is nothing overly special about it. The most disappointing part was the lack of seasoning. The coleslaw was creamy, but there was no zing to it. The chicken in the sandwich had no seasoning whatsoever. Sure it was fresh - but it didn't hit the spot. And definitely not worth $14.   I do appreciate the fresh ingredients and the combinations, but I was very disappointed on the lack of flavour. I'd love to try it again, and I hope to change my review."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place! Being a vegan, I have a hard time eating out, especially in Aurora where the restaurant industry hasn't quite made accommodations for veganism yet. Fresh changed that for me! Although the restaurant is not vegan, there are plenty of veg options.   The restaurant itself is small and cute. You can either order off their menu, or order a custom sandwich or salad by filling out a sheet that lists all the ingredients. Simply check off what you want in your meal, and they'll make it for you! They have a variety of breads, meats, and veggies. Some toppings are additional cost (avocado, sun-dried tomatoes) but worth it, in my opinion! Your order comes with a side of chips. I usually order sandwiches here, and they've always been incredibly delicious. I once had their house-made hummus (to die for) with the crostini. They also have a small sweets counter, but I've never had anything from there.   It can be a little pricey, depending on any extra-priced toppings you add to your meal. But, personally, I don't mind paying for something healthy, delicious, and filling! I've never been disappointed here! I am a definite repeat customer."}
{"text":"Not your average sandwich shop. Delicious recipies. Expanded hours. Glad i found this place. Its true the ingredients are really 'fresh'."}
