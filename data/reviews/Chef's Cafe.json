{"text":"I'm visiting Calgary from Toronto for a few days and discovered Chef's Market  a short walk from the Glenbow  Museum. This place has quickly become my kitchen away from home - yesterday I enjoyed a wonderful flatbread with chicken, roast veggies, kale and goats cheese - delicious. Today I went for the fresh beef curry - with the chai latte. The curry flavour was complex and authentic -the dash of cinnamon on the latte complimented the food perfectly.  I  took their roast veggie wrap and chopped salad back to my B & B for dinner. (Hate eating out by myself). As one fellow diner said, why go looking for greasy processed food from the food court when you can watch the chef throw together the ingredients and make something healthy and 
fresh. I couldn't agree more. Congratulations and good luck to Nuno and his crew!"}
{"text":"I've only ever tried their smoothies from here (which are pretty good btw) and my coworker convinced me to give their food a try.  She is a frequent patron and boasts the eatery's use of free range eggs, everything made from scratch, all natural ingredients, etc.  Every Tuesday and Friday the Chef makes eggs Benedict, so I had that last week.  It wasn't bad - I like how the Hollandaise sauce is lighter than most other places and isn't as heavy, but what I loved was the hash.  The Chef has his own blend of seasoning and I don't know what he used, but it was really delicious and addicting!

While the food was decent, I didn't feel that welcomed there.  I've read somewhere that the Chef has worked at some of the more well known restaurants / hotels in Canada.  Yet any attempt to make small talk with him was met with barely an acknowledgement.  I would say something like, yeah, my coworker sent me down here boasting some of your best [items]! He'd respond with a, yeah? And that was it.  He wasn't even curious who my coworker was even though he knows who she is.  The whole experience was pretty much an awkward silent interaction.  I thought he'd be excited to talk about food or tell people about his business given his resume.  For a place that relies a huge chunk of their business on office clientele, I would expect them to be more engaging to their patrons. 

Oh well.  I've tried."}
{"text":"So glad to have a restaurant in this location worth reviewing!  Lunch specials vary week-by-week, but so far they have all been great. Seafood pasta with fresh seafood (not even a hint of \"fishiness\"), chicken pot pie, flatbread specials ... Can't wait until next week to see what's coming!

The specials are prepared for you while you wait, usually about 5 minutes to fry up the pasta sauce and shred some cheese, or heat up the pot pie and garnish with herbs. 

They have some little tables in the lobby, partly within the adjacent flower shop, so eating in is recommended.  Great selection of fancy bottled beverages (if you are on a budget ask for water instead). 

Lots of vegetarian options, I particularly enjoyed the roasted vegetable wrap. 

The menu seemed initially confusing. They seem to have it more itemized and straightforward now then when they first opened, but if you do get confused just ask the chef what he would recommend. The chef is the owner and he really knows what he's talking about.  I'd recommend having the freshly prepared pasta special, perhaps with the daily soup (always fancy and delicious), on your first visit, unless you are in a dreadful hurry in which case just grab a wrap or sandwich."}
