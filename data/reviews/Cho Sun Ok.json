Their menu features a wide variety of dishes - mostly typical Korean fare. However, people usually go for their cold noodles. They also feature an extensive list of Sundae (\"soon-deh\") dishes, which is Korean sausage made with pig organs and intestines. Observing the other tables, I noted that it wasn't as popular as Naeng Myeon. However, keep in mind that it was a hot summer evening and the cold noodles are just that good. I personally like Sundae (spelling it like that is making me want ice cream...argh. I better switch to Soondae), and encourage you to try it!

Chik Bibim Naeng Myeon (Thin arrowroot noodles with a special sauce)
Win!
This was perfect for the hot day. The slushy broth, cooling veggies, chilled arrowroot noodles, and sliced hard-boiled egg made this the most satisfying bowl of noodles that I've had in Toronto. I chowed until all that was left was a puddle of the \"special spicy sauce\" which I loved. From what I observed, it's essentially hot pepper paste (gochu-jang), hot pepper flakes, and probably a bit of soy & minced garlic.
The slurried broth kept the dish chilled while I ate through my mother's plate of Tang Soo Yuk. My father and I shared dumplings & short ribs.
Anyways, I can quite honestly say that this was the best bowl of cold noodles that I've had to date, rivalling South Korea. While it may seem backwards to eat spicy food when it's hot, it was super satisfying and it didn't make me feel hotter at all.
Not a fan of spicy food? They offer Mul Naeng Myeon, which is essentially the same thing but without the spicy sauce (but that's what makes this so good, so please...get the bibim!!). It comes with seasonal fruit - watermelon was being served tonight. I like watermelon, but I love spice.
I also like squirting hot mustard all over my noodles. You can also add vinegar, but I don't like it in my Naeng Myeon.

Tang Soo Yuk (Korean-style Chinese dish. Sweet & Sour Pork)
Soggy :(
A childhood favourite of mine, this is an example of Korean-style Chinese cuisine. There are many dishes that you'll find in Korean restaurant under this niche - Jajamyeon (black bean noodles) is another popular example. Sticky-sweet, when it's done right the deep-fried pork, chicken, or beef has super crispy batter and is tender on the inside with a generous helping of sugary syrup, vegetables and fruit. Unfortunately, this was not done right. It was squishy, not crispy, which pretty much ruined the dish. Boo.

Kalbi (Grilled, marinated beef short ribs)
Skip this...
I've had better - much better. I am a bit of snob since I often make my own short ribs, but since I don't have a grill I like ordering them from restaurants. The cut of meat tasted low grade and fatty, and the flavour was lacking from the missing green onions. Moving on.

Mandu (dumplings Available fried or steamed)
Deep fried goodness!
Another dish that I often make on my own, I still like to order these in restaurants since I never deep-fry them at home. I was pleased with these, and I would order them again with my noodles over the kalbi any day!

I was a little frustrated with the service, but it was super-busy so I wasn't upset. The servers were rushing between tables, so they definitely weren't slacking. I was simply anxious to get my banchan because I was super hungry and jealously watching other tables get theirs while we were a little forgotten...even though we were right in front of the kitchen. Oddly, we received our mandu (dumplings) and kalbi (short ribs) before our banchan but again, they were under quite a bit of pressure so I didn't complain. We were also not given a box of cutlery, and it was hard to wave a server down. Needing something to eat the food on our table, I leaned over and swiped a box from another table.

Cho Sun Ok!"}
{"text":"Busy place even for a Monday evening (it was a holiday however). Service was decent, but the food was fantastic. 

Pros: The cold noodles was recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. The beef stew soup was good, but the pork bone soup looked more filling & appetizing based on the size.

Cons: Wish they had a larger menu with options like the seafood pancake like at Song Cook.

Definitely worth eating here though!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
-kimchi Jjim 
-fried dumplings 
-fresh side dishes
-friendly owner

Cons:
-service could be quicker

Overall: not your typical cheap college Korean joint, this place has good Korean food but very slow service. Their Kimchi Jjim stands out and is a must try so I recommend highly just go for the food!

Heard about this place because if it's famous Kimchi Jjim and the dish does not disappoint. The pork is very tender and flavorful, the steamed kimchi gives it the proper acidic balance. We really enjoyed the fried handmade dumplings also they were really fresh and the skin was not too doughy. The spicy beef soup was not bad and the fresh side dishes stood out compared to other places."}
{"text":"Cho Sun Ok is one of my favourite Korean restaurants and it is definitely a local favourite because it's always busy during dinner time with a lineup out the door. While the menu is small, the staple entrees are there. 

This time we ordered: 
- pork bone soup - one of the best I've had! Perfectly flavoured and very meaty 
- chicken katsu - huge portion! The chicken was fried just right 
- fried mandoo

Overall, another satisfied meal. Their cold noodles are also well known here but we save that for the summer!"}
{"text":"i enjoy going to this restaurant... a regular here. usually go there to have 'chik naeng myun' cold noodles or donkatsu. however i did notice that the broth of naeng myun is becoming more bland recently....starting to lack depth of flavour recently. i certainly hope they will keep quality of it consistant. donkatsu size is huge here."}
{"text":"Waited for about 30mins for a seat and another 30min before our side dishes were served. Meanwhile, The table next to us got in minutes before us and finished eating their first order already. 
Difficult to flagged down people for water and tea, or even ask what happen to our order. 
The older man whose mostly at the cashier station (I believe he maybe the owner), came around the area and chat with customers, but in Korean. He looked at our table and skipped us. How rude!!!! I didn't asked him to stay and talked like he did with the family near me(at least 10mins?) He even spent time talk to each of their children.  But no, not a word for us. We too have kids. Even a simple how's everything going would be okay. So I'm not a valuable customer because I can't chat in Korean now??

stars were for the only waiter (the guy) who who actually serve us throughout the dinner. Even tho it's all done at the very end and all at once.

Their beef ribs are nice but I had similar elsewhere and not as pricey. Hot pots are pricey if consider the portion size."}
{"text":"Despite the weather turning cold, I am happy to eat Mul Nyaeng Myeon (cold Korean noodle) any day of the year at place called Cho Sun Ok up in Thornhill. It's that good.

I remember the first time I had this years ago; I nearly drank all the broth in the bowl. I stopped only because I was too full! Another time, they must have piled on the hot sauce, because it was super spicy. And every time, it has been a delicious meal. In the heat and in the snow, there's just something about the combination of flavours that I truly enjoy. If you're extra hungry, there's also the option to supplement your Mul Nyaeng Myeon with some mandoo or kalbi.

And while Cho Sun Ok is known for their cold noodle, they offer some of the usual suspects like pork bone soup, as well as some not so usual suspects. Sundae - a traditional Korean-style sausage - is not too strong in taste with an interesting chew. Makes for a nice supplement to what's on the table."}
{"text":"What a great find! I don't know that anyone who has found Cho Sun Ok really wants more people there, because it was packed; but there is a good reason for it. The food was clean, good quality, very tasty, (novel but not scary for us), and plentiful. Not knowing we didn't maybe need quite that much food, the two of us ordered the cold noodles, the pork parts soup, and the beef ribs on a sizzling plate to share and try. When our food came, we had many many side dishes: 4 different preparations of radish, eggplant, peppers, fish, bean sprouts, a tasty broth, purple rice, and I think I'm still forgetting something!

The cold noodles Mool Naengmyun are in a well seasoned broth, slushy with ice indeed, with a fresh, sesame, slightly smoky and spicy, developed flavour. The server offers to cut the noodles to make them easier to eat. The dish is highlighted with bits of cucumber, pear, and radish, plus the egg that we asked for on the side. Certainly unique to my experience, but fantastic!
The pork soup Soondae Gook was ordered by my daring friend due to her fond memories of pork ear dishes growing up. She ordered it 'one and a half peppers' spice level rather than the standard 'two peppers' just in case it would be too hot to handle. The 1.5 had a zing, but was not too much, especially just after I'd had some of the pickled spiced kimchi side dish to blow out the spice meter. All the parts in this soup were well-prepared, and I came out of trying new parts with a positive perspective. This soup had an appealing flavour different from the broth with the cold noodles. The sausage in it was unique and delicious. 
The thinly sliced beef ribs LA Galbi were well-seasoned (sesame oil and seeds were prevalent) and served on a bed of tasty cabbage and onions. We had scissors at the table to cut between ribs so it was easy to share and eat hands-on. This dish was the most straightforward, so is really good for even the less daring. And of course there is still plenty to try with the sides that come with the dish. 

Our bill was $43 before t&t for plenty of food for three. As we arrived for early dinner, we lucked out and actually did not end up waiting in line, but did get some of the last seats! Unfortunately the benches are hard and not cushioned, so not super comfortable. The seating in booths is set up for groups of four max, but CORRECTION: if you have a bigger group they can be seated at the outer sides of the restaurant, where there are some tables and chairs that can be moved. When we left there was a big line with about 30 people looking forward to their dinner. I would anticipate a wait. Servers were attentive, cheerful, willing to accommodate special requests, and helpful, though busy. It was an excellent experience, and I would like to return soon. This is the kind of food I would consider comfort food even though it was my first time trying it. I hope this place continues to succeed with the quality-value balance for a long time to come. There's a lot more on the menu to try!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is good!! It's one of the few good Korean restaurants even at Korean standards. To be honest, it's hard to get nang myon this good even in Korea and trust me, I've  had LOTS !! 
Their kimchi jjim, which is steamed kimchi with steam pork bits to go with, tastes soooo good and I'm not a big fan of kimchi. This place is always packed, but it worth the waiting no matter how long. 
My only complaint is the quality of service here. Their staffs r so unfriendly and possibly rude. The owner herself is rude. However their taste makes me come back over and over again."}
{"text":"My favorite cold noodle place !

Their cold noodle is delicious and the shaved broth (which is ice) tastes superb good !
the side dishes that come with it are your normal side dishes, but if you want refills they only allow 1 round for 3 types only.

Order the combo that comes with dumplings...I've tried both the fried and steam, and I personally think the steam is better then the fried because after the dumpling is fried you can't really taste the ingredients within the dumpling anymore...but over all both is not bad..but nothing special 

The downside of this restaurant is that it's ALWAYS PACKED !!! from trying to get a parking spot to a table to waiving down your waitress might be a challenge ! Besides from that I would give their cold noodle a try !"}
{"text":"Went there around 6 with a non-Korean friend of mine. The restaurant was almost full but we were seated right away. The waitress who seated us came back pretty quickly to take our order, but we weren't ready. We decided after a few minutes, by which time she came back again to take our order. We settled on trying soondae jungeol from their hot pot menu for two, and we've been told that we might need more space. The waitress came back pretty quickly and moved us to one of those more space cubicle-like area for 2-4 people.

Our order came out fairly quickly and we had side dishes to keep us occupied while we waited for the hot pot to boil. Despite the possible off-putting description of the dish (pig organs), it was pretty good, although I didn't like the texture on some of the ingredients. But then I tried soondae before, so it might not be the first dish to go for, especially if you've never tried Korean or Chinese food before. The hot pot was filled to the brim, and while it appeared to be a little too small for two people, it turned out to be pretty filling.

One problem I had was that nobody came to see if everything was okay. I could have used more napkins and if I hadn't asked for some cold water before the food was delivered, we wouldn't have had enough to drink, either. Had to go up to the counter so that we didn't have to wait for them to check on us. They did give each of us a piece of candy when we paid the bill, though.

Verdict:
Quality of food (for the price) - 4/5
Service - 3/5
Serving time - 3.5/5 (although depending on the time and day, it could vary)"}
{"text":"This was my go-to spot growing up here. The blood sausage, blood sausage soup, and hangover soup were my favourites and I still like them and would recommend. 

It had a nice feel to it too and the owner was super friendly and would go around and chat with diners to make sure everything was ok. That \"homey\" feel was really good to experience. It was a 5 star before but every time I've gone since they expanded, it's lost its \"homey\" feel. The food quality has slightly dipped too. I guess it's understandable with the increased patron traffic, service has to be quicker. There are more employees so the owner is now only there behind the counter. I'm still a fan of this place and will keep going when I'm in Toronto craving a nice hot soup and blood sausages."}
{"text":"Ordered pork bone soup for my self and kimchi Jjim to share. The Jjim is definitely a must order. The sides, food and service were all on point.Will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"In Markham, there's no shortage of Asian restaurants, but there aren't many Korean restaurants that have food this delicious and authentic.

First time I went, I got the galbitang and my partner got the famous gamjatang. Both were AMAZING! For both soups, the broth wasn't too salty, and the meat was falling off of the bone. They put some special seeds/spices in their gamjatang that I haven't seen anywhere else, and they add a whole new dimension to the soup. The broth for the galbitang was much more flavourful than a lot of other places, and you can tell that they took their time making a kick-ass soup.

Second, third, and fourth time around, I got a little more adventurous. I got hangover soup, tofu stew, and a couple of other things. All delicious, except the tofu stew was a little saltier than I like. Make sure to ask what's in the soup, as you may be in for a bit of a surprise when you order a stew and expect it to be filled with meat, but end up with more vegetables than you expected. Still tasty, but not what I thought I ordered. Any hot soup or stew is the perfect dish for a cold night, and it'll leave you stuffed for under $10.

Banchan is also delicious, and they're refilled pretty quick. Amazing cabbage and radish kimchi, but I'm not so sure about the apple/vegetable/potato salad thing. Service is good, too, and the waitress even spoke Mandarin when she noticed us chattering away :)"}
{"text":"Recommended by a Korean friend who's a regular there. Food was good in general. Place was nice and clean. But I think I'll stick to the pork bone soup at H Mart rather than this."}
{"text":"Family of 4 - 2 adults 2 kids- We went for an early dinner around 5 pm.

Ordered: cold noodles with slush + kalbi (2 pc)combo $18.95
               Additional kalbi $9 (2pc)
               Additional noodles to add $4.95
               soondae $12.95
               Gamja tang (pork bone) soup $9.95
               Additional purple rice $2 

Cold noodles.....WoW...cold noodles were awesome!!! Much yummier than instant. First time trying it \"fresh\" and it hit that spot. Didn't need to add any hot mustard or vinegar - it just had \"enough\" tang & full bodied light broth flavor that is...just...so....yummy. (Sound sooo much like a newb LoL). 

Kalbi: standard...yummy...daughter loves kalbi...sucked all that meat out. That's why doubled ordered. 

Soondae: 1st time trying it....and it's so damn good. Has a side dip of some kind of nice herby salt. Dip or not to Dip - both tastes great :). Highly recommend.

Gamja tang: different from what we usually taste from a pork bone soup but was still yummy tried just a bit (actually I was too busy trying to finish my orders of noodles haha). But hubby and daughters seems to like it...not toooo spicy. Think hubby order it less spicy or waitress saw kids and told them to not to make it spicy.

Purple rice: I know it's standard fare in k restaurants but my daughter loved it so much we ordered another. So funny!

Banchans: had 8 dishes ... All Delish...refillable and waitress/waiters are just too happy to oblige.

Service: food was quick and waitress eager to refill banchans (I just had to stress it a bit) and any additional orders. Maybe because of the time and day (Thursday 5pm) but we had a beautiful dinner.

Will I come back?  YES!!! Place is clean. Bathroom is clean. Area we eat are clean. Restaurant is bright. Waitress/waiter doesn't look gloomy (LoL). Also wanna try other dishes. (Just gotta convince someone to come with me).

Thanks for a wonderful experience Cho Sun Ok!"}
{"text":"The first thing that I recommend off the menu is the cold noodles (Naengmyun). Regardless if it is the summer or the winter, this dish is an amazing addition to your meal. Do not make the rookie mistake that I made of eating this dish as is. Make sure to mix the slushy broth and content together thoroughly before serving it to your fellow table mates!! I promise you that these cold noodles will refresh your senses. It may seem like a contradiction but the spicy and cool broth balances with a slurp worthy thin noodle.    

A second dish that is worth considering is the kimchi braised pork belly (Kimchi Jjim). It is a pork belly sliced with a side of large kimchi leaves. A delightful kimchi broth acts as the base of the dish. All of this was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The perfect bite is a slice of pork belly, one piece of kimchi combined with a lick of its wonderful broth. If you like a dish that has both an outstanding meat and veggie, this is your dish!!

If you crave Korean food, you have to visit Cho Sun Ok. The staff are extremely friendly and their food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I am a regular of this place with my friends and my family! I recommend their spicy cold noodles (Bibimneangmyun) or their Soon Tofu. I personally believe they're the best ones on the menu. The service is what you'd expect of any local Korean business so don't expect some 5-star service since they're always so ridiculously busy so they're obviously doing something right! Highly recommend always."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in town! I love the cold noodles. Clean dining area and friendly staff but expect long line ups during weekends."}
{"text":"Really good authentic korean food. Thanks yelp for the find. This place was packed and the line up was out the door. Ordered the bibimbap and cold noodle soup. Bibimbap was meh but the cold noodles were AMAZING! Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is delicious, I can't say enough good things about it. I'm not a fan of cold noodles but they are good, as is the rest of their menu. I really like this soups and side dishes and especially like that the food is not macerated in salt or chilly like a lot of other Korean restaurants. They also do not skimp on the meat which is very commendable.

So why the low rating?

The overall experience is just lousy, the place is constantly packed, the staff is overworked and the whole experience brings back memories of going to the walk-in clinic or waiting in line to collect your milk and bread ration in a communist country. Take a number, get in line or sit down, wait, and if there's anything left when your turn comes up you can order.

I say \"if\" because I've been here several times and they had run out of certain things on the menu, or just weren't serving them today. This is understandable an hour before closing time, but an hour after opening? 

The whole place feels foreign at first, I've seen people walk in and be completely confused because there's usually no one greeting people and the staff are all running around. There doesn't seem to be any (English) instructions or directions telling you to go take a number or order at the counter.

I'm also not sure what the deal with banchans is since some dishes do not come with them, which to me just doesn't make sense since they are one of the main features of Korean cuisine and hospitality.  On the same line with the rest of the \"small print\" points, no VISA on orders less than $10 just makes no sense to me considering the price point of this restaurant puts most things over $10 anyway so I'm not sure why they feel the need to include that. Are the handful of people who end up paying like $9.50 really that big of a deal? It's never been an issue for me but it speaks to the overall service standard of a restaurant when they have silly policies like this. 

I've had takeout a few times here as well and I can say that the food is just as good as you get in the restaurant which is great, but you will also wait for it. Expect 20-30 minutes depending on how busy it is, you will also get limited banchans and the portions seem smaller than they are in the restaurant especially the rice. I've also never been offered tea while waiting even when it wasn't busy, something a lot of other restaurants do. 

Overall the food is great but I just can't recommend this place given how many other great Korean restaurants there are around this area. Sure their food might not be as good, but their service and price point more than makes up for that in my opinion."}
{"text":"The hype is real! And these guys live up to it too! This was my first time having Korean food that isn't completely westernized. And it's dope! My friend and I went here, and I was totally impressed. The cold noodles we're delicious, filling, and refreshing, especially for a hot summer day. The Soon Tofu stew was hella dope too. But I would probably put that pork cutlet on my table for a meal on death row. It was actually that good. Anyway I'll definitely come back, probably many more times. Fyi, if you don't believe me about the hype there aren't too many places in North York that have 45 minute wait times, and there are even fewer that are actually worth that wait. This place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cho Sun Ok is a delightfully authentic Korean restaurant that has mass appeal. When it's not too busy the service is great, although this place can be pretty busy. The food is excellent and the prices are fair.  

The kimchi and pork as well as the cold noodles are strong recommendations. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We order sweet & sour chicken, large size pork bone soup & bibimbap. The food was average and lacked some flavoring. The pork bone soup had generous portion of meat but bibimbap did not. Chicken was mostly breading. Ban chai was ok. It's not terrible but would rather spend $ elsewhere."}
{"text":"A small family run Korean cuisine with a limited choices on the menu. This restaurant specializes in their cold chewy noodles in ice beef soup. Another Korean comfort food, the jeongol noodle hotpot, includes beef slices, baby octopus,  cabbage, onions, carrots, zuchinni, glass noodles served in spicy beef stock. A good portion for two to share which comes with 2 bowls of purple grain rice and 7 side dishes (you could ask for refill). An overall good service, decent food quality, clean, spacious and fairly priced. The owner was very friendly and come over to each table a couple of times to ask if everything is ok, very attentive."}

{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Fri Mar 27 2015
Ordered: cold noodles and a soup dish
Cost: incl. tax and tip $30-35
Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies.
The cold noodles were different. The side dishes were fresher and tastier than other Korean restaurants. I recall the soup being done well.
This place annoyingly does not take reservations.
Bottom line: I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 8, surprisingly did not wait to long until we were seated (like 15mins tops). The servers and host were very friendly, they speak to you in Korean and also some English but limited.

Got cold noodles w slushy broth & dumplings. Went to heaven. I believe the store owner (the man who runs the front and cash) is also very friendly. He went around the restaurant talking with the patrons and it was nice!"}
{"text":"So far the best Korean restaurant my wife and I have been to in toronto. Cold noodle to me tasted better than some places in Korea. Except dumplings I have tried everything else on the menu and everthing was very good to me. The reason I never tried dumplings at this place are just because to me dumplings are best from northern china and home made.  Anyways I see many people ordering the dumplings too. Side dishes are so good some time I give up ordering cold noodle just to get the full side dishes(only ordering cold noodle has limited side dishes).

The place is very clean. Much cleaner than the Asian restaurant standard. Waiters and waitresses are mostly welcoming and attentive. 

The only thing is that I wish the menu would be pictured so non Korean will also be knowing what the dishes looks like."}
{"text":"All hail the Mecca of Mul Naengmyun lovers! 

I can't say enough about how great their naengmyun is ~ it is the perfect dish for a hot summer day (my cravings, however, persist all year round even in -30 degree weather!). If you don't believe me, ask the lineup of Koreans flocking to this restaurant on any given summer evening or Sunday after church. At the risk of sounding melodramatic - Cho Sun Ok's naengmyun would probably be my last meal request if I were on death row. 

What makes it such a winning dish? The noodles - the top secret recipe noodles - that are the perfect width and chewiness that so many other restaurants have failed to replicate. The icy slushy beef broth is also made with the perfect consistency - seriously, I've been to restaurants where they just threw a bunch of ice cubes in. The moo and cucumber add a nice crunchiness to the dish. Add a little vinegar and mustard sauce to taste and your mind will be blown! Really, it is the quintessential naengmyun that I have found no comparison for ~ It is in a league of its own. 

The interior is nice and extensive renos were done not too long ago. They actually expanded their space by taking over the store that was beside it - a clear sign of the their success. Service is quick and efficient once you get a table. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant! 

P.S. Their other dishes are excellent too, I just couldn't stop raving about the naengmyun."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, a friend of mine went to a Korean restaurant (not named Cho Sun Ok) and tried to order cold noodles.  I had no idea what she was talking about, nor had any frame of reference for what cold Korean noodles in a dish would be.  After a visit to Cho Sun Ok, I totally get it.

Our dinner consisted of the following:
- Mool Naengmyun (slush) with Mandoo (fried pork dumplings)
- Mool Naengmyun (spicy) with Galbi
- Kimchi Jjim

The difference between the slush and spicy is that the slush has more cold slushy broth than the spicy version.  Apart from the broth, they're basically the same dish that's topped with their homemade red pepper sauce, sesame oil, pickled daikon, cucumber, bosc pear and a hard-boiled egg.  And it is the absolute perfect dish to order on a hot and humid summer day.  The icy beef broth is refreshing, and works so well with the red pepper sauce.

I would highly highly recommend cutting the noodles several times.  The chewy arrowroot noodles are extremely difficult to bite.  I learned my lesson after I started choking when half the noodles were already down my throat with the other half still hanging out of my mouth.

The mandoo and galbi sides that came with our noodles were cooked to perfection and surprisingly large.  I was expecting them to go cheap on sides, but a side order combo of mandoo and galbi, yielded eight dumplings, and three giant marinated beef rib strips.  My friend and I were so stuffed from that noodle/side order, that we ended up needing to have the kimchi jjim packed up to go.

Recommendations:
- Cut those noodles several times.  Choking on food isn't fun.
- If you plan to go during peak hours, make reservations.  The line-up to get a table can last up to 30-45 mins.
- If you don't make reservations, make sure to walk right up to the cashier and request a seating ticket number.  If you don't have one, your wait will be much much longer.

Overall, Cho Sun Ok, is definitely a gem among the countless number of Korean restaurants that decorate the surrounding Willowdale area."}
{"text":"I haven't had too many cravings of late and even with all the summer BBQs I've been to, I've found myself wanting kalbi quite often. I was meeting up with a couple of out-of-town friends who wanted to have \"Asian\" so we went to Chosun Ok, which is known mostly for their naeng myun. I always get their chik mul naeng-myun (cold noodles in slushy broth) with kalbi combo for $16.95. If you want the bibim-myun, that's an extra dollar for the combo.

I hadn't been to Chosun Ok for a while before today and didn't even notice they changed the interior! It's nothing fancy but it's clean. Before this, it looked like a bare bones, typical bunshik kind of place. And as usual, there was a wait in the corner by the door during the early dinner period (we arrived at 6pm). Not too bad in terms of wait time, as people don't seem to dilly-dally much once they're eating. 

As I mentioned, it's my go-to place for mul naeng myun and kalbi combo which they do very well. The kalbi is always juicy and delicious and their naengmyun is HUGE, so the meal is quite filling. Today we had a couple of those along with the kimchi jjim, which everyone seemed to be having. A good choice: for the small ($10.95), you get steamed kimchi and pork belly and a bowl of purple rice and a small bowl of miso soup. It's a pretty big portion and best shared. They gave us about six or seven banchan but small servings of each so that we had to ask for more. I'm not sure if it's because they thought we weren't Korean (I didn't bust out my Korean until after we got our food, when I had to ask for chopsticks--they brought us forks), but they were good about bringing us larger portions of banchan after, assured that we'd finish it all, and finish we did~

While we were waiting, I noticed the most commonly ordered dishes were the kimchi jjim, soondae (blood sausage containing noodles and other bits), kamja-tang (pork bone soup), and naeng myun, so it seems Chosun Ok makes a number of things quite well. Most of the diners were Korean but there were also a few Chinese people--the ones in the know ;)

Prices are good, and service is too. There's an older ajumma who's really sweet who likes to compliment me on my order (even though I always get the same thing!) and always tells me I'm pretty so I try to pay her back with a compliment too. I've never had issues with their service so hopefully for those who have just went on the wrong day and will have better service the next time they eat at Chosun Ok.

Parking can run out at certain times as there are a few businesses there that all seem to bring in a sizeable amount of business so be prepared to wait a bit for a spot."}
{"text":"Just found my next 'go-to' Korean restaurants.  I've been to more than dozen of Korean restaurants, a few of them I've been going for couple years but they've sort of deteriorated in terms of quality.

This place is newly renovated and sort of open kitchen like many Korean restaurants.  I have tried their pork bone soup, very comparable to The Owl, full spice and tender meat.  Their tofu soup is also amazing, smells and tastes superb.  The pulled beef bibimbap is also very tasty.  Overall this would be my go to Korean place at least for the next while.

I totally recommend this if you're looking for a good and clean Korean restaurant.  I think this place is operated by Korean ethnic minority from China, a lot of waitresses are able to speak Mandarin.  Because of this, you can expect authentic Korean business from this place."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean experience. Came here based on recommendation from my friends. They don't take reservations, so go early if you don't want to wait.  Came here on a saturday night and had to wait a bit.  Was impressed with the food. Will recommend and come again. 

Food:
Good amount of side dishes and unlimited refill. However,  it would have been better if they had glass noodles and potato too for side dishes.

Ordered 3 appetizers:
- sliced traditional Korean style sausages
- sweet and sour pork
- home made steamed dumplings
Sausages were served with liver. The sausages were mixed with rice and noodles inside in bite sized pieces. It is good after adding some special salt spice mixture with it. Good texture and taste.
Sweet and sour pork was served with fruit in a sweet based sauce. It was okay and I preferred the pieces with less sauce. 
Dumplings were very good with the traditional filling inside. The dumpling skin was nice and thin. 

#24 Gamja Tang- Requested this dish in less spicy and was perfect for me. Broth was very flavourful with a huge portion of pork bone meat. Meat was very tender and falling off into the broth which was delicious. It was served with purple rice which is very healthy and yummy. 

#29 Dolsot Bibimbap - Allright but meat portion was small with more vegetables. Rice texture and taste was good. 

#32- Chicken Katsu - Great portion with 2 large pieces, rice and vegetables. The chicken was tender on the inside with a nice crispy exterior. 

#27 - Stewed beef short ribs in clear beef broth - Lots of meat and the broth was very soothing. 

Service:
Good service, they came to check up on us and asked if we wanted more side dishes."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a more perfect place to eat than Cho Sun Ok on a sweltering day in Toronto. Why?  Because their signature dish Mool Naengmyun literally transports you to the heart of Alaska!

Cold, chewy and thin arrowroot noodles are served in a wondrously icy broth.  The broth itself is so complex and delicious.  It's sweet yet tangy and it has a deep beef flavour.  The homemade red pepper sauce gives it a subtle kick and the sesame seeds and oil give it an astounding aroma!  Still, the coolest thing about this slushy broth - if your not careful - is that it can give you brain freeze!  It's such a strangely unique concept (at least to me) that is fully thought out... I mean, the Mool Naengmyun is served in a stainless steel bowl so that the broth stays chilled while you consume it.

Along with a boiled egg, the Mool Naengmyun is also served with notoriously refreshing and crunchy ingredients such as slivers of cucumber, pickled daikon, and a slice of pear.  What an awesome combination of ingredients to give a contrast to those chewy noodles!  It's a true winner to help you stay as cool as a cucumber (I know, I couldn't resist). 

I didn't want to end this post without saying that Cho Sun Ok is not afraid of heating things up either.  Cho Sun Ok is home to one of my favourite incarnations of Gemja Tang, commonly known as pork bone soup.  The pork neck meat is just so tender that it is easily coaxed off their bones - fall off the bone if you will.  You roughly get four hunks of meat in a well developed broth with potatoes and onions.  But it's the generous garnishing of perilla seeds and green onions that really take the cake for me.  It makes for such an aromatic soup!  I highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time it was excellent food.  In the summer you have to try the mool nangmyun which is a cold noodle dish.  Sounds strange if you've never tried before but this is such a refreshing meal.  I usually get the combo that comes with LA Kalbi ribs as they go really well together.  The item on the menu that I get almost every time is the Kimchi Jjim - this is stewed kimchi served with succulent and so tender pork belly, also an unreal combo.  The side dishes are very fresh and always delicious.

This restaurant is very popular and each time I've been there I have had to wait in line.  They give you a number and call it out when your table is ready.  The service is fast, friendly and efficient.  The decor is modern and clean.  The food is well worth the wait if you find yourself in a line up."}

I don't know if I want to blog about this restaurant not because it's my favorite spot and I don't want to share, but because last time I blogged about Korean restaurant that I visit fairly often- it somehow got SO BUSY to the point where couple times I had to go somewhere else cause the wait time was ridiculous. I mean I don't think everyone went because of my blog post, but it just ridiculously got busy with non-Koreans that I am sure I played some part in getting that restaurant known. By the way, the Korean restaurant I am talking about is MakkalChon- one of my favorite Korean restaurants in Toronto. Anyways, I've been going to Cho Sun Ok for awhile now but just realized recently that I never blogged about it so here it goes. If you like Naeng Myun (Korean cold noodles), Cho Sun Ok is the place to go. If you see the photos, you will see why.

Ordered: #13 LA Galbi Jeongsik 4/5
Grilled marinated sliced short beef ribs served on hot plate for $18.95. This is served with rice and miso soup on the side and it it your typical Korean short ribs. 

Some of the side dishes that were served, I forgot to take photo of the rest cause I was busy eating!

Ordered: #22 Sashimi Naeng Myun 5/5
Arrowroot noodles topped with spicy sauce and raw sashimi (seasonal) for $12.95. This is spicy cold noodle that is chewy and quite refreshing. This is a popular dish during summer time and I think Cho Sun Ok does it best in Toronto. Served with raw skate fish pieces on top, it's suppose to be chewy with soft bones that can be eaten. 

They will give you some Korean mustard and vinegar to add to your noodles but I usually don't add any since it has enough flavor for me. Keep in mind that if you order one of their cold noodles, you don't get any side dishes!

Ordered: #11 Don Katsu 5/5
Deep fried breaded pork cutlet served with salad and rice for $9.95. This is Korean style tonkatsu, a little thinner and crispy than Japanese version. Portions are quite big here so you might want to share if you don't eat that much (which means we can't be friends either haha). This is another dish that is not served with side dishes.

Summary: Cho Sun Ok is another solid spot for Korean food that serves variety of dishes so def do check it out. Keep in mind that the restaurant gets super busy so prepare to wait a bit. Also, I wouldn't go with more than group of 4 people since the restaurant isn't that big and it will be hard to get a table. Other dishes that are also popular here is Soon Dae (blood sausage) so check that out as well. For all you people that knew about this restaurant already, don't blame me if the restaurant gets busier!"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch.  Had the bibimbap the first time and second time a beef soup.  Knocked off one star for the beef soup, because I didn't see any beef...a little disappointing for a $12 lunch. 
Have discovered another Korean place I love that I now frequent instead :)"}
{"text":"The setup of Cho Sun Ok is similar to a doctors office: take a number at reception and wait to be called.

They don't take reservations so the queue during peak dinner hours is humongous. It didn't make sense to me that I had to squeeze past a crowd just to get a number then back out. 

The whole hype about this place is their cold noodles. Almost every table ordered some variety of Korean cold noodles! You could combo it up with dumplings or beef ribs. 

I tried the combo with steamed dumplings. The dumpling skin hardened quickly so I regret not eating them faster. I suggest ordering fried dumplings - they taste a lot better. The arrowroot noodles are super chewy and I smothered it with vinegar, maybe a little too much because I had a stomachache after... 

Soondae (Korean Sausage) seemed like it was microwaved and the taste is not as rich as Lim Ga Ne. 

The service is fast and efficient but it's hard to get ahold of any servers. They accidentally seated us too soon and had to request that we stand back up so they can provide the table to another party... That was a bit annoying.  

Seeing how my tummy can't handle the cold noodles, I would try the pork bone soup next time as that also seems to be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Best cold noodles in the city! I always get the slushy broth Mul Nengmang with a side if Kalbi for $18.95. It's quite pricey as the cold noodles don't have meat in it but it's my go-to spot for cold noodles on a warm summer day! Only negative thing I woukd say is I wish they gave more variety of the side dishes (panchans), they usually give you three if you order this item on the menu. If there is a line up, make sure you go the back of the restaurant to the counter to get a ticket number. The wait doesn't take too long."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 3 at around 6:30 for dinner on a Wednesday. It was already pretty busy by the time we were there (wait time was roughly 5 minutes), as it got closer to 7 the restaurant got more and more crowded. It's obvious this place is extremely popular and extremely busy. We ordered the:

Mool Naengmyun: The famous cold noodles lived up to its name. They were very refreshing.

Jangjorim Dolsot Bibimbap: I love stone bowl Bibimbap and this dish solidified that feeling. The meat was tender and seasoned well, they were generous with their portions and I was left very satisfied.

Bulgogi Jeongsik: My dad got the bulgogi and although the meat was very flavourful, I felt it was more on the pricier end at $17 before tax and tips.

I would come again as there are other items on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cho Sun Ok since I was 6 and I can say without hesitation that it is my all time favourite Korean restaurant. Not only is the food amazing, the owners really go out of their way to make sure you have a pleasant visit. 

First off, the side dishes here are stellar. The owner makes all of the side dishes by hand so the taste is consistently top notch. Honestly, I would come to this restaurant just for the side dishes. They are also more than willing to give you refills which is great!

The Cold Noodles are Cho Sun Ok's speciality and a personal favourite - I highly recommend giving it a shot. Consisting of buckwheat noodles in a cold, slushy broth with egg and veggie toppings, this is the perfect meal on a hot day. One tip: the Cold Noodles come with a spicy sauce, so ask for sauce on the side or no sauce if you don't like spicy foods. 

Another favourite is the Don Katsu (pork cutlet with sauce), which comes with salad, miso soup and rice. This and the Kimchi are the perfect pair. The servings are huge and the quality is always consistent, making every meal a satisfying experience. 

The customer service is the cherry on top. I was surprised to see the owners regularly coming in and interacting with the customers - in fact, they go around and check up on each table one by one to make sure everything is going well. The servers, are very friendly as well, but many are not proficient in English so be patient when communicating with them.

All in all, I am in love with Cho Sun Ok and I could not recommend a better place for Korean food!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine brought me here for the first time. She recommended the arrowroot cold noodles. It was DE-LISH! The broth looked and tasted like a slush? It was different. Perfect for a hot summer day :) 

I ordered the one that comes with 8 steamed dumplings for $13.95. Not bad at all. 

Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I don't really have anything to complain about this restaurant. The food is decent, service is fast despite the lineups and the inside is clean. 

I think it's one of the few Korean restaurants that Korean people still choose to go since other places have turned to suit the tastebuds of big demographics (aka non-Koreans); meaning many of the dishes are no longer authentic - they are way too sweet, not spicy, the broths taste like pure MSG. 

That being said, not all dishes taste great. Pick the ones that are recommended, popular or what Korean people order."}
{"text":"Ban chans and service are not so good, compared to Huh Ga Neh. Cold noodle is the best here. Over-priced slightly."}
{"text":"It's one of my top favourite places for any Korean styled dishes. When there are no seats available, you are given a number at the cash area. They will call out your number as soon as there is a spot available. 

This place is authentic and owned by Koreans. You are under great hands!

PROS:
Food - Fresh and super good. Can't have enough.

Service - Great service overall.


CONS:
Terrible Parking - If you're eating here during the weekend, good luck finding parking. Your best bet is to park on the other side of the plaza once you arrive after 11:30AM. 

Opening Hours - They are never on time to open the restaurant at 11AM. We have came here continuously at 11AM and people would be waiting outside or in their cars for at least 15-30mins before we are allowed in. 

Limited Space/Seats - It's a small restaurant, when people arrive during lunch hour, it is jammed packed. Everyone tends to arrive after 11:30-12PM and you'd have to be waiting in line for a while before you get a seat. Not too many seats for eating in such a popular restaurant. They need to open up another location!

Payment - They don't have the portable debit/credit card machine, you have to go to the very front of the cash to pay where you're fighting to squeeze through the people who's waiting in line.

Menu - If you are not Korean and not familiar with the menu, you're going to have a tough time ordering. I had to reference back to the photos on Yelp so I know what the dish looks like. It would be helpful if they had a menu where you get to see a picture of their most popular dishes or recommended dishes."}
{"text":"The food was great and came out super fast. As a Korean who eats Korean food almost everyday, their food is  super authentic! Their bibim nengmyun is so good is also their dumplings! I would definitely go again during my next visit in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving bimbimbap. Through a Yelp search decided to check this place out. I was NOT disappointed. First of all, incredibly friendly staff who made you feel like family from the minute you walk in. Prices are more than reasonable! I've dined downtown and expect to pay $12+ for the same meal that came under $10 here. The food was so delicious and authentic and came to our table pretty quickly. The place was pretty busy and I imagine that a lot of the \"locals\" know this place well and come here often. I found a great new Korean restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood soft tofu soup. It came in so quickly and tasted great. Side dishes that came with it were also tasty, with not much to criticize. I was impressed with the overall quality of the food and the service I received.
My friends always say good things about this place, and now I can confirm. I would love to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"It seems like every time that we go out for lunch, we spend no less than twenty minutes deciding where to go. This time was no different, but after some minor arguing, we decided on Cho Sun Ok. It's a good thing that people had cleared their calendars for their afternoon because this place was packed when we arrive around 12:45 on a Wednesday. After about twenty minutes, we were seated and presented with menus which are printed directly on the paper placemats (yay! everyone gets their own menu!). As always, my go to at a new Korean restaurant is the gamjatang, but since some other Yelpers have raved about the cold noodles here, we decided to split a bowl between three people.

On a side note, of the eight sides that we were presented with, the kimchi was by far my favourite: salty, spicy, and fermenty. We had to ask for another portion of this.

Shortly after, three bubbling bowls of gamjatang arrived at our table, accompanied by bowls of purple rice. The pork meat tender and pretty much fall off the bone, but I would say that it would have been beneficial if the bones had been cooked a little longer. The bones still separated, but a little effort was required in order to get at all the bits and pieces of connective tissue. The flavour of the meat was nice and sweet (typical of fresh pork), but did not take on too much flavour of the soup. Simultaneous spoonfuls of the broth and meat are recommended for maximum flavour experience. The rice was pretty average.

The Mool Naengmyun (cold noodles) arrived shortly after we started eating, and we had the waitress cut through the noodles for us. When it came, it looked nice and slushy, but we didn't get to eating it until after the pork bone, by which point it was no longer slushy. I didn't know what to expect with this. Yet, when I tried that first spoonful of soup, I was impressed. The broth is cold and sweet and tangy with subtle fishy understones (anchovies? fish sauce?), and a very faint hint of spiciness. The arrowroot noodles were pleasantly chewy and easily took on the flavour of the broth. As an added surprise, we found half of a boiled egg in the soup when we were nearly finished. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavours and texture of this dish, and thought that sharing a bowl was a superb idea, but I don't think that I would have been able to finish an entire bowl to myself.

I would definitely return here, but due to the popularity, you can expect that your lunch may be longer than usual."}
{"text":"Even though I live extremely close to this place I had never heard of it until now. I was surprised to see the hundreds of positive reviews and had to see what the hype was. 

I ordered the Pork Bone Soup. Although I have no spicy tolerance it was fine and mild enough that I still enjoyed it. I was looking for something soothing so it definitely hit the spot! It comes with a good portion of real tender pork as well, along with a bowl of rice that goes really well with the broth. My friend got a katsu dish and the portion was huge (definitely good value)! In general the prices were really good, and it was fairly economical. 

We went around 6:45 to avoid the \"peak hour\", which according to google seemed to be around 7-8pm. There were at least 5 parking spots when I arrived so even though it's a small lot the situation wasn't as dire as the reviews seemed. 

The restaurant is definitely known for its food, and not the atmosphere. My first impression of the place was how 'clean' it felt! It's very bright inside and not very cluttered. However, that being said it doesn't feel cozy and it's not somewhere you'd want to stay longer than the meal."}
{"text":"LUNCH

They renovated since the last time we tried this place and it was a much needed improvement. Bigger and brought into this era lol. 

It was pretty hot today (77F) so had to obviously order the spicy Mool Naengmyun aka cold noodles. This place is pretty famous for them so you can't go wrong with that choice. 

We also ordered the Tangsooyook (sweet and sour chicken), Dwenjang Jjigae and kimchi jjim. These dishes could possibly be a skip imo but they were not horrible. Just ok. 

Service was great and staff occasionally asked if we needed anything throughout our lunching experience. 

Would come back if craving the cold noodles again and in the neighbourhood  it can get busy so try to come off peak hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on Dec 31st at 7:15pm and noticed the sign said they were opened until 8pm. There were a few tables empty so we were able to be seated by a woman who didn't seem very welcoming. I thought perhaps because they wanted to leave early and didn't want to stay late or maybe because they were busy and were running around serving tables.  While we were seated, we saw other people come in all the way up to 8pm and they each got the scowl, so I took it to be the standard greeting . 

This is the real deal run by Koreans, not like some other places run by Chinese so at least I knew it would be authentic. 

The menu isn't huge, but had a few items that I was familiar with, and some I hadn't seen before.  Seeing how we got such a \"warm welcome\", I didn't want to ask about the various cold noodles or dumplings and stuck with the traditional bibimbap #28. 

The main course arrived really quickly, even before the appetizers. We were actually wondering if we should ask for them, but they were dropped off right after the bibimbap. The nice thing about this place is the man handling the cash seemed to make it a point to come by each table and talk to the patrons and ask how the food was which is a really a nice touch. The bibimbap was actually one of the best I've had. Lots of vegetables and flavour, the stone bowl stayed hot to the end and as usual, I find they don't put enough meat in these, but it's the same everywhere. 

I saw some of the other menu items on the tables beside me and will definitely go back and try them when I'm in the area again. 

Two #28 bibimbap, plus tax plus tip was $30."}
{"text":"Beware, the place will be packed whenever you go. And it's popular for a reason. Food is good. I mean GOOD. What else do you want?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto! It's always super busy but they have a very organized system for seating- you go to the counter to get a number and wait for your number to be called. My favourites here are the kalbi, the cold noodles, and the bibimbap in the hot stone bowl. This place is always worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Tasks to do upon coming here:
#1: Have your driver or someone in your party to drop you off and enter the restaurant first and take a number from the back of the cashier.
#2: Have your driver wait and find a parking spot in the plaza where spots are highly coveted and hard to obtain.
#3. Wait for your number to be called. 
#4. Order from the placemat and enjoy.

I came here on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm and it was packed. Tons of people waiting and tons of people waiting for parking spaces. Finding a parking spot is tough since the plaza has a couple of spots reserved for other businesses. You can just wait for a parking spot for 5-10 minutes until someone leaves which is what I did.

We waited for around 33 minutes until we got our table at 7:03pm. The menu is on the placemat and we ordered the naengmyeon (slushed broth) and galbi combination and naengmyeon (spicy) and steamed mandu (dumpling) combination since it was a hot summer evening in the city. The galbi and dumplings came pretty quickly as we waited for a bit before the main attraction arrived. Dumplings were kind of cold and the galbi was marinated well.

The naengmyun noodles were refreshing. I had to give it a couple more cuts with the scissors before digging right in. Even though it was slushed broth, I still find it a bit spicy. 

Overall, I would not wait another 33 minutes just to get a spot but I am willing to try new things if there is not a lineup."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 8:30 and waited for about an hour. It was well worth the wait! Most of the customers were Korean so you know this place has to be great. We ordered pork bone soup, tofu stew, bimbimbap and cold noodles with the slush broth. The tofu stew was so flavour and delicious! We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I never would order cold noodles in the past because in my mind eating what should be served hot but now served cold is like eating left over soup and noodles from the fridge but boy was I wrong!!! The texture of the brown noodles were bouncy and fresh. The cold slushy soup is delicious and flavorful. It seems that everyone was eating that today (full house and line up out the door) so you know it must be good. Yes it is pricy $15 but I would eat it again....BTW, I am not Korean so this was a wonderful surprise to my palate."}
{"text":"Went to Cho Sun Ok this weekend and it was a full house. But wait time wasn't that long. Place felt authentic and cozy, surprised I never noticed this place earlier as I drive pass it often.  Price was okay and food wasn't too bad.  However, the service wasn't the best as they took a while to come take our order even after asking for a waitress and being told she will return right after.  Had to wait another 5 mins and waved her down again before she actually came back to take our orders. Other than that I regret not getting the Cold noodles as it was the most popular dish there."}
{"text":"Was recommended to visit this restaurant for their famous cold noodle.
Came here on a Sunday night around 7pm, the restaurant was pretty busy. We waited around 15 to 20 mins for a table of two.

When I walked in to the restaurant, almost every table had an order of the cold noodles, hence, despite the cold weather, I decided to order a bowl of cold noodle - Mool Naengmyun for myself as well.
The noodle came in a slushy soup with pears, picked carrots, egg, cucumber along with the spicy sauce. The noodle was al dente, I am guessing this was one of the reasons why the servers actually cut the noodles ahead of time for you.

I must say, this place does have the best tasting cold noodles so far. I have had it a few times at other Korean restaurants but definitely they are not comparable to this place.

We also ordered the Kimchi Jjim - which is similar to a pork bone soup but it comes with sliced pork belly instead. I haven't seen this entree anywhere else, so we thought we should try.
This dish was decent, the pork bellies were soft but the cabbage was a bit too spicy for us.

Service was ok, and the restaurant is bright and clean.
I would for sure come back again when I crave for some cold noodles."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while, because of its great reviews. So I thought, hey why not have a birthday dinner here with some of my friends?

This place is crazy busy, especially on weekends of course. They mainly cater to korean customers, since some of them don't speak fluent english. I decided to try something new and go with the cold soba noodle slush. What surprised me was that the portion was so huge, aside from the standard side dishes that they offered us. The noodles tasted OK, but I'm not exactly a fan of the cold slush now that I've tried it. What ended up happening was I devoured all the veggies and left the soup relatively untouched. I think I'll settle for a warmer entree next time.

Overall, service wasn't terrible (but wasn't marvelous), and so I give this place 3 stars for now. Will be back to try some of the other hot dishes."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Along Yonge Street, within a small plaza north of Glen Cameron Rd
- Limited parking available within plaza and it gets very busy during peak hours. There is another parking pot on the next plaza
- Relatively big restaurant, modern/bright interior. There is a small waiting area available
- Staff are good with requests. But they mostly speak in Korean, although they understand English (perhaps it's just the style)


Food
- Summer is around the corner, so the menu we were offered had a lot of Cold Noodles option
- Ordered 2 cold noodles (skate fish and dumpling). The skate fish didn't have much broth to it and it's a bit spicy - bear in mind. Overall it was good, and the skate fish taste is a bit crunchier/harder to chew. Dumpling one had more broth - very refreshing, and dumplings were full of meat and easy to chew. Noodles for both orders were great.
- Ordered pork bone soup hot pot. Big pieces of bones with plentiful of meat. Came with potatoes and a few veggies in the pot. Broth was easy to taste. Also came with 2 bowls of rice

This is a very popular place and it's always packed. The food is comforting, but I really do find their prices to be expensive. If it wasn't shared between 5 people, each individual meal would cost at least minimum $18+."}
{"text":"Wonderful little Korean place.  You can tell it's good by how busy it is even in the later hours of the day.

I've never had icy broth noodles before, but they were quite good.  I can see it being especially delicious during the hot summer days.  The Pork bone soup was also some of the best I've had in Toronto.

Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is a Korean restaurant that I'll recommend to everyone including both Koreans and non Koreans alike. While most of their dishes are prepared well it's the cooked kimchi with pork that really separates this place from other Korean establishments in my opinion. If you like well fermented kimchi it will be worth your time and money for sure. It's also something that is pretty unique so will be a nice thing to experience at least once.

The servers are also extremely generous with their variety of side dishes so you'll never walk out of this place hungry no matter what you order. They are actually generous to a point where it seems wasteful but it's all about that Korean hospitality where the host will not let you walk out unsatisfied.

They have been through two renovations that I know of expanding every time and for a good reason since it gets full during typical meal times very quick. I often opt for takeout during those hours since I don't really enjoy waiting. I don't live in the city anymore but I do try to return here at least once whenever I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean restaurant - hands down. The quality of the food is the best in Toronto. The ban chan is also super fresh. Obviously the neng myun is the real star here. But their soon dubu and soondae soup is also amazing. 

The drawback with this restaurant? Line ups!!!!! They don't take reservations and I've waited as long as 30 minutes at times. I've had to leave sometimes just cause it's a bit too ridiculous. 

I come to eat here at least a couple times a week and always leave happy. 
Take note though. As of last week, they are now closed every Tuesday's moving forward."}
{"text":"It was very busy and had to wait for a table. The food came fast and is relatively cheap. The food was excellent. Appetizers came very quickly, and were very good. I shared the pork jjim dish with one other along with meat dumplings and was very satisfied.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was because we were starving, the portions are small or the food is just that dang delicious but the 5 of use nearly licked the pots clean. We ordered two pots and a small pork belly with kimchi. Everything was so so so good, we almost ordered a second round.  Usually we try to have some courtesy around each other and offer one another the last bite or forfeit last few pieces of meat... but at the place, we became savages. Or at least I did. Like, okay, this pot says it's for 2 people but do I really have to share? Is it wrong of me to slap others hands away? It honestly could have gotten ugly but I kept my composure. The food is really that good.  Thankfully I live is Los Angeles, the mecca of Korean cuisine, so I won't miss this too much, but it'll have a special place in my stomach."}
{"text":"This busy Korean restaurant was highly recommends this place.  The wait time of ten minutes was quite reasonable and the servers were really friendly.  They somehow assumed we speak Korean.  Lol!  I have been to some Korean restaurants with terrible service, so I was not expecting too much beside taking order, bringing the food and giving us the bill.  However, this place has a warm and inviting vibe which I really liked and the modern decor was just a plus.  The side dishes were really good with reasonable spiciness and saltiness.  And the tofu soup was just wonderfully seasoned and has the sweetness from the seafood.  Keep up the good food for us hungry for good food and dining experience."}
{"text":"What a lovely restaurant. Service was very on the ball our whole visit. Food was amazing and filling for a great price! They have very miminal beer selection but priced can't be beat for 3.50 for domestic and 5 for henekein. My don Katsu was amazing-a giant plate of delicious flavoured meat-heaven! All that meat and a drink for 20 dollars is a great deal in my book. Especially since it came w a ton of free mini apps and rice and salad. Only comment is when I asked for soy sauce w my dish they woman gave me the sassiest look and a look of total  disappointment.. I was being kinda vanilla asking for it I get it but the reaction was kinda funny."}
{"text":"Cold noodles on a blistering hot day? Check.

We arrived for lunch at around 1 pm hoping to miss the lunch crowd but we were met instead with several tables waiting to be seated! We decided to wait and after being seated, we both opted for cold noodles.

I opted for the Mool Naengmyun (arrowroot noodles in slushy broth) and we also got the bibim naengmyun which is spicier and without a soupy broth.

I fell in love on my first bite! The slushy broth had a super refreshing feeling with a subtle sweetness as an aftertaste. It was almost like drinking a melting slushy. The spice kicks in eventually but the broth is addicting!

We were recommended to try the bibim naengmyun with a side order of the slushy broth to pour on top. Definitely will give this a try next time!

Overall, would definitely recommend trying the cold noodles! Other stews and soups are also decent !"}
{"text":"I LOVE U Kimchi Jimm! Aged kimchi +tender pork.... don't think I am spelling it right, but this is a MUST!

Cold noodle and pork bone soup are also quite delicious! 
Only downside is that there's usually a 15mins+ wait time during meal time, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"this is definitely one of my favourite restaurants. i come all the time with my family, sometimes just my mom. if i don't know what to eat that day, i'm coming to cho sun ok. the owner's son is really nice and strikes up conversations, especially because he sees me and my family all the time. the servers take a couple of visits to warm up to but are overall helpful and the only other thing is the long waits for a table but thats how u know its good food!"}
{"text":"You want Korean food? You go here.
You always have to wait but trust me it's so worth it. As an actual Korean, they're food is so good and I've been going here for years!
They got a renovation so the restaurant got bigger and the interior design is really nice. 
Service is always smooth and quick to add.
Food serving sizes are always big and plentiful so you won't ever worry about not being full."}
{"text":"I  absolutely have 0 tolerance with any spicy food. So I ask them to make my cold noodles none spicy at all,and it tastes still super good! So does the galbi comes with it.
I tried some of my friend's spicy kimchi Jjim. I think it will become my favorite pork belly if I'm a spicy food lover.

Will come back for sure, such a great place for authentic Korean food.
The table is a little bit small :p"}
{"text":"This is still our favourite Korean restaurant. The food is still really good. Today, we ordered the Donkatsu and the Dolsot Bibimbap. The portions for the Donkatsu is huge as it comes with rice and cabbage slaw. The Bibimbap was flavourful but unfortunately it didn't come with a lot of beef. 

Service is efficient and reliable. No complaints in this regard at all. 

There's a few more dishes that I like to try for this place so there are going to be more checkins in the near future. Too bad that it's far from our place."}
{"text":"Okay yea I can see why blog to said it was one of the best Korean restaurants. The pork bone soup was near perfect! Side dishes were really good, and the pork with kimchi dish was like nothing Iv had at a Korean restaurant before. Place does get busy and have a line, but I think it was worth the wait. I will be back that pork none soup really hit the void I have been tryin to fill for a  while now. 
Lots of booths also makes it rather attractive, nice modern interior. Owner looking  fella also came by to ask how every thing was."}
{"text":"5 star for the cold noodle. Never let me down:)
The other dishes are good as well but cold noodle here is the best!"}
{"text":"I have nothing really to complain about this place. 

The waitress was lovely. 
The food arrived promptly after ordering (night time around 8:30 p.m. on a raining weekend).
The utensils and tissue papers were plentiful as well as the fact that they have a self serve water station, whether it be hot or cold, drink to your heart's content.

The food that we orderedwas definately a brand new experience. We ordered #13 Bibim Naengmyun because I wasn't feeling the slush broth tonight and then #16 Spicy Raw Skate Naengmyun with the Galbi so we could share the meat.

#13 Bibim Naengmyun came with about a giant spoonful of slushy broth and then another spoonful of spicy sauce that I simply adored. It wasn't a toned down spicy either, it's the real deal when they say spicy. I loved the slice of korean pear and cucumbets as it came as really refreshing to bite into between flaming mouthfuls of delicious, chewy, cold noodles.

#16 Spicy Skate Naengmyun was basically the same thing as #13 but with Raw Spicy Skate. Pretty straightforward and pets be real. Those of you who don't know; the pieces of skate they use are the more softer cartilage pieces so you CAN eat them unless you're really sensitive about it. I loved every piece of skate and inhaled all of it. My friend on the other hand couldn't eat it because it was \"too much bone\". Like I said, whatever floats your boat, but haters gunna hate, the spicy raw skate was amazing 11/10.

#16 Galbi was cooked amazingly and perfectly tender, was not that charred (though I personally aleays love a little char) and super juicy. I would definately love it if this place even offered galbi in larger quanities here or even DIY grilling with their galbi.

Everything comes with tongs and scissors so if the noodles or galbi was too chewy or too difficult to chew yourself or if it was a hygienic thing, they got you. 

I love their barley tea here because it's not served blazing hot like every other korean restaurant ever.

Thanks for having us and hope to come again soon."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!!! Cho Sun Ok!!! My friend had been urging me to come here for quite a while, and I finally did with a bunch of friends! Majorly impressed overall!

Had heard that you need to try the naengmyun here, but we also wanted to try other dishes, so we ordered different things and shared. I wasn't so sure about the pricing to portion ratio, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that we got TONS of food!
We ordered the Goonmandu to start, and collectively ordered Naengmyun in slushy broth + Galbi, Dolsot Bibimbap, and Kimchi Jjim.
The Goonmandu were very good, nice and crispy skin! The Naengmyun was definitely interesting. Not like anything I had tasted before, and very unique. The slushy broth was awesome though. More taste that I expected from cold noodles! The Bibimbap was quite good, but not enough meat in the bowl. Finally the Kimchi Jjim was amazing! Rich kimchi flavour in super juicy and soft pork belly! Definitely my favourite that we ordered.

Tons of side dishes and options as well as great friendly service is a win in my books. The servers were quite attentive and made sure everything was going well. The booths in the restaurant had high dividers though, which made getting a server harder at times since you couldn't always be seen.

Overall, great food with friendly service makes this one of my favourites now for Korean food. Make sure to come check this one out!"}
{"text":"A group of three of us arrived one weekday evening, around 8pm and this place was packed! We ended up waiting for a table for about 20-30 minutes.

A friend of ours had been here before, and she described it as one of the best Korean restaurants. 

We ordered the mool naengmyun, a cold noodle dish. I personally thought it was average, but the other two enjoyed it. We also ordered the budae Jjigae Jeongol, which contains instant noodles, spam ham, what I believe are Costco hot dogs, in a spicy broth. That was delicious, but oh so spicy that it took away from the individual flavours of each component in the dish. 

These two dishes were enough to feed 3 adults, with a small doggy bag to-go even! But would I come back again? Not sure"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night with my husband around 6pm, just early enough to beat the crowd.

The restaurant is spacious and bright. There are booths for smaller groups and tables for bigger groups. Very toddler friendly.

Service was prompt and friendly. The owner showed up a few times at our table to make sure we were okay with the food. 

We ordered their signature cold noodles with an extra slushy soup, pork bone soup and bibimbap. The bibimbap was filling and had generous amount of toppings in a hot stone bowl. Their pork bone soup was a bit disappointing for me. The flavour was lacking. I've had better pork bone soup elsewhere. However, their cold noodles were tasty even on a cold winter night. It was slightly spicy but refreshing at the same time. The dish was pretty addictive in my opinion. I wouldn't mind ordering this again in summer."}
{"text":"Top quality Korean food. The slushy broth noodles are soo good in the summer. The cold noodle is a must try for first time visitors. 

The only problem with this place is size of the restaurant. Its small and often you have to wait. Its worth thou you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm Korean, and this is my favourite Korean resto. I've only ever had mul naeng myun, hae naeng myun and kimchi jim. 1 and 3 were revelatory for me. 2 is good, but it's a bit of an acquired taste."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place after reading all the reviews, and I will say the cold noodles are honestly very good! But another part of eating out is the experience and service you receive, which was NOT there. It was about a 20 minute wait which was acceptable - there is a ticket system and we had some minor issues with that as it's hard to hear when they announce your number. What was UNACCEPTABLE was the fact that an employee (a very senior looking man who may have been the Manager) came up to our table of 2 to ask if \"something was wrong with our food.\" I could tell he was hinting that he wanted us to eat faster - this was a very strange interruption. A few minutes later, he came back and said to us: \"You've been here for more than 30 minutes, people are waiting, don't you see? If you want to go talk, go somewhere else.\" I was so shocked I couldn't even respond, we both just stared at him point blank. A few second later, our server comes to ask us if we'd like our bill. The answer was of course, yes, so that we could leave this place immediately. This was both our first time at this restaurant and it was disappointing to have ended this way."}
{"text":"No 1 . korean food restaurant 

Clean . Fast . delicious

Everything great.

But sometimes huge lime up."}
{"text":"Very good korean food lost a star because ive been here twice and no kalbi twice :( but the menu is diverse enough and the nyaengmyun is very good! We're trying the gamjatang today so we shall see how that goes! No line at this time but last time about 7pm on a sunday the wait was around 30 mins"}
{"text":"Solid Korean place. Got their kimchi pork (jjim) as recommended and gamjatang. The gamjatang was pretty good and the soup was definitely higher quality than many other places. There was a good variety of side dishes. However, the service was subpar. I understand it is not fine dining, but messing up our order and then proceeding to play hide and seek with your customers is definitely not great."}
{"text":"Definitely my go to place for cold noodles. I've tried other places for cold noodles and none of them is as good as the one from cho sun ok. You can order the cold noodles with kalbi or dumplings, if not, you can order cold noodles by itself with no side.
The only thing about this place is they don't serve you like many other korean restaurants do with their side dishes. That is what I look forward to the most when I go to korean restaurants. It was only the two of us and we ordered just the cold noodles by itself, and another order of cold noodles with dumplings, and we only got 2 side dishes (kimchi and pickled cabbage), whereas at other restaurants, there's atleast 6 or more dishes. 
Another thing is whether it is a weekday or weekend, it's always a full house and line ups at the door. So expect a bit of a wait! But totally worth it! 
Besides that, great service and food doesn't take long to get to your table!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Wednesday night. We were seated immediately and had tea brought to us. After we ordered, the service seemed nonexistent with the exception of them bringing us a variety of side dishes along with our orders. Our tea was not refilled (which was not pleasant because my friend and I both ordered spicy items off the menu), and no one came to check on us or take away empty plates. 

I ordered the Kimchi Jjim, and it came with a bowl of rice, which was good in offsetting the spiciness of the dish. I liked how the kimchi was presented and overall the taste of the dish was pretty good. 

All in all, I thought this place was average. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I also wouldn't make a conscious effort to return."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Came on a Thursday evening around 8:15, and waited around 25 mins for 2. MAKE SURE YOU GET A NUMBER FROM THE CASHIER AT THE BACK! The owner helped to seat people and turn over tables so definitely a plus. Ordered the naengmyun with steamed dumplings and was quite special given that this was my first cold noodle experience. The ice broth mixed with the noodles is a unique taste that was refreshing - perfect for a warm summer day. The noodles were a bit too chewy for my liking, but thankfully they do offer to cut the noodles prior to serving. Brother ordered the pork bone soup and it seemed a bit mild for his liking, although the soup still tasted quite good. There were plenty of side dishes and a water station for self serving near the cashier area. Probably not recommended for larger groups as most of the tables are in 2s or in booths for 4. Parking is also a bit small since it is located in a smaller strip plaza.    

Will return to try the other items given the good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is always so crowded. The cold buckwheat noodles (naeng-myeon) are really the best in Toronto IF (and I emphasize this *IF*) you ask them to hold the spicy da-dae-gi. Once that stuff gets into your cold noodle soup, then the clear and refreshing soup becomes grainy, muddy, and too sweet. Their kimchi and pork combo dish is very delicious, as are the blood sausages and the old-fashioned bibimbap mixed in a big brass bowl."}
{"text":"I like this place. The quality of the ingredients they use, especially for side dishes, is noticeably fresher. 

They are famous for their cold noodles. I tried it and thought it wasn't exceptionally better. But it was still very good. I always thought adding a few slices of pork was standard. There was no pork in our cold noodles. This was a slight letdown. Aside from this, the broth was very good. I ordered the cold noodle combo with dumplings. I thought the 8 dumplings were really small compared to what I've seen in the pictures on Yelp. I eat Chinese dumplings all the time and frankly I thought the dumplings were almost exactly like Chinese fried dumplings in terms of taste and size so I don't see why they are worth around $1 each. I was expecting those big dumplings. 

Their other dishes are also great. They make everything (that I've tried) very well. I eat a lot of Korean food so nothing here blows my mind, but it's obvious they know how to manage their ingredients. They have a very focused menu so don't expect a lot of unique dishes. You'll find all the \"standard\" dishes here.

I still recommend this place despite the slightly bad experience with the dumplings."}
{"text":"The arrowroot noodles were thin and topped with a little bit of kimchi -- which provided a little spice to the noodles which were otherwise plain in a good way.  (They also brought three side dishes to our table -- kimchi, an apple and potato salad, and pickled radish.)  I was extremely pleased with how the arrowroot noodles were so soft yet firm.  The ice slush near the sides of the bowl kept the noodles cold.  A sip of the soup made me notice how refreshing the broth was too!  There were also cucumbers, radish, and a half boiled egg in the rest of the bowl."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Korean restaurants. There's always line ups at the door and always busy even at 9pm on a weekday night. 

Three favourite dishes of mine - cold noodles, stewed pork belly and the Sundae (Korean Sausage) soup with pig gizzards. Also like the purple rice here."}
{"text":"We were two downtowners aimlessly driving up Yonge in a borrowed hot car, wanting to take advantage of our being vehicularly-equipped by eating somewhere new and fun, but not knowing where to go. I used my phone-a-friend lifeline and was recommended Cho Sun Ok for its apparently famous cold noodles. SOLD. North and norther we went.

We got the naengmyeon in slushy broth ($9), a dolsot bimbimbap ($10, in the hottest hot stone pot I have ever encountered), and an excellent banchan spread.

So good! Naengmyeon is the perfect summer dinner, although when they say \"icy\" they mean it. It makes gazpacho feel like a hot toddy. Portions for both dishes were large; factoring in the bottomless pickled radish, we were beyond stuffed.

Overall, a delightful journey to exotic Markham.

VEG/PESC NOTE: Most Korean menus aren't super vegetarian-friendly, but this one is really limited. But they happily swapped the bibimbap's beef for tofu, and I took the don't-ask-don't-tell route with the broth."}
{"text":"Came to Cho Sun Ok for a late lunch on Saturday around 3pm and this place was still jam packed!  We had to wait for a little while before getting seated but staff were very efficient!  I ordered the tofu soup and my mom ordered the cold noodle kalbi combo.  Food was ready very quick and everything tasted delicious.  Though I find the price to be higher than what I expected for Korean food."}
{"text":"Place is actually has very clean modern look. Porcelain flooring, Wooden booths, very cute.

We ordered the kimchi budae jeongol regular spicy.  Aka pot stew at 27.95.  It's supposed to be for 2.  It's pretty big.  Really yummy.

Menu is not huge, but i like it like that. Handful of really good specialty foods. 

Comes with a full set of appetizers as well.  

Service was amazing.  She packed our left over food. Came back to check if we needed more appetizers. And was very polite. 

5 star all around. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Never listen to a non-Korean when they rave about a Korean restaurant. This isn't like Italian food that is so pervasive in our \"Canadian\" diet that ethnic background really doesn't matter. Korean food is something you need to have been immersed in - not necessarily raised on, but immersed in.  If you are not Korean, but spent two years fully engaging in Korean food and cultural activities in Korea, then your word counts.  The reviews received here for all dishes other than this places known favourite: naeng myun, were most likely non Koreans who saw the line up in the summer and thought it had to be a good place. Why else the line up, right?  

Honestly, the naeng myun is good if you are into that. Anything outside of the naeng myun is just ok but nothing to wait in line for.  So why the 1 star?  The Korean restaurant experience is not only about food but the service. Koreans are of a culture that elevates the guest to a position of honour and respect.  As such many Korean restaurants will provide little extras or \"service\" (free sides) when you are a patron.

However, I have never been to a Korean restaurant where the ownership was so stingy that they held back on the banchans unless your order made financial sense for them to offer the most standard and customary of these dishes.   Don't believe me??  Read the fine print. They actually have it written down on the place mat at the bottom in small print. It basically states if you order certain dishes they will not provide you with anything but \"select\" banchan sides.  I have never been to a Korean restaurant like this ever. And I've been to Korea, to LA and New York Korea town/restaurants.  At first my partner and I thought we were being discriminated against because we spoke English. So I spoke Korean and asked why the table next to us and behind us had so much more ban chan than we did and the waitress pointed to the fine print an told me to read their policy. I couldn't believe my eyes!  I went from curious to fuming.  So with one look I must have said everything that I was thinking because a few moments later she came back with a full try of ban chan. A little too late. The damage is done.  

This type of service ruins any good taste the food might contain.  No offense to my lovely and charming Chinese brothers and sisters but this type of Scrooge tactic is something I expect at a Chinese establishment NOT at a Korean joint.  If you think I am going to spend my money here for average Korean fare at premium prices and be treated like a North Korean being given food rations, then you have got to be kidding. I am not the smartest cookie but I am not that dumb either. For the rest of the people who choose to frequent this place thinking its the best Korean food in the gta , you go ahead and live that dream. I for one want nothing to do with these poor representatives of my people!

***UPDATE to REVIEW - May 30, 2013***
Sean P - the owner - sent me this:
\"We gave you the side dishes after your complaint because on your prior visit, you complained then about not receiving side dishes. Please understand the culture before making accusations on a public forum about being \" stingy\", \"cheap\" and \"discriminating\". We personally do not care about the stars on Yelp as you will always have a disgruntled customer followed by many of the happy customers.  Our volume of customers (often regulars) speaks for itself.  I just felt compelled to respond to your outrages claims and hopefully shed some light on the tradition of eating Naeng Myun and why we did not serve you the side dishes you would have received with a rice entree.  This is the first time I have ever posted a comment on a guest's review but I felt I needed to defend our restaurant's integrity and the Korean tradition. I really do hope that you will join us again now understanding our policies and the reasons behind them.\"

My thoughts on this:
1.  He mentions a \"prior visit\" where I supposedly complained.  This never happened, so it's clear others aren't happy either.
2.  To clarify, I never said this restaurant discriminates to non-Koreans.  I said at first that was what I thought.
3.  My partner and I ordered Naeng Myun, Kal Bi and Tonkatsu.  Even with tokatsu and kal bi ordered, the waitress still pointed to the house \"policy\".
4.  He writes about how the unqiue taste of Naeng Myung can be affected by certain banchans.  Then why not put in the fine print something to the effect of: \"The house does not recommend...but, will serve should the customer wish it so\"?

My review stands.  Cho Sun Ok's menu is as diverse as that of Im Ga Nae, Ogeul Bogeul, Jung Soo Nae.  The only difference is Cho Sun Ok won't give you banchan when you order tonkatsu or naeng myun while the others will.  Cheap?  Stingy?  I have my opinions.  You decide."}
{"text":"Must try their nangmyun. Spicy or not spicy, both versions are excellent!!
Also love their steamed kimchi with pork (They are served side by side but not mixed together)."}
{"text":"I haven't came to Cho Sun Ok in forever, and on Sunday I was real cravings for cold noodles because it was so hot that day. We arrived there at around 5:15pm and already there were a lot of people waiting. I think we must've waited for 20 minutes before getting seated. My bf ordered the cold noodles with the LA kalbi, and I just ordered the regular cold noodles so that we could share the kalbi.

Almost every table ordered cold noodles! I seriously think this is one of the best places to get it because it's has a lot of flavour and it's just so refreshing after drinking the broth! The noodles comes in a huge bowl so I think it's worth the price. One thing to suggest is - come early to avoid waiting forever!"}
{"text":"Blogsters finally had a chance to visit Cho Sun Ok!  They served home-style quality comfort foods, which make customers coming back for more.  Every time we passed by this place, it is always packed and you can see the line outside the restaurant, but it is definitely worth the wait.  Cho Sun Ok has their very own philosophy QRST: Quality, Reliability, Service, and Taste - making sure every customer is satisfied with their meal.

Unlike any other Korean restaurant where they serve you numerous of side dishes, Cho Sun Ok will only serve you side dishes that compliment to what you ordered for your main course.  And that night we have kimchi and pickled radishes as our sides.  =)  Their kimchi is very tasteful and well fermented.  It's not like any other that we have tried, it is very well seasoned, a little too spicy for us but the flavour just makes you keep wanting to have more.

Cho Sun Ok is very famous for their naengmyun (arrowroot noddles with icy broth), especially in the summer.  Even though Toronto's weather is not that hot right now, we still decided to give it a try.  Without a doubt, it is the best naengmyun we had so far. AWESOME!  The noodles were cooked perfectly, chewy yet not too tough or too mushy.  I guess you will call it AL DENTE, as if it is a pasta.

We also ordered steamed dumplings with the naengmyun.  The pork and veggie inside are well seasoned,  However, the wrap is a little bit too dry.

Don Katsu is another famous dish that they have.  The pork chops are slightly on the thin side but they are very crispy, and there were just enough sauce to give you the flavour.  Of course we weren't able to finish two huge pieces of pork chops, and ended up taking it home.

We had a great time at Cho Sun Ok, and plan to go back as often as we could.  The only down side to have dinner here is we would have to have an early dinner or late dinner, as this place is always packed with customers."}
{"text":"The cold noodles at Cho sun ok never disappoints me, the broth is very flavourful and refreshing. I always crave this on hot summer days. However, you can expect to wait in line for about 30 minutes before you can get a table."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Tried their cold noodles and kimchi jiim, both were good although the noodles were a bit too sweet for my taste. I do think it would be great for summer though!

The place is quite pricey and is not easily reachable unless you drive, however the place is clean and service is quick."}
{"text":"You know this place is good when you see lineups of all kinds of Asians clamouring for their trademark dish: NAENG MYUN (cold noodle soup). At other Korean restaurants, you may get a few ice cubes; here you get a fresh mound of arrowroot noodles surrounded by the most perfect consistency of slushy ice goodness!!! Hits the spot on a hot summer day. We had a large group of 9 including a sleeping baby in a car seat but the hostess did her best to accommodate by seating us in booths opposite each other. It was tight but hey-- I'm skinny. Know what you want b/c the pace is fast & so is the service. We got either hot barley tea or cold water offered right away followed by a good variety of 4-5 side dishes called \"banchan\" (meant to be shared).  My son thought his Kalbi (BBQ side ribs) were a bit oily but I thought it was quite tasty and tender. I thoroughly enjoyed my Bibimbap topped off with an egg yolk. Stirred in the requisite spicy sauce \"kochu-Jang\" and it disappeared fast scraped down to the stone bowl it came in. \"The kochujang was too sweet\" said my son who makes a mean homemade kochu-jang sauce but maybe the cold soup made his taste buds too sensitive?!"}
{"text":"The minute I tasted  (kimchi jjim - pork and kimchi), I am hooked on this restaurant.  So good."}
{"text":"2 of my friends and I decided to check out this place in a Friday evening for dinner. While it was pretty busy when we arrived at 6:45pm, we were seated within 15 minutes.

My friends ordered the pork bone soup and the seafood soft tofu soup, while I got the don katsu. This place was really accommodating for spice levels of the soups, and the don katsu portion was much larger than I expected and well worth its value. 

The only downside was that we didn't get our side dishes until we asked for them - after our main courses were already served."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been out for Korean food. I ended up here on the suggestion of a friend. I was a little skeptical but the place was 90% full on a Friday at lunch and it was mostly Korean people inside. That's always a good sign. I ordered a bibimbap and the others ordered pork bone soup. The food arrived shortly after we placed our orders and it arrived hot and fresh along with the usual banchan - kimchi, etc. 

I thought the prices here were a bit higher than some of the other Korean restaurants I'd been to but the interior was clean and modern, the service was fast and the food was fresh and delicious. I will be back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Love it here. You know the places are good when all the ajummas go there. I never really liked cold noodles until going to this place. Now I find myself craving it!"}
{"text":"Came here for some authentic Korean food. As my friends and I were debating where to eat. We got here and hoping we didn't have to wait. That assumption was false. The line up was huge. However people were in and out fast. So the wait wasn't so bad.

The restaurant is pretty clean and well lit. On a super hot day, the air conditioning was blasting away. Once we sat down, we quickly place our order of food. One thing I noticed this restaurant doesn't have where other Korean restaurants do have is that bell ringer. That was just an observation. Anyhow.

I ordered the Don Katsu and my friends ordered the cold noodle. The food came not long after. As my picture shown, portion is big. The pork came out a bit dry? But at least it's not greasy. I was super full after. Also one thing, my perception of Korean food has improved after visiting this place. Over all impression is pretty good."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Korean restaurant. Purple rice with tofu and seafood soup. They only use canola and olive oil!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to Cho Sun Ok, I liked the service, the staff was friendly and an older gentleman (probably the owner) walked by asking us how we liked the food. Personal touch,

we had the cold noodle in slushy soup...amazing flavour
The Soondae was awesome, not a big fan of the liver in this plate but the rest of it was awesome
We had the steamed and fried Mandoo (dumplings), amazing
Next was the Galbi Tang...meat was very well done and the soup...imagine having a cold and you need a good bone soup..this is it
FInally we had the seafood Jeongal (Korean Hot Pot)...my fav dish of all the things we ate..

We really pigged out..I loved the restaurant"}
{"text":"I might as well join in on all the reviews on this place. They are famous for their Korean cold noodles. I had the Bibim naengmyun or cold noodles with spicy sauce. It was a hot day and this was just perfect. Very flavorful, satisfying, and refreshing. I believe everyone else has already covered the bases in terms of reviewing their cold noodles. 

Just beware of pepper flakes being stuck in your teeth after! 

I will change my review to 5/5 once I've tried one other dish that I like and is not cold noodles here."}
{"text":"It is definitely one of my top Korean restaurants in Toronto. I went with 3 other friends on a Saturday at lunch time. The wait was about 15 min which wasn't too bad. We sat down and ordered Yukgaejang, Bibimbap, Gamjatang, Soon tofu jjigae and the famous kimchi jjim to share between the 4 of us. I love spicy food and the spice in all these dishes was just right. I personally got the yugaejang - the beef was tender, the soup was spicy but not too salty and the glass noodles were slippery and tasty. I was in love with the kimchi jjim - the meat and kimchi combo was just 100% amazing. The ladies who served us were friendly and helpful. I tried to order for my entire table by speaking Korean only. They were able to understand me perfectly without making fun of my broken Korean (thats always a big plus.) Overall, this place was great and I would recommend everyone who loves Korean food and spicy food in general to come. The price was on the higher end but I dont come here often. It was worth the money to get good korean food like this."}
{"text":"3.5 Absolutely love the cold noodles (mool naengmyun) - arrow root noodles in a slush broth, perfect for a hot summer day!  I also tried the sharing pot of intestines with noodles was not a big fan of that, had an odour which I could not eat, would prob stick to the regular kimchi/pork belly next time. Also tried the spicy chicken which was ok -portions are generous and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Walked in and there was a half an hour wait for a table for two... I wasn't expecting this place to get so busy! Ended up killing some time at the Korean supermarket down the street. There are some cute and cozy little plazas around the area. Anyway, we really enjoyed our meal here! The Korean food was awesome. We ordered three dishes:

1) Cold Noodles (Bibim Naengmyun), one of the more popular items on the menu. It was delicious after mixing it around in the spicy sauce. It's not too spicy, and really adds yummy flavour to the noodles. There is quite a big portion in my opinion - I split this dish with someone else and found it to be well over enough. 

2) Pork Bone Soup. This tasted pretty average, like you'd get at any Korean restaurant. I found they gave you a good amount of pork bone! Yum! Mixing some of the meat with the cold noodles tasted really good too.

3) Chicken Katsu. We honestly ordered this because the cold noodles had no protein, and we figured we'd still be hungry and would want some more meat to our meal. But I was full after the first two dishes though... So that was a mistake. I did however try a few pieces of the chicken, and they weren't bad at all. Reminded me of chicken nuggets.

Overall, I would recommend coming here to try some Korean dishes! I had a great time and would probably visit again."}
{"text":"COLD NOODLES - SLURRRRPPPPP!!!!!

How would you know if a Korean place is good? 
You KNOW a Korean place is good when you get thirty Koreans lining up for cold noodles on a weekday night. 

We came on a Thursday night and WOW, this place was packed that we were squished - a little less than a can of sardines in the waiting area of Cho Sun Ok. When you come in, make sure you walk straight to the cash register (yes straight down on the right side) to get a number. The staff will call the number out in Korean and English! 

If you sit at a booth, be careful you don't pull open the boards right beside you, or else you will be playing \"peekaboo\" with the other guests sitting on the opposite side. Yes, it's embarrassing, so don't do it. 

On a Thursday night, we waited about twenty minutes to half an hour, but FINALLY we got a seat and all of us ordered a Cold Noodle Dish! We got the Mool Nangmeyon ($10.95). My other friend got the Bibim Nangmeyon. The side dishes were radish and kimchi - I heard if you order other items, there will be a greater selection of side dishes. Both of these dishes were LARGE, I'd say the size is like a large bowl of pho. They put radishes in it and the largest piece which looks like a radish is actually a pear! 

The Mool Nangmeyon wasn't spicy at all for me, but my friend who was not a spicy eater, was bursting up in flames, especially towards the end! Definitely watch out if you're not a spicy eater! The broth is like a slush, nice and cold. The waitress brings the cold noodles out in a cart and cut them into quadrants right in front of you! Super pretty layout with half an egg in it.

My friend who enjoyed spicy food ordered the Bibim Nanmeyon and it was super spicy for her. Her noodles were cold, but she didn't get a broth. 

Verdict: Come on a hot summer day, and expect to wait in line!"}
{"text":"The cold noodles here are the best in town.  The only complaint I have is that they don't give you enough of it. Further the prices they charge are a bit over the top.  There seems to be a 2-3 dollar premium as opposed to other restaurants"}
{"text":"Their speciality here is their cold noodles - the broth is the best one I have had in Toronto so far and I prefer their ice slush rather than ice cubes found in other Korean restaurants.  So for their cold noodles and their service - it would be 4 stars. As an overall experience though, I give it 3 stars. For one thing, they don't have a great variety of side dishes. 
 
We asked the waiter what was his favourite dish and he recommended Item #19 on the menu, which was the sliced pork belly and whole cabbage Kimchi in special sauce.  The sauce is...special,  as I haven't tasted anything like that before but it could be an acquired taste for some people.  I liked it.
 
He also recommended Item#29 -Jangjorim Dolsot Bibimbap, which we didn't try. He said not every Korean restaurant serves this kind of beef flank.
 
I would see myself coming back for their cold noodles in the summer time."}
{"text":"I had their cold noodles here, and it was very good. So far, it's the best I have had. The broth slush was very tasty, and did not taste watered down in any way - like when all the good parts of the slush melt, leaving only the watery ice.

Service is very quick in getting your order and getting your food. I was only there for about an hour, which is great and was not rushed eating as well. 

Although, the place does get pretty busy, and sometimes I see lines outside when I drive by. I'm not about waiting that long for Korean food, when there are plenty of other good options in the area - but by no means is this the establishment's fault. Just be aware there may be a line if you go during prime time. 

Overall I would definitely come here again, but not during peak times."}
{"text":"Everything here was excellent. There was a good variety of banchan, and the soon tofu was possibly the best I've ever had. The only problem is how busy it gets -- you should consider going early, or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"3.5. 

Wow. Busy place. Got here later than the rest of my party (they'd already been here for 15 or so minutes), and we still had to wait for another 8 tables before we got seated. That being said, service was not bad, and the place was pretty clean. What I really appreciate is that their seating system is automated. You get a printed ticket letting you know what number they'd call to let you know your table is ready. I appreciate that they had seats for some of those waiting, but there were a whole bunch of people waiting outside the restaurant as well.

I came knowing that their specialty is their cold noodles. On a hot day like yesterday, I thought more people would be ordering cold noodles, but many of the tables were ordering the hot plates/pots/stews for 2 people. They looked and smelled amazing, but I was here to try the cold noodles, and so I did. I quite enjoyed them. The broth was tangy. The noodles were cooked well. I wish there had been a tad more slush to my broth, but I suppose with me coughing and all, I should be thankful. The singular slice of Asian pear in my soup had been hyped up immensely (my friend has a big thing for that slice of pear), but it was still just a slice of pear. 

7 types of banchan, but none of them really, really stood out. Small slivers of fish cake, kimchi, sprouts, cucumber kimchi, shredded radish with potato, kimchi radish cubes, and one other one I forget now.

Cold water served with your meal, not tea.

Washroom was decently clean (although one of the stalls smelled kinda funky).

Pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"Nice authentic Korean food.   The Spicy chicken is really good!   Do not be deceived since it's considered an appetizer-it was a really large dish which explains the $23.95 price.  Enough for 2-3 people.  It has a bit of a kick in it and also the sweet / sour is not overwhelming.  Even thought its breaded, it's not too oily/filling.  The pork bone soup was a bit watered down and the potato was was bit undercooked...I will give them the benefit of the doubt since my friends have been here many times before said that is the exception.  I will try it out next time and hope for an better pork bone soup.  Maybe it's because we came really late?  All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place from many yelpers and especially my Korean friend, who is literally one of the most 'korean' people I know- as in, she eats authentic Korean food only from home. Therefore, when she recommends a Korean restaurant, I know she ain't playing games. She told me about this place numerous times and told me that they specialize in one of my favourite dishes- the naeng myun. She also taught me a lesson that day that I thought I'd pass along. \"If a Korean restaurant doesn't say specifically that they specialize in naeng myun, that means it's straight from the instant package. Rookie mistake.\" 

Anyway, we stopped by early Sunday afternoon to grab some quick food. It was only 11am and it actually opened at 11:30am. So we waited until it was time and then we were one of the first customers to get in. The service is completely in Korean and they speak minimal English. They greet you in Korean and even speak to you in Korean even after they realize you are not fluent. The place itself is very clean and has little wooden booths for every table, which I love. However, usually places with this type of setting has bells to call the waiters over easily but cho sun ok did not, which was a bit inconvenient since we had to wave our hands like madmen to be noticed. 

The naeng myun here was spectacular and just like one of the tips said: get it with a side of galbi. YUM!!!! The portion was HUGE and it was definitely an Olympic star compared to the \"Korean\" food at chains like owl of Minerva and Nak Won. They hand pull their own noodles and you can definitely taste the difference in texture. I had a happy stomach for the entire meal. My boyfriend had the gamjatang (because he's basic) but it was VERY good. Nice warm spicy soup with purple rice, which is my preference. 

Overall, it was a good experience for authentic naeng myun and I'd definitely go again. I think I did luck out though, because when I left at around 12-12:30pm, the door was lined with hungry Koreans waiting anxiously for their own naeng myun. It was clearly a very popular place due to the authenticity and the competition they have around the area."}
{"text":"The naengmyun here is pretty special! Be careful though because it is addictive! You will be back again and again for it! It seems strange at first...slushy noodle soup...but give it a chance and you will be converted."}
{"text":"This was my first time having cold noodles after my Korean friend told me about this place that was famous their cold noodles, and it was an AMAZING DINING EXPERIENCE!

The portion sizes were beyond my expectations, with all the side dishes and a big bowl of noodles, I left the restaurant 10 pounds heavier.

The noodles had so much character and was chewy and very fun to eat. The broth was refreshing and spicy. I don't normally have something cold and savory so that certainly a unique experience for me."}
{"text":"YES! Cho Sun Ok! SO GOOD! 

They have the best naengmyun (korean cold noodles) in the city! The slushy broth is just the right balance of tangy and sweet. It comes with pear slices and boiled egg, which sounds weird but pairs well with the cold broth! The noodles are chewy and super satisfying going down to the stomach. I particularly like ordering the cold noodles with the Kalbi which creates a nice contrast between the cold noodles and hot meat. 

pork bone soup is 4.5/5
cold noodles 5/5
Kalbi 4.5/5
steamed dumplings 4.5/5 (this one could be a personal preference, but I love the dipping sauce)

If you go during meal times on weekends and dinner on weeknights, there will be a lineup, although it's usually faster than you think. The parking isn't too bad, I seem to always be able to find a spot regardless of how busy it is, and there is a parking in another plaza beside this place, although you should park here at your own risk as parking is reserved for plaza customers only."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and while they do serve good Korean food here, I haven't been totally blown away. But for me the highlight of this place will be their broth for the soups. It's truly special.

Let's start off with the fact that there's really modest menu here. There's some apps, naeng myeon, soups, and a few of your standard main dishes. Not much to choose from but obviously you don't come here for kbbq. This is a cold noodles and soup place first and foremost. Prices might seem a bit higher than your average place too, but portion sizes are reasonable.

I went with the hoe bibim naeng myeon this time which is your standard cold noodles in spicy gochujang based sauce but with skate fish. Skate fish is really interesting; it's kind of tough. It's almost nothing like fish, since they use the wings of the skate, it's cartilaginous in texture. It's really not for everyone. You do get the delicious warm broth here, and it's very rich with plenty of meaty flavor. I wouldn't say the naeng myeon is super special here (the menu said they're famous for it) but it was good and it's definitely a safe thing to eat here. It was also pretty spicy so just a heads up to ask for a more mild one if you can't handle the heat! And also, the serving size is massive. I couldn't finish the entire bowl of noodles myself. I did also try the dumplings but would stay away from them. 

The soups and stews here and also pretty good. I tried the yookgae jang here; again, the soup is incredibly flavorful but I was disappointed with the lack of shredded beef. It was practically devoid of any beef. But otherwise, I loved it and the soup was just so rich. Same thing applies to the kalbi tang, they just make an amazing broth here."}
{"text":"It was a hot day in Toronto; my sister brought me here and for the first time I tried the Arrow Root Noodles in Icy Broth. It was phenomenal! The noodles are dark brown, chewy, and placed in a ice slurry broth. It was kinda pricey ($16) but it came with a side of short ribs (also good). 

Although I thought it was pricey for Korean noodles, I tried the same thing again at another place (on Yonge/Finch) and it didn't even come close. 

This place gets packed fast and lines form in a matter of minutes. Free parking in front (but you gotta fight for it - as with all Asian establishments in TO)."}

Food / Quality Rating - 4 / 5

Galbi beef + Naengmyeon (cold noodle) in icy broth. 

Noodles were as cold as advertised. Chilled and refreshing to the tongue, while the galbi beef was a nice complement for a protein. The beef rib slices could have been slightly bigger but the quality of the rib showed. They were sweet and a bit chewy. 

Gamja tang. Plenty of little peril seeds to make it authentic. Hot and nicely spice. Pork bones contained ample amounts of meat. 

Side dishes contained your standard assortment of dishes. The Kim chi was especially refreshing and tasted very fresh. 

Portion size was good. 

Staff/Service Rating - 3.5 / 5
Staff was friendly, and the store was  adequately staffed. However given the number of customers and constant flow of customers, it was really busy for them. The supervisor did come around to ask if the meal was received well which added a nice touch.

Environment Rating - 3.5 / 5
Standard environment. There were no indications of going above and beyond cleanliness. Washrooms were standard and kept. 

Price Rating - 3.5 / 5
Price after tax and tip - $44.05 for 2 people. Meal was slightly pricey but still affordable."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time back to this restaurant and it never disappointed me. Between 2 people, we ordered the soondae jeongol during 2/3 of our visits. The amount you get for 2 people will definitely fill you up, as it came with 2 bowls of rice, and the soondae is made of glass noodles itself too (which was my favourite part of the meal).
Naengmyun is a must try here as well, as it's considered the best around town.

The best time to go for dinner is around 8:30 or 9, as there's no wait time since they close at 10pm. Service was really quick."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food! 

Went with my family during the lunch rush(12:30) and waited for around 15 mins, bonus points for providing wifi! Due to the small waiting area, it may seem packed, but the wait is usually fast paced. Also the food is well worth it. I had ice buckwheat noodles (naengmyeon) and also the Bul Nak Jeongol ( beef, octupus, veggies all in a beef broth hot pot). Both where absolutely amazing, not too salty, or sweet. Personally, I added the vinegar and kimchi to my naengmyeon, I gave it more of a kick, weird but I enjoyed it?"}
{"text":"THE BEST COLD Noodles!!! It's a bit cold in the winter, but still amazing! Family own business, always giving back to the community with church donations. Service is great. Sometimes the parking lot is full and the wait can be approx 10-15mins. Worth the wait! Highly recommend , and will be coming back as a regular!"}
{"text":"The BEST cold noodles I have had so far.  Seriously.

Favorite Orders
1) The Slushy Broth Cold Noodles with Fried Dumplings--you will fall I love.
2) Steamed Kimchi & Pork--something we ALWAYS order every time we are there.


Tips
==========
For first timers, YOU NEED TO GET A NUMBER at the cashier desk.  Its all the way at the back, and usually the boss is standing at the cash register.  Once you get the number, listen for them as they will call it out.

In the summer when there are HUGE line-ups outside, the staff usually call the number inside and then if no one answers they usually come outside to check as well.  BUT if you want to be on the safe side, have someone stand inside to listen for your table number.


Take out
==========
The take out menu is limited, and different from the main menu--just an fyi."}
{"text":"I went here with my fiance, because I kept seeing it while driving down Yonge Street and we decided to come try. (We are always looking for good Korean food).

The first time we went here, we went pretty close to closing and they were super welcoming.  The waitress was extremely polite!!!  She made sure we always had enough water and appetizers and packed our food for us.

We have tried their big hot pot with sausage, ham, pork, veggies and instant noodles.  It's so good!  This is my favourite Korean dish at any restaurant I go to (I think I'm addicted lol).
I also tried their cold buckwheat noodle dishes (Which is their speciality).  This was also pretty good.

The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is that I wish the menu had more items.


We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"YUM This place is very authentic, clean, and modern. It is in a plaza with lots of parking space. This has become one of our favourite Korean places in Toronto!
My boyfriend tried galbitang for the first time and he LOVED it! The broth (clear) was packed with beef flavour, and the meat was tender. They give you a generous amount of meat. It comes with a complimentary steamed rice. There is also glass noodle inside the soup so quite filling. We also ordered a small size kimchijjim. It was SO good! Kimchi was a tad bit too sour for my liking (but you are supposed to use aged kimchi for this dish). Pork belly was tender. Great banchans and service 

Overall, we will definitely be back to try naengmyun (and my boyfriend will for sure order galbitang again). I would recommend this place to anyone, especially to those who are not familiar with Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"There isn't a huge selection of food like some other Korean places but there still was a good amount of food items. The food they had was very yummy, the more traditional type of Korean food like bibimbap or Kamja Tang. The service was alright, the server's English wasn't the best so it did complicate things and they were a little short with us (which again could be the language barrier) but otherwise great place! I definitely will go again."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite Korean restaurants - especially for cold arrowroot noodles in an icy broth (try the spicy one for an extra kick).  This is a great dish to cool off in the summertime.

You do need to go early for lunch or dinner because it's not a big restaurant and it's very popular amongst Koreans.  It's rare that you don't have to wait for a table.

It's Korean-run and it's clean with a straightforward menu.  You can order your cold noodles as a combo with things like Kalbi ribs or Dumplings.

We usually get the Don Katsu (deep fried pork cutlet) for the kids.  They love it as it's lightly breaded with a little bit of sweet sauce.

If we aren't feeling like cold noodles, we'll order some of their other soup-based dishes like Pork Bone Soup, or Beef Rib soup.  I find their pork bone soup to be on the weaker side with not enough flavour or spice.

Expect to get your typical Korean side dishes as an appetizer - although certain entrees on the menu will not get you the full set of side dishes.

They accept Visa/Master Card here.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"My friends love the cold slushie noodles that are their staple but I don't get the appeal... that being said, the pork belly, gamjatang, and katsu are all delicious. Good amount of side dishes too."}
{"text":"I usually love Korean food, but I found my experience at this restaurant to be a little disappointing. My family was really looking forward to trying the budae jjigae jeongol. This was actually one of the main reasons we decided to go here in the first place, and we were pretty set on ordering one of the hot pot choices because the Korean restaurants in my area don't really offer this. Unfortunately, the waitress told us that they were out of one of the main ingredients for our first choice, so we would have to order something else. Our second choice was unavailable as well.. We ended up going with soondae jeongol. We also ordered kimchi jjim, yookgae jang, and haemool soon tofu.

The kimchi jjim was alright. Some of the pork belly seemed a little dry and tough, but I did enjoy the flavor. The spicy cabbage was very soft, and I enjoyed eating it with their rice. The yookgae jang was pretty good, but again, the meat was too tough for my liking. The haemool soon tofu was excellent. The broth was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and everything inside of the broth was as it should be. I didn't like the soondae jeongol at all, but I think this is a matter of taste. I'll also admit that I didn't realize \"traditional Korean style sausage\" was actually referring to blood sausage when we initially ordered it. This was my first time trying blood sausage, and I think it's just not for me. I didn't really care much for the other kinds of organs in the hot pot either.

The service was fine. The prices were a bit on the high side, but I guess the large portions were big enough to justify the high cost per person. I can't help but feel like I would've loved this place if we were able to try the budae jjigae jeongol as we had hoped. I also wish I ordered one of the cold noodle dishes instead because that sounds pretty interesting. I hope I have the opportunity to give this place another shot one day."}
{"text":"My Most favourite Korean restaurant. Food is good . Especially cold noodle and the pork bone soup..But you need a long line up."}
{"text":"Would return. Worth visiting at least once for their famous slush noodle soup. 
Long waits on weekends beware!

Been here just twice - this place seems to always be rammed. For standard Korean cuisine it's good, but what stands out here is the ice cold slush noodles, and evidently, this place does it better than anywhere else. I'm still not 100% sold on slush soup, cold noodles either but on trying just the soup, I'd be open to trying it next time for sure. 

The menu has a good variety of standard Koreatown Korean dishes - nothing too notable. Smaller location, fair prices, average service, authentic food, well executed. 

I ordered the Pork katsu with rice - awesome portion size for $12 with perfectly cooked steamed riced rice, fresh house made slaw and two well cooked (not dry) cutlets. Cutlets were well sauced and seasoned and I was smitten start to finish with the portion size. I added the cold slush soup on the side since this is what CSO is known for - very refreshing and tasty. It's a little spicy, a little savory and very well balanced, admittedly far better than I expected as a skeptic.

I give it 4/5 for good value and execution but I can't see coming here for much beyond just the cold noodles or the twin cutlet steal of a meal."}
{"text":"Food was quite good. Had the bimbimbap and my dad had the tofu seafood soup. Service was a bit slow, but the waitress was nice and kept getting us extra sides. The quality was very good, though i would have preferred more meat! Food was super hot, but this just means you have more time to talk over the meal. Prices are fair."}
{"text":"Flew into Toronto for family gathering and finally got my turn to pick the restaurant for the night.  I was so overwhelmed with Chinese food that I was craving some Korean food.  Found Cho Sun Ok on Yelp and the fact that they had Soondae Guk caught my eyes.  My family were surprised when they arrived a Korean restaurant and it was not a KBBQ joint.

Since my relatives have no idea on what they should be ordering, I took charge and ordered some of my favorite Korean dishes for the table.

-Gamjatang aka Pork Bone Soup was delicious.  The spiciness was perfect and there was a lot of meat left on the bones.  It is comparable to the ones I have had in Korea and in Koreantown Los Angeles.

-Soondaeguk - Blood Sausage And Intestine Soup:  Unfortunately, I was not really feeling this one.  It was prepared differently from other restaurants I have been to, and it was much spicier than the gamjatang.  Didn't like the fact that the soondae were served inside the soup because it made the sausages very mushy.

Overall, reasonable price and decent Korean Food.  Was glad that I made it to the restaurant before the dinner crowd.  Now that I have introduce my relatives to this restaurant, I am sure they will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The place is pretty big but still has a line which indicates how popular it is and how good the food is. I would recommend avoiding popular mealtimes like noon and 7pm and to go in a group of 4 - these will get you a high chance of getting seated quickly. If you do choose to go with a larger group, make sure to quickly get a number if there is a line. I find that with groups of 8, the wait time is still not too bad. Once you go past 8 people, it starts becoming a longer wait. (Also note the place is closed on Tuesdays). I went yesterday with a group of 7 and we got seated within 10 minutes which is pretty good for a Sunday afternoon and a large group. I also noticed that they seem to have hired more people which meant that the service was a lot faster than usual - from getting our order taken, to food coming out, to them processing our food. The nice thing about this restaurant is that they now process your payment at your table even if you want split bills.

In regards to food, I've tried about half of the dishes and am rarely disappointed by them. I would definitely recommend going with a group so that you can try more things. My favourites are the soondae (I usually ask for just sundae so I don't get liver or other parts I don't like), the kimchi jjim, mul naeng myun (which they are famous for), and oogeoji guk. They also have really good banchan that comes with the food. When I went yesterday, I got the mulnaengmyun which was perfect for a warmer than usual day. I love the sweet and tangy taste, the good amount of ice and the pear slice that it comes with. 

The only thing that was disappointing about yesterday's meal was that the prices had gone up since I last went (presumably due to increase in minimum wage?). However, it's still probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto and a place that most friends are down to go to when I suggest it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Clean compared to a lot of other Korean restaurants. It wasn't so busy the time we went so service was quick and the food came out at a good speed. Once the food arrived though we didn't have the servers check on us except a gentleman that seemed like the owner. 

Warning. If you order any of the cold noodles or Don katsu you do not get complimentary side dishes (banchan) as you would at other Korean establishments. 

Husband ordered the Don katsu $9.95. This came with soup broth, salad, rice, kimchi and pickled radish. 

I ordered a  combo of the chik bibim naeng myeon and galbi for $17.95, which came with soup broth but no rice with the meal and again no banchan (side dishes). The meal with filling but not sure worth the price without the extras. 

Overall 3.5 stars for cleanliness, service, food and price. I would come back only if in the area but I wouldn't make the effort to drive all the way here to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very limited menu as they only have other soups cold noodles or some snack items. I think the best or most famous dish restaurant has is the cold noodles.

 Noodles were very chewy and bibim sauce was very good and spicy.

I would kind of skip on the skeet cold noodles. Very fishy in flavour. 

The Gyoza and cold noodle combo were probably what the most people were getting, but in terms of flavor for the Gyoza they were not that good so I would skip it.

This restaurant would be a great choice if you wanted cold noodles on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"I came to have cold noodle as my friends tell me it's the best in town.  I totally agree!  This place is super busy tho, so if you don't want to wait go off peak hours.  We got there at 3pm for lunch and the place was 90% full."}
{"text":"Yes please still sucks I'm glad I don't live here anymore there's a lot of better Korean  restaurants out there yet waitresses still give lots of attitude I mean you don't have to work there if they don't want to so I don't understand why they still work there for. This place used to be good along time ago but after they had the renovations now it sucks. Waitresses always have bad attitude!"}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurants anywhere!

They specialize in naengmyun, AKA chilled broth noodles. This is a dish that has boggled my mind for a long time (isn't broth supposed to be hot?!). Even after ordering it at several restaurants, I still didn't 'get it'. It just wasn't special, and I usually found myself drowning the broth in vinegar and mustard. That is until now. The broth here is perfect. Extremely flavorful, refreshing, and just the right amount of sweetness. 

Before, it was a novelty to me--something different to try at a restaurant. Now, Cho Sun Ok's naengmyun is a must every time I'm in the GTA.

Also have to mention the kalbi, one of the best I've had anywhere, and you can get it as a combo with your naengmyun. Oh, and try the soondae (pork blood sausage), too. It was my first time trying it, and I was pleasantly surprised. People are just put off by the idea of pig's blood, but if you shut that part of your brain off and just eat, I think  you'll enjoy it.

The restaurant gets packed, so get there early or be prepared to wait. We showed up 15 minutes before opening and there was already a line. Luckily, the place had plenty of seating, but if you do end up having to wait, the turnover seems fast."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty legit Korean food! Cooked to perfection and great service! We pretty much finished everything on our plates. You know it's good when you see other Koreans here!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it is my absolute fave Korean resto in all of Toronto.  The mool naengmyun is our kid's fave dish because it has a slice of Asian pear   I love their jimchi jjim -- the most deliciously slow boiled kimchi with pork belly that I have ever had.  You can't go wrong with any of the dishes here.  Wow, just had pork bone soup...wow...and yes, I just went two days in a row and the wait staff recognized me!"}
{"text":"Ordered: 
Bibim Naengmyun (cold noodles)- $10.95
Haemool Soon Tofu (seafood stew)- $8.95 lunch, $9.95 dinner
Soondae Gook (pig organs stew)- $8.95 lunch, $9.95 dinner

Came here twice and both times the place was quite packed. I don't think they take reservations so you have to try your luck. When you enter, make sure to head towards the counter to take a number. I noticed some people just standing at the entrance not aware of having to go to the counter. The restaurant seemed very authentic since all the servers spoke Korean and you know the food has to be good when you see that the majority of customers are Korean as well. The menu is just one page with appetizers, noodles, stews, and hot pot options. I ordered the cold noodles (Bibim Naengmyun) which is apparently what they're most known for. What's special about their cold noodles is that it's made with arrow root so the noodles are black in colour. My friend ordered the Haemool Soon Tofu (spicy seafood and tofu stew). The second time I came, I ordered the Soondae Guk (stew with various pig organs and sausages). The cold noodles were definitely differnt from anything else I've had, the texture was chewy and the portion was actually quite generous. There were still ice in the bowl to keep the noodles cold. They also provide you with scissors to cut the noodles which you would definitely need. I highly recommend the cold noodles if it's your first time eating here. Initially I thought it was sliced white radish in the cold noodles but to my surprised it was Asian pears which made it more refreshing. I also recommend the Haemool Soon Tofu if you want a stew instead. I've had Korean stew countless times in the past but I think this was probably the best seafood stew I've had in a while. Unlike other seafood stews, it wasn't too salty and you could actually taste the seafood in the broth instead of just spicy paste. However I found that the broth for the Soondae Gook was just average. I did enjoy the Korean styled sausage in the Soondae Gook which is made from pork blood and glutinous rice. 
The dishes were decently priced and I would definitely come back to try their other dishes or order the cold noodles again."}
{"text":"Cho Sun Ok has a unique taste to their meals that make me want to come back over and over again, particularly their Pork Bone Soup and their BiBimBap.

The restaurant is very well run, despite the large volume of customers. From my experience, it is best to go after 1PM and before 5PM to avoid the rush. This place is incredibly clean and the quality of their meals is consistent, which is something that I highly value as a returning guest.

I usually get the Pork Bone Soup, which comes with a side of purple rice and loads of meat in the soup. Their cold-bowl BiBimBap is plentiful and colourful, which again remains the same every time I come back.
I will say that I am not a huge fan of their side dishes. Despite the large quantity, something about these dishes lack quality that I usually observe at other Korean restaurants. However, this doesn't stop me from coming back every time.

Overall, I enjoy coming back to the same meal every time and I haven't been disappointed since I started in 2015!"}
{"text":"This little Korean restaurant was packed and it was so with the wait! :) definitely really great food. We ordered number 36 of the hot pot. It comes with ham, sausage, ramen, lots of veggies, chicken, etc all in this kimchi like flavored soup. It was huge and absolutely delicious! 

The side dishes that comes with the meal were really good too! There's this radish dish that's crunchy, a little salty, picked, and a little spicy. We loved that little side dish and they were happy to give us more.

The staff here are fantastic, from helping to stabilize the table to helping us mix our hot pot to organizing our table for better eating space. They would show up just when you needed and you didn't even ever have to ask them for help. Super friendly bunch.

No wonder this place is so packed! But it's worth it :) definitely glad my cousin found this place for us to try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with a friend, so this is my review of the second time here.  Get to the restaurant early!  There was a line for lunch when I went on a Saturday (around 12:00pm) so we had to wait a little bit before we got a table.  Since it was a really hot day, we both opted for the mool naengmyun -- very good cold noodles and great portion size for the price.  If it had been a cooler day, I would've tried something else, but a hot day calls for cold noodles.  (I think the last time I came here I got the dolsot bibimbap)."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was \"Holy crap it's busy!\". It was incredibly busy at 8pm on a Tuesday night. The restaurant has a very simple and open concept layout and the air was filled with chatter and delicious smells. 

Let me be upfront and just say that it was the service that really docked marks here. This was one of the few times where we were not greeted or acknowledged the entire time we were waiting for a seat. A simple \"Welcome, for how many?\" or any variation of that was not received. In fact, we had to track down a server at the kitchen window to ask if we could get a seat or a number - this was after 10 minutes of standing at the front. Afterwards, it was a struggle to get a server to take our order and the bill. That said, the food arrives rather quickly (I believe that is where the focus for service efficiency was). 

The food was delicious and definitely won back a lot of points. We had Budae jigae Jeongol and the dumplings. If you cannot take spicy, this is probably not the dish for you. I am not great with spice but the flavour was impeccable! This is the perfect dish to have during those cold winter days. I will definitely be going back to try more!"}
{"text":"loved the gamjatang and the cold noodles here!  both are pretty delish.  just a heads up though, if you only order cold noodles, you don't get the full collection of side dishes they give out for those who order the soups or other entrees.  i was a tad sad when i only got 3 side dishes vs. 8.."}
{"text":"A fantastic traditional Korean restaurant in North York Korea town. It's popular for its cold noodles, kalbi and hot pots. The kalbi is extremely tender and packed with flavour. The cold noodles are refreshing and with the sweet soup.. it's an excellent combination. It's probably one of the best Korean restaurants I've been too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Went during the dinner rush, was seated within 20 minutes because it was that packed. My friends and I ordered neng myun, with kimchi jjim, and my fiancee ordered the chicken katsu. The portions are very generous, the neng myun broth was so refreshing with broth slush, korean pear slice, and pickled radishes. Kimchi jjim was super tender and soaked with flavour. It was worth the drive and I'm craving it again!"}
{"text":"It was one of those places that just felt authentic and homey. For a fleeting moment, I could just close my eyes, take in a whiff of the food and make myself believe that I was Korean, even though I'm not. 

We ordered a large Korean sausage platter (very tasty), a bibimbap and the hangover soup. I must say the hangover soup was the highlight. It was delicious, hearty and soothing which is exactly what you'd expect from a soup labelled as such.

I know that the restaurant is popular for its chilled noodles but when we went, it was way too cold for that. So next time (and I'll be back for sure), chilled noodles are on the menu!"}
{"text":"Koreans are the most stubborn group of people i know, especially when it comes to food. Basically the rule is if you can make it at home...make it at home. So when my Korean friends recommend a place then I know it's gonna be good 

Service is fast and efficient. However expect to become an expert in sign language as servers generally do not speak English 

Cho sun ok specializes in cold noodles. These things are fire. A good level of spicy ( spice is customizable for some dishes) and satisfying l noodle bounce you will have a mouthgasm in a faster time that it takes your ex to finish. This shit is authentic and is super refreshing on a hot day

The seafood tofu broth soup thingy was ORGASMAGICAL. Super deep and rich in flavour with a generous amount of foodstuffs mixed in.

Some dishes come with sides and others don't. Be aware 

Overall one of the best Korean restaurants available to us uptown folks"}
{"text":"My mom is Korean and we wanted to try some authentic food to start off our vacation. This place has great reviews and happen to be walking distance from our hotel so we tried it. Although it was a long wait for to the number of patrons waiting, it was well worth it! Perfect meal for a hot day!"}
{"text":"Many people have praised the cold noodles here, and it's definitely a popular joint. We arrived around 8pm on a Friday, and around 4 groups were waiting ahead of us. We were seated after 20 minutes in a nice booth. I love the clean, spacious interior, which is different from the Korean places I usually see in North York.

I ordered the naengmyun (slush broth) & galbi combo. It looked like a huge meal when served, but it ended up being the perfect amount, and great during this heat wave we're having. There were two large pieces of meat, and I loved the slight spice in the noodles. I have next to no spice tolerance, so the redness scared me at first, but it tastes great once mixed in.

Great service, good value. Overall thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant is located in a fairly small plaza and it is pretty tasty.

The noodles and broths are flavourful. The pork bone soup and the spicy broth soup (#21 and #23) are pretty good.

Although not very Korean, the chicken tonkatsu is crunchy, no grizzle, and tastes better than what you get at some Japanese restaurants.

Price is a bit higher, but the quality of food is good and the service is very helpful. It gets busy near dinner time so arrive early."}
{"text":"Love this place, but not when they're sold out of certain dishes.

One problem that this restaurant usually encounters is that they run out of stock throughout the day which can be an annoyance to customers. I remember so many times when we visited this restaurant and they either ran out of galbi tang or naengmyeon. Other than that major flaw, Cho Sun Ok is probably my favourite Korean restaurant in Toronto and I believe they serve the best tasting mul naengmyeon in this city!

Their mul naengmyeon is served in a large stainless steel bowl with the noodles in the centre and all the ingredients stacked on top. Surrounding the noodles is a cold slushy beef broth that has tangy and sweet flavours. Since the noodles can be very chewy and sometimes difficult to cut with your teeth, they offer to cut the noodles to make it easier to eat. This is the best dish to cool off in this summer heat!

The perfect accompaniment to mul naengmyeon is their Kimchi Jjim. Since the kimchi is fermented for a long time, it is full of intense flavours with a delicious sourness, making it perfect to be cooked with pork. The pork loin is braised with the aged kimchi, resulting in extremely tender and juicy meat. You will not be disappointed with this dish!

If you have yet to try Cho Sun Ok's mul naengmyeon or kimchi jjim, I highly recommend you visit soon, preferably early in the afternoon, so that you can experience these mouth-watering dishes they have to offer."}
{"text":"Great Korean restaurant in North York. I tried Korean sausage for the first time as we read about it on Yelp. For us it was just mediocre, not something I would crave to have again. 

I had the pork bone soup which was loaded with meat, as well the broth was very rich! My dining partner had the soon tofu and said it was way too spicy. Something to keep in mind when ordering it. 

Will be back for their famous cold Noodle soup in the summer!"}
{"text":"We ended up here one night when the kids were at their friend's place and we were supposed to be grocery shopping near home in Markham.  I convinced my husband to drive all the way from Markham in the opposite direction from home and our original destination to go to the Galleria Supermarket (who *doesn't* do date night in a Korean supermarket???).  On the way there, I saw the sign for Cho Sun Ok and recalled favourable reviews so we made another last minute change of plans and stopped here.  It's not often we get to try new places when the kids are with us.  Parking is tight here but we managed to find a spot.  We were seated fairly quickly only because someone had just left.  It was a full house.  My husband immediately targeted the pork bone soup with steamed mandu.  I had the Doenjang Jjigae as I'm a sucker for any stew with tofu.  The banchan is so good (except the ?fruit and potato salad? which we did try but just wasn't our thing).  The korean green peppers, I had to get seconds.  There was spicy radish or turnip, kimchi, a daikon salad (I'm guessing), eggplant and sprouts - all were good.  The staff comes around and offer you refills.

Steamed dumplings - good, they come with a nice dipping sauce but we put ours in the bubbling bowls of broth
Pork Bone Soup - my husband just loves Gamjatang and this one bubbled to the top of his list of favourites.  Spicy, rich, generous portion with a bowl of purple rice - thumbs up
Doenjang Jjigae - slightly salty for my palate but still very good, a one pepper level spice, nice soft cubes of tofu, beef, veg, broth perfect to eat with rice - also thumbs up

In total incl tip for two was $40 and we tipped well.
I picked price range of $$ to include appetizers.

One star off because it's pretty drafty in there which you really notice in the winter.

Next time:  Kimchi Jjim, for sure

FYI - we never did make it to the Galleria"}
{"text":"First time I came here I had the highly recommended cold noodles. The second time I came here I decided to try some of the other dishes.

Some of the best Korean food in the GTA. Most dishes done here are textbook, but somehow it just tastes better than other Korean restaurants.

Tried:
- galbi beef
- kimchi jjim (awesome, a must try, we had a small to share among 5 people)
- hotpot #36 \"budae jjgae jeongol\" (loved the noodles)
- soondae (traditional Korean sausage)

Everything was good. Would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for Korean food, not just the cold noodles, but other dishes as well!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not the biggest fan of cold noodles -- it confuses me; noodles being cold?!

There was only one place where I enjoyed cold noodles - and that was in Waterloo (surprisingly).

However, wow!  My world was changed after coming here.  This placed was packed on the Sunday afternoon when I went (and it was 3 PM!)  My friend ordered the seafood soondooboo and I had the nang myun with hot spicy sauce.  The seafood soondooboo was a bit too heavy on the seafood taste for me (but that's just my opinion).  The nang-myun was absolutely delicious!  It includes egg, radish/daikon, cucumbers, - and even a slice of pear.

The banchans on the side were really good as well.

If you're feeling extra hungry, you can also order it with dumplings or kalbi.  I ended up getting dumplings; but i was ultra full by the end of the meal.

I totally recommend this place if it's a hot day and you're looking for some spicy food!"}
{"text":"Loove this place for naengmyun its so delicious. Only con is that theres no meat in it but other than that everything else is on point. The noodles are perfectly chewy and the soup is super flavourful. Try to get the combo with fried mandu (usually sold out when i'm there :/).  
Their don katsu is really good as its crispy but its a tad thin. 
However their bibimbap are tasty, the bottoms never end up crispy and just ends up sticking ): not enough sesame oil? 
I often find them running out of items when i go which is sort of annoying but everything's delicious so its whatever."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, both for lunch. Found this place on blogto top Korean restaurant-I could see why. It's cleaner than a lot of other Korean restaurants, seats are comfortable, ambience is modern. Staff are friendly. They are known for their cold noodles, I'm not crazy about it (that's only bcos I'm not into cold noodles) but they are very refreshing and good-I did try it the first time I was here.  Other dishes such as kimchi pork belly were delicious.  The food might not be the best tasting Korean restaurant in town but definitely a very pleasant experience. Will be back. For those who like cold noodles, you would love this place!"}
{"text":"This review goes to the Korean cold noodles + fried dumplings. In this killer heat weather, I assume everyone will be searching for something refreshing to eat! Well, my case will be the Korean cold noodles (naengmyeon)... this dish is served in different way, such as slushy broth, spicy sauce and more.... the one I order comes with a side dish of fried dumplings which is cooked to perfection since it was sooooooo crispy! All for like 17.95$. The cold noodles broth was actually as it was stated, \"slushy broth\". The taste is fantastic! I love it, it goes so well with mustard n vinegar, I don't even find it spicy and the taste is so amazing and flavourful. The fried dumplings were really good! CAme with 8 pieces and some sauce for dipping, I really enjoyed it.

I would definitely recommend this place! It seems pretty packed when I came for lunch hour, the place itself is very noisy and you will see customer of all range of age, mostly korean. I will come back another time to try their gamjatang in the future!

They only lost a star because of their waiting area is too tiny, so if is extremely hot, u might have to wait outside when the sun is shining on u while u roast urself outside and the A/C isn't high enough lol... was hot...."}
{"text":"Can't blame this place for always being busy and they are worth the wait! Definitely our go to place in the summer for Korean cold noodles (the best in town) and another must order is the kimchi Jjim (aka pork belly with whole kimchi)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend asked her Korean boss what her favourite authentic Korean restaurant was, and she replied with Cho Sun Ok. She raved about the cold noodles so much that we had to come and try them out. 

I have never seen my girl's face light up so fast from one bite of food. If she were to ever get mad at me, I would bring her a bowl of these cold noodles as an apology and I know she would accept it with open arms. 

The soup is refreshing and flavourful with the perfect amount of spice. Its unique flavour is incomparable to any other Korean restaurant's cold noodles. The best is getting a side of galbi alongside the noodles. The warm, savoury flavour of the galbi perfectly compliments the cold tang of the soup. Truly a match made in heaven. 

The noodles are a must try on a hot summer day. Or even a cold winter day. My girlfriend could eat these noodles everyday for the rest of her life."}
{"text":"Very popular Korean restaurant just north of Steeles.. I found the parking to be very limited and the front door lacks signage. I had to park in the other plaza and my friend parked on the street. Don't come here if your group is bigger than 4 - they can make a table for 6 but that requires longer wait time. Most of the tables are for groups of 4. The menu is quite limited (and a bit on the pricier side in comparison to other Korean restaurants down the street- though it is still reasonable). I had pork bone soup ($10.99), it was pretty good. But I would say it's comparable to other places. The specialty here is cold noodles - I would come here for that but not the pork bone soup."}
{"text":"They specialize in their cold noodles, so of course we had to try it. We ended up ordering #15, Naengmyun + Dumplings ($18.95) and #23 Gamja Tang ($10.95). 

The noodles were quite chewy! The spiciness of the noodles went well with the refreshing taste of the cold noodles.  Personally, I found the noodles a bit difficult to bite apart with my teeth. They offered to cut up the noodles when they brought it to our table which I think is definitely necessary. We were given the option to have the dumplings fried or steamed. We chose fried thinking it meant pan fried, but it came deep fried. The Gamja Tang (pork bone soup) had a good amount of meat but too much perilla seeds and I found the soup wasn't as flavourful as other places. I was slightly disappointed there wasn't japchae as part of their banchan but we were given 8 banchans which was generous. The beansprouts tasted a bit bland. 

In terms of service, the place was quite crowded with about a 20 minute wait for a table on a Saturday night and it was difficult to get the attention of a waiter.  However, food came quick."}
{"text":"Pretty legit Korean restaurant. Beware that it gets busy during the prime dinner hours (on weekends mainly), and the line will sometimes be out the door.

Dropped by on a Wednesday night and we were seated immediately. Menu covers the standard Korean fare, but yes, the cold noodles are a specialty and somewhat of a novelty here. I didn't spring for this as the weather wasn't quite hot enough yet to justify it.

Instead I opted for something more boring and conventional, the dolsot bibimbap. Some other companions ordered bulgogi and soup dishes. Overall we all agreed that the dishes were excellent and very well made. The ingredients were noticeably fresher than many other Korean restaurants and the flavours were also better. One of the best bibimbaps I've had in Toronto. Even the banchan (side dishes) were of higher quality, though I was somewhat disappointed by what they had (my fault for getting used to the non-authentic stuff). I will say that their kimchi is excellent however.

Service, as with most Korean restaurants, is quite pleasant. Take note that it does seem a fair number of their servers don't actually speak English, or at least, not very well. Although the server who greeted us was fluent, it was a little bit more challenging when dealing with the one who took our order. If you are Asian and look even remotely Korean, they seem to default to speaking Korean with you first."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years and not sure if it's just me but it seems like their portions are getting a bit smaller.

This place specializes in cold noodles, and the broth is definitely full of flavor but they now have a lot more places for competition. The noodles are nice and springy. The ban chan they give is just some kim chi and vinegar dicon.

This place remains tasty, and service is quite decent but it's always packed.

I wouldn't mind coming back, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"My friend suggest to come here tonight for dinner and we gave it a try.  The restaurant is renovated and clean.  The waitresses are friendly and helpful.  For appetizers, we ordered chapsal soondae - Korean style sauage, tangsooyook  - sweet and sour pork, and jjinmandu - steamed dumplings.  They all taste great.  The sausage looks like Chinese sausage but of course they are differently made.  The sweet and sour pork and dumpling are pretty standard and nothing spectacular.  We also ordered the pork bone soup with rice and dolsot bibimbap - rice top with vegetables, beef and egg.  The pork bone soup is good and very favourable and lots of meat.  The bibimbap is lacking the beef.  Mostly are vegetables and I don't think it's worth ordering it.  Maybe is our first time here and didn't know what to order.  I see other table order some good food.  I will definitely come again and try out different food."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean restaurant in Toronto. If you like Korean food, must try before leaving Toronto."}
{"text":"Craving Korean food but it's a hot, sweaty day? Have no fear, Cho Sun Ok's cold noodles are here! 

Cho Sun Ok specializes in MOOL NAENGMYUN  which are cold, chewy arrowroot noodles in a tangy icy beef broth. Trust me, I was sceptical about cold noodles - I'm more of a piping hot bowl of noodles kind of gal but man, I'm a believer now. We ordered the Mool Naengmyun option with Galbi  ($17.95)

We also got a DONKATSU ($9.95) and were pleasantly surprised when two HUGE pieces of crispy pork were placed infront of us. I kid you not, they are VERY generous with their servings.

Lastly, we ordered the BUL NAK JEONGOL ($29.95) Onions, green onions, cabbage, squid and bulgogi served in a spicy beef broth in a hot pot topped with glass noodles. This is our absolute favourite Korean comfort food even if it's a boiling hot day outside. We were a little disappointed as it is a very small portion in comparison to Oh Geul Boh Geul but the flavours were there and it was still very yummy :)

Skip the hot pot orders but the cold noodles are a definite recommend!!"}
{"text":"Everything here is A Okay. Got the pork bone soup. Lots of meat. Liked the soup here more than other places because the soup was not as salty. The kicker here is the Candy they give you as a dessert at the end. I'm guessing its a Korean type of candy. Its just as hard as a jawbreaker and its the same spherical shape and the outer layer is sprinkled with crushed nuts I think. I've tried looking for this candy in all the Korean grocery stores but with no luck. I wish I hadn't thrown out the wrapper. If anyone knows where to find this candy then please let me know where I can buy them."}
{"text":"Their food is high standard (prices reflect that). I compared their Soon Dae ($13) to Owl of Minerva (Thursday special, $6.99) and even though it's like double the price, I would go back to Cho Sun Ok and ordered theirs. It's a lot juicer and tastier!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, located @ Yonge & Clark up in Thornhill. They were recently covered in the Toronto Star for their Naeng Myeon. If you didn't see it here, then you would have driving right past it; it's located in the Tavazo Nut Plaza; between the Britannia pub and dingy looking Nail One place.

Cho Sun Ok was surprisingly packed; with a steady enough turnover. But their Cold noodle soup is pretty darn good and filling. The boyfriend, our mutual friend and I made a bee-line for the cold noodles; due to the hot weather. 

The boyfriend ordered the cold noodles with dumpling set, which came with 12 fried/steamed dumplings; I went for the typical cold noodles and kalbi set; our mutual friend went for the spicy cold noodles with raw skate in it. 

The Naeng Myeon itself was pretty excellent, with a slushy broth versus then a chunky block of ice normally seen at other korean restaurants. The noodles texture is how I liked it, chewy and hefty and didn't feel slimy. Although the Kalbi, I would give it a miss. But the dumplings were good and our mutual friend went and said that the cold noodles hit his craving spot for cold noodles.

The servings were pretty hefty and quite frankly, if they had skipped out on the usual banchan dishes, I would have been full up as well.  

The service was pretty great, the server came by and refilled the Kimchi for us, without us having to ask. They did speak to us in Korean first, but it was helpful that they confirmed the order by circling the corresponding order number on the place mat menus.

Parking is somewhat limited, but you might want to park @ the Paramount Fine Foods plaza next door and walk over. 

Cho Sun Ok takes Visa and Mastercard, no AMEX"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly clean and bustling with customers when I came this weekend! Each of the tables have their own individual booths where customers can enjoy a private conversation with each other but the overall mood of this place can get a bit loud. I can tell that this place has been recently renovated and I am definitely digging the new setup. 

We got the pork bone soup and their famous cold noodles. Both of which for lunch on a weekend is abit above 10 dollars each. 

This meal included a set of 8 individual little side dishes each with incredibly small portion of appetizer compared to the standard Korean restaurants, however they all tasted fresh and the waitress did ask us if we wanted more during the meal which we appreciated. 

Despite being the winter, we still loved having a dish of cold noodles.  These came with cucumbers, eggs and radish. I was hoping for some sort of protein but the overall taste of this dish was good, the broth was refreshing and had more flavours than some of the other places I have been to. Adding mustard and vinegar to the dish helps elevate the taste of the dish while adding more dimensions to it which I often like. 

The pork bone soup came with alot of peppercorn looking spices sprinkled generously on the top but the dish was not spicy whatsoever. In fact I found it to be more on the salty side compared to the many places I have been to. There was a generous serving of meat in the dish but I still think the meal offered at OGBG was better. 

Overall I think cho sun ok was alright. I just wish they have the ringer on the side of the table to ask for a waitress. The price is a little more than the standard Korean joint but the establishment is spanking clean. Too bad I forgot to check out their washroom before heading out. Haha"}
{"text":"Ok ok ok! This place is always packed from when it opens to when it closes! I've never been here during it's closing time so maybe it's not packed? Although I would assume this place is packed regardless due to its amazing food! The service is good, but sometimes forgetful as they have a lot of customers to deal with! The food here is amazing! Their specialty is the cold noodles, but the other food they have is really good! I usually order the pork bone soup, but I also get the pork cutlet on rice. They are giant sized portions and the purple rice, which is freaking deeeelicious! They have specific side dishes so if you order just cold noodles then you get a certain set. If you order pork bone soup you get the other set. Also refills for side dishes are limited. I don't know how *limited* it could be as I've never refilled them at this restaurant. 

I do know if you go right as it opens at 11:30 you'll see it get super packed by 11:45."}
{"text":"Arrived on a friday evening and luckily did not have to wait to be seated. The place was packed and i expected to be waiting for a table. 

Probably the best customer service ive had at a Korean restaurant. Food came out very quick and store owner came to greet each table. I ordered the naengmyeon noodles. I recommend getting the combo which comes with kalbi for $22. Chicken katsu portions were excellent however i didnt personally like the sauce it came with. Delicious cold noodles in a flavourful broth and will definitely be returning for authentic korean food."}
{"text":"I've had such mixed reviews of this place and it really is a hit or miss unfortunately.  The second time I came here was a couple weeks ago and the son was in charge that day.  He is the quintessential reason as to why you need to give millennials a chance in the workforce because he alone gave me a five star experience.  We both ordered the cold noodles with kalbi (which mind you, is not a cheap item) but we only had two side dishes.  Now, I know the \"tradition\" is that we have less side dishes with these noodles BUT on the same token, if side dishes are free, I feel we should be entitled to them upon request.  Also, I'm not Korean and I really enjoy side dishes...so when I go to a Korean restaurant, that's what I get an enjoyable experience out of.  Afterall, your restaurant should be customer service oriented and cater to the customer.  

When we asked the millennial son, he explained to us that he was concerned about food wastage but that he'd give it to us.  We agreed and promised we'd eat it all and we did.  The side dishes were delicious.  We had a great experience and I even told my boyfriend how wonderful the restaurant was now that it's changed and no longer the old man running it. 

We came here again on Saturday night and the old man was back.  We should have known better than to stay.  This time, we ordered two cold noodles again and they gave us the meager two side dishes and knowing what their son had told us last time, we requested for them again.  After a huge ordeal with one staff member talking to another and finally the old man coming out and telling us that we just simply couldn't have them because it was based on culture, we told them to forget it and just let us eat in peace.  They must have known that we were pissed because he kept checking back to see if everything was okay but I was so irritated I couldn't even take him seriously.  

Overall, the service alone that the person owning/running the place exhibited was just ridiculous and deserves less than the two stars I am giving them.  Luckily, the son has redeemed some stars back based on my second experience.  Giving me an explanation of \"because that's just the way it's always been\" is not satisfactory to my mind and you should have given a better justification as to why I couldn't have those side dishes.  It makes no sense.  Next time, I'm just going to order the cheapest entree on the menu that entitles me to all those side dishes if that's the way they want to play."}
{"text":"By far my favourite Korean restaurant! The cold noodles are delicious accompanied with the dumplings a perfect pairing.  Just enough to leave satiated and happy.  I also love the tofu soup in the winter.  Definitely recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Best cold noodles ever!!! I live in New York now and and cannot find any restaurant that can even compare to this one  which is odd since there's a large population of Koreans over here... I have to fly back every three months to eat here"}
{"text":"Sunday Feb 14th. The restaurant was full at 1:30pm. 
They do not take reservation for weekends and holidays.  Tables are either for 4 people or 6 people. If you have a big party, then make sure that you go during non peak hours, as this is a very busy restaurant. 

Service - acceptable. They are so busy, so don't expect excellent customer service or the waitress would refill your tea automatically. 

Food - Don Katau must be one of the most popular items there as i saw many people have ordered it. Yes, I like it too.. Definitely one of the best Don Katsu in town. Fresh and crispy!! The pork chop is very very thin, so you don't really taste the pork , but I like it!!! Kimchi Jjim is also very yummy....the pork belly is so tender that it melts in your mouth...haha... the Kimchi portion is also very good... 

Price is decent, pretty much align with other Korean restaurants in town..
Don't ask for the bill, you have to pay at the front cashier after the meal.


This is a restaurant that i would definitely recommend to friends and family!!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the wait time was ridiculous. Service was busy. I'd come back happily if there wasn't such a long wait. Also very crowded And noisy. 

I prefer nearby song cooks for Korean."}
{"text":"Really fresh and solid menu.  Infamous for their cold noodles which I love on a hot day.   I tried just about every of their other dish and they are all delicious. Pork Bone soup was not overly seasoned like many Korean restaurants - light and hearty.   Hot stone bibimbap is served with freshest vegetables, unlike other Korean restaurants on Yonge and Finch.  My favorite is their Beef Flank bibimbap.   Also had their other infamous dish ~ the pork belly served with kimchi.  I don't eat pork belly normally for fear of it tasting the fat, but I don't taste the fat at all.   The fatty part actually taste like collagen or tendon-texture.  Soo good!  


I always try to go off-hours as it can get super busy during prime time and especially on weekends.   

By far,  my most favorite Korean restaurant in North York."}
{"text":"A snowy Saturday night in April! 
Ordered naengmyun + galbi and jangjorim beef flank bibimbap
The slushy broth is refreshing with a touch spicy kick to it. Nice chew to the noodles in a flavourful icy broth. The galbi had a nice amount of fat to it - delicious! The scissors make cutting through them like a breeze. Will definitely order it again!
Bibimbap was a generous serving.
Assortment of side dishes - really liked the eggplant and the radishes. 
Price seems comparable to the other Korean restaurants in the area.
There was a small lineup - came at 6:30pm hoping to beat the rush. Moment we came, a nice lady waiting in line told us we had to go to the front for a number. 
25 minutes wait then we were seated. Pretty quick turnaround. 
They give each person a piece of candy to end off the dinner."}
{"text":"Came here late afternoon near the end of summer to try the cold noodles! We were really satisfied with our visit and it was definately worth the 25 minute wait. 

The cold noodles were really nice, the broth was flavorful and the portion was massive. The banchan that came with our meal were fresh and delicious. The waitresses were really friendly and patient even though they kept forgetting that we didn't speak Korean. 

Can the weather warm up already so I can come back for some cold noodles?"}
{"text":"Just ate here and I left very full and satisfied!
Had the cold noodles with Kalbi and my boyfriend had the bulgoki
First time having cold noodles and they were DELICIOUS!
The side dishes were also great! Very tasty kimchi. There were a few others I really liked but I have no clue what they are
The service was quick and efficient and they refilled the side dishes very quickly; some without us even asking!
The service and food were great and I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cho Sun Ok is in the middle of an otherwise unassuming plaza with a pub and convenience; not the kind of place I expect to find gourmet Korean fare. And gourmet it was not. Plenty of dishes served in large metal mixing bowls was not a good sign.

But the food....the food here is great. Especially if you dine on the swine, otherwise the menu is quite limited. The fried dumplings...amazing. I ordered dumplings with cold noodle, the former were so good we ordered a whole extra plate (and debated another for taking home) and the latter, while probably \"authentic\" as others might be able to describe with greater background, came in one of the aforementioned metal bowls and despite my wishes not to include the ice chips sitting in the side of the bowl with the remainder of the dish, the waitress came over and turned my nicely laid-out dinner into a mash of ice-cold noodle and bits of veggie and egg.

Large bowls of soup appeared on other tables- pork bone soup with different meats (including organ meat) and veggie options seemed to comprise a good third of the menu.

Definitely not for those who don't know this cuisine well or are willing to give it more than a basic try."}
{"text":"Still just as good the second time 'round!

This time, instead of the arrowroot noodles with icy broth, I opted for the traditional Yukgaejang (Beef Brisket Soup), $8.95 for dinner portion.  In all honesty, the thought of handling/sucking on bones was too exhausting, so I just got the beef version out of utter laziness.

However, I did convince my friend, a Cho Sun Ok virgin, to get their signature dish with Kalbi.  The Tofu Bibimbap was also ordered and I believe that that dish was veggie.  All dishes came with purple rice and approx. 8 side dishes.  

Everything was tasty.  Kalbi could be marinated longer, but it wasn't fatty/chewy like lotsa places.  Yukgaejang was homey and deceivingly very filling, so bring your appetite!  

At one point, male owner (??) did come around to ask how everything was, asked if we needed any refills on our banchans.  I thought this was a very nice touch.

Aside from their signature arrowroot noodles, what sets Cho Sun Ok apart from the other numerous Korean places that are just south is that the atmosphere is slightly nicer, it's small (maybe 10 small tables), but certainly not divey by any means!  Service is also pleasant.

Tip:  There is a private lot, so no need to worry!"}
{"text":"Great food. A tad expensive but for two people, we ordered appetizer and a hotpot for 2, it was $47. But we had lots of left over. So it could have fed 3 people.

What sucks is during a busy night, they tend to get disorganized. They aren't very good at managing flute of customers."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to go during the winter for their Korean hot pot, and summer for their cold noodles. 

(According to my Korean friends) the food here is very authentic compared to many or most of the Korean restaurants in North York. 

It is owned by Koreans and the customer service is awesome. I am very indecisive and they have always been patient with helping me choose what to get.

The price might seem a bit high but you get a decent portion. The hot pot is more than enough for a party of 2. 

Go early for dinner (before 6pm) or there will be a very long line up!"}
{"text":"Favourite Korean food in the York region we have tried. Strongly recommend the hotpot and cold noodles!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place where I'd go if I'm craving for traditional Korean food. Parking is a bit difficult especially when they get very busy at dinner time. Do expect a long lineup for a seat but their great food makes none of their issues significant."}
{"text":"We were (past tense) regulars for a long time.  No doubt, their kimchi jjim is exceptional.  BUT --- overworked, tired, harassed and seriously unhappy wait staff.  Spouse and I ordered chapsal sundae and two nyengmyeons and the waitress gave us only two panchans.  Her rationale was it was because we were ordering nyengmyeon.  Hello!!!  People next to us did not even order the chapsal sundae and had full panchan.  Hmmm ... wonder why.  Anyhow, too bad that they focus on the unimportant which forces people to go somewhere else.  Owner's wife oversees the kitchen, the husband is in charge of the desk/restaurant.  As good as their kimchi jjim is, there are several other places in Toronto who prepare it well.  They need to focus on their customer service as WELL.  (I earlier reviewed this as another restaurant - got confused with the name).  These waitresses are enough to give anyone indigestion."}
{"text":"Very crowed and busy, just the sign of an authentic korean restaurantm Prices were jacked up after renos a couple years ago but food is pretty good nontheless."}
{"text":"I had the classic cold noodles and it blew my mind! This is actually the first time I've had cold noodles and was surprised of how tasty a meal can be cold and chilled in ice. But this was really good, the soup base was delicious and it was perfectly seasoned to match the taste of the noodles, the egg and the vegetables in the dish. The noodles were really chewy, a bit more chewy than I imagined but I guess it's part of the experience and I can imagine why that texture could be enjoyable. It's just something I'm not really used to. Our food came out really fast because if you get cold noodles, they're usually always making them because they're so popular. It's so nice to have these cold noodles in the summer!

This place is really packed, all the time I've heard and it was no exception when we came. We came around 7 and finally got seated around 8. Also they don't have a lot of options on their menu compared to other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"They continue to grow and it is impossible to get a seat without waiting in line.
Food is fantastic, even in Korean standards.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Since my bestie and I were talking about Korean food one late, hungry evening, I have decided to bring him to Cho Sun Ok (???) on Yonge Street, one of my favourite Korean restaurants in the area :)

Walking in, I noticed that Cho Sun Ok has newly renovated - it looked much more modern with a white finish and with great lighting. I also loved the semi-private wooden booths! It was very busy that evening, considered it was a Thursday night. Parking was VERY limited - shared a tiny parking lot with other restaurants and shops. I hope we didn't park illegally lol.

I've been here before and this restaurant always had a small menu selection, which I appreciate because I have decidophobia lol. I really enjoyed their specialty cold arrowroot noodles #delicious! It was quite an experience to have icy cold broth noodles on a hot summer day. The individual soon tofu hot pot was amazing too, the hot sizzling broth was very tasty and it also comes with a bowl of rice.

Since it is still the middle of winter, we have decided to shared the marinated beef with baby octopus hot pot for 2 people. It was served on a portable hot pot stove top. The meal also came with 2 bowls of red/purple grain rice and 7 small appetizers. It was very hearty and filling #stuffedourfaces lol.

Overall, delicious food, courteous service, very clean and well maintained restaurant. One of my fave go-to places indeed :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. We wondered into Cho Sun Ok about 4 years ago and today we still choose to wonder into this restaurant. Reason being, their slushy cold noodles are just so so so good! 

The perfect bite of slush to broth to noodle to spice ratio is just unbeatable. It's flavour is on point at every single visit and even more desirable during the hot summer months. I must also mention that their pork belly with kimchi and don katsu are exceptional. 

Wrapping that tender piece of pork belly in a kimchi sandwich is your best bet for spice and sour. This is a spicier dish so beware! Keep your tea close by. The katsu is just so perfectly fried and flavoured. They provide you with the sauce already on it, so no extra work for you. 

Remember to pick up a ticket at the cashier window whenever there is a line (basically every dinner), you don't wanna be waiting and have no service. 

I will continue to wonder into Cho Sun Ok so long I'm a Canadian resident!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome Korean restaurant for noodles and hot pot. It's located in a strip mall off Yonge Street. The interior is sleek and no-frills - not a great ambiance for date night, but it works for a casual dinner out. The staff is all super friendly. They explained the dishes to us and taught us how to operate the hot pot.

We shared the soondae jeongol, a slightly spicy hot pot dish with Korean sausage and other pig organs. It was delicious and super filling. Like most Korean restaurants, you get banchan (assorted side dishes, such as kimchi) with your meal. We liked some and disliked others, but they were all still fun to sample. We also ordered the jjinmandu (steamed dumplings) as an appetizer, thinking we'd eat them while we waited. But our hot pot actually came out first, and we didn't end up needing the extra food. So although they were also tasty, I'd recommend against the appetizers, unless you're extremely hungry.

This was overall a fun experience and a great meal. If you're craving some Korean food, stop by Cho Sun Ok for an authentic and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Must try: Naenmyun + Galbi

This is hands down my favourite Korean restaurant. I had the cold noodles here, and actually wanted to cry in frustration when I tried it at another place. I'm 100% sure this is the only place I'm getting my cold noodles. The flavour of the broth is so hard to describe, but so refreshing and addicting. The beef ribs are marinated well and bbqed to a smokey tenderness, washing it down with the cold broth is really the best and only combination. 

I have also tried the chicken cutlets, the tofu soup, and other soup dishes, all excellent and incomparable. 

There is usually a line, so come during off hours or expect to wait. All good things come to those who wait I guess. 

WYWH"}
{"text":"Despite having heard good things about this place, the first two times I didn't bother to wait when I saw a huge line forming inside and all the way out of the restaurant. 

I finally got to try this place, and I can say their cold noodles (Nang Myun) are one of the most authentic ones I've ever had in Toronto. I had Mool Nang Myun (cold noodles with slushy broth), and it was super tasty! I don't usually like having red hot pepper stuff in Mool Nang Myun. I tend to like my broth clear, but despite that, I found this dish very good. I got the Mool Nang Myun and Kalbi (marinated beef short ribs) combo; and unfortunately, Kalbi was just okay. I know a ton of Korean restaurants, which can serve better Kalbi. We also got six or seven complimentary side dishes. I tried about four of them and all of them tasted great. I'd recommend this place for their cold noodles. This place was sooo busy, and the service was pretty much non-existent. It's an extremely busy place, and they do not take a reservation, so expect a wait. We were lucky that the wait was only ten minutes."}
{"text":"Cho Sun Ok is a very solid and popular Korean restaurant. At the same time, it is very busy and you always see lineup and crowd. When you get in, remember to get a number from the front desk. Service is very quick and friendly.

I always order these dishes: Hot Stone bowl rice (Dolsot Bibimbap), Pork Cutlet rice, Cold noodles with L.A. Kalbi, Seafood Tofu Soup. For big group, get the Seafood (baby octopus) hot pot, sweet and sour fried pork.

If you are open to traditional Korean dishes, blood sausage (soondae) and kimchi pork belly (jjim). 

My family always have a satisfied meal there. Otherwise than the crowd, I would love to go back if possible."}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelp for recommending a place when we were in the area. Great little Korean spot away from the hustle and bustle of Yonge and Finch...

We were greeted right away and seated to a comfortable booth. The restaurant is really clean, and by the looks of all the chairs in the front, it can get really busy. By the time we were finished our lunch almost every table was seated. 

The menu comes on a paper placemat, and utensils are at the table in a little wooden box. 

Huge portions for the Don katsu, and it was delicious. Way too much for lunch, but enjoyed the leftovers at home afterwards. Big selection of kimchi, and the tea they serve was delicious.

Service was great, they got a bit busy when we needed the settle up, but overall great!

Will return if we're in the area!"}
{"text":"Went there in a Friday and it wasn't too busy. Likely because it was cool out. The cold noodles as advertised was delicious but everything else was average at best. The galbi was slightly below average. Though the service was sub par, as we had to wait to be seated even though there was open seats, and the servers didn't pay attention to us at all and was difficult to get their attention. 

Overall come for the cold noodles as they are worth a visit for but everything else there are better Korean places."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants away from the Yonge/Finch area, very nicely decorated and good service.  My personal favourite dishes here are the black bean noodles and the dol-sot bibimbap.  My friends come here for the cold noodles and really likes them, but that's not my cup of tea. 

Side dishes were all very tasty but they didn't refill them for us (we didn't ask though). We've been here a few times and they've been pretty consistent.  Sometimes they get really busy."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is hands down one of my favorite recent Korean discoveries.  They have a short menu with a few very well done simple dishes.  The star is definitely the Naengmyun (cold noodles).  We had the Mool Naengmyun.  It was excellent.  I also had the Galbi Tang (stewed beef short ribs in a clear broth).  It was also simple (just ribs, broth and green onion) and excellent.  Some of the dishes are a little salty and they use a lot (and I mean a LOT) of garlic but I loved it!  And no--they do not recycle side dishes like some cheaper Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Cho Sun GREAT - not just OK.

The food here is way better than that awful pun. The menu is very simple and straightforward; not too overwhelming. 

This restaurant is busy most of the time and parking is limited. Make sure to show up well in advance to wait for seats. If you can't find parking, go to a neighbouring lot and walk over. 

Let me get this out of the way - I'm a big fan of naengmyun so I'm a little picky. So it should speak volumes that I come here relatively frequently. 

The group of us ordered the naengmyun, dumplings, yukgaejang, bibimbap, and tofu soup. I really enjoyed the naengmyun with spicy sauce. You REALLY need to order it with spicy sauce. It tastes MUCH better. Trust me. I got the deep fried dumplings arrived first, and then the side dishes came out. The dumplings and naengmyun together are quite filling and I left pretty satisfied. The price of this dish is pretty reasonable as well. 

My friends didn't have any complaints about the other dishes, but come on it is known for the naengmyun! 

This is a great place to eat during the summer for a cool meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"2.5 is my rating.
I would give it a 3, but judging how I was slightly disappointed by my last few visits I'm bumping it down considering the food was just ok at my last visit, and the service was horrible at my prior visit.
I swear they keep increasing the prices here, and I sort of feel like the food is going downhill.

Pork belly with Aged Kimchi ($15.95 for small size)
My brother always orders this dish when he comes. This place is known for their aged kimchi which is supposed to be aged for like 20 years or something? I can't say whether it's true or not, but I can say it does taste different and really drenched in flavor. The pork belly is good, the meat is soft and tender. The small is a good portion for one person, comes with rice as well. But is it worth the price? Not so much in my opinion.

Gamjatang ($10.95 for dinner) 
This did not taste good at my last visit. Even just looking at the picture you can tell this does not look spicy at all. There is a decent amount of pork, lots of meat and the soup tasted good, just wasn't spicy. 

They were however generous with the side dishes. I remember at my last visit about 6 months ago, they only served my table 2 side dishes. When I asked for more and a variety of others just like the table beside me, the waitress came back and said no, you only get specific side dishes based on what you order. Like really? Don't think it would hurt if you offered me more considering you can get free refills for side dishes."}
{"text":"If you're Korean and you don't agree that this place is one of the best in Toronto to go for Korean food, you're lying to yourself. 

First of all their cold noodles are famous! The one with broth and spicy sauce are both worth trying. I personally like the spicy sauce better and they give you a side of hot soup on the side to bring down the heat. The galbi combo with cold noodles is the best in my opinion over the dumpling combo. 

Their soondae which is traditional sausage comes with some salt and spice you dip it in, it comes hot and fresh! Also a must when you come here. 

I've had their soy bean paste soup as well and it was one of the best I've had. Their dumplings are great fillers, you can get them steamed of fried, great either way.

That's all I've had off their menu. Everything I've tried is tasty and I'm sure there will be a lot of other great things on the menu. I heard their kimchi Jim, katsu dishes and their soon tofu soup are also all tasty! It gets incredibly busy here evenings and weekends. Be prepared to get a number and wait during rushes. I think it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Busy but it's always worth the wait. It has, hands down, the best cold noodles in town, and its Korean sausage soup is literally unmatched in quality by the ones I have tried from other Korean restaurants. Went a few times before the renovation when it was smaller. I started going here again a few months ago, and it seems to have gotten bigger and busier. No reservations on weekends, so arrive early if you want to eat on time."}
{"text":"The food at this place is good but the service is so shit. Literally we just sat down and she asked what we wanted to eat (didn't even greet us or smile).. I didn't even have the chance to look at the menu so we asked for a few more minutes first...literally 2 secs later she comes back asking what we want. Terrible service. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"My sister found this restaurant in Thornhill on Yelp. It has pretty good ratings so we thought we would give it a try. Got there on a Saturday at 6:30pm and the place was rammed with people. They had a pretty good system where they gave you a paper number and you wait for your table. It took us 30 mins to get our table. We ordered the fried dumpling as an appetizer. It was good not amazing.  Then my girls shared the chicken katsu which I have to admit had a lot of chicken. However for $17 I would expect nothing less. It was crispy and not dry. My sister and I ordered the pork bone soup. It was more expensive than the pork bone soup you get at Yonge and Finch and Korean town at $13 an order.  It was tasty and they gave you 4 big pieces of pork bone. There was plenty of side dishes and free refills.  Service was excellent. Although the line ups was all the the way outside the door the staff not once rushed us. We really like that. Also the owner took his time to come by and asked us if everything was ok and if we need anymore side dishes which is not normal for an asian restaurant. It was a nice added touch.  The food was typical Korean food and the quality was good however nothing stood out from all the other Korean restaurants I've been to. I would say its priced higher than other Korean restaurants.  Although the service was excellent I took off one star because I was not blown away by the food and it was quite expensive. But I would definitely come back again but only if i don't have to line up."}

Cho Sun Ok

Had a craving for Korean food, and was away from our usual spots, so we gave this place a shot.

FOOD:

This place has a decent selection of typical Korean fare, from stone bowl, to cold noodles, rice dishes, and an assortment of hot pot options. I wasn't feeling particularly adventurous on this night, so I went with the safe bet in the Pork Bone Soup. Now I have to say that this place uses WAY too many peppercorns in this dish...I mean an unnecessary amount. Nonetheless, the soup was nice and spicy, and the bone had just enough pork to satisfy me. Most meals come with the standard sides that the servers happily re-fill on request.

SERVICE:

Although they were quite busy, the food came out expectantly fast. You won't get too many servers in East Asian restos who are particularly gabby, but they were attentive for sure. A man who appeared to be the owner of the restaurant was friendly, and seemed quite on top of things in terms of directing traffic.

ATMOSPHERE:

The spacing here is not bad, which allows them to accommodate many folk without getting too jammed in. We were lucky enough to beat a late rush though, and a line did start to form. Unlike some Korean restos, we didn't leave the place stinking of smoke and spice - so bonus points for good a ventilation system!

VERDICT:

I'll be back for what will hopefully be LESS peppercorns!"}
{"text":"As we drove by the restaurant, my friend told us how great the cold noodles there was and we ended up turning around to have an afternoon snack. Although it was around 3 in the afternoon, the place still had a line up and we had to get a number and wait for about 15 to 20 minutes before we were seated. They have free wifi and they post the code in the waiting area so if you're data-less and friendless (or are out with friends who would rather chat on their phone or read fb updates than talk to you) you could still be entertained. 

After we were seated and I opened the menu, I realized that the noodles were not just cold dry noodles, but with cold soup. And then i saw that they called it slushy noodles and i wondered whether it was a translation issue...i mean, do they know what slushy means? 

When the slushy noodles arrived, I realized I was just uncultured. Apparently the noodles do come in soup that's in icee form and it's a popular dish in Korea. I was not ready for this though, the spicy salty taste of Korean flavours in the texture of slush gave my brain some confusion. The soup flavour was so good, but the texture is still too disconcerting for me. I'm just going to have to go back on a hot summer day and give it another try. 

Seriously, people need to try this if they have not already - not cold noodles, but slushy soup noodles!"}
{"text":"One of my fav places to go for Korean food.

This place is always busy....

I like the banchan selection there!  I had a few things there.

Slushy cold noodles -- the broth/slush taste was amazing!!  Presentation is nice, the only thing I don't like it, it only comes with 2 types of banchan if I order this...so if I am eating solo, I could not try other banchans :(

Soon Tofu -- was good!!!  I like it a lot.

Pork Bone Soup -- also very good~  I don't have other words than good LOL.

Kimchi pork -- this one is AMAZING!  I really like the taste of cooked kimchi, and the pork.  The small portion is still quite big, I usually ended up packing some home.  

Don Katsu -- not so good. It's too thin, but I guess that's korean style.

I love this place and will definitely return many times."}
{"text":"Very authentic Korean dinner from the tea, to the complimentary appetizer plates, the size of main course dishes, to the steamed purple rice. We had the LA galbi beef and the pork don katsu. For the class of food, ten min wait time, and dining service, this is as good as it gets. Expect lots of noise because, you know, it is what you will experience in a family restaurant. :)

*not wheelchair accessible but challenging for people with walkers/canes due to elevated step at the front door."}
{"text":"I like Cho Sun Ok. It is a good spot for cold naengmyun and galbi. But I would put it as A-OK. The galbi is good, although the marinade can be a little bland. The naengmyun is a hard one to gauge, as there aren't many places that specialize in naengmyun in Toronto. It's good here, but the broth is a bit more sour and a bit less flavorful than I'd like. When I get a hankering for cold noodles, I will think of this place. I don't hanker for it often though."}
{"text":"This is not a new establishment, as it has been around for years. I was very surprised how cleanliness of the restaurant. Excellent quality Korean food. It was packed with Koreans - this says a lot!! All the items looked delicious and the Korean snitzel and the spicy kimchi hotspot with ham, sausage, instant noodles and rice cakes was very tasty without MSG. Loved it!! Definitely will be going back every other week to fulfill my cravings...nummmmm"}
{"text":"Glad they have a time stamp on their lineup ticket, so that i know for certain we waited over 40mins for a table.  Have to give myself the credit for being patient.  It is not that they don't have tables, but it is just they don't have enough staff to clean it up in time.  It took so long that, Guys are actually sleeping at the waiting area.
We had been here before, but didn't find it special.  after some reading on the advices for ordering, also today being a hot day, I decided to try the cold noodle(naengmyun)+galbi.  my partner is ordering soon tofu as usual...
Not going to claim that I'm expert in Korean spices,  but I've to say, the kimchi side dish is very good.  Don't know how u qualifies what is a good cold noodle, all I can say is not bad.  I wouldn't mind eating it again.  The soon tofu, is good as compare to many other Korean restaurant we've tried.
Overall, 3 min to figure out the we should've picked up a ticket for the lineup, 40 min wait, 10 min to wait for ordering 10 min wait for food, 20 min meal time.... Walking over to the cashier makes the paying a lot faster.  So u get the idea.... Wait."}
{"text":"There's noodles its really good but expensive than other restaurants, Also the Kimchi was good. It's really like home made food but too far from young street."}
{"text":"Cold Weather! Soon Tofu Hot Pot Season! 

Warm Weather! Cold Noodles Season! 

I have been driving by Cho Sun Ok numerous of time... snowing, cold... and thinking of the icy cold broth just made my heart turned icy and cold too! 

Finally, when everyone start wearing their short sleeves and I even saw some legs... I know the time has come! 

Arrowroot Noodles in Icy Broth ($8.95) 
- Remind me of Shaved Ice dessert!! 
- I demand not to have my noodle cut so I can take a good photos.. and I like how they were bundled together waiting for me to slurp them up! 
- Arrowshoot noodle were chewy and have great bite and suppose to be health too? 
- No meat at all but a half boiled eggs, cucumber, pickled turnips and pears... 

The deco of Cho Sun Ok reminds me of a HK Style Cafe restaurant, so I fitted right in! And surprising some of the waitress can speak both Mandarin and Korean too!! 

Lunch Specials from 11 - 3 Monday to Friday, which has a few items that are a $1 cheaper than dinner hours. 

Korean Sausage made from pig organs and intestine cooked in a spicy broth with more pig organs is one of the choice on the menu... if you really want to make your cholesterol level go higher.. that might be a good choice!"}
{"text":"Have had lunch here a few times. Always left completely full. Some interesting items on the menu. The spam hot pot was amazing ! Cold noodles are popular these days but an acquired taste for a Canadian guy."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend and his girlfriend for dinner, and they recommended this place. Cho Sun Ok specializes in cold noodles. Except I don't like cold noodles, so I opted for my favourite Korean dish - the Kalbi ($22.99). The beef rib was tender and slightly charred. I really enjoyed it, and the portion was pretty good for the price. The bachan was decent, but I wished the kimchi was a lot more spicier. At least they had fish cakes, but they ran out of it by 7 pm. Not sure if the waitress was lying though to limit one bachan dish per table, since I saw new patrons enjoying the fish cakes."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday night with several friends for Korean. I've never been to Cho Sun Ok before but have heard so much about this place. So, I was going in with pretty high expectations.

The restaurant is located in a small plaza near Yonge and Clarke. Parking was a bit scarce but I managed to find a parking spot well enough. The restaurant looked fairly busy for a Tuesday night but there were still tables readily available. 

I happily noticed upon entry that the restaurant was well-lit, clean, and that there were many servers ready and willing to serve!

Since I ate with a large group, we were able to order a variety of dishes from the menu. Rather than listing all the dishes that were on the table, I'll provide some highlights of the meal and particular dishes you may want to try.

On the appetizer menu, I'd likely skip all of these items other than the Korean Sausage dish (Soondae), and would recommend going for this appetizer version of the Soondae if you just want to try it, rather than going for the full blown stewed Soondae with noodles (Soondae Jeongol). Needless to say, the Soondae is a bit of an acquired taste, so just be aware of that.

The Naeng Myun is a must, and if I were only able to order one dish from the menu, this would be it. The cold noodles is quite tasty and refreshing and the dish itself is unique. I'd recommend going with the Mool Naeng Myun + BBQ Short Rib (Galbi) combo that's available -- the Galbi was seasoned well and tender, it won't disappoint.

On the entree menu, I'd go with the Pork Belly and Kimchi dish (Kimchi jjim), Pork Bone Soup (Gamja tang; a classic), any of the rice (Bibimbap) if you intend to get a rice, and the BBQ ribs (Galbi) if you haven't already placed an order for it. Other items on this menu didn't really stand out as much to me, but I wouldn't hesitate to agree that they're on par with similar dishes at other Korean restaurants in the area.

If you're with a larger group of people (2+), I'd recommend opting for Jeongol version of the stews mentioned in the entree section as it provides a larger portion. Again, I'd go for the Pork Bone (Gamja Tang Jeongol) if you're playing it safe, or the Pork Belly and Kimchi (Kimchi Jjim Jeongol). I wouldn't order any of the two Korean Sausage Jeongol (Soondae Jeongol) if this is your first go at Korean Sausage (Soondae).

Overall, the food was very good, the place was clean and welcoming, and the service was friendly, plentiful, and efficient (on a Tuesday night). Parking spaces are a bit scarce but was available at no cost.

COOL TIP: You will leave the place smelling like the food you ordered, so if you have an expensive jacket or clothes you don't plan on dry cleaning any time soon, best to leave it in the car!"}
{"text":"Very tasty food!! We didn't know we would have that much food and we ordered an appetizer but that was too much just for two people. But the food is amazing and the service is also very good. Menu has both korean and english."}
{"text":"I got the jangjorim dolsot bibimbap. I usually get just the plain old dolsot bibimbap so this was new. It was done very well and you can tell they put a lot of effort into making it. My girlfriend got the cold noodles with kalbi on the side. The cold noodles were good..a good meal for summer but I think it can be an acquired taste. The kalbi was flavourful but kind of chewy. I'd opt for the dumplings next time as the side. The side dishes were plentiful and at least half of them were tasty. The portions were generally very generous. 

The service pretty much disappears after you get your food so make sure you get everything you need from them early on. You also seem to have to walk to the cashier to get a number to wait for a seat (expect a wait) and also to pay for the bill."}
{"text":"My Korean friend had been bothering me to try out this restaurant for the longest time, and before I knew it, here we were in the humble booths of Cho Sun Ok on a Friday afternoon.

The vibe of the restaurant is very (for lack of a better term), \"systematic.\" All the booths and chairs are ordered in a grid-like fashion that gives every party of diners a lot of privacy, similar to the restaurants found in Korea. Most of the furniture is fairly traditional - there's a wooden texture to most of the seats and tables. It was oddly a lot more spacious than I had originally thought.

In terms of the service, I would say there's just a little bit room for improvement. The wait staff, although incredibly friendly, were a bit slow when we arrived (5:00PM). Also, be aware that not all of them are Korean. Some speak other Asian dialects, so if your Korean friend fluently impresses you with their language while the waitress just awkwardly and blankly tries to make out what letter they are pointing too, don't say I never warned you!

We ordered two dishes: the specialty cold noodles and the seafood tofu soup.

The specialty cold noodles: when they say cold noodles, it is literally cold. And when they say literally cold, it means that the noodles come submerged in a bowl of broth that is FROZEN. So if it's a really cold winter day, I would advise not to opt for this dish, considering how you are actually slurping noodles from a slushie. Apart from its physical appearance, the taste was absolutely fantastic. It had a very organic taste to it, and a very fresh aftertaste. My only concern with this dish is that the portion size is quite large. Order this dish and share it with your friends, because after a while, the taste of the frozen noodles can get numbing and tiring.

The seafood tofu soup was fantastic as well. It was incredibly flavourful, warm, and complemented the side dishes and purple rice. Cho Sun Ok was also surprisingly generous with the amount of seafood and tofu in the dish too, which was a bonus.

The side dishes were awesome! Although they gave REALLY small portion sizes to begin with, once you ask for refills, they are much more generous. This makes sense, especially since many families and diners don't even touch the side dishes anyways. Very clever decision on their part. I especially liked how this restaurant served marinated eggplant and marinated green pepper. They were a fresh surprise away from the usual kimchi and radish.

Thanks Cho Sun Ok! Will definitely be coming back again some time."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their naengmyeon (cold noodle) and their dish kimchi jjim (kim chi and sliced pork dish). 

Cho Sun Ok is known for their cold noodle and the Kim chi sliced pork dish! Both not commonly found in other Korean restaurants downtown, so I would order these when you're here. Especially cold noodle being a seasonal item elsewhere (only served during the summer time) this noodle is served all year round at this restaurant! 

It was packed when we got here and the service is generally quick. The restaurant is very clean and of course our dishes were served with abundance of small dishes typical Korean restaurants have too. 

The Kim chi and sliced pork is slightly on the sour end so watch out, if you're not a fan of sour taste or vinegar, you might not like this dish as much. The cold noodle is served with broth that is frozen and comes in a slush with the noodle. Amazingly, the taste is still there despite being in a frozen form and the noodle was chewy just the way I like it. 

We also ordered soondaetguk which was a soup which had internal pig organs and Korean sausage. The soup was very tasty but this soup might scare some because of the internal organs. If you like a soup rich with taste, you might like this dish too because it was very creamy and didn't taste too piggy at all if you know what I mean. 

LAST TIP?!

You can come try the hot pot option too because it's pretty popular item here too. The dishes usually come served with one bowl of purple rice per dish ordered and the Kim chi jjim also comes with a miso soup! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"There's always a line up at this restaurant.  We got here at 545pm for dinner on a weekend and there's already a line up; waited 10-15min for our table for four which wasn't bad. They don't take reservation at this place so it's not ideal for large groups.

 Like other Yelpers mentioned there are many Koreans dining here so it's definitely authentic. 
We ordered:
1. Tangsooyook (sweet and sour pork #3 on menu): pork was fried and mixed with sweet and sour sauce with onion, apple chunks, and cucumbers. This was a nice appetizer.  
2. Cold noodles: Bibim Naemyeum  (#13) as recommended by server as one of their popular cold noodle dishes. It's spicy  (not that spicy though); comes with boiled eggs.  Cold noodles were refreshing on a hot day. Noodles texture was chewy and good flavour 
3. #16, cold noodles slushy broth with a side of beef.  This was an interesting dish for me. There's ice in the broth to keep it chilled. My friends like this one. I thought it was ok. 
4. #19 kimchi jjim: seems like this is one of their popular dishes as many tables ordered it. Pork belly with kimchi; serves with purple rice.  Pork belly was tender and flavourful. 
5. #31 chicken Katsu.  Comes with 2 big pieces of chicken; serves with white rice and coleslaw.  Chicken Katsu was good but I didn't like the sauce that came with it. I would say I had better katsu elsewhere. 

Overall, food was authentic korean and decent portion sizes. Service was fast. However make sure to pack your patience if you go during dinner rush as there's always a line up. Or go for early dinner. Also parking is difficult in that small plaza during dinner rush."}
{"text":"Bombass cold noodles, better than the ones I had in Korea. Only downside is that they give you less side dishes than if you ordered something else and they don't have meat in it...but the broth is so good, I'm willing to make a concession."}
{"text":"I used to like this place as I thought the food was above average and also has parking right in front of the restaurant. But I haven't gone for a long time as usually has long line up. I went on a weekend afternoon recently and  was disappointed. I ordered the pork bone soup and the pork had no flavour. The potatoes were rotten and I had to split out it was that bad. My husband also said the potatoes were so bad in his dish. I think the restaurant is very profitable due to its popularity; but being so cheap on using the bad ingredients in the food really turned me off. I will probably not go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"On a hot day, there's nothing better than a cold bowl of Mool Naengmyun: thin arrowroot noodles in a slushy broth ($12.95). The first time I had this type of dish, I found the concept a little strange but when I tried it, all my doubts dissipated. The arrowroot noodles are thin and chewy and never seem to get soggy or mushy. The noodles sit in an icy beef broth which is extremely flavourful and somehow has a nice sweet flavour to it as well. On top of the noodles, sit a bed of different ingredients, all of which add another dimension to the dish. The slivered cucumbers, pickled daikon and slices of Asian pear all add a light crunchy texture and the hard-boiled egg grounds the dish with its more earthy texture. In terms of flavour, the tangy pickled radish pairs well with sweet Asian pear. The sesame seed oil gives the dish a subtle nutty flavor and the red pepper sauce really adds heat to the dish. I am usually not a fan of spicy sauces but in the icy broth, the spiciness is muted and I was able to eat the dish with absolutely no problems.

If you want to add some meat to your meal, you can order the Mool Naengmyum with a side of dumplings or galbi. I decided for the Naengmyun + Galbi combo ($27.95) since it seemed more filling. The galbi was tender with just a bit of char with sweet honey on top. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Very homey neighbourhood Korean restaurant, decided to try this out based on the rating and I was told Toronto has some of the best Korean food. The service level was great and friendly. The soup was okay, I would say it's 3.5 stars since it was nothing spectacular and also not particular a good deal."}
{"text":"Great place for naengmyun but very very busy. Long wait.  Less than friendly staff. Too busy to be friendly. Food is good. Some dishes better than others. Limited refills on banchan."}
{"text":"They TRICK you in to TIPPING when paying with credit or ATM even if you don't want to.
Terrible business ethics.  They automatically add 15% tip when paying with credit card and don't give you a choice.  Had lunch there the other day.  No issue with the food but the service was terrible.  After waiting for our table, sat down and ordered.  We were only provided with a napkin and paper placemat.  When the food came we had to ask for chopsticks and spoons.  Kimchee side dish was tiny, about 2 fingers worth in size.  Then we had to ask for the condiments that should have arrived with the dish.  Midway through asked for more kimchee.  It never came and they were too busy, we gave up because by this time we finished eating.  When we went to pay the terminal didn't give the option to tip zero.  When selecting no to add a tip, it automatically added it anyway (tricky).  Had to tell owner who said tipping was mandatory. He asked what was the problem.  We told him.  Rather than be concerned with the poor service we received or apologize he got mad at us and re-did the transaction with no tip using some secret code on the terminal .  How they set up their credit card terminal is unethical, possibly illegal and demonstrates utter disregard for service.  Tipping is a customer's prerogative based on service not an owner's entitlement to extra margin.  Will never go there again."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night at around 6:30pm on a hot summer evening and it is no surprise that there were already lineups. In order to get a number to get seated, you have to go up to the cashier counter. You also pay at the counter. This type of service made the restaurant extremely efficient as you did not need to flag people down to pay or receive a number to wait. The only time would be if you wanted to order your food.

I came with my brother and we both ordered the cold noodle combos (one galbi and one dumpling combo). We've both been to Korea and have tried naengmyun on a hot summer's day in Hongdae..so we both knew what we were in for. For the cold noodle, my bro ordered the slushy noodle while I ordered the spicy noodle. The steamed dumplings came out the very fast along with the side dishes (kimchi and pickled radish). Both noodles came out last and was very refreshing and cold on a hot summer night. Very important to have scissors at hand in order to cut the noodles too! I liked how the noodles came with some cucumber slices, radishes, as well as a slice of pear (which was quite refreshing!). The price of the dishes is a little more than your regular Korean restaurant, so keep that in mind if you do end up going.

Would I go back? Probably, but not if there is a line. I would want to try their hot pots and pork bone soup."}
{"text":"Be prepared for Long lines but worth the wait. A small restaurant with modest, hard working , attentive owner and staff. Ask and they are happy to please their customers.  Owner walks around talking with guest to ensure all are happy.  

Recommend the spicy soft tofu soup, 
Pork bone soup
Sweet n sour fried chicken pieces served with honey, apples, oranges and cucumber pieces. 
Spicy Cold noodles and my kids favorite 
Bibimbap (rice with veges, meat and egg)

This is not a cheap place but worth the few extra dollars."}
{"text":"Cho Sun \"\"OK\"...
Years before the reno and the popularity, I have been going here for my K-Food-Fix.
Over the last year, it has become ridiculously popular and prices have risen considerably.  It is now the norm to see a large contingency of Chinese patrons and non-asians.  Great for the family business owner that put their recipes to the test and make such good food.
This is the place to go to get \"OK\" Korean food.  They are not the best for Kalbi but they make an OK version.  They are not the best for Soon Tofu, but they make an OK version.  They are OK at almost everything on the menu, however, I do have to admit that they are the best, so far, for Pork Bone Soup and NangMyun (cold noodle).
Best times to go to this place is before 6PM and after 9PM, otherwise, be prepared to easily wait 30mins or more.  Oh...on Tuesdays, they are closed so don't make the trek there.
One way to know if they are busy is to look at the parking situation.  If there are none, the restaurant is packed.
Oh...the meal choices.  Usually, the fam orders Pork Bone Soup, Soon Tofu, Tonkatsu, BiBimBap and dumplings.  We dabble sometimes with the TangSuYulk, the Pork and KimChi Jim, and the SoonDae.
Their BahnChan selection is good and the service is fine."}
