{"text":"There was live music! The piano player was a talented gentleman who sat at the entrance! The music added to the yummy food eating experience. Went for dinner with a good friends of mine on 4/18/2015.

For drinks we got a bloody caesar, vodka with tonic, and vodka with club soda. For dinner we ordered bigos (roasted meat, sausage, and lots of cabbage), krokiety (breaded meat and mushroom crepes with a side of salad and side of potato salad), and golabki (cabbage rolls stuffed with pork and rice with side of pickled red cabbage). Bigos was well made and tasty but did not look so appetizing. Krokiety had two separate crepes, one was meat and other was mushroom. The salad and potato salad were not so different from the American versions. Golabki was good as well and the pickled cabbage was a good compliment in regards to flavor but a lot of cabbage on the plate."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Was really looking forward to a nice polish meal in Montreal, but this was kind of disappointing. The food was meh, not horrible, but just kind of bland. The restaurant itself felt kind of stuffy. Combination of a warm, crowded room, with warm water being served, mediocre food, unengaged service, and a piano that was somewhat too loud, just made the experience a bit uncomfortable. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Yes, the Polish restaurants you'll find in NYC are better, hands down. But Stash Cafe did not disappoint at all. They have a new drink menu and the Bloody Polak was so good, we ordered it twice!  We had golobki (stuffed cabbage), flaczki (tripe soup), & barsz (beet soup). The beet soup was tasty but just a tad salty.  The other two items seemed like they had an ingredient or two missing. However, overall the taste was pretty good. Granted we came here in the middle of the afternoon when it was virtually empty, but service was excellent. Our waiter even helkpled us with directions to Olympic Stadium, which was our next stop.  Everyone who works there is Polish & seems to speak Polish as well, which is a nice touch to the authenticity of the restaurant.  The ambiance is also great, with wooden tables and chairs. If I'm ever in Montreal again, I'll definitely stop by this place again!"}
{"text":"A friend has been, for some time promising me a taste of genuine polish food. Yesterday was my first experience at Stash Café and I can tell you it was one of the most enjoyable samplings I have had in a long while. 

I started off (with her guidance) with a Barszcz which is a beet consommé. My was it good. We also had the Pierogi entrée as well as shots of a particular Polish vanilla base vodka. 

For my main course I had the Kielbasa with egg salad and sauerkraut. The sausage and the egg salad were good but I really tasted Sauerkraut for the first time (again). It was absolutely amazing. Apparently it is prepared the right way there as they drain all the vinegar out of it by hand-pressing it for just the right amount of time and and a good amount of effrot actually yields a relatively small portion, but now I tasted real sauerkraut and I am a fan. 

The service and ambiance were great. It was raining outside and looking through the windows and the warm cozy haze of the low-lighted restaurant it truly felt like we were ensconced in a warm , cozy cocoon of Polish hospitality.

Price VERY reasonnable for dinner in touristy old Montreal."}
{"text":"Great polish restaurant in Montreal. The food is amazing. We chose virtually everything on the menu and it was great. Incredibly tasty!! 
The service was great too, the waiters and waitresses were very polite and sweet. 
They also have a piano player with excellent music to set the mood for a relaxing dinner.
Will return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant! My boyfriend had stroganow and I had krokiety, and they were both fantastic. The ambience of the restaurant was nice, the location was great, and there was an awesome pianist playing favourite songs. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a bite on a whim. Yum!! Perfectly seasoned and well cooked. We got herring salad, pierogis, and some blinz thing filled with meat and potatoes, nothing was too greasy either. Even the side salad and side potato salad are worth mentioning: the salad was well dressed and the potato was seasoned with dill."}
{"text":"So delicious. I'm so glad we stopped in here. My husband is half-Polish, so we always try to find Polish restaurants in various cities. This was in a gorgeous, historic building in old town that looks like a castle. My husband, son and I shared kielbasa, pierogi and galubki and they were all delicious. The service couldn't have been friendlier or more attentive. In a seriously touristy part of town, this feels like an authentic, charming find."}
{"text":"I'm married to a Polish man with a Polish mom from Poland. I know good Polish food. My mother-in-law is an INCREDIBLE cook and so is her mother and they tell me her mother was a great cook and I totally believe them. I could eat my mother-in-law's pork chops everyday and I don't even like pork THAT much. 

Let me tell you Stash Café takes me back to my visits in Poland sitting in my grandmother-in-law's apartment. We would chat as I peeled potatoes (she spoke no English I spoke no Polish) and she would show me how to cook and I would watch and try to learn all I could. 

The Flaki here is perfect. I tried flaki at a restaurant in America and almost couldn't eat it ever again (it smelled weird). Thankfully I gave the Flaki here a try and it is delicious. If you like menudo you will like this Polish version. I'm not going to lie to you people, it's cow intestine. That may sound scary to some of you out there, but you're really missing out if you don't try this. The texture is unique the flavor is unique. It's a rich soup full of herbs and spices and tender meat. Don't think about it just try it. 

The kielbasa has that snap that I cannot live without. Who can bite into a sausage and enjoy it without the snap? You need the snap. Full flavored sausage here. 

The Sledzie (pickled herring with apples)! I've never had this outside of my mother-in-law's house let alone seen it on a menu! Also we only have it over the holidays so this was a real treat and Wow this was good. The plating is done tastefully. The juicy meaty herring the tart green apples the creamy smietana the bite from the onions the fresh fragrant Italian leaf parsley.  All there. Again don't think just do it. Try it.

Lastly but not leastly the hunters stew Bigos. Phenomenal in my mother-in-laws house also phenomenal here. There's prunes and their delicious kielbasa and cabbage and sourkraut. There were juniper berries in there and bay leaves and the broth. So rich. This is a hearty meal. It's called hunter's stew for a reason. It was made to warm the hunters up after long days in the woods. This will warm you up and make you feel full and cozy inside. Wow. You can tell this has been cooking at least since yesterday. The flavors are fully developed in this hearty stew. You will go home satisfied and happy. 

I tried all the unique things my in-laws make best. I haven't seen most of these items on menus in different Polish restaurants around the world. (Even in Warsaw.) This is what the Polish people eat at home. This is real Polish food."}
{"text":"Hands down, best meal we had while in Montreal. Better than smoked meat and poutine together. Food and service were both  amazing. Perogies, stuffed cabbage and kielbasa - soooooooo good. Whenever back, this will be the one place we are sure to come back to. 

Also, everybody there was so awesome with little kids. They made it an extremely pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"We visited it for the first time. We ordered Menu du Debutant, which supposed to have \"bigos\" as a main course. It was described in menu as \"cabbage stew with roasted meat, sausage and wild mushrooms\". Instead we got a small (not more that 2 table spoons) portion of a sour craft cabbage with absolutely no meat sausage or mushrooms. When we mentioned it to waiter she just said that we were probably given a bad batch of this meal. She did not suggest to replace it or explain it otherwise. She did not even apologize. 
All in all our experience was not pleasant, and we would not recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"They serve the kind of food you only get in people's homes. It's not fancy restaurant food by any means, just solid stews and such. I keep thinking back to the dishes and how I can recreate them at home.

Rich dishes (try the post-hunt pork and cabbage stew). Really friendly service. One of my favorites in Montreal. Surprising to find reasonable and good food in the touristy area."}
{"text":"We went at 4:30 and the place was almost empty, so the service was great. The pierogis were amazing, especially the potato and cheese. Kielbasa was delicious as well. The building is lovely, and it is definitely worth a trip to the bathroom just to see the beautiful stairs. May have to go back before we leave Montreal! Best meal we have had here all week."}
{"text":"My mother and I recently went to Montreal.  As my father loves the city and goes pretty regularly, he recommended Stash Cafe as it is one of his favorite spots.  I can see why he recommended it as I will now do the same.  The food is out of this world, and they have a good selection of local beers.

When our server came over and asked for our order, I told him I was vegetarian and was considering a certain dish.  He said that while what I was considering was great, I should think about the breaded mushroom crepes.  I am so glad I listened to him.  The crepes themselves are covered in mushroom gravy and were delicious.  They came with a nice green salad, and the best potato salad I have ever had.  I never would have thought a potato salad could be that much better than other potato salads.  It was full of fresh dill, some small chopped up pickles, and maybe magic.  It was that good and tasted very fresh.  

The atmosphere was nice as well.  The restaurant does get extremely busy, however.  We were there on a Wednesday, and fortunately arrived early because it was jam packed very shortly after.  Because of this, it took ages for the sever to come over, clean up our table, and give us the bill.  However, we also didn't rush him since it was hot outside and we had been walking all day.  I'm sure if we had asked, he would have did what he could to get us the bill as he was working very hard and was kind and professional.  I will absolutely go back to Stash Cafe next time, and every time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while walking through the old city on an unexpectedly crisp fall day.  The warm atmosphere and hearty food was just what we needed.  Husband had the cabbage stew and loved it.  I had the pierogi.  Good pierogi (and side of 'kraut), but in a little too much oil/butter for my taste.  Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I wanted my friend to try Russian food and this was the closest thing I could find in Montreal. We started with the Borscht...Mwehhhhhh....not so good. It was really salty and tasted more like beef broth. I've grown up eating homemade borscht and this didn't even come close to what I've experienced.

I ordered the perogie since I've never had perogie stuffed with meat or mushrooms and my friend had Sznycel Mielony. Both were really really delicious. They definitely made up for the salty borscht.

Cute little restaurant located in Old Montreal with a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a romantic dinner!"}
{"text":"My brother, his girlfriend, and I happened upon this restaurant after getting a recommendation from another restaurant down the street (this first place was not open for lunch). It turned out to be a great recommendation! First, walking in, the decor was really nice. Red lights, heavy wood tables, bench seats, and pop-art hanging on the walls and from the ceilings. We were only the second group in the place, so we did not experience the slow service of other reviewers. Our server was very attentive, seemed to be in a great mood, and knew her beer! 

We started with two order of the mixed perogies, which were brought out right away. Our server recommended that we order them first and then see if we were still hungry. Being generally a hungry bunch, we ordered more. I ordered the mielony, my brother's girlfriend ordered the cabbage rolls, and my brother ordered the schnitzl (excuse my spelling, not sure if it's correct). We shared a bit and everything was delicious. Overall great experience and I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"This was a great find, just on my stroll through Old Montreal when my wife had to use the rest room so we decided to stop to have some food and drinks, the pierogis were great and the drinks were on point!
Nice cozy joint with a great atmosphere, would be happy to stop by this place again when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Still one of the best places in Old Town. Service can be indifferent, but the food is great. Make a reservation if you can."}
{"text":"Loved this place! My husband and I came here for dinner during our first night in Montreal. We split an appetizer of potato pancakes, which were delicious with applesauce. I got the filet of sole, which was delicious -- and I appreciated that it wasn't drenched in olive oil. And the food at all the neighboring tables looked fantastic. The ambience was lovely, and there was a live piano player. I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.  
Real, authentic and honest cooking shines through. 
Stuffed cabbage. 
Pierogi. 
Potato pancake. 

Tip:  order the cobbler.  Peach or apple...both were great."}
{"text":"Excellent. Had white sausage soup followed by the wild boar. Boar was very tender and delicious. (Polish)Friends had the hunter stew and the duck. All just delicious and tasted very authentic. Sorry I don't know the polish names but you cannot go wrong here for a great meal. Good beer list also."}
{"text":"Situated in the heart of Old Montreal, this place bustles with charm.  

The ambiance is unique.  Some of the seats are church pews, and modern Eastern European art hangs from the ceilings.  A pianist's music echoes through the room as you dine under dim lights.

On both visits to Stash Cafe, I had the Debutant, which gets you a delicious borscht, a yummy salad, a plate full of mixed pierogies, krokiety, bigos, and a potato pancake.  Dessert was a choice of homemade apple or plum crumble, served with a choice of tea or coffee (all for 29$!).  Everything was delicious, especially the borscht, pierogies and krokiety.  My partner tried the boar on his second run, but preferred the variety and flavors delivered by the Debutant.

I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant because it had wide open windows (on a beautiful evening) and had a piano player.  The menu offered three choices for complete meals... a Polish sampler type feast, fish (filet of sole, I think) and roast wild boar.  The meals included borsht, a green salad, entre, dessert and coffee.

The borsht was basically a beef consume flavored with beet.  It was served with sour cream.  Not like any borsht I've ever had, but not too bad.

The salad came with a house dressing to compliment the lettuce (only lettuce) hence the \"green\" description.

The Polish sampler plate was tasty and satisfying.  The roast wild boar was so dry and tough, it was nearly inedible.  According to the waiter, \"wild boar has a different texture than pork\" (apparently a shoe leather texture!).  I left all but  the first bite for the garbage bin.

The dessert was an apple strudel and was very good.  My wife asked to substitute the poppyseed cake ($1 more) for the strudel.  The waiter  agreed to do it at no extra charge since \"I didn't like my entre\".  Honestly... the strudel was a much better choice!

Clearly the most memorable part of the evening was the talented piano player who effortlessly turned Pink Floyd, Blackeyed Peas and other favorites into \"elevator music\".

Next time, we'll probably stop in just for dessert, coffee and piano."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We had the boar meal and the beginner's meal. The service was good, yet very slow. Overall, we stayed there for 3 hours (4 course meal).

I would recommend anyone to at least try it, just expect around 40$ per person for the meal and a drink."}
{"text":"Very relaxing atmosphere. Never felt rushed. The food was very good but the portions were small for the price. Staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Sorry for the short review, but i don't have a lot of spare time.
Had the pierogi, the sour soup and the beet soup, schitzel and kielbasa.
Great taste, brings back great memories from our trip to Warsawa."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Staying in town from California and ate here twice in a week. The service was really friendly. The food was delicious. And there was an old time pianist playing pop songs. It looks like NY mafia place without the kitsch. I recommend."}
{"text":"What a gem in Montreal. The menu is authentic, service is great and food is delicious. I've offered my recommendation to several colleagues and will gladly return next time Polish food is the preference in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great place to grab dinner. The service was great and very friendly and we got food very quickly, which was especially important since we were starving. The food was great and tasted very fresh, I know my fair share about Polish/East European food and I have to say a lot of places don't do it justice, this  place does, so that's saying a lot and for a fair price. This is a place you should surely check out in you're in the area. Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent Polish food and decor. The live piano player was amazing!"}
{"text":"This was a great find a little off the beaten path in Old Montreal. The food here is traditional Polish fare. My mom and I both had the stuffed cabbage which was very tasty and filling. It came with fried potatoes and a red cabbage salad. The decor is very charming there are church pews and open windows all around. Also some nights there's a piano player who the night we were there played some jazzy tunes. Service is a bit slow to start but once they get to you it goes quickly. Recommended for anyone who likes Polish food or someone who's interested in trying something that isn't from a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Always visit the Stash Cafe when i come to Montreal!!! It's one of my favourite restaurants. 

It can be hard to get a table, so we always try to arrive early. 

Love the piano accompaniment with dinner."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were amazing!!  This was our first time having Polish food and we were impressed.  We started off with the potato pancakes for our appetizer and enjoyed them but let me tell you our entrees were delicious. I had the cabbage rolls with this incredible tomato sauce and my husband had periogies.  I'm a big foodie and can say this was one of the greatest meals I've had in a very long time.  We both had sauerkraut and loved it. Never had sauerkraut this good before.  We finished off the meal with homemade Plum cobbler. I liked it but my husband loved it enough to order a second piece. Portion sizes are good and prices very reasonable. Service however was extremely slow, during our first hour we only had our beers and appetizers. Servers were very helpful and friendly so made up for the time. I highly recommend this place. Simply amazing!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from the US, and while wandering Old Montreal decided on Stash.  We had an exceptional meal with a very friendly waiter who took the time to answer questions and make recommendations.  Prices were very reasonable (especially for Old Montreal), and portions were sizable.  Polish doesn't seem the obvious choice for Montreal, but we are so happy that we decided to eat there.  Whenever we make a return to Montreal, we will definitely return to stash for another delicious meal!"}
{"text":"(see explanation of ratings below)


4 of 4 stars (excellent, casual dining).

Love it.  Good Polish food in a cozy atmosphere.

They don't have the dozens of vodkas as they did years ago, so that was a disappointment.

Love the pickled herring.

About $30 per person for lunch, no dessert, booze included, gratuity excluded.


About my ratings:

Only high-priced dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.

Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):

1) fast food and \"fast-casual\", low-priced (no table service).

2) casual, mid-priced dining (table service, average entrée price: $10-$20).

3) fine, high-priced dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entrée priced at more than $20, can vary depending on the city).

High-priced dining can earn a max of five stars.  Mid-priced dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Had the Debutant and split an order of cabbage rolls with my dining companion. Everything was delicious. The cabbage rolls were served with a nice, slightly spicy tomato sauce.  The filling was very tender and flavorful. Pirogies were also very good. The Debutant gives you a nice selection, so if you are not familiar with Polish food, it is a great place to start. 
If I was spending a long weekend in Montreal and could only choose two or three restaurants for dinner, this would definitely be on the list."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the pierogi and my husband had the hunters stew. Great service and food.... Just a bit pricey, but on par with the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Splendid - that's how I'd describe it. I'm a Pole, born and raised in Poland, spend there good 25 years of my life (out of 32, so I guess it counts for something). I visited Stash Cafe Bazaar with my parents, born, raised all-time Poles and a few friends and we were all nothing but impressed. Ordered barszcz, zurek (soups), krokiet with mushrooms (started), all of their dumplings and kotlets - all of which was splendid. Soups were nice and flavorful and tasted home-made, krokiet was delicate, not greasy, subtly mushroomy, all of the dumplings tasted awesome (meat ones would be my favorite) kotlets were huge and tasty. Only complain was from my dad, who wanted more of their side potatoes - he's one big starch-loving traditionalist) and from me to increase their Polish beers selection (although they had some nice local beers, so that's just my wishful thinking). Decor was very nice too, ambiance was great, live music added on to that. Prices were very reasonable too. Overall an afternoon at Stash Cafe Bazaar was the best ending to our Montreal trip - thank you for that! Best Polish food I had outside Poland for sure (except my own cooking that is ;)))"}
{"text":"Busy place where locals and tourists both go. They serve Zywiec and I had the beef stroganoff which was excellent. The potato pancakes truly are legendary and the mushroom sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"Great place.  The food is delicious and considering its Old Montreal not terribly pricey.  The atmosphere/decor feels authentic without being kitschy.  The food is very good and decent sized portions.  My salad was fresh and green.  I wish there was a 4 1/2 stars.  This place deserves it."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend Stash Cafe enough to friends, family, strangers!  Just ignore the fact that Rachel Ray also loves it.

Located in Old Montreal (Vieux-Montréal), this old world Polish restaurant serves up deliciously large plates of weiner schnitzel, peirogi, potato pancakes, pan seared fish, etc.  My weiner schnitzel (veal) was the size of my big head, pounded thin and fried up crisp and buttery.  The sides with it were shredded pickled beets (sweet and tart) and large, buttery wedges of potato.  My companion had pan seared white fish.  There were three very large and meaty fillets, fried up crisp and buttery.  Sides included the potato wedges and a fresh salad with creamy dressing.

A lot of people ordered the poppy seed cake, but we were too stuffed to indulge."}
{"text":"I loved it here! The ambience was dimly lit yet warm and cozy. The food was very authentic, and delicious. The service was great, and all of the wait staff speak Polish (and english) . They can explain the dishes if you don't really know what you're getting into."}
{"text":"Restaurant polonais avec des plats traditionnels excellent. Nous avons goûté le Bolgi et le plats avec saucisses. Les deux sont excellents. Nous avons fini par un café polonais, très bon également. Tout au long du repas, nous avons eu de la musique live au piano. Très bon pianiste. Service très agréable. Super ambiance. Restaurant cozy. Nous recommandons grandement!"}
{"text":"Found this in Old Montreal.  Started with the cold beet soup served with cucumber and sour cream.  Very refreshing and delicious.  Next came a fried crepe filled with beef.  Amazing!  Next we had a friend pork chop served with sauerkraut and roasted potatoes.  The potatoes were quite good - perfectly done.  I was expecting something different from the pork chop and while good, was not spectacular.  The cabbage rolls filled with ground pork and rice were some of the best I have ever had. The flavor is unique - maybe thyme was the spice.  The atmosphere is vibrant and service friendly and efficient.  There is much more to discover in the menu and I hope to make it back there."}
{"text":"Definitely worth it! My family of four came here for lunch... we didn't have reservations and had to wait but the food was worth the wait! We shared the peurogi's and I had the steak tips, and a bunch of other food... in addition to dessert! Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm a huge fan of polish food and they have tons of dishes that are made out of cabbage and potatoes! mmmmm.. super good  pierogi. Located in a good part of montreal nice to walk around after dinner. 
Cant wait to go back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"La nourriture était excellente, le service merveilleux (serveuse amicale et chaleureuse).
Nous avons pris des tables d'hôte et le prix était raisonnable pour la quantité de nourriture dans nos assiettes. La saucisse kielbasa était bonne, la soupe aux betteraves, un délice."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant polonais à Montréal. Goût exquis 5/5, ambiance chaleureuse 5/5, service courtois 5/5. J'ai vraiment hâte d'y retourner"}
{"text":"Superior!  We immensely enjoyed our late dinner.  We arrived after 9pm with two children and were warmly welcomed.  We loved the piano player, pierogies, and potato pancakes.  Ambiance, service, food taste and quality were all beyond expectation."}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly Polish restaurant in beautiful Old Montreal area.  Took a walk from our hotel to get here and turning onto Rue Saint Paul was simply magical.  Modern buildings give way to cobblestone streets, historic 18th century (?) facades, and horse-drawn carriages.  Yeah, it's hokey and touristy, but I'm a sucker for that kind of thing.

But definitely nothing gimmicky about the food here at Stash.  The ambience is unpretentious and friendly, darkly lit with a heavy emphasis on wood and old-world charm.  A piano player slightly separated from the main dining area played through the entire time we were there, providing a lovely unobtrusive musical accompaniment to supper.

We shared the beet consommé, a salad, then a sausage appetizer, a mixed plate with pierogi, potato pancake, stewed cabbage, and a breaded beef crepe, and a meat-stuffed cabbage plate.  Finally, for dessert, we enjoyed a sweet cheese crepe.  So nothing too exotic, but all well-prepared and tasty.  These were recommended by our excellent waiter, who pretty much picked out our entire supper for us, checked in just a couple of times, and otherwise let us enjoy our evening.

Delicious, homey, and reasonably-priced fare, we definitely enjoyed dining here and would love to come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Decided to go to this place after I read online it was one of the best places to eat for under $20. It succeeded.  Cozy atmosphere in a historic building. We went on a Saturday for brunch. The eggs were cooked perfect , crepes with the raspberry and cheese inside were good not overly sweet, and perrogi mixed selection were excellent. This was one of the best places I've been to in Montreal."}
{"text":"Famished in a sea of expensive touristy restaurants, we found respite in the wooden harbor of Stash.

Service a bit slow, but they were busy at lunch. Everything was delicious.  Meat stuffing in the Pierogi reminded me a wild boar pulled pork; cabbage and mushroom were smoky and savory. Light, giant potato pancakes, fried pork chops perfectly cooked, bier refreshing and cold. Loved the creamy tarragon salad dressing. 

The wood and stone spiral staircase is worth a trip upstairs.

Cheers~"}
{"text":"Super cute place with decent Polish food. We ordered the borscht , which was okay, but nothing to write home about. Then we shared some pierogies with apple sauce AND sour cream on the side, because that's how I do it, and those were much better. We ordered some other stuff, but they must have not been that great if I can't remember what they were.

The waiters were all very pleasant, if a bit slow during a time when the restaurant wasn't very busy. I would pop in again, but only if I were craving some pierogies and found myself in the area."}
{"text":"This was a real find, courtesy of the young woman at the reception of the Auberge Bonaparte. Cafe Stash features excellent Polish food; pierogi, sausage and sauerkraut, hunters stew, and a variety of other specialties. Décor is Polish lodge, and service very fast. I highly recommend Café Stash for lunch or dinner in Old Montreal.   This is a moderately priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Our group ate there Saturday night. Great atmosphere with piano playing. I cannot say enough praise about the cold beat soup. It was amazing! For dinner I had the spinach crepes and they were tasty, but three others in my party had the golabki and I tasted it - super yummy. Another had the perogies and loved them. We waddled out, but worth it."}
{"text":"Stash is a pretty cool and unique place.  The atmosphere is cozy and the piano player at the entrance is a really nice touch.  My coworkers and I stopped in on our last night in Montreal and it was a solid last meal.

We ordered a couple of appetizers since we had heard that the pierogis and the potato pancakes were good, but didn't want to get them as our entrees.  We tried all three types of pierogis and they were all excellent.  For an entree I ordered the Golabki (stuffed cabbage rolls) and they were very tasty.

Overall, I'm giving it three stars because of their tough competition in Old Montreal.  It was a good experience overall but I don't think they quite stand up to many of the other restaurants in the area.  I likely would return if I were specifically craving Polish food, but otherwise I would probably head to one of the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is a friendly place with a warm inviting atmosphere. Attentive staff and the ambience is perfect for a rainy summer night with breezes wafting in the tall street side windows. Situated in Rue St. Paul, it is in perfect harmony with its surroundings.

Very busy this August Sunday night, but they found me a spot. A piano player tickles out bg on an old upright which is a perfect substrate for the human of conversation of people enjoying their evenings.

This is the equivalent of a bistro - good food that seeks to fill bellies and trigger comfort. My Stroganoff came with potato pancakes and a chopped beet salad. Comforting, satisfying, warming, if not inspirational. Completely consistent with the ambience.

Washed down with a cold Zvweic, all in all an entirely satisfactory dinner."}
{"text":"Wow! We weren't expecting to have old-world Polish food on a warm June evening, but man, was it good!! We enjoyed the perogies, potato pancakes and duck, among others. The Borsch was a consume and a little too salty for my taste, so that would be the only thing I would avoid. The service was friendly.

Oh yes, the piano player was a nice touch too. Varied and fun song selection.

Try it, you'll love it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"My father's birthday was coming up, so as he is Polish, we thought what better place to go, than to Stash for some Polish food. I had not been to the restaurant in a few years and hoped it would be just as good.

As soon as you walk in, you are met with that familiarity of having been here before. The piano player is tickling the ivories, the lighting is just bright enough, that each table feels like it is in its own little private area.

If you like Polish food or have never tried it, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. There are dishes on the menu, that remind me somewhat of what my grandmother used to make for us.

We started off our meal with drinks and being in a Polish restaurant, we started off with a round of Polish vodka, Wyborowa. Nicely chilled and a great way to start off any meal; but I guess any meal that starts with a round of drinks is a nice way to start.

We got an assortment of appetizers to start with. A few people got the Flaki soup (a Polish soup made of tripes) and we also got pierogis, plaki, kielbasa, and sledz (herring). On a side note, I don't like herring, however, I decided for the first time to try the one from Stash after my brother convinced me that it is really good. OMG, he was right, I now know what herring should be made like (sorry grandma), but that was really good. What better to have with herring, than vodka, so round two was ordered. Hey, it's a celebration.

Three people at the table got the sznycel wiedenski (veal schnitzel), someone got the Bigos (a type of Polish stew), and one golabki (cabbage rolls). There was a lot of sharing and trading of plates and each was excellent, although the golabki could have used a little more salt and the Bigos a little less salt. However, I would recommend either of those dishes in a heart beat. The portions are well sized and quite filling.

For dessert we got struddel, although I was surprised that a Polish restaurant didn't have p?czki (Polish doughnut). When I asked about it, when making the reservation, the lady told me where I could find them; but I wasn't sure if she meant I could bring them with me or she was just simply being nice and telling me where I could buy them.

The meal, with tax and tip (and I was very generous with the tip because our waiter was great) was 308$. That was for 5 meals, 6 entrees, 2 rounds of vodka shots, 2 martinis, bottle of wine, and dessert. In my opinion and of those at the table, it was money well spent."}
{"text":"This was THE BEST Polish food I've tasted in a long-long time! Authentic, homemade-tasting, beautifully seasoned, very well-prepared. The service was great - always such an important aspect of any business! I was greatly impressed by the fact that the staff spoke at least 3 languages: French, English and Polish. Friendly, polite and helpful. Next time we are in Montreal, this will be my Montreal's #1 destination! :-) yes, it's THAT good! :-))"}
{"text":"I had the pierogies with meat, and am not a fan of mushy meat that is ground up into a paste and put into a dumpling. I'd prefer a Chinese dumpling in this case, with meat you can actually taste in terms of texture.

It was bland, it wasn't enough food...

The borscht was not a real one, it was a light soup which everyone told me was not a true borscht because there was just a light beet soup.

I'll try it again but so far, it's just okay. I'll come back for a few more tries.

Maybe Polish food is not my thing."}
{"text":"lunch recently, drinks were ok and small, food was great, had the veal schnitzel and wife had the nalesniki, service was pleasant, good food!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here . We had the borscht and  dumplings for starters followed by the cabbage roll and snitzel. We shared the pancake for dessert. Everything tasted good and  fresh. The piano player added to the ambiance . Prices were reasonable ."}
{"text":"We found this little restaurant while walking in the old port. Inside there is a traditional vine which is really nice. The food was very good and diversified. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great experience for someone who has never had Polish food. The server was very nice and patient in explaining the unfamiliar dishes to our table. There was a pianist who played wonderful music. The restaurant felt very cosy and intimate, with warm lighting and great atmosphere and smells. The food was very filling and wasn't too expensive. Definitely worth a revisit or two."}

{"text":"Loved this place!

Went here with a Polish friend of mine who had been before and recommended the food - I'll totally be back!

This was my 2nd Polish restaurant experience (the 1st being a place somewhere on the Plateau which I have no name for at the moment), and I thought it was very comparable!

Nice little place in the heart of the Old Port with an awesome vibe and super decent prices. I had the Krokiet which was a plate with breaded stuffed crepes - 1 with mushroom and the other with meat. Both were really delicious, as were the accompanying side salad and potatoes (although a hot potato dish would've hit the spot way better!).

Good overall - will probably come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Polish food. Delicious borscht and the lightest pierogies I have ever had. The place is small so you may need a reservation."}
{"text":"The menu reads: Everything tastes better with wodka -- even wodka.

On a Friday night, Stash was filled with young couples on dates and groups of friends meeting for dinner. (Okay, okay, we were a not-so-young couple on a date). Nice ambiance with stone walls, red lanterns, art posters hung from the ceiling, and a piano player giving Madonna and other 80s classics a jazzy twist.

The food was well-prepared and servings generous. Not fancy but quite tasty. I've never liked sauerkraut before but, being the brave sort, gave Stash's \"salade au chou\" a try. To my surprise, I liked it. 

With a shared appetizer, two mains, two desserts (but no vodka), dinner for two came to about $60 including tax, tip for the waiter, and tip for the piano player.

Thanks to other Yelp-ers for the recommendation!"}
{"text":"Yummyyyy..... never had Polish food before... my husband has and I loved it ...specially the beet soup.... a must have !! and great value for money"}
{"text":"A lucky find in Montreal. We were walking by and saw this place. It looked interesting and we liked the menu.
Borsch was bad since it tasted as if it was from a can. But holidnik, golubci and the rest was incredibly tasty. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming! Staff was courteous and attentive. All the food was delicious and fresh (except for borsch)."}
{"text":"We were looking for a totally different resto to lunch at in Old Montreal when we accidentally walked by this charming little restaurant. We were warmly greeted and shown to a great little table looking out onto the cobblestone street and it's occasional passing horse-drawn carriage. It was all very touristy, but in the best sense possible.
Having heard that Polish food tended toward heaviness we carefully chose our lunch portion to match our appetite.  I had the tripe soup (Flaki)  and an entree level order of pierogies whereas the Missus had Barszcz and Kielbasa - their typical beet soup and sausage meal.
The honeycomb tripe's texture was OMG wonderful, as was the hearty broth. The pierogies were completely unexpected. They were delicate little pouches, their translucent skins glistening and  hinting at the promise of meaty yummy goodness. A dollop of sour cream just sent the meal over the top. I almost started planning a trip to Poland solely on the strength of these nibbles it was that good.

I think that the Missus's meal met her standards because she wouldn't share any of her dishes with me. For shame, Missus, for shame! ;-)"}
{"text":"Food was good, but not excellent. I'm of eastern european descent, so many of these dishes are akin to what my family makes. Nothing special here. Service was just okay. Portions were small and prices were high. I would not come back - too much of a tourist trap."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. I come from a Polish family and really enjoy Polish food, and this place was great. I ordered an option that included a soup appetizer, a large main entree, and a dessert. This was a great way to try many items on the menu. Everything was wonderful- especially the pierogis and kielbasa. The restaurant also had a great drink selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff, and a cozy environment. It was my favorite meal in Montreal. I highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Our family had a wonderful evening at Stash Cafe. The restaurant is charming and cozy. A piano player provided ambience. Our waiter was friendly. And most importantly, the food was scrumptious.  The potato pancakes and pierogis are a must."}
{"text":"Small, crowded, and Polish. Not what you'd expect in Montreal, but the pierogis are very good, and the sausages were too. I recommend reservations, though--we were lucky to get a table. A nice stop if you're walking around Notre Dame."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Definitely recommend Kilbassa (polish sausages)! The soup, sauerkraut, and apple cobbler were superb as well. Every bite was spectacular. Well worth the wait!! Very warm and cozy ambience. Lovely decorations and great service."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place is delicious, it's a must. We went right when it opened at 11 and got a table right away. It got crowded closer to 12. The food was delicious and reasonable priced. Most things were $15 an under. The staff was friendly and attentive. The decor is interesting and adds to the overall vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Pierogis, sauerkraut, cabbage rolls... everything was delicious! Everything was extremely flavorful!!"}
{"text":"We weren't actually aiming for Stash, but the restaurant down the block was closed mid-afternoon and we were quite hungry.  What a lucky stop!

First - good, prompt service - and they put up with us pronouncing the food names very poorly (except for the pierogis).  We had pierogis and the sweet cream crepes for entrees.  The portions were GREAT.  The pierogis were tender and flavorful - great with the sour cream.  The sweet cream crepes were a great surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting, but they were more savory than sweet - at least until the awesome fruit sauce was added.  Great afternoon meal.

Decent belgian beer selection as well.  Definitely will visit again in Montreal."}
{"text":"Solidly good food, with adequate yet moderately indifferent service.  Really nice piano playing when it happens."}
{"text":"When I read the reviews all were amazing, fresh food, beautiful decor... I don't know about you buy fried potatoes and fried crepe rolls and way too salty soup is not fresh food to me. I have never had polish food before but this is not gastronomy to me. Super uncomfortable church pews and way too dark. The only really good point is the amazing service. Not worth the ridiculous price. Maybe polish food is just not my thing."}
{"text":"We ate an early dinner as we had spent the day walking. We decided on Stash for a nice change. I had the sausage & kraut. The sausage was So Good & flavorful. DH had a prefix meal that included a little of everything. It had what they call a stew, beef & kraut, It was Yum!  Stash is a nice quiet place for a good change of pace meal. I had a club soda & vodka with a twist, So perfect on a hot day in September!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place on a previous trip to Montreal, and it was on our list of places to eat when we returned to the city this past week. We got 3 big plates to share: potato pancakes with sour cream, a mixture of cabbage and cheese pierogies, and a pancake \"thing\" filled with mushrooms. It was all SO good. We had our 3 year old with us, so we couldn't linger and really enjoy the food like we wanted to. We had some potato pancakes left over, and we took them back to the hotel to maybe eat later on. They were ice cold when I finally got to them, but I didn't care. I still ate them."}
{"text":"Now THIS was a hardcore polish restaurant that did everything right!
* Live music! A man played tons of different songs on the piano in an old-west type of style! There were some polish songs, some 80's songs, Katy Perry, Adele, and a bunch of others that I didn't recognise. 
* The waiters all seemed to speak polish, English, and French. I was super impressed by this fact alone because two languages is hard enough! They were super friendly and we got some laughs. We heard lots of laughs from other areas of the restaurant, too.
* The atmosphere was jubilant and friendly. It was comfortably noisy. Felt like a true polish restaurant. Oh, and go to the bathroom! The staircase up was totally medieval.
* Lots and lots of alcohol choices - and of course tons of vodka! Take a look at their placemats for a little giggle. Do it.
* The food. Oh my god, that food. Do yourself a favour and come here hungry. They had all the polish staples. The pierogi were simply fabulous, not too greasy with just the right amount of fried onion. It came with a truly polish cabbage salad. The potato pancakes (Placki) were delicious and came with a side of what seemed to be homemade sour cream. I myself and lactose intolerant, but my dinner mates gobbled it up along with their food. I'd suggest asking for apple sauce if you can't eat dairy. My dinner mates had the herring, barsht, goulash, and a couple other dishes (LOL they kept going and going and going) and they raved about it the whole trip home. 

So, basically, come here to eat. You will not regret it. Seriously. Go. Now."}
{"text":"Vegetarian heaven in old Montreal!!! My girlfriend and i orderd potato pancakes and crepe roll filled with mushroom and they were both yummy  the wait time was high but it was totally worthy. We didn't get to try the drinks but the bar counter sis look cool.. oh, I almost forgot to mention the dip alongside the crepe, it was fantastic and so fresh. Also, the price is pretty decent for fine food"}
{"text":"Was wandering the streets of Montreal in January of 2013 when my wife and I found this place. It was -18 outside when we passed by, and it was closed. Because of my Polish heritage, however, I wrote down the name and vowed that before we left the city, we would eat there.

I called from the hotel the next day, made a dinner reservation, and spent the day anxiously awaiting our trip to Stash Cafe. 

I grew up on Polish food. I don't have a grandmother on my mother's side. I have a Babci. She's been cooking polish food for me for 25 years. So, too, has my mother. The meal that I had at Stash Cafe that night with my wife stands up next to the cooking of my mother and my Babci as being some of the best Polish dishes I've ever eaten. 

I had the kielbasa. They were divine. Cooked absolutely PERFECTLY, with a side of potatoes that were out of this world. 

My wife had the pierogis, stuffed with cheese and potatoes. As good as the kielbasa was (and believe me, it was fantastic), I found myself envious of (and eating most of) her dinner. 

The next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be going back. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is fantastic (they have a piano player that comes in and dazzles), and the location is fantastic.

Oh, and don't forget to order dessert. 

(P.S. For those who said the service can be slow, take a step back to enjoy life. Not everything has to be fast/fast/fast go/go/go all the time)."}
{"text":"What a nice place. We had friendly service, very good food and with the comfortable atmosphere all made for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Avant de commencer, je dois dire que je ne connais rien à la cuisine polonaise et que ce restaurant constitue mon premier contact avec cette cuisine. Tout ce que je sais de la cuisine polonaise, c'est qu'elle comporte beaucoup de patates. Allons y maintenant pour la critique.

Côté ambiance, ce petit resto est parfait. La déco fait très \"vieille Europe\" et l'édifice historique dans lequel il est sis y contribue grandement. Je sais aussi que le soir, on y retrouve un pianiste qui joue de la musique très vivante et que l'endroit est souvent bondé en saison haute.

Côté service, c'est là que ça se gâte un peu. Les serveuses sont toutes très gentilles, mais bon Dieu qu'elles sont lentes! La journée où j'y suis allé, c'était un après-midi pas mal calme. Elles étaient trois au bar à ne rien faire et ça leur a pris beaucoup trop longtemps à me remarquer dans l'entrée. Cette lenteur aura été caractéristique de notre repas, l'allongeant bien plus qu'il s'en faut.

Côté bouffe, c'était bon, mais sans plus. En fait, je dirais que c'était ordinaire. Sourtout le dessert. Peut-être que c'était de l'excellente cuisine polonaise, je n'en sais rien, mais je ne sais pas si j'y retournerais... Le meilleur plat que j'ai mangé -- surprise totale -- c'était mon entrée : du hareng mariné servi avec des oignons rouges, une salade de pommes râpées et de la crème sûre, ça m'a beaucoup plu. Vint ensuite, un sanglier en daube aux oignons et au vin, avec chou rouge braisé et pommes de terre. Le sanglier était trop cuit pour être un rôti (ce qui était écrit au menu), mais pas assez pour être \"en daube\", donc relativement dur. La sauce était goûteuse, mais très grasse et les patates très fades. Mon élément préféré était le chou, qui acidulé, coupait bien le graisseux du reste de l'assiette. Vint enfin le pire élément du repas : une espèce de croustade aux pêches assez infecte. Le croustillant était mou, dans le genre \"j'ai plusieurs jours de réfrigération derrière moi\" et les fruits criaient la conserve. Le seul plus de l'assiette : le tout était noyé de smetana, une crème sûre sucrée. Hélas il n'y en avait pas assez pour masquer complètement le goût désagréable de cette chose. Mon compagnon, pour sa part, avait commandé le barszcz (version polonaise de la soupe aux betteraves ukrainiennes) goûteux, mais liquide, suivi de l'assiette du débutant, constituée de patates, de choucroute, de patates, de saucisse, de patates, le tout accompagné de patates. Ah j'oubliais : il avait aussi des patates. Son assiette n'était pas froide, mais pas chaude non plus, probablement à cause de la lenteur du service. Déjà que des pierogis ce n'est pas excellent, imaginez s'ils sont à peine tiède! Son dessert lui, était identique au mien, mais farci de pommes, ce qui le rendait un peu plus agréable, malgré la trop forte dose de canelle.

Voilà ma critique du Stash Café. Mon verdict? C'était intéressant de découvrir cette cuisine pratiquement inconnue, surtout au Québec, mais je n'y retournerai probablement pas. Par contre, si jamais j'y vais encore, je m'assurerai que ce sera à une heure de plus grand achalandage. Le service sera sûrement plus rapide et les plats encore chauds."}
{"text":"Great place - agree with the other reviewers. We had Borsch soup and the only thing to comment on was that we thought it should have had some chunks of actual beets
My wife had the Golabki (cabbage rolls) and loved it. I had the Pierogi and found it excellent. That and two glasses of Chopin vodka and St Ambroise beer topped it off. By the way, the piano player was enjoyable. The only sour note was our waitress who either had an attitude or ....

The other tables had a waiter who really seemed to go out of his way to please and explain the dishes - wish we had him"}
{"text":"Loved the food so much we went back the next day for drinks and appetizers, before we went over to Garde Manger. Really impressed with the selection and quality of the food, and highly recommend getting a number of appetizers to share. Once you decide on the appetizer you like the most, order it as a meal if you're staying for dinner. 

My favourite are the potato pancakes and make sure to ask for both the sour cream and the Apple sauce. Apple crumble for dessert if you have room."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked in for dinner without a reservation and were able to be seated with only two tables available . This restaurant is packed for a reason. The best potato pancakes we ever had and the pirogies with incredible sour kraut are not to be missed. The kielbasa was cooked perfectly, seared crisp on the outside and deliciously seasoned. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for 4 years.  The food is great at lunch or dinner.  Try the krokiety, you won't be disappointed.  I've been there for informal business lunches, meetups with friends, and candlelit dinners serenaded by their pianist.  One of the best restaurants in town for the location, ambiance, and food."}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Polish food. Nothing but Polish food on the menu; just as it should be. We stopped there only for a snack. We weren't all hungry, but after tasting some appetizers we ordered more. Flaki soup was the best my wife (who is from Poland) ever had. Our children are picky but we were able to get the pierogies without onion on top. The Krokiet was the best I've had with a nice crispyness. Best to call ahead for reservation! The live music was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Homemade pierogis were fabulous. Great ambiance, service, and food. So many places are really showy, and this hearty Polish resto hits the spot and saves some cash in your wallet."}
{"text":"It was quite by accident that we found ourselves at a second Polish restaurant in as many days during our recent visit to Montreal. We had made hasty reservations elsewhere but upon discovering that it had an ambience somewhere between a punk rock club and a frat party a quick change of plans was needed. It was Saturday night and Vieux Montreal was hopping; would we be stuck eating Poutine again? We spotted this place and it looked busy but it never hurts to try. Surprisingly and to our relief, she looked around and said just a few minutes and I can fit you in. Great!

So we sat on a bench inside while we waited and took in the ambience. It was completely full, with tables of all sizes densely packed. But not in a claustrophobic way. The effect was almost like a jigsaw puzzle: the tables as interlocking pieces filling the cozy historic stone-walled dining room. Soon our table was ready and we were escorted, right into the heart of the animated scene.

We looked at the menu and everything looked good, with all the standard Polish fare one would expect. But for some reason we were both attracted to the appetizers. There were six and we wanted them all. So we pointed to the appetizer page page and asked for \"one of everything\". Plus a salad.

Now probably appetizers are not the best way to judge a restaurant, as they can sometimes be rather simple and not where the chef shows off his talents. But no matter. They were all very good and exactly what we hoped for. We had: Krokiet (breaded crepe roll stuffed with meat and mushrooms), Placki (potato pancakes), Pierogies (pastries stuffed with various savory fillings), Kielbasa sauteed with onions, Sledz (picked herring), and something else which escapes me. All simple plain food, just what we expected and hoped for. The only surprise to me was the sauerkraut: much milder than I am used to, with less salt and vinegary tang. I liked it though.

I'd love to go back someday and try some of the entrees. Maybe next visit?

For dessert we got a slice of hazelnut cake. Plenty big enough to share. Good enough though not memorable.

Some Yelpers have mentioned problems with the service. I couldn't disagree more. Our server was efficient, friendly, and made us feel right at home from the moment we came inside.

I almost forgot to mention the piano player. He sat at an ancient upright piano and played throughout the evening. Mostly old jazz and jazzy renditions of old pop tunes. I only wish we would have played some Chopin (who was Polish). Be sure to tip him; he helped to make the place feel special."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I had on a weeklong road trip throughout New England and Montreal.

Ambience is dim, intimate, and punctuated with soothing piano interpretations of 20-40 year old pop songs. This place has a certain feel to it that I absolutely love, one that begins from the moment you enter the rustic wooden door. The ceiling feels like a rustic European beerhall with the plaster and wooden banisters, and I love the stone walls. The bathroom area is also above a beautiful stone spiral staircase. All of this just underscores the great ambiance.

The food is fantastic European comfort/fried offerings. We started with the cheese and potato pierogis (yum!) and potato pancakes/latkes (solid, but nothing special). For our meal we got the Chicken Schnitzel (wife) and Veal Schnitzel (me). Each came with a small potato side that was far superior to the latkes. I loved my dish - rich and flavorful - but my wife out ordered me here. The chicken paired with the coleslaw was so moist and crunchy at the same time!

Service was slow, but not rude or impolite (unlike some other experiences we had while in Montreal).

Bottom line: if you like polish food and are looking for a gem of a place to dine with a great atmosphere, do not skip this place!"}
{"text":"We're from the U. S. and we don't speak French, beyond a few common phrases. We were seated quickly and treated like we were an imposition, even though we go to great lengths to avoid the ugly (often well-founded) stereotypes of our fellow citizens. Our server was stoic to the point of surly with us, while chatting and laughing with nearby customers, who were also clearly tourists. We kept wondering what we had done. But, whatever, we don't need to be loved; just seemed like poor form. For what it's worth, the pieriogis, kraut, and kielbasa were adequate, but nothing special. We tipped 20%...we're not assholes."}
{"text":"Enjoy Polska cuisine in a rustic environment in downtown Montreal.
Don't miss the borsht, pirogies and specially the Snitzel with egg..simply delicious..All with a glass of Wiborowa vodka and a Zwieck beer..
Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place has really nice environment and if you want to focus your experience on conversation rather than food, this is definitely a good place to go. The ambiance is very romantic with piano performance and the good location can really enlarge your romantic night from dining to a nice stroll in old town Montreal. However, the food is really not so impressive."}
{"text":"So why go to a Polish restaurant while visiting Montreal? Well if it has great reviews, looks really inviting, and if it happens to be snowing and freezing outside (like it was when we went), then I think those are good enough reasons.

Actually I had one of the more distinctive soups that I've ever had at this restaurant, hence the four stars. I've looked everywhere but I really haven't found a place here in the Bay Area that could duplicate the \"zurek\" soup (sour rye malt soup) I had here. Simply wonderful...

Sure the sausages and pierogies were great as well, but on a cold winter's day that soup is what I remember most."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to experience the taste of the old country. 

The food is fresh, well plated, well portioned but lacks proper seasoning.Pierogi are probably the best dish - tender, light. Stay away from the schnitzel - it's tasteless.

Service is attentive. The place feels a bit like a cafeteria probably because of the cheap wooden tables and chairs. The restaurant is set In an old church and uses pews for some bench sitting. That's cute but not very practical unless you like to sit in the high school gym bleachers. 

I recommend it for lunch. It's fun and gives you a taste of the peasant food of the past. Good news is that you don't need to plow the field afterwards."}
{"text":"I've had several meals in Poland, and the food served at the Stash Cafe is very authentic. My wife & I shared a kielbasa appetizer. The sausage was served with sautéed onions and brown mustard - delicious! We both had pierogi for a main course. The plate generously came with eight pierogi and a side of sauerkraut. Our favorite of the group was potato and cheese. Service was appropriately attentive. Overall, we had an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Montreal restaurant that I'll actually willingly return to!  

I've been so disappointed by the Montreal restaurant scene, so I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The borsch soup, though wasn't so good. In fact, it was just a red, salty broth. I was expecting something with texture.

I ordered the debutant menu which featured a sampling of perogies, chopped sausage with sauerkraut, a deep-fried thing sorta like an egg roll with beef inside, and a potato pancake (latke?). Very nice. I just wish there was more sausage!

The dessert (apple strudel) was just okay and not at all like the strudels I've had elsewhere. A strudel should have layers, no? This one was more like an apple crumble - a soggy one at that. And the taste was nothing special. Next time, I'll just order a la carte and get a main dish without entree or dessert. 

In terms of value, I think it's overpriced for what you get, though. But since this is one of the few Montreal restaurants where I wasn't disappointed, I'll give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Wow.

My husband and I went to Old Towne yesterday and saw this little gem, but I had already agreed we'd pay homage to HIS heredity and have Phó (that review is also included!).  But, we tucked this in the back of our minds and I'm glad we did!

The staff was an extremely pleasant woman who was fluent in English, Polish, and French.  She was sweet, attentive, and knew the city like the back of her hand.  She recommended our vodka and suggested to accompany it with apple juice, a \"chaser\" if you will.  She said it was \"how the Polish do it\", so why not?  When in Rome.....It was smooth, strong, and I felt content immediately.  The turpentine aftertaste (all vodka does to me, regardless of brand, but some better than others!) was immediately quashed by the sweetness of the juice.  I will never drink vodka any other way hereafter!

I am an embarrassment to my Polish and Irish heritage - I hate cabbage (!) - so I went with the pierogies.  Cheese.  My husband was easily swayed into the  gobki.

My dish came artfully arranged with a sprinkle of dill, a heaping side of sauerkraut and carrot shaped into a rosette.  My husband's order was accompanied by a cucumber/dill sauce mix and sliced boiled potatoes.

The pierogies tasted like my Babçi came back to life and got work in their kitchen.  Very authentic.  Dipped in the side bowl of sour cream, it was delicious!

My husband inhaled his dish (and half of mine) within seconds, which usually is a sign he likes it.  The gobki appeared to have an abundance of ground meat, which is a nice change from the rice-laden  cabbage rolls I usually see.  He stated the tomatoes were an excellent topping, as it was a bit dry inside of the roll.  He found the cucumber/dill muxture to be divine.  Not his words, but \"wicked good\" isn't exactly poetry, but a good description nonetheless!

The ambience is divine and the bar nicely stocked.  (side note: the building's side door also gives access to bathrooms without going through the restaurant). Our waitress informed us live music is usually at the restaurant nightly of we wanted to cone back for dessert and Polish coffee (coffee with vodka....of course!)

The menu may have been simple and don't offer a huge array of options, but sometimes that can be overwhelming.  So points today for simplicity.

If you are a fan of Polish food - this is authentic as it gets.  A MUST when in Montreal and desire something different than American and after a few days in Quebec, something different than French!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Monday during lunch rush.  Restaurant was full of guests.  My nephew and I liked an ambiance a lot. Service was very good and attentive, very good selection of Polish food. We had ?urek, which was different than traditional Polish soup, too much of marjoram, no wild mushrooms, no hard boiled eggs, but it was tasty. Pierogies was the smallest I have ever seen, but very tasty. We had those to start the meal. Than krokiety, one meat and one mushroom, very good, flavorful, again: the smallest in size ever. My nephew had a special: crapes with melted cheese, ham and asparagus. Those were very good as well and very small. Both main dishes were accompanied with side salad, and in krokiety case, also potato salad. With salad arranged on a plate, the dish did not appear as small as it really was. We finished off with two fruit cobblers ( apple and peach one).  In short: we had appetizers, main meal and dessert, so were filled.  If we ate just a main meal for lunch, we would be hungry.  The prices were not bad, so we could buy more food. We are going to be back and try other dishes as well.  Overall we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Very solid sit-down. Nothing in particular is mind- blowing but most dishes are done well. Waitress is incredibly friendly and attentive so a plus for that. Recommend the pierogi and sausage-based dishes. Atmosphere is casual for lunch. Would recommend a stop if nearby but wouldn't go out of the way for a meal."}
{"text":"First time at a Polish restaurant. Was very surprised. Enjoyed the tasting menu for beginners. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Probably the best food I've had in Montreal!  We had some perogis and the fried pork chop.  Both were absolutely delicious!  Great sauerkraut accompanies most dishes.  Love the cute decor too.  Chocolate cake could use more cake and less cream, but really my only complaint.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Duck into this red-hue, low lit Vieux-Montreal restaurant for an epicurean experience of pure Polish comfort foods. The potato pancakes were just like my mother made and the pirogies are must-haves, the sauerkraut rich, and our main entrees satisfying, full of depth and flavor. You can taste the love cooked into these honest and hearty dishes. This is old-school dining at its best, a restaurant doing its thing without feeling compelled to be hip, fusion, trendy, or modern. And it works! 

Our waiter was pleasant, but did not ask to refill our wine. We could have easily been swayed into another carafe. Dessert menu was very limited, but we were pleasantly full from dinner to do more than glance at the selections. 

Verdict: Authentic restaurant in the heart of Vieux-Montreal is perfect on a cold night. A hearty mix of locals along with visitors is a good sign that the Stash Cafe is a smart pick in a city overflowing with dining options."}
{"text":"Not polish, but food was so good we went back again the 2nd night.  Service the first night was very poor.  Waiter said he was having a bad day.  Second night, a different waiter was extraordinary.  The piano music was excellent for quiet dinner and conversation."}
{"text":"Polish for dinner? Why not!  I wanted to do something different for a restaurant outing this time and chose to eat Polish food since I've never really had...plus it's so different from Asian cuisine. This place is just so cute with wooden-like decor and a piano player as a bonus. Each table had a fresh tulip in a vase and awesome lighting that reminds me of a jellyfish. 

The waiter was very attentive and the service was pleasant. I ordered this dish (which I will not name here but describe because I don't want to butcher the language) that was basically breaded fairly large nuggets that were made of ground pork with mushroom sauce/beet salad/potatoes. It was seriously satisfying and I really enjoyed it. Beet salad was quite delicious too! Not too sour/sweet.  My bf had the pierogies (sp? correct my spelling if it's wrong) but they are essentially Polish dumplings with mushroom, cheese, and potatoes. Those were enjoyable too. Portion sizes were just right and not overwhelming. 

The dinner was definitely different than what I usually am used to but I really recommend coming here because they have live piano playing, I'm assuming around dinner time. So not only do you get to eat awesome food, you get to hear awesome music playing! Not too shabby...not too shabby."}
{"text":"If you're looking for tasty authentic Polish comfort food, this is the place to visit.

They have homemade pierogi, bigos, flaki, and much much more (don't  forget to order a shot of Wyborowa, it's how a good meal is supposed to start).

It's very affordable and located in old Montreal, so you can go stroll around after your dinner and enjoy this beautiful area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it a lot. Good crowd going on a Thursday night when I pulled in by chance - just walking by. Menu looked interesting. Casual but cozy atmosphere. Scored a decent table despite just walking in off the street with no reservation on a Thurs night and was seated quickly.

Started with a chicken soup of the day and then the Sznycel Mielony - tasty ground meat with mushroom sauce served along with some fried potatoes and what I can only guess was some cabbage? should have asked, but it was good.

Limited wine menu by the glass but I found a Canadian Mission Hill cab from the Okanagan Valley that went nicely."}
{"text":"While exploring the Old Port, my friends and I stumbled upon this gem off the cobble stoned street of rue Saint-Paul Ouest. Wow, what a find! This place serves hearty Polish/East European cuisine in a low-lit intimate setting. And, did I mention at dirt cheap prices? No joke!

The staff here are very friendly, however note: The service is European-style. Do NOT expect prompt, speedy service with multiple check backs and all that. One person (when they're ready) will take your order, someone else brings your food, and then you pretty much linger..and linger, and so forth...But, its all good, if you go in expecting this type of laid back hospitality (similar to most restaurants in Montreal). 

We were encouraged to order some vodka to go with our meals...Yes!!! But, we were quite thirsty and each opted to have a nice 20oz pour of Montreal's foremost microbrew: Saint- Amboise for $7.00C. Great choice as it pairs well with this type of hearty cuisine.

For our meals we ordered a few different popular choices and turned our table into a Smorgasbord. Our choices: Pierogi, filled with meat and cheese, served with fresh sour cream $15.25C (best pierogi I've ever had, whaat??), Golabaki, meat stuffed cabbage served with potatoes and vegetables $12.75C (again, phenomenal), and Placki, potato pancakes served with fresh sour cream and sweet chunky homemade applesauce $11.25C (to die for!).

Needless to say, I will definitely be making this a routine spot to hit when ever I'm in the great city of Montreal. Between the quality of the food and gorgeous décor, ambiance and artwork which lines Stash's walls, one would expect to pay so much more. If you are a lover of Eastern European food, this place is a must. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stash Café has hearty, satisfying, stick-to-your-ribs fare. It's simple in it's approach without trendy foams, dusts, or smoke emanating from a glass dome. This is the kind of food I wished my Eastern European grandmother would have made had she been a better cook. 
Last night I came in with a pretty big party of family and friends. My sister and I shared the Placki (potato pancake appetizer) and they were thick but not heavy. Then we each had a plate of Krokiety, which is essentially a deep fried rolled up crepe, either with a mushroom or beef filling, and a mushroom sauce on top. It was served with a simple green salad and a dilly potato salad. This is one of my favorite dishes, and although I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms generally, this dish is somehow comforting - I even prefer the ones filled with mushroom! We were stuffed at that point, but I forced myself to share a portion of plum cobbler which was perfect for early fall and absolutely delicious! 
So why not 5 stars? The ambiance is nice, but when you have a larger party seated along pews, you cannot really talk to anyone except those next to you or across from you. Also, we had a lovely waitress, but she seemed over-worked, handling several tables and carrying out multiple dishes without tray, leading to her doing several trips (even for smaller tables). When the whole table isn't served at the same time, then those who are served have to wait, or the ones without a meal watch their companions start without them. 
TLDR; simple, honest, Polish comfort food."}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious but the atmosphere and service were excellent.  The staff helped us find the Coldroom, an underground bar with craft cocktails.  We really appreciated that, it was a great time."}
{"text":"Eight of us strolled in on a Tuesday for lunch.  We ordered multiple things including different varieties of perogie as well as a mushroom crepe, stuffed cabbage borsch, and pork cutlet.  The cutlet was crispy and tasty, truly the star of the meals.  The Perogi we well prepared (boiled) and quite tasty with the mushroom as well as the potato varieties being sampled.  The mushroom crepe was truly outstanding, full of mushrooms and was cooked to crispy perfection.  The borsch was decent and served hot. The stuffed cabbage was the minus one star from perfection.  It had a spice that didn't belong like rosemary or thyme.  Prepared well... but didn't go along with the amazing flavors of everything else."}
{"text":"What a great find for dinner!

This restaurant was super close to our hotel and it had some great reviews so I thought \"Why not?\". I'm sure glad we came here because we were treated to a lovely polish meal, something you definitely won't find in Colorado. 

There were only a couple of groups seated when we arrived so we had no trouble getting a table. Our servers were kind and very attentive. We ordered the pierogis (cabbage and mushroom), two house salads, and the stroganoff. Everything was so delicious!! The salads came out first and they were lightly coated in a delectable dressing that reminded me of a Caesar but definitely had something else in it. I finished every leaf of lettuce! Next the pierogi which I ordered as a meal but there were only four small ones on the plate. However, they were tasty! Soft, juicy and flavorful I could have eaten a lot more. I even enjoyed the side of sauerkraut and usually I hate the stuff so that was pretty cool. I got to try a bit of the stroganoff which was excellent; meaty with a hearty amount of mushrooms. However, the star of the plate in my opinion was the potato pancakes because they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. For some reason they also tasted like bacon?! I was definitely on board :)

In the end food is delicious, prices are fair and staff is friendly. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good food and nice atmosphere. The piano player was there and that was a nice touch. The beet soup is amazing. Salty but in a good way. Nice and clean. I had the Charcuterie plate. It was pretty good. The cheese wasn't anything special. I liked the Lard and the meat with prunes in the middle. Finally I finished with two kielbasa. They were amazing, nice and crisp and fresh, not as salty and fake tasting as store bought.

Try it out. It was worth sitting at the bar since it was Valentines day and the tables were all booked."}
{"text":"Great traditional polish food. The menu découvert (tasting menu) is great as you will have a bot of everything, their beets soup is delicious , for the pireogies I like their meet one :)"}
{"text":"I love this Polish resto! Today is my birthday and I was craving some good ole comfort food. Great ambience and the service has improved over the years. For starters I had a tomato soup with pasta and veggies which was quite tasteful. The Potato Latkes and Mixed Pirogies are the bomb, this is what I truly come for over and over. Reminds  me of my grandmother cooking. The finale was a cappuccino with a crepe filled with a sweet cheese and strawberry coulis. Wonderful for the pallet. Enjoyed all this wonderful food with a man playing the piano in the background!"}
{"text":"Authentic polish food. Lived up to my expectations. The beet soup was really good. Nice atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here, but I only came for brunch! They had a super simple eggs sunny side up with potatoes and sausage but it was done really well. 
Defiantly a go!!!"}
{"text":"Darling, warm, and inviting Polish restaurant in the heart of old port Montreal with live music, and helpful staff. 

PROS: delicious food, inviting ambience

CONS: it's a little pricey for what you get

If you're nervous about Polish food or don't know what to order, get the polish sausage dinner; it comes with two sides of your choice and anyone would love it, even picky eaters!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Totally authentic and absolutely delicious. We enjoyed every morsel. From the appetizers to the deserts, the chef did not disappoint.  Service was excellent, with a good range of cocktails, wine and beer, and a piano softly playing for ambiance, there is something for every palette. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"this is an amazing polish restaurant that knows how to serve some seriously good comfort food.

we got the last open table (without reservations) and we were so happy we did b/c dinner was awesome.

pierogies - holy sh*t, so so so good.  you don't need the sour cream.  just absolutely delicious.

house vegetable soup - sounded totally boring but i really wanted some veggies and it was possibly the BEST soup i have had in the last decade.  so much so that when i got home, i googled the recipe and tried to reproduce it at home.  that's how good it was.  

we both got the combo platter: beef wrapped in crepe, more pierogies, cabbage and pork, and potato cakes.  and more sour cream.  

fantastic and highly recommend.
unbelievable (in a good way) service."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good drinks. Highly recommend. Tasted more authentic than chicago. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe it. I've been to this amazing place many times but haven't reviewed it yet! I love this polish cafe. Everything from the late night ambiance with a piano playing in the background to the delicious food that never disappoints. If you're in the area of old Montreal there are a lot of great places to choose from but this place should definitely be high on your list.

I would heartily recommend the potato pancakes and the perogies (which flavour? Why not try them all!?). The staff are super friendly and will help you decide with excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"Love! The potato pancake appetizers were fantastic. The atmosphere is cozy with live piano playing but quiet enough for good conversation. Had the kielbasa dinner one night and cabbage rolls on another night - went twice in one week. Will come back the next time I'm in town for sure!"}
{"text":"found this great little spot while wondering around old mtl... the piano player and friendly staff (and the fact that my gf is polish) sealed the deal for a dinner choice! had the mushroom filled crepes and potato pancakes to start followed by the cabbage rolls and pork schnitzel... it was all delicious!!! good portions and very reasonable priced for a great meal! if youre looking for some comfort food this is a spot for you!! will deff try to come back!"}
{"text":"This was the Best upscale Polish restaurant I've ever been to! And I live near Hamtramck, MI. The original Polish Town. Ever bit of food that we ate was delicious! Can't say enough good about it!!"}
{"text":"Great polish cuisine! Perfect service. 
Tastes like good old polish home cooking.
I'll definitely come back when in Montreal"}
{"text":"Finally, Good food in Montreal. I was looking for good polish food and decided to try Stash Cafe. Very nice restaurant. There is a piano player and the ambiance is very relaxing. We ordered cabbage rolls, pork chop and pirogi. All we super good. Being from California, we never eat sauerkraut because it tastes terrible.  Many of the dishes came with sauerkraut and it was FANTASTIC. They make their own and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Make sure to get dessert also. :-)"}
{"text":"We ate here and were very happy. The space is romantic and the service was great. We even had a Polish waiter. I had the stroganoff with potato pancakes and salad. So yummy. My husband had the sausage plate and it was huge. The piano player and the open windows were a delight as it was warm for September. I definitely recommend. We are even considering going again tonight!"}
{"text":"Great polish place. Food was great. Lovely service. Very spacious. Portions are not huge but big enough to leave place full."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it was excellent both times.  Last night I went with my family - great food and atmosphere.  We had platki, pierogi, and kielbasa and all were delicious.  Very reasonable.  Cool art and live piano.  Try the bison vodka!"}
{"text":"My wife is from Poland...so when we checked into this cute restaurant in Old Montreal, she felt like she had been shipped back to Krakow upon entering.

My wife has me hooked on borscht, and I have become quite the borscht snob. I have had beat soup from her mother and from a Greenpoint restaurant. So when I tasted this version, I looked up at my equally disappointed wife. It was as if they had just made some powdered beat soup they picked up from a local supermarket.

We were then given some pierogies, and score! They made up for the soup, with some deliciously made pierogies. We then had a few Polish beers to end a decent dining experience.

It is family run and the waiters were from Poland. They even had a strong accent and spoke the language to my wife.

Very cute place...loses 2 points for the awful soup, and at times slow service."}
{"text":"If you can only eat one place this is it!
Service is outstanding 
Prices are very reasonable 
The menu selection is very good 
My food was prepared perfectly 
My wife's order was also perfect 
Now the desert prepare to be overwhelmed this was great to say the least 

Of all the places we have eaten this was the best."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the piano player with his fun cover songs.  The kielbasa is good, but the pierogies were the best.  The potato salad was not really to my liking, but perhaps that's just me.  Overall, I definitely enjoyed dinner there."}
{"text":"\"Great Polish Restaurant\"

Think about your favorite ethnic neighborhood restaurant , the one your return to time and time again because multiple entries are delicious and the service and atmosphere never lets you down. That's Stash, a reasonably priced polish restaurant in Vieux Montreal.

We had

Golabki -Two cabbage rolls filled with pork and rice, served with potatoes,

Krokiety-Two breaded crepe rolls filled with meat or mushrooms, and a creamy mushroom sauce

YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plus dessert! YUM !!!!!!!!!

Suggest reservations as it does fill up .

    Visited July 2016"}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place as we explored Old Montreal. As we walked by the storefront, someone opened the door and we heard the piano playing and we were just drawn inside. We didn't have a reservation so we were thankful they were able to seat us at the bar. 

The place has an incredible vibe, between the jazz music, the dim lighting, the old features. We ordered the entree of pierogies and the potato pancakes. And, to be really honest, I'm not sure I've eaten anything better in my life. The pierogies are topped with these perfect little onions that add the perfect flavor. The potato pancakes are crispy and flavorful. We both cried as we realized we had gone through the food so fast and ended up cutting our last pierogies into the tiniest bites in hopes to savor it for a little while longer. 

I'll be dreaming about this place until I make my way back to Montreal. In fact, I'll probably plan a trip just so that I can eat those pierogies again."}
{"text":"If you are in old Montreal, you MUST go to Cafe Stash. This was by far THE most memorable meal that I had in all of Montreal -- from the historic building, to the great beer selection, to the unreal food.  It was a great experience.  I would highly recommend the perogies (but I guess that goes without saying...)"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 4 stars as the food is good, but based on the three visits I have to go with one star. 

The first time at the Stash we ordered Pirogi and another dish. Then the Pirogi arrived it had a wrong filling and instead of the 8 pieces as started on the menu there was only 7 pieces on the plate. The mistake was corrected with a new plate from the kitchen. 

Second time at the Stash ordered Pirogi and another dish. Again received Pirogi with wrong filling. Had to wait for correct order to arrive from the kitchen. 

The third time ordered Duck and another dish. After 1 hour and 20 minutes nothing arrived. Inquired with the waiter three times about the food and each time were told that it is almost ready. Customers at three tables around all arrived after we were seated and all had their appetizers and main dishes served and finished while we were still waiting for our food. Our waiter was unpleasant and unfriendly. After 1 hour and 20 minutes we got up and left hungry and angry. Extremely disappointing! I don't know if they forgot to put the order in or did not have a duck to serve, but there should of been a way to avoid this. Give a customer an appetizer or something... Be honest... Be friendly... You can't make people wait for food for an hour and 20 minutes... If the duck is not ready to be served serve the other items that were ordered. Offer something on the house... Do something!

I am greatly disappointed in Stash. The food that we tried was good, but overall I can't recommend it. There are gazillion great food places in Montreal and Stash simply does not cut it."}
{"text":"Oh man!! What can I say about Stash!! This place is just incredible!! One of the best restaurants in Montreal!! You will for sure miss out on something VERY special if you don't come here!! Perogies, kielbasa, potato pancakes, hunter soup (cabbage stew with meats) was all incredible!!!! I wish I could \"live at the restaurant...\""}
{"text":"Good Polish food in a charming atmosphere.

I  dined here a few days ago and to get a feel for the place ordered the 'sampler plate' - the Table d'Hote's Menu du Debutante. For my appetizer I chose the the Sledz - a very tasty 'herring salad' wrapped in a herring filet. For the entree plate itself the Pierogies were the star of the car - plump and tasty and perfect. The Placki (potato pancakes) were delicious as well - though I would have liked a bit of apple sauce to go with the sour cream. On the other hand the Krokiet (croquette) was kind of bland for a fried crepe filled with meat. But most disappointing was the Bigos (cabbage stew with meat and mushrooms) which was oddly flavorless given the ingredients. The Menu du Dubutante comes with a small fruit cobbler but I instead ordered the Hazelnet cake - creamy and nutty and delicious. I paired all this with a St-Ambroise Oatmeal Stout and coffee.

If I were to do it again I think I would try the vegetarian version of the Menu du Debutante - getting the mushroom Krokiet and cheese/potato or cabbage/mushroom Pierogies. Or just stick with the Pierogies.

As I mentioned the atmosphere is charming and there is a small bar off to one side of the restaurant. As for the service...it was brusque yet efficient and aggressively polite almost to point of rudeness. It took me back to any number of Eastern European restaurants I've visited in the past."}
{"text":"Great casual Polish food.  We split the pancakes and the pierogis with a mix of meat, mushroom and potato/cheese for the latter.  All solid and tasty washed down with a beer.  Wish we had room for dessert.  I'd recommend going with the sour cream rather than the apple sauce but that's me."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was really good! I love the decor in this place. The food was very well cooked and the pierogies were amazing! The only reason why they don't get 5 stars is because the waiter was taking his sweet time by talking to someone else."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, reasonable price, a little shy but kind employees, the good atmosphere.
What else you need. It opened our beautiful weekend with great brunch menus."}
{"text":"I've had pierogis and kielbasa before, but I'd never really had much else.  I was really hesitant to go here, but my husband really wanted to try it, so we went.  I'm really glad we did!  I did the 3-course prix fixe menu.  

I started with the zurek soup, which was really good.  I was hesitant about the soup, too, because it was described on the menu as a sour rye soup, which doesn't sound appetizing to me.  But I figured I should try it.  It wasn't really that sour, but it was GOOD.  Like pieces of sausage floating around in sausage-flavored broth.  

Entree I had the dish that came with pierogis, potato pancakes, a potato crepe thing, and cabbage and sausage stew.  It was a lot of food and all of it was really good.  For dessert I had the apple cobbler, which was good, but nothing special.  

For all 3 courses (plus coffee/tea), it was $29.  We were stuffed afterwards, so it was a pretty good deal for the money.  We met a Polish couple there who raved about the food as well, so it had to have been authentic-tasting, too, right?  Would definitely recommend going here!!!

TIP: Make a reservation for weekend dinners!"}
{"text":"Truly superb food, ambiance and staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the fam on vacation.  Delicious food, nice service.  Everything tasted good from the pierogis, cabbage rolls, crepes and schnitzel.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"5 stars! First time trying Polish cuisine and was extremely satisfied.  Reccomend the perogis and stroganoff!  Also the house voldka"}
{"text":"They actually had room for all 7 of us with same day reservations!!!! Food was delicious and atmosphere was cozy with nice background music"}
{"text":"Located on Rue Saint Paul, Stash Cafe claims to be a family owned Polish restaurant. The place looks cozy with vintage wooden furniture and red lamps. There's a Piano at the entrance.  There will be someone playin the piano everyday after  6 pm. Don't forget to tip em. The owner of the place is really cool. I was sitting at the bar and chatting with her. I told her I'm new in Montreal & she was suggesting me good local restaurants. Also visit their washroom if you get a chance. Worth the trip O_O
                Food is fresh. Portions are generous. It seems to be a bit pricey, but Its a fancy place in Old Montreal so I saw this coming. All in all a good place to visit if you crave for polish food

Food -  Good
Service - friendly
Ambiance - Cosy
Worth the money - Um.... Uh.... Yes     o_O"}
{"text":"Super happy with our meal. We enjoy Polish food when we can find it and this little restaurant is a gem. we started with the Borscht, a beet broth soup that was served hot with a dollop of sour cream. Then some fresh Rye bread with butter. For the main course we all ended up getting the mixed plate. It had Perogies, a Potato Pancake, a meat croquet, and the most delicious sauerkraut! It was rich and filling. The sauerkraut was cooked with beef and sausage providing a flavor that was out of this world!!! The meal ended with coffee and a fruit cobbler of choice. I had the peach with creme-fresh on top! The ambiance was comfortable and the service was wonderful. We felt welcome as guests of the restaurant and our server made sure that all of our needs were met. If I lived closer, I would become a regular."}
{"text":"I'm Polish and my fiancé is Ukrainian.  We were walking around the Old Town for the first time on a trip to Montreal for my birthday and literally stumbled upon it.  We checked the menu and it had all of the great food we grew up with, everything looked great, so we went inside.  To be honest, I was prepared to be disappointed based on my experience visiting Polish restaurants in the United States - but what a very pleasant surprise!  The decorating was a nice mix of old Montreal, dark and light wood, but with an agreeable dash of more modern Polish artwork.  Seating was very comfortable and a nice change from the tiny tables other restaurants have. 

The food... was fantastic. By far, the most authentic and identical to the homemade and dishes I grew up with.  The piergories, the second best I've had compared to my mom's.  The potato pancakes - perfect and served with apple sauce and sour cream.  (These are very hard to do right - they were spot on!)  Not too heavy and not to dry, the right mix of crispy outside and tasty inside.  My fiancé had the fish stew which comes with larger hearty pieces of delicious white fish in a tomato-like stew with vegetables.  This is not my personal favorite, but I liked it.

Good selection of Polish beers, vodka and a full bar.  Service was very pleasant, and not slow. The food is definitely made fresh every day and well worth waiting for.  As another reviewer mentioned, even on the first visit - you feel as if you have been here before and already know everyone.  We finished our meal with homemade apple strudel served with a light sour cream sauce.  Price - was very reasonable and the portions are perfect (although you will be tempted to order more to explore the menu deeper!)

One of the most pleasant experiences during our trip to Montreal - not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Authentic polish restaurant with a cozy romantic feel!!! Ambiance was lovely: they had a live pianist serenading us during dinner. 

We tried: 
Golabki (cabbage rolls): absolutely delicious!! It takes so much work to perfect this dish; first you pickle the cabbage, then the filling,  assemble it together before baking with lard on top. Balanced flavours and hearty meal with a side of potatoes and cucumber salad. 

Bigos (meaty-stew): great flavours!!! Very generous serving. Warm and hearty stew.  

Bottom line: warm hearty meals with the perfect amount of lard to enhance the flavoursd in a cozy romantic setting with live music!! What more can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Stash after visiting Notre Dame. It is a short walk for scrumptious Polish food.

We enjoyed and shared leak soup (packed with many veggies), potato pancakes, beef/mushroom stroganoff, beet salad, beef-cheese-dumplings, and sauerkraut. 
It was soooo good! I wholeheartedly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is fancy Polish food. I've only been to homey, blue collar Polish restaurants in the US. I got my favorite dish, Bigos. It wasn't the best Bigos I've ever had but still really good.

They have Zywiec. You should drink that when eating Polish food. :)

There aren't a lot of good, not too overpriced restaurants in Old Montreal, so this is a gem!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, the pirogi's were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were tasty.  I loved their beet soup and the kielbasas."}
{"text":"Drinks, super friendly staff, amazing live music, out of the world potato pancakes.  What more can you ask for?

We were here 2 consecutive nights and enjoyed both experiences. They have an interesting selection for drinks.  You must order food in order to be served drinks - apparently for legal reasons!  We even tried the vodka in pickled juice just for kicks and it turned out to be pretty good.

The food here is amazing.  Whether it be the polish sausage, veal, pirogies, the polish dinner or desserts.  The potato pancakes are undoubtedly the best you can ever taste.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very casual and the live pianist in the evening makes it even better.  Parking can be tricky around here.

Pricing : Not an inexpensive place but you get the value for your money.

Will I return? : Definitely!"}
{"text":"We always go there when we are in Montreal. The ambiance is great and service is always nice and efficient. It is a place to relax, talk and enjoy the atmosphere. 

The food is great. Authentic Polish dishes like the pierogi are the highlight of the menu. I always order the dish that had four different samples of Polish staples. We had dessert the last time we were there and it was delicious. For me, the best option in Vieux Montréal."}
{"text":"We saw polish food and wanted to try it out. The pierogi appetizer was a delicious start. We also hd the veal schnitzel and krokiety for entrees. Everything tasted fresh and homemade. Must try it out."}
{"text":"JJ and I needed a late lunch after doing some touristy things in Montréal, so we walked into Stash mid-afternoon and snagged a table. First things first, Stash serves Polish food, so there was of course a vodka list. JJ ordered a Belvedere, which was startlingly cheap (CA$7). I ordered myself an IPA, and we settled down to look at the menu.

I ordered some cheese and potato pierogis for us to share, which were pillows of heaven and came with a side of sauerkraut that I was initially wary of, but gobbled down once I got a taste. I also had beef stroganoff, which was rich, hearty, and arrived with a side of potato pancakes and beet salad (shredded). I was perfectly satiated by the time I finished my food. Service was on point, especially once the vodka got flowing. We finished our delicious meal and headed reluctantly back out into the cold.

As a final note, I thought I hated sauerkraut. Turns out I've just never eaten it when it's been made properly. If you're in the same boat, or if you really need some good pierogis, stop by Stash and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Visited on a trip to Montreal with family. Kids loved the food as well. Highlight was the live music by an great pianist. Very comfortable place for a great family dinner."}
{"text":"My mother in law would laugh at the portion sizes and what they charge for them.  With that being said, the food is absolutely authentic and delicious.  We had the pierogi, sausage, and golabki with sides of sauerkraut, potato salad and beet salad.  

The atmosphere was very good and the waiter and hostess were very friendly. 

The bathroom is up this windy staircase so hold off on the alcohol or hold off on the peeing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Cool setting, live piano music, great Polish food. The zurek was great (and something I hadn't tried before), borscht was good, pierogies were (as expected) excellent."}
{"text":"Pour le deuxième fois nous sommes ici. On a juste fini demander les plats maintenant, mais je me sen pas bien parce que l'attitude de ce serveuse est très mal. C'est une première fois que je sen ça à Montréal."}
{"text":"Good service! Cool vibe & decent polish food."}
{"text":"The cabbage pierogi are sooooo incredible ... delicate and delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute, quiet cosy resto. Service is pleasant and prompt.  The lunch special is only $14 and includes a soup and main dish. The perogi plate is only $14 and covered with caramelized onions, sauteed shredded cabbage and sour cream. 

I asked for a mixed plate of perogies: meat, cheese & potato, mushroom and cabbage. But the meat one was the best tasting of them all."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home. It's just warm, and inviting and large windows that has a nostalgic view of Montreal streets. Lots of natural wood, and natural lighting from outside. Who wouldn't love it here.

 I've never had polish food before and this was one of those places that you would visit again. Decent portions for the price and all around great food to classic dishes. I had the Poranek Polki - 2 sunny side up eggs with potatoe pancakes. My friends had the Zapiekana. I would save the level of comfort food is equivalent to grilled cheese with tomato soup on a rainy day."}
{"text":"The bigos stew is delicious and hearty. The atmosphere is great, with piano playing and comfortable lighting and seating. Very friendly staff, with good beers on the menu. Great Polish treat in beautiful Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the service was prompt. They are child friendly but only if your kid is potty trained. There are no change tables making having you get child difficult to deal with in such a nice place"}
{"text":"I knew when this place was very popular with the locals it had to be good. We go to Montreal every year and don't miss eating dinner here. The wait staff seems like family and that's just how you are treated. At times they have a piano player who adds to the room. Not very large but they have seated large party's in the middle by putting tables together. When you are a party of two they just separate the table of four a little. Last year they actually had a chef grilling outside on the sidewalk. The kitchen is downstairs and service is efficient. Very small bar and I have eaten at the bar when no tables were available. The desserts are in a case next to the bar area, save room even if you normally don't eat dessert. I often take mine home because it's so good. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a tip from a friend. What a tip!!  The Bloody Pollock was smart and tangy with just the right amount of horseradish.  The Kalabasa was delicious, the sauerkraut was wonderful and the potatoes were potatoes.  Service was spectacular. The ambience was very quaint and the piano player added the crowning touch. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Service was fantastic and the live piano that started at 6pm cinched it. I had the platter, which came with a starter soup, main plate with pirogies, a meat filled croquette, potato pancake and pork & cabbage stew. The whole thing was followed by a peach crumble with a generous serving of cream and green tea (you could choose from other teas and coffee). If I had to criticize anything, the platter was very heavy, all one colour and salty. I couldn't finish the croquette which felt dry. The pirogies were the best part: covered in caramelized onions and half filled with meat and the other half were filled with potato and cheese. The potato pancake balanced the salty stew. I would come back for the pirogies, live music, great service and cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"I came to Stash on a friend's recommendation, and left pleasantly surprised. The pork rolled in cabbage and mixed pierogis were both delicious. Both tasted homemade, in a good way. 

I had to knock off one star because they appeared to be understaffed. A couple diners near us decided to leave due to inattentive service (i.e. not getting water or menus) while we were there. Even though the restaurant was half empty at the time, the one waiter who was working couldn't keep up."}
{"text":"Walking around Old Montreal, we got hungry.   We saw this cute corner cafe with lots of people inside, so we decided to check it out.

The staff seems very unorganized.   We waited a long time to have someone greet us or take our name.    Finally my BF approached someone and things got a bit more organized.   We got seated about 10-15 min after our arrival. 

We decided to get some small plates:  Krokiet, Kielbasa, Pierogies and Placki.    All of them were very good.   The Kielbasa was a bit salty, but not bad.   The Placki were crispy, crunchy, excellent.

Advise to make reservations if you can, that will help with the wait.     They have a full bar and take credit cards."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. Hubby is Polish and was in pierogi heaven! He had the mushroom as well as cheese versions and was equally satisfied with both.

I tried the szyncel which was heavenly, ground pork patties that are crumbed. The meat was flavorful and the mushroom sauce served with the dish was divine, ask for extra mushroom sauce!

The only thing that let the place down was the service. We waited a long time for a table as the waiters would not seat us since the hostess was on a telephone call and the food took quite a while to come out. This is forgiven as the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Do not miss this place! Loved everything about this place from the ambiance and the piano player, to the food, to the service. Everything was cooked to perfection. The potato pancakes were much more crisp than the traditional latkes i have generally had which tend to be a bit more doughy - they were delicious! The pierogis were all amazing! I tried all 3 flavors and the crispy onions they sprinkled on them were so good. Then their plum cobbler for dessert, oh my goodness...i was absolutely stuffed but I wish I could return.  Even their sauerkraut that came with the pierogis was amazing and i normally HATE sauerkraut but this was sweet!"}
{"text":"Hello everyone !
Were  at this place about month ago . For dinner . Came especially because of live piano music. Came around 8.30 pm for dinner and live music was already finished . What sense to lie people that you have dinner with live music ? Do both understand .
I definitely know what means polish food same as all European food as we are from eastern part of Europe . PEOPLE ATTENTION: this place is extremely overpriced and they have no any idea what is Eastern Europe food ! This is probably interesting for tourists who never tried European food and not aware how it should look like . Prices are overpriced but if it was good real authentic polish food I would never write this kind of review ! 
!!!!!Polish borsch !!!!: it was just water of beet color without nothing inside . Just water !!!!! Looked like liquid from CANNED BEETS ROOTS from grocery store for 2  dollars a can  .OMG it was disaster , not borsch ! Just go google and check real photos of polish borsch and thin ten times before ordering borsch at this place !!! 
We ordered two glasses  of wine and never even see our waitress again to propose us any other wine or water or whatever ...... BECAUSE SHE WAS BUSY !!! She was having her dinner just in from of us at bar counter . She was eating so rushly and greedy , tasting all her fingers all the time !!! After 20 min we ask another girl what problem with our waiter and she just answered - she is busy she is eating habits !!!! SERIOUSLY !!!!!! You have customers oh my god and you are in Canada , what kind of service you provide to your customers for prices you take from them??!?!?!"}
{"text":"Such delicious Polish food, some of the best I've had outside of home kitchens! Very unexpected in Montreal, but this was the only place that was recommended to me by name by friends who visited the area - that says something!

The food was great, the service was exceptional, and it was overall an exceptional experience. I got the menu du débutant, and it gives you a great sample of different food, and it kept me full for hours after.

I visited for lunch on a Saturday and I had no reservations and did not have to wait for a table - worth considering!"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. The stone walls are stunning. Visit the restroom just to see the fab staircase. Perigees are a must. Also had the potato pancakes (perfectly done) and the cabbage stew (kind of one note). We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in Krackow and Warsaw last summer and really enjoyed Polish food, it was on point. We passed this restaurant as were searching for our meal and on a Saturday in old Montreal, good luck trying to get a table. We waited 20 minutes and it was well worth it. The schnitzel was not greasy and light. The potato pancakes are to die for..ligt and crispy. The goulash flank steak with mushroom sauce was delicious with the best red beet salad!   
The atmosphere was great, decent prices and the service was excellent. Must try that is diffrent from the rest of the tourist trap."}
{"text":"Yum. We really liked this place. Service was super friendly and fast. The good was delicious. We had the perogies to start, then we shared the breaded pork and the steak in red wine sauce. The potato pancakes were delicious! Some reviews say it is a bit pricey but I thought it was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in Old Montreal. Customer service was friendly and especially I liked the interior design, fresh roses on each table.
We ordered Bigos dish but were brought Stroganoff instead (I think the waiter mixed up the orders because we did have some questions about their Stroganoff). We wanted to return it at first but we were in a hurry so just kept the dish, and it was good. I did not like the fact that Stroganoff came with potato pancakes, that's just too greasy, I would have preferred boiled potatoes instead.
I ordered barszcz soup and it was just a simple beet broth. I was told this is traditional Polish barszcz. It was good but I prefer regular borscht that comes with beets and veggies inside. So I think that $5 for just a broth is too expensive.
We also ordered Pierogis appetizer: 4 different Pierogis (meat, cheese and potatoes, and cabbage and mushrooms). I was not a fan of this dish, also very expensive ($7).
I would come back to try another dish, but wouldn't order their small and expensive appetizers."}
{"text":"Polish colleague of mine brought me to Stash Cafe  years ago and the restaurant was on my list to revisit since then. We were a group of nine and at first we started kind of slowly with the drinks and orders, as soon as our choice was made appetizers and mains started coming quickly, and orderly. 

The food in Stash was perfect for the rainy fall evening, filling, warming and quite delicious. I had the tripe soup, which was amazing, very well seasoned and the tripe was excellently cooked. The two starters we tried were the herring, single piece of fish garnished with apples and sour cream, and the  potato pancakes. The potato cakes were just Ok, but I'm a big fan of the herring. The main courses were perfectly prepared. If you opt for schnitzel you would not regret and it comes with wonderful red beet salad. The star of the dinner with no doubt were the pierogi, there are three flavours to choose from, the meat ones being my favourite. We naturally went with the Polish and Czech beers as a drink choice, but the menu offers good wine list and some vodkas if you'd like to consume your herring appropriately. 

The restaurant has cute atmoshphere, the little benches used for seating may be a little bit uncomfortable if you fit three grown up people in them. However, the good food compensates for it. The live piano performance is wonderful. I can easily see myself coming again for some soup and pierogi, and glass or more of wine."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Their potato pancakes were delicious (Would have never thought to put so much garlic and sour cream and applesauce on it). Their dumplings were also very yummy and I had the tripe soup which was, once again, very yummy. Their dessert was also wonderful-- I had the hazelnut cake and it was the perfect, decadent end to a perfect meal. The service was also very professional. I would love to go here with my significant other."}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief: get the potato pancakes.

I still can't get over how good they were. They were hands-down the best I've ever had in my short 26 years of life. I don't know how \"traditional\" they were, but if your Polish grandma makes potato pancakes that aren't like these, she makes them objectively worse.

Seriously, these pancakes exist on a local maximum of the hyper-dimensional pancake tastiness function: there is no possible step you could take that could make these pancakes taste better. They were *magically* savory in a way I can't describe. They were delicious enough to eat by themselves, but still played well with the applesauce we ordered as a side.  Side note: I had never had a pancake so good that I was reluctant to mask its flavor with applesauce, but here we are.

Everything else we ordered as solidly above-average Polish food. The pierogies were nice, and it was great we could sample all the different flavors with one order. I tricked my girlfriend into getting the black sausage, which was good as far as blood sausages go. It reminded me a little bit of haggis, but with less intense spices. I'd probably skip that unless you're ok with blander flavors. (I do like haggis, by the way.)

The atmosphere reminded me a little bit of the Russian Tea Room in NYC, but more approachable.  Another pro-tip: if you're older or disabled, feel free to use the elevator up to the bathroom--the stairs are pretty steep and I saw an elderly lady having a little trouble climbing them!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous and so is the service! Pierogies were better than I excepted. My waiter was great and was quick at serving us. The seat by the open window really made the whole experience really good. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I loved the pierogies, I got a mixture of different types. I thought the meat and the cheese piergoies were the tastiest. A side of sour cream also comes on the side. Enjoyed the borscht which was also very tasty. They also have a three plate course. One of the desserts was a sorbet which was tasty. Definitely try this place if you like polish food. Cute decor too."}
{"text":"This place is worth the trip without question!  I had the beef stroganoff and it was delicious. The garlic soup was amazing and I never knew I liked beets until I had theirs. No heavy earthy flavor, but light and delicious. Had an amazing server that was attentive and helpful. Live music would have been the icing on the night, since the piano player was so good, but the hot Mead wine for dessert topped the night off great!  Loved it !!!"}
{"text":"Who knew the best food we would eat during our Montreal trip would be Polish food? This was the first meal we had, late night, after driving 7 hours from NY. It was cold and rainy outside but stepping into this restaurant, we instantly felt warm and cozy. The space is small and intimate and quite romantic with the red lampshades. We had two overtired and hungry kids in tow so too bad it wasn't as romantic for us...but they graciously sat us in the corner of the room where we could put our stroller near the table. 

We ordered conservatively at first but after clearing our plates in 5 minutes we had to order more. The food was so comforting and delicious, and I didn't even know I liked Polish food. We ordered: KROKIET, Breaded crepe roll filled with beef and mushrooms
PIEROGI
PLACKI: Potato pancakes
KIELBASA
STROGONOW: Beef Stroganoff
SZNYCEL WIEDENSKI: Breaded veal schnitzel served with sunny side up egg

The veal schnitzel was a bit bland so we asked for a side of the mushroom gravy to top it and it was perfect. We also enjoyed coffee and a big slice of chocolate cake to share afterwards. 

A perfect meal to start our Montreal trip! 

Service was a bit slow but it was expected because there was a large party dining in the middle of the room."}
{"text":"Amazing sweet crepes - potato pan cakes. Don't miss the coffee and the mimosas. It's easier to get a place and nice ambience and diverse polish cuisine touch."}
{"text":"Stash cafe was delicious! Based on other reviewers, we ordered the potato pancakes, which were delicious. For my main, I ordered the pierogies; my personal favorite was the potato and cheese filling but the beef and mushroom/cabbage fillings were also delicious. My mom raved about her kielbasa, and the rest of my table were satisfied with their dishes too.

Overall, Stash Cafe's food is wholesome and hearty; perfect for a cold day. It's hard to believe how they can make meat and potatoes so flavorful and sophisticated!"}
{"text":"The Polish food here was very good. The service was very proper. 

Started with warm beet soup, which was clear and tasty. 

Shared the Polish sausage and onion plate, pierogis, and stuffed cabbage.

All food well prepared and portions generous. 

I would return to Stash Cafe."}
{"text":"Everything i tried here was excellent. If my polish friend says this is the only polish place her mother will eat at, then i know it's good. 

And i'm not kidding when i say everything on the menu tastes authentic and loved. 

The places is also very cool hidden in old montreal, it has a unique charm. The piano adds warmth and the awesomely cute sexy and nice waitresses makes it a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We stopped here while walking around Old Montreal because a lot of the other restaurants were more expensive. The food was very tasty and arrived quickly, and the staff was very professional and spoke English and French, which was helpful as nobody in my group speaks much French."}
{"text":"This was an accidental wander up to menu and decide on whim to go in; good decision! Cloud like Peroigi; a perfect beet borscht; eggs w sautéed spinach and potato cakes.  Nice nice service too."}
{"text":"On the plus side, Stash Cafe has nice ambiance and excellent service. I loved the piano player. He had a wicked sense of humor and played some very interesting melodies such as David Bowie's Major Tom and lots of old TV themes and hits from the 80s.

The food unfortunately was just average. We had their wild boar special and it was a little over cooked with way too much sauce.  Maybe this was an off night for the chef.

Will definitely give this place another try when I am back in Montreal. May stick to the simpler polish dishes like pirogi and sausage next time."}
{"text":"Mmm...Polish food.  Stash is a great place to try Polish food.  The cuisine has both simple dishes (prepared to taste anything but simple or boring) for the timid eater like pierogi or pork chops as well as dishes that pack a wallop of flavor like zurek (sour soup) or bigos (stew with meat and sour cabbage).

Friendly service and tasty food."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant polonais dans le vieux super choix pour un souper intime en amoureux. J'ai adoré les crêpes que j'ai choisies, l'ambiance était superbe avec un fond de piano. Très bon service aimable et chaleureux je recommande fortement"}
{"text":"Perhaps a Polish restaurant seems out of place in Vieux-Montréal? Well worry not, since this one's definitely worth a visit.

I, too, was planning to go somewhere more French, but I ended up here for dinner and definitely don't regret it. The ambiance inside is classy and comfortable: prints hanging on the walls, a pianist playing in the corner, and red lighting giving the whole restaurant an eerie glow. It feels like stepping out of Montréal and into a different country.

For food, I got the \"Menu du Débutant\" Table d'Hôte. The starter was a piping hot borscht. The main course was a hearty collection of different appetizers (pierogi, a potato pancake, a croquette, and bigots). And for dessert, I got an apple cobbler with cream (good but unremarkable).

Overall it was a tasty meal and a fun experience. Pay Stash a visit if you want something unique and different for your next meal."}
{"text":"We were staying in Old Montreal during a conference my husband attended in late October. We were looking for a family friendly restaurant near out hotel with decent food and this fit the bill and the food was excellent, I'm half Polish and know good Polish food. 

We had pierogi, potato pancakes and cabbage rolls and all tasted like my grandma's homemade dishes, only better (sorry grandma).  The waiter was pleasant and social and when we forgot our bib after our meal, he called our hotel and let us know!

Great food, great atmosphere, live piano during dinner--all around great experience!  Will visit again when we return to Montreal."}
{"text":"While on Montreal for business for a few days and staying in the old town, I have bumped into this traditional polish restaurant for a casual dinner.

This is an old school classic eastern european restaurant that has lots of tradition and less novelty. 

The food now, what can I say? good borsh (sour beet soup), really good pierogi (which is the polish equivalent for ravioli), an excellent polish sausage and some mighty fine polish and Lithuanian beer were sampled.

bottom line: everything was good and service was great!

The atmosphere is very warm, the owners and the people who work there all speak polish, French and English. the place is very warm and features live piano on evenings."}
{"text":"One reviewer below went on & on about how she knows Eastern European food & how Stash is probably good for tourists who basically don't know better. I must strongly disagree with everything that person wrote. We have had a lot of Eastern European food, both in Europe, San Francisco and New York & Brooklyn. Good friends of our are Polish & have cooked for us as well. Additionally, we've made at least 18 long trips to Hungary where they serve food similar to Polish cuisine so we've had our share of sausages, borscht, etc.

We ate at Stash Cafe twice during a visit to Montreal in August this year. On our second visit we also took a German friend. Quite frankly, we all loved this place and the food. Two other of our friends dined at Stash Cafe in the last month & also loved the food. The interior is cozy & has some nice Polish artworks on display. On both our visits were walk-ins, but it does tend to get busy, so perhaps reservations are a good idea. 

We had numerous dishes between us: bigos, pierogi, kielbasa, golabki (stuffed cabbage), & a wonderful charcuterie plate & even the smalec (a spread of bacon fat). Everything we had was delicious! Service was friendly & helpful. On our second visit the place was mobbed so the orders took a bit longer but, heck, we were on vacation so we just enjoyed our beer & conversation & the very nice, live, piano music."}
{"text":"Seriously shocked how good the food was. The service was great and the food...you leave here very happy. I honestly wished I would have tried it early cause I would have eaten here daily.  It's literally that good."}
{"text":"A nice cozy place for Polish comfort food in Old Montreal. The old-world atmosphere is nice and very consistent with the food. The menu includes many of the Eastern European standards - potato pancakes, perogi, kielbasa and combinations thereof.
Service was very attentive. 
This place would be a great option on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"We had a slightly early dinner here after a day of exploring Old Montreal. The decor is very charming and I liked the various art pieces they had hanging from the ceiling. The service was friendly though a bit slow at times. The food was traditional Polish food, which I enjoy, but the prices were a little over priced. I suppose you can blame that on the fact that it is located in the most touristy neighborhood of Montreal. But that's why I'm only giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"As winter cloaks the streets of Montreal We are 8n the hunt for hearty meals with world renown prestige of the city, and for some reason one of the top sites in the area is polish, and I decide to give it a whirl. Let me disclaim that I lived in Chicago for five years, which is considered one of the greatest epicentres of polish food in the US, so I consider myself savvy on polish food. But let me tell you about the \"stash cafe\"...
Kilbasa, black sausage, pirogis and chicken livers are a must! We are so glad that we stop here, it has live piano and a romantic ambiance. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"A Polish Delight. Went with my wife to this quaint little polish restaurant. It's a fairly small place, but well set up. They have a nice ambience. There are artistic posters hanging from the ceiling and other unique pieces. Had a guy playing the piano. That was very pleasant. 
The waitress was very helpful, courteous, with a good sense of humor. 
The food: We tried the polish sausage and the Pierogi (ones with meat and ones with potato and cheese). Everything was delicious. Sauerkraut was served as a side for both dishes. I'm not a big sauerkraut fan, but this recipe had a very mild flavor leaving me much more interested in it. My wife really loved it. 
The polish sausage dish also came with some very scrumptious dill potato salad. 
The total bill for the 2 plates and 2 iced teas was around 40 Canadian dollars. 
I would highly recommend this place. I'm glad I went. It was my first time at a real Polish restaurant. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Loved it! Vegetarian krokiety was great! Nice atmosphere. I loved having the piano player playing through dinner!"}
{"text":"My son in law is from Poland and I have experience good Polish food.  This place is close to the top.  I had the veal cutlet with beet salad.  It was amazing.  Kielbasa for appetizer was great as well.  A good wine selection and the service was very good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best authentic restaurant in Montreal! Real homemade food! The soups are to die! What made our experience unforgettable was the live music, the pianist was such a talented soul! Tomorrow I shall eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great experience. With social media usually highlighting the worst of restaurants I had my doubts about trying this place. What a pleasant surprise.  The place is rustic and beautiful. The staff is very friendly.  The food left me in awe. One of my best dining experiences. The pierogi, polish sausage, the cabbage rolls, the crepes, etc... were absolutely delicious. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I came here with four friends for dinner and we had the most amazing meal during our Montreal trip. My meal was so good that I texted three of my family members right after to rave about what I had just eaten.

To start off with, Stash Cafe has great service and an even better ambiance. It feels really cozy and warm, which was great since it was downpouring outside that evening. We were seated right away and our water was friendly and attentive. Everything is priced very well--we all got appetizers, wine, and a full meal for around $40 per person. The waiter also gave us our individual checks without us even having to ask, which was awesome.

I got the cheese and potato Perogies as an appetizer and the Krokiety with beef as my main meal. The Krokiety came with a side salad and sauerkraut--the salad dressing was to die for, I wish I got the recipe for it from the waiter. Everything I ate was very flavorful and homey. We enjoyed this restaurant so much that we almost came back the next day for another meal.

I will be returning to Montreal this summer solely to eat at Stash Cafe again."}
{"text":"Great for a light lunch or dinner.  Awesome service and atmosphere.  We loved it - highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is incredible and serves authentic Polish food.  Even on a day that they had slow service, the food made up for it.  Everything tasted so fresh and homemade.  I love the location (old Montreal), the inside of the restaurant is designed really well, and overall just a great meal.  My boyfriend and I shared the kielbasa appetizer and the stuffed cabbage rolls.  Delicious!  Plus, the portions were perfect and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Really really good. First time in Montreal and we picked a winner. Filet if Sole was perfect. Some beef and mushroom dish was also great.
Piano player was very talented and server was extremely nice. Ambiance good. Location was the best. Go enjoy......"}
{"text":"Lovely ambience .. the music was little loud for that ambience. I had the potato latkes which was very good. Perogies - my first time to try it! I found it oily. I tried the mix of cheese potato and mushroom perogies. The fried onions on top was nice. Still it's oily for me. However like the place as it's a great memory to me ! Try it :)"}
{"text":"Being a Polish girl from Pittsburgh...I know a thing or two about pierogies. What a fun surprise to go to Montréal and find a Polish restaurant!  Our horse & buggy driver gave us the recommendation and I wish I could have found him to give him a big thank you!  Stash Cafe is so cozy with its stone walls and wood beamed ceiling...felt just like we were in Europe.  My husband and I ordered the kielbasa dish & the pierogies and split our meals so we could try a bit of each. SO so good!!!!!  Get there before 6, after that there was a wait...on a Sunday!  This should tell you how great this place is. We will be back....."}
{"text":"Wooden furnitures, red and orange lamps,  cozy cottage, this place screams Old Port. We were seated by a very welcoming waitress which kept a smile throughout our entire meal. Since it was my first time trying Polish food I went with the beginner's plate which offered me pierogi, placki, krokiet, and bigos. Genius isn't it? 

The plate was like a Christmas present to me because I was excited to try everything but I wasn't sure what to expect. Everything was delicious especially the pierogi (dumplings) and the krokiet which was a roll covered in breadcrumbs with a meat filling. I don't know which kind meat the krokiet's filling was (maybe beef) but it didn't matter because it quickly slid down into my belly! As for the pierogi, those were heavenly. The dough was al dente and the filling was rich. I want more of those miniature pillows!"}
{"text":"I liked the classy feel of the decor and the food was very good so I have no complaints there but the waiter taking his sweet time to give us our checks because he was more concerned about talking to the pair of women at another table was annoying.  It was to the point we didn't get our checks until the women were leaving."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Had soup, strognow, kielbasa, pierogies all very yummy,  good portions and service was fine."}
{"text":"On our first night in Montreal we walked over to Rue Saint-Paul and over to Stash. The restaurant was chosen from the Yelp reviews and it was pretty close to our hotel. Rue St-Paul is an awesome little street with numerous restaurants and shops.

I have had Polish food  in Philadelphia but Stash is different. The Polish places I have I been to before were mostly in bars or semi cafeteria style but Stash is a really, really nice place. The space is very old world inside and warm with a wood and stone interior. We were there in June and the windows were open. They had a live piano player that only added to Stash's charm.

Everything we had we really great, including the Pierogis. I had the Polish Stroganoff and that was pretty darn incredible. The potato pancakes were the best I have ever tasted. The dessert was also excellent. Our server was great and helped us with our choices. The prices were reasonable.

Stash is a great restaurant to try in Old Montreal. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!! Food above decent but not the best polish food I've had. Server was borderline rude, but it didn't ruin my dinner. She made up for it by giving my kids something to color. Good food for the price."}
{"text":"I had the beef stroganoff, my wife had the mushroom crepe and my daughter had the cabbage stew with sausage.  My dish was also served with 2 potato pancakes and a beet salad.  These potato pancakes were prepared perfectly.  Super crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  My beef dish was also seasoned wonderfully and we all thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.
The only drawback was it took a little bit to get our lunch since we didn't get the typical dishes most people get.  But it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good place to learn about Polish food.

I came here on a random tip from a tour book and it was alright. I got the cabbage and sausage stew, which was tasty, but a bit salty. It would have went well with beer. I'd definitely get it again. For dessert, our server recommended potato pancakes... which was so weird. The only thing that made it remotely a dessert was the applesauce dip. Good experience though.

Tips: Good place to try Polish foods."}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals in Montreal here. Definitely planning on going back if I find myself in Canada again."}
{"text":"Stumbled in on a rainy day. What a perfect treat to warm us up. Perogies were awesome!"}
{"text":"While shopping around in Old Port being a complete tourist my party and I began to look for a place to eat. So I turned on my yelp app to help us decide on a place that was in our immediate area, well turns out Old Port has like a million restaurants. While scrolling down the, what seemed like a million, restaurants in the area I spotted this place. Being Polish it caught my eye, we had never had Polish before so we thought we'd go try it out. 

We were seated right away. The restaurant is swanky in the all the right way, outfitted with leather booths and old fashion décor. Our server was prompt and friendly, knowledgeable about the menu lucky for us, we of course had lots of questions about the cuisine. 

I settled on the meat and cheese Perogies, my friends went with the Kielbasa and cabbage. Holy cow, the food was fantastic. The Perogies, were prepared to perfection. The Kielbasa was juicy and cabbage was surprisingly savory. 

Prices were moderate, I assume everything in the Old Port area is priced slightly higher than the rest of the city but in my opinion it was worth it. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We wanted a small bite before a dinner reservation later that night. Service was really good. Vodka was good. I loved the pierogies. My favorite was the cabbage and mushroom. We also shared the kielbasa which was good too. All around a good stop!"}
{"text":"Warm and cozy vibe: beautiful artwork hanging from the ceiling: spectacular Ukrainian Borscht; delicious kielbasa sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes; tasty apple cobbler. A hit with every dish."}
{"text":"I had heard some wonderful things about this place and was looking forward to trying Polish food for the first time. Instead of taking a menu du debutant, we literally just ordered four main courses that contained the same items as the discovery menu and shared it among four people.  We did replace the plaki with kielbasa and they turned out to be among the best sausages I've ever  had. I really liked trying a bit of everything and I would recommend the same if you don't mind sharing. The price was extremely reasonable too. I would happily return for a casual dinner any night."}
{"text":"I was meandering about old town Montreal, and I wanted an authentic old-town restaurant. I wanted the great open window, the old town building, and I had a hankering for fish.  I was drawn to this place by an aroma that tickled my olfactory senses a block or so down the street.
     It had the great open window and a beautiful brunette greeted me and asked where I'd like to sit. She gave me a menu and a glass of water. I first needed a restroom, and beautiful brunette gave me directions to the facilities.  
     I've got to comment on the bathrooms, or rather the pathway too them.  Out the restaurants door I found myself in an old stone mason stairway, wooden stairs creaked as I climbed them. I could feel the history of this place. This was the old Montreal I was looking for. I savored the walk to the bathroom as long as I could, but beautiful brunette would be waiting for my lunch order. 
     The menu was good, and I found myself torn between two items.  In cases like this, I tend to get an opinion of an employee. So I asked beautiful brunette which item she preferred. She picked one and I ordered it.  It was a sautéed filet of sole, with a salad and potato. Beautiful brunette said it wasn't actually a polish dish, and I was okay with that.
     The fish came out, it looked and smelled delicious.  A filet covered in slivered almonds sat next to a salad and skinned potatoes.  I ate them, and they were delicious. A band struck up a merry tune outside at a festival going on a few streets away.  Every now and again a cool breeze would blow in through the great opened window behind me. The meal experiance was magical.
      Beautiful brunette visited me often, filling my water glass, and checking on my progress with the delicious meal.  The bill ended up around 20 bucks with tax and tip.

   I'm way glad I ate here, and not at the five guys burgers down the street. I would recommend it, and their bathroom to anybody visiting."}
{"text":"Excellent Polish schnitzel, was very pleased. In a long street of many adorable and hopping places, this is one with the talented piano player & old world vibe  pulled me in. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great polish food experience! Very good from the soup to the black sausage! I could eat here weekly"}
{"text":"O.K.   I have to start this review by telling you I cant be impartial! My friends go to Montreal every year for new years  and i started last year.  I found this place prior to my first trip, and after having a early dinner here we all decided it would be a staple. We all know that a great place this time, does not mean it will be great next time This was sooo not the case here!! The service...the food....the feel of the place!!! I couldn't  wait to come back, and i cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"So good. 
Great vibe. Intimate, but bustling. Very cheerful. 
The food was delicious. Had a party of four and everyone left smiling with clean plates and bowls. The soups were especially great. Pierogies, while smaller than my Grandma's, tasted almost identical. 
Great beer, too. 
The plum cobbler, though, blew us all away. 
 It may be pricey, but it is so worth it. 
Just go. There's a reason they've been there for so long."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday with ma familia, simple home cooked kinda food. Yummy Polish food.... Ive never really ate sauerkraut before just because I thought it was \"sour\" but this was pretty darned yummy! The beet soup was flavorful and the sznycel was perfectly made not dry. It has a homey, relaxed atmosphere. Service was a bit slow during our lunch but the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that something as oddly named as \"borsh\"  could send your tastebuds to heaven. It's sharp cutting sweet flavor mellowed by the rich ultra fresh soured cream. Only something as simple as a salad could follow that flavor else your tastebuds might be broken.
   After a quick break of salad, their tour de force plate of wild boar, pickled sweet cabbage, and rough cut potatoes arrives and fills your mouth with such warmth that you begin to think that it's the kind of place where even a crying baby can put a smile on your face as you think about how wonderful and beautiful life is.
  After polishing off the main course reality is slowly brought back with a sliver of delicate hazelnut cake and a rich coffee which soothes the soul after such an experience. 
  Ahhh......thank god for good food."}
{"text":"Went there a while ago
I liked the place very cozy dimmed lights lots of wooden tables and banquettes
I liked the piano touch ... added a certain touch to the dining ..!  
Now this is on my personal opinion and has nothing to do  with the restaurant it self
But i was not impressed with Polish food ... i found Polish food to be very simple ... 
the restaurant and the service was great ... maybe i should give it a second chance  .... or have i become so demanding with my food .?!?!?!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, Pierogis were cooked perfectly and the potatoes pancakes were the best ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch polonais les fds, relativement petite portion donc pensez à prendre une entrée, bon service, ambiance de cave , joli."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal I had while in Montreal for 5 days.  I went this last week right before Christmas, for lunch.  Service was slow, but that was typical of all my dining experiences in the city.

We thoroughly enjoyed the pierogies (we got the \"mixture\"); as well as the sausages.  Sauerkraut was not as good as I expected it to be.  Good beer list."}
{"text":"Ahhh so delicious!!!! My Polish teacher took me out for a beautiful lunch here at Stash Cafe. In the past they are not opened on Mondays, but we were both surprised they were open November 30!!! A Monday and Andrzejki (St. Andrew's Day)! 

The lovely lunch at 12:30 was peaceful, 3-4 tables of customers. Very quiet. The interior is absolutely gorgeous. You can impress anyone here!

Stash makes good traditional Polish dishes such as 
- pierogi $13 we asked them for a mix. So we had some with meat stuffing, some with cheese and potato (l love this one), and the rest with mushrooms and cabbage, topped with caramelized sweet onions
- krokiet $4.50 one crispy roll (like a fried dumpling) with mushrooms or meat. I had the mushrooms and it was great, I gobbled it up fast.
- barszcz soup, which is beets soup, deep wine red in colour and supposedly spicy. Stash's is not spicy at all, but still flavourful and quite nice. It's best when hot so don't let it sit!

The best Polish dishes are perhaps at your Polish friend's home, but Stash Cafe fills the void and with wonderful service. They have Polish beer and wine, as well as the incredibly delicious crepes with cheese, topped with sugar, sweet strawberries and fruits. You do in fact eat this as dinner in Poland, but here in Montreal this is a dessert. And it was sooooooo delicious. This is officially my favourite crepe of all time."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this charming restaurant!  We have Eastern European roots in our family, and often eat Polish food, so our standards are pretty high. All of their food seemed to be made from scratch and was fresh and flavorful!  We tried the pierogies, potato pancakes, and kielbasa, and the hazelnut cake for dessert. All were delicious! It was also very reasonably priced. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur restaurant Polonais de Montréal, dans une ambiance chaleureuse et tellement typique. Un pianiste accompagne le repas bien copieux et délicieux... Dans la pure tradition Polonaise. Au passage, si vous y allez la première fois, choisissez le menu débutant accompagné d'un vin blanc Hongrois ou d'une bonne bière."}
