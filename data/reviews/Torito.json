{"text":"I am not one who is opposed to going out and dining alone, but this is one place where you definitely want to bring a friend along. Offering a tapas-style menu full of Spanish dishes, with a hint of Latin American flare, Torito (Spanish for \"little bull\") gives you the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and flavours, and provides a great atmosphere for sharing with friends.

Torito's dining room is quite small, but has a great look and feel. Spanish pop culture images tastefully adorn the back wall and it has an intimate atmosphere and d√©cor modeled after a traditional Barcelona Tapas bar - having never been, I will have to take their word on that.

At first glance, two things stood out about the menu; they had so many options for beverages that the wine and drinks section made up for half of their selection (no complaints here), and I did not know what most of the items were - Patatas Whatas?. Thankfully, the knowledgeable staff were more than happy to explain the menu to me.

Always an advocate for ordering the specials, I began with the Picos and Jamon, thin prosciutto-like ham wrapped around crispy breadsticks, and the Huevos Escoceses, boiled quail eggs battered and fried - quite good!  Following that were the Crab Croquettes and, with the server's recommendation, the Patatas Bravas and Chorizo, or potatoes and spicy sausage.  The Crab Croquettes were perhaps a bit soft for my liking as I do enjoy a bit of crunch, but they were seasoned and plated nicely.  The Patatas Bravas were my kind of \"meat n' potatoes\" - simply delicious!

The food is flavourful, fresh and clean, and is not hidden behind a barrage of spices and sauces.  Most importantly, it is served in a timely manner.  Torito offers hot and cold tapas, and instead of everything coming out at once to litter the table, it is brought out in a staggered sequence; the cold remain cold, and hot remain hot.

On my next visit--and I will make my way back--I am definitely ordering the Ceviche.  When it arrived to my neighbouring table, it looked fantastic!  If I can recommend something I did not actually taste, it would be that.  If you have tried it, please comment and let me know the verdict!

A few cautionary items to draw your attention to: the restaurant is open only from 5:00p.m. - 11:00p.m., so it is not a late-night-bite place; there is an 18% gratuity (before tax) applied to parties of six or more (not unusual, but watch out for it); and Torito's spread is not for bargain eaters.  For my party of two, with only one single-serving alcoholic drink each, and a dinner of 4 appetizer-sized plates, it was just over $65 before tip.  That said, there is a difference between dining and eating; and Torito is a dining experience that I am happy I had.

Torito is a \"little bull\" of a restaurant that packs a punch!"}
{"text":"The tapas were tasty, churros for delicious, very friendly service and great atmosphere! Will come back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of six on a Monday night around 8 p.m. Ended up with a group of five by 9:30, because our first plate (charcuterie board) took nearly an hour to reach our table. We should have left with him, as the entire meal took about three hours. I love a three-hour meal, but only when the dining experience and company are equally fantastic. We only had half of this equation. The service was painfully slow and unapologetic. The food was for the most good, but not remarkable. And the portion sizes were way too small, considering what an $18 tapas plate can get you at other restaurants in the city.
Torito was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I passed by after a meal in Kensington and decided to go in just for drinks. Well, one strong 2oz. $12 margarita was enough - It was delicious! The place was small and very busy on a Friday night, but we managed to get a table. We got great, friendly service and loved the ambiance, so next time I will try the food and stay a bit longer."}
{"text":"Decent food but at crazy prices: sadly, this place fits the \"small plates = large cheque and empty stomach\" tapas stereotype.

My girlfriend and I spent just over a hundred dollars for a several (three or four?) plates, two deserts, and four (total) glasses of wine--for that price, I expect a meal, not a snack...particularly in Kensington Market.

The food was reasonably tasty, but nothing aside from the churros and chorizo was particularly spectacular. Yes, the restaurant is cute and the service was decent enough (though the sole waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed), but the portions were insultingly small. For example, we ordered homemade breadsticks wrapped with jamon serano and manchego. The jamon serano was maybe a quarter of a usual slice, and it took me a few seconds to recognize the tiny, paper-thin slices of manchego as cheese.

Save your money and go somewhere else, though for Spanish tapas in Toronto, you may not have many other choices...perhaps that's why they charge what they charge? Sad."}
{"text":"Went to Torito lately with a group of 10 of us for a birthday party.  Definitely not somewhere to go on a budget but I really enjoyed everything I tried, and we tried A LOT!!   

A few great things about the restaurant and management:  First, we had ordered a bottle of sparkling wine only to discover it tasted like ice wine as it was so sweet.  They took it back, free of charge which I thought was pretty nice of them.  Second, the manager came around with a tray of shots for our party, also on the house.

I honestly cannot say enough about the food, I loved everything. I gave 4 stars only because of the price.

Best things on the menu for me:
Ceviche - amazing!!!  I've tried a lot of ceviche, this is the best so far!
Smoked trout - not a huge fan of smoked fish but I loved this
Any of the sausage dishes
Crab cakes
Steak with egg

Next best things...
Tongue and cheek - really tasty, I just couldn't get past the appearance of tongue
Rabbit - also super tasty, more of a mindset thing I think

All in all, a great night!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants in the city. The food & service is always great. They also have the best ceviche in the city - I dare you to order just one. 
The only down side is it can get quite noisy in there - I think the sound bounces around. So if you are out for a quite date night, ask for an intimate corner or in the summer get a spot on the back patio."}
{"text":"Excellent pricing, selection, portions, quality, service and ambience.  Not at all pretentious.  Wonderful for groups or an intimate date."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend a couple of weekends ago and it did not disappoint.  The staff was great accomodating us seeing as we walked in with no reservations.  Place was full and took on a bit of a Guu style atmosphere.  

The menu has changed a bit from that last time I was there but it was still delicious.  We had:
- charcutterie plate;
- a salad of beef heart with arugula which was cook perferctly.  Not overdone or chewy;
- stuffed peppers (wish it automatically came with bread so soak up the delish sauce);
- paella;
- fried churrros to top it all off.

It's still a great intimate atmosphere that serves us yummy dishes which we thought was perfect as a date place.  Depending on who you're sitting beside though - it may be tough to have a conversation but lots of fun regardless.

Definitely planning on going back again."}
{"text":"Great place! Wonderful spot for a romantic date night. Great food and drinks... try the margaritas!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed my eating experiences here a great deal, but not my waiting experiences, nor the anxiety of wondering if I should even bother trying to get in. I wish these guys took reservations. Great food - fun busy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here last night with a few girlfriends.  We made a reservation and sat in the back near the cash.  Each of us ordered a drink and we shared 7 plates.  The bill came out to $150 (tax and gratuity included).

I have to come outright and say it: there is one server who is a little strange.  He mumbles, doesn't look at you when speaking to you, and is really aggressive in trying to get you to order more, even when you're clearly not indicating any interest.  Us girls weren't that hungry and felt borderline harassed by this guy who kept coming by and asking us if we wanted to order more in a not exactly low-pressure manner.  The Spanish guy (is he also the owner?) is friendly, though.

I've actually been here before, so we ordered more or less some of my favourites including the lamb meatballs and the oxtail stuffed peppers.  The lamb meatballs are full of flavour and the accompanying bread was fresh (hot out of the oven) and delicious!  The oxtail was sweet and flavourful, and best eaten when hot.  The squid ink noodles are a little strange as the noodles are these thin chicken-noodle type noodles, but the squid (while not generous pieces), are cooked just right - just chewy enough, but not tough.  We also ordered avocado fries, which were nothing too special, the croquette with jamon for which the croquette was pretty standard but there was not nearly enough ham to justify including jamon in the title (and it wasn't a part of the croquette, just a thin slice on top).  The lobster ravioli was forgettable as there wasn't much of a lobster flavour, and the ravioli was a little undercooked (no terrific sauce, either).  We had the chorizo which was good, but nothing special or of note.  Also, with the exception of the croquettes and avocado fries, the food wasn't served as hot as it could've been.

For $30 a person, don't expect to be full.  The server recommended we order 2 plates a person, but we weren't terribly hungry.  At the end of the meal, we were full, but could've probably eaten more.  If you're going to go, I'd recommend that you order the lamb meatballs and the peppers stuffed with oxtail.  But be prepared to have a hurting wallet if you want to be full.

The setting was cozy and intimate, and I do quite like the restaurant decor and seating.  That is a redeeming factor, but this second experience has me thinking that there must be a better value tapas place.  That being said, we didn't have any of the wine this time, but I recall the wine to have been excellent the last time I came here.

My two star rating is largely driven by the perceived low value for money, our strange server, and the temperature of food served."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a great atmosphere, perfect for a date. The food is good, but not great. There's really very little Spanish influence in the menu... Very overpriced."}
{"text":"Very cool spot in one of Toronto's most unique neighbourhoods. Sit on the back patio for a vacation like atmosphere. Everything we had was delicious, but I especially enjoyed the Avocado Fries. Definitely a must order for Avocado lovers!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very loud; we found ourselves yelling at each other. Food was good but did not have the \"wow\" factor that's required to charge the prices they charge. Staff was nice. Overall, restaurant could be rated as: ok. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

...and it does take reservations."}
{"text":"Sat out on the back patio right at opening time on a Friday evening. Service was attentive, sangrias well made and the food was well prepared and quite delicious. Highly recommend the dates stuffed with cheese and almonds and wrapped in jamon."}
{"text":"My foodie friend took me here for my birthday recently, and it was a great introduction to Tapas for me. Sure, I'm slightly behind the times. I hope you'll forgive me.

We were lucky and got there before most people, around 7 pm on a Thursday. (Still lots of tables at this time, but it packed up completely at 8). Making conversation with the chef / owner, we decided to have him present us with his best choices for dinner. He took great care at asking my dislikes / allergies so that he could bring out food that we would enjoy.

Started with the beet salad (yum), bread & cheese (always yum), fish ceviche (my first time eating uncooked, cooked fish - surprisingly amazing, despite the coriander), and a duck pate with apple compote. The waitress was a sweetheart, and brought us some YUMMY sangria (and I'm a bit of a sangria nazi, having mastered about 5 variations myself). After the first round, they brought out some chorizo and potatoes (slurp!), and I think we ended with the chickpeas .... mmm. There may or may not have been something else, don't recall.

Once it filled up, it got pretty loud, making it a bit tough to hear each other  (or was that the sangria talking?), but the atmosphere, people, staff and of course food made it a-ok.

Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had a dilemma. My foodie friend from NYC was in town and we were meeting up for dinner. I wanted to take him somewhere fun and hip, but not so hip it hurt. I didn't want food that was too precious or fancy; no foams, sous vide, or stuff suspended in gelatin, just honest grub a cut above burgers and fries.  And since he was coming from the Big Apple, pizza, Japanese, smoked meat and several other categories of food were out of the running. Ahhhh!

After much research and hair-pulling, I decided on Torito. I remember liking the vibe there during a stop on the Yelp Sangria Crawl, and I'd heard good things about their tapas.  It's also in a cool neighborhood. (And on a selfish note, I'd much rather sample a bunch of small plates than stick to the conventional 1 app + 1 entree formula.) So the S.O., foodie friend and I went, and got a table on the backyard patio--bonus! 

The food was quite good, much better than you'd expect from such a casual restaurant. Did it knock my socks off? No.* But the service was unobtrusive and we had an awesome time noshing and drinking from their excellent wine list.

FAVES
Pintxos of olives and boquerones (white anchovies)** (10)
Smoked trout, potato salad w/ chive mayonnaise (9)
Flying fish filets with orange aioli** (12)
Patatas bravas and chorizo (10)
Merguez, crispy polenta and tomatoes (12)

GOOD (BUT DISAPPOINTING CONSIDERING ALL THE RAVES***)
Piquillo peppers stuffed w/ salted cod and tapenade (10)
Roasted quail, pomegranate glaze, squash (13)
Braised beef tongue and cheek (12)

{"text":"I've had better tapas.  This place is overpriced for the quality of the tapas.  Seriously, $12 for some broth with mushrooms floating in it???  They have the traditional spanish tortilla, and the garlic shrimp.  I thought poblanos were Mexican, not Spanish.  The best tapas dish was the patatas and chorizo -delicious!  The desserts weren't bad either.  I liked the service better than the food.  Overall, this was tapas amateur style.  Afterthought:  I ordered the Piscola as a cocktail, and it was fantastic!  Pisco is a strong alcohol from Chile reminiscent of Tequila.  Mixed with coca cola (hence, piscola), it's a great alcoholic drink :-)"}
{"text":"Love the ceviche, the avocado fries and really everything we have had here.  The bonus  is sitting on the front patio in Kensington. I can't say enough about the staff."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with girlfriends for an evening with a healthy ratio of wine to food. I have been with men before, and my experience is that their appetites outsize the great tapas menu.

The menu items are small and packed with flavour. They have changed over the years. The oxtail-stuffed peppers are a recent favourite, and I have never ordered something I don't like."}
{"text":"Sunny patio in the back of the restaurant is perfect for after work drinks and food!
My friend and I ordered quite a few dishes to share.
My fave was the grilled octopus skewers (first time trying octopus!) with the sausage.
The sauce was super tasty and the octopus was tender and grilled perfectly.
I thought the patatas bravas were okay - I've had better.
I also liked the fried manchego cheese a lot!
We also ordered bacon covered dates, ceviche, avocado fries, arugula salad and churros.  All were good but were not incredibly amazing making me crave more. 
The white wine sangria is also really tasty.
Also, maybe I was extra hungry that day, but I wasn't really full afterwards. I think this place is a bit cheaper than other tapas bars I've been to but the portion sizes are also smaller."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This was my first experience with tapas, so I wouldn't know what a proper ceviche would taste like anyway.

The menu is split into 3 sections: cold dishes, hot dishes and dessert.  I had a few dishes from each section.  My favorite was the 'bacon wrapped dates\", phenomenal.  Everything else was good.  

Service was good, I didn't experience the exceptionally slow service as some of the previous reviewers.  

In terms of beer selection, they have nothing on tap and about 6-7 types in bottles/cans.

The wine selection, on the other hand, is pretty big.

The two stars come from the exceptionally poor value.  Dishes range from $8-16 each.  If you're coming here for dinner, you would need to order at least 3 dishes per person.  So a group of 4 would have to order at least 12 dishes.  This would be the equivalent of a really small dinner entree.  So its about $40-$50 minimum per person.  Factor in drinks and you're looking at pricey night out.

For a $50 entree, there are so many better options.

Note: They add an 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more.  Annoying."}
{"text":"I am going to start this review with the positives. Nice scenery, awesome sangria, friendly waitstaff. 

However, over an hour before the bread and olives ($5 and 4 slices of baguette and an ounce of olives) arrives. Longer to order a glass of wine. Having travelled through Spain I understand the slowness, the ease, but this is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.

1.5 hours I am starving absolutely famished and discussing going to Burger Bar across the street for eats.

The food arrives, they have been backed up, all is forgiven as me, and my 5 DCs dive in, frantically dividing every bit into sharable portions. Famished. its 10pm. Dinner, in Barcelona dinner IS at 10pm. so, I suppose they get points for authenticity. 

The food, itself is good. Tasty. Tapas, yes, but unforgivably tiny portions. $14 for a couple of bits of fish and two ounces of frites. Very tasty, but horrifyingly too expensive and not enough portion wise. Not for the price.

18% autograt on our tasty meal left 5 of the 6 of us hungry and cost us $90 a couple. Can you IMAGINE the meal we could have had anywhere else for this price.

The ceviche was great ok, but with 2 ounces of fish in it and the 75 min wait for $14 SO not worth it.

Do they want to do better? Hire more waitstaff. When you have a full DR via reservations, make sure you have enough staff to cover. And knock the prices down a bit, seriously. 

Luckily, I was with my best friends, and the company made the whole night. I had a great, but hungry, time. Possibly would have been a different experience if we came FULL and wanted to have ONE shared plate while drinking.  Even then, a mediocre Tempranillo runs $10 a glass. Will not, ever, ever, return."}
{"text":"my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Pretty much have had every dish here. It's a shame they got rid of the tripe though.

The churros are unbelievable, and the ceviche is my staple. I have never ordered a bad dish here. Very consistent and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Earlier this week I met a good friend and restaurant owner for a family dinner at one of the very few somewhat authentic spanish tapas places in Toronto. There really aren't that many, considering that tapas and small dishes are quite popular.
The service at Torito was good, and did everything from offering to take my coat right when I arrived in the place (apart from the high-end places in the city, that's not a thing to do any more). They were always around when we needed them. When ordering tapas it's generally more of a free-wheeling thing so the servers don't have as much of a sense of timing of meals, so they have to be paying more attention to the tables, and that they did. 
Among the table we ordered about every dish on the menu and while there weren't really any great superstars, what I like about Torito is that there really aren't any losers either. Everything from the ceviche, to the various sardine dishes, to the salads were well prepared and good, and sharable around the table. 
It's one of my old stand-bys in the city, and there's no reason I won't keep going back."}
{"text":"Great sangria which is half price on Sundays! And I love the ceviche, avocado fries and the chorizo scrambled eggs are heaven!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 7/10
Food: 6.5/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10
Service: 7.5/10

I'd describe my experience at Torito as very hit and miss. There doesn't seem to be much consistency in regards to food, atmosphere, service, so depending on the night and time you come, you could be looking at two very different nights!

HITS:
- kale salad
- chorizo
- fresh pasta with mussels (pasta and seafood was great!)

MISSES:
- mediocre sangria
- being seated on high stools with nowhere to put your coat or bag
- fresh pasta with mussels (pasta ratio was super low, you could consume in one fell slurp!) 

THE BOTTOM LINE: hits and misses lead to an inconsistent experience and a general feeling of not wanting to return."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Service was poor  and seemed half-hearted - they forgot some of the dishes we had ordered and needed to be reminded. Portions were small for the price. Love the idea of tapas but we were hungry when we left. I don't mind paying for good quality food but it wasn't worth it. The open air area in the back was lovely."}
{"text":"Fine tapas place.  Nicely laid out and fun place to be in - has that slightly cramped / communal dining feel, which can be annoying but is super appropriate for tapas.

Didn't have the sangria but the people I was with didn't seem wowed by it.  Other than that the food was pretty good - we ordered maybe 8-9 things for 4 people and they were all good. As per usual tapas, we ordered too much and were thoroughly stuffed.

Tapas isn't cheap, but this didn't seem outrageous.  We paid about $40 per person for a lot of food, one sangria pitcher and two beers.  That's not a bargain, but I didn't feel ripped off either."}
{"text":"Great date location. Tucked away in Kensington, this restaurant offers a great offering of Spanish tapas. Sat in the back patio on a beautiful summer day. The date unfortunately didn't eat red meat, so our choices were kind of limited.
Beverage:
Coke & Red Wine: A spanish favourite, tried it for the first time and found it to be not as weird as expected. Don't know if it was the alcohol but the 2nd glass tasted a lot better!

Thumbs up:
Roasted quail , pomegranate glaze and sweet squash
Beets,black lentils,goat cheese and frisse salad w/ red wine vinaigrette
Shrimps al ajillo

Thumbs down:
Crab croquettes w/parsley aioli (crab did not taste fresh)
Andalusian spinach and chickpeas stew (Did not excite the tastebuds)

This place is a little overpriced and there are definitely better tapas restaurants in the city (I'm looking at you Mezzeta). But it was an enjoyable experience, great service and the food was pretty good. So I will definitely give it another shot avec meat eater."}
{"text":"A group of six of us went last night and sat on the patio.  Our server broheim was inside most of the time and took quite some time getting our glasses filled, our order taken etc.  One friend had to leave because he had a concert an hour after we sat down, when we still hadn't gotten food.  We had gotten a pitcher of sangria ($36), which was totally unremarkable.  This is a compliment for a bottle of $36 wine but not for $36 sangria.

Our server seemed somewhat surprised that we had not gotten any food yet after an hour.  He blamed it on a big group and offered to move us inside.  Perhaps he could have spent that time talking to the kitchen and actually getting us some food.

We moved inside, turned down another pitcher of sangria and slowly started to get some food.  First came the charcuterie plate, which consisted of 4 melba toasts, a few wedges of cheese, slices of some meat of the day and some sort of \"rabbit rillette\" that tasted like tuna.  Ten minutes later, we got another dish - fries.  The wait was to become the norm throughout the course of the night - one small dish every ten minutes.  To be fair, the food was reasonably tasty.  The chorizo/patatas bravas were great, the quail reasonably juicy, the arugula salad fresh and topped with delicious cheese.  The shrimp were notably skippable.

Overall, the slow speed of food delivery/service, our out-to-lunch, or \"authentic style service\" server and the very small portions really killed it for us.  We were getting so hungry (and as a result, cranky at portion sizes) that we had to auction off 1 small nibbet of food/person ie 1 piece of bread, 1 nut, 1 arugula leaf.  Entertaining, but not filling.  We all left two and a half hours after sitting down, with our pockets $35 lighter (thank god our friend had to leave and we avoided the 18% autograt on parties of 6 or more), and still very, very, very hungry."}
{"text":"Bacon covered dates? BACON COVERED DATES!?! INSTANT 5/5. Haha, if only.
I attended an event here hosted by a good friend and unfortunately showed up a little late to the party. We ordered a bunch of dishes to catch up and by accident (I assume) most of our food got delivered to the other end of the table and got devoured before it made it's way down to us. 
When we finally did get some food it was delicious (if overpriced) with a few exceptions. The deep fried avocado fries were amazing. Served with a roasted tomato salsa, they melted in your mouth. Inventive and delicious. The grilled chorizo was likewise delicious and tasty.
And finally aforementioned bacon wrapped dates. Haha, I still think of these with longing, occasionally, and find myself staring off into space while drool pools under my chin. Hyperbole? Maybe a little, but these were still delicious savoury and rich.
The Spanish lamb meatballs were kind of boring and plain and as was the jamon serrano thin sliced and served with bread. Good, but boring and overpriced. The sangria we ordered was likewise just average.
Overall this place is fun for a group if you're willing to foot the bill and deal with uneven dishes. Start with the dates and avocado and work your way into the menu from those high points."}
{"text":"People love Cava. I love Torito. It's a little cheaper and much more hospitable. I marked my first visit of the summer with a pitcher of white sangria. It was the perfect thing to banish the humidity - refreshingly fruity, sweet and tangy. Red or white it's so good you may find yourself on a third or fourth pitcher (shared amongst friends of course). 

My buddy, Saltine, accompanied me and we were so excited we ordered a little too much. I would recommend four to five dishes for two people. We had six. 

After a couple glasses of sangria I got a little camera happy. Let me walk you through our meal. 

I always like to start with something fresh to wake up my taste buds. Ceviche is one of my favourite dishes and Torito makes a classic white bass ceviche - a mishmash of sour, salty, meaty and tart. We covered our vegetable intake by adding a beet and lentil salad. There was a little too much goat cheese for me, but it a great pairing nonetheless.

One of the shining stars of the night was the piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod and served with an olive tapenade. It was so good I almost ate my friend's share...but then the sausages came...

I'm a huge chorizo fan so I had to order the patatas brava (fingerling potatoes) with chorizo. Good chorizo is like fireworks - an explosion of flavour followed by a slow simmering heat.  
We tried the daily special of pork sausage with flat bread. It was a softer and milder meat, which was a good thing because I needed to undo my belt at this point.

Our last dish was the pescado in a basquaise sauce. You can never go wrong with prefectly cooked and well seasoned fish. Theirs is light, flaky, and flavourful. 

Finish with some more sangria and cheers to the official start of summer. Tapas on, tapas on."}
{"text":"Did this really happen? Wow - random walk in for some eats and just blown away! Worth making your way through the whole menu."}
{"text":"Came here w a friend for a catchup session and it was the perfect venue for it! We sat on the patio in the back which was lovely and cozy. They have a great drink selection and Spanish tapas. The service was friendly and conversational. Great music and conversation called for a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"I used to come to Torito a lot. When they first opened eight or nine years ago I was a huge fan. It was a warm, inviting and super fun place to eat, drink and make much merriment.

I'll confess that after 5 visits or so, I became bored with the menu because it didn't change. I was happy to find that they now take reservations and also have added a whole slew of new things to the menu while keeping some of the favourites such as Chick Pea and Spinach Stew (this is yummier than you can imagine) and the Steak with fried egg.

I will also say that I was hoping for the same hospitality to which I had been treated before. They don't rush you here and they know that tapas is about eating good food, having nice drinks and enjoying the company of those you're with. Their Sister restaurant, Carmen, failed at this and as a result I gave them a far lower rating than what the food deserved. I can cook at home and I serve tables all day at work, so when I go out, I want stuff I don't usually make at home and to be treated well. It's about the total experience.

Torito, despite not having as much culinary finesse as Carmen, was a wonderful night out and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for romance, a night with the girls, or some casual cocktails and nibbles.

We began with a pitcher of the white sangria. We asked out server for suggestions and he confirmed a few of the dishes that we had been eyeing on the menu. The Sangria was a lot of apple, and not a lot of other fruit, but I liked the size and I liked the strength.

The octopus carpaccio was recommended by our server over the grilled octopus. It was delicious and almost creamy in texture with a whisper of pickled red onion and a couple of capers. I wasn't in love with the colour of the squid ink aoli, but the combination was delicious.

Almonds and dates covered in bacon were crunchy, oozy sweet and sexy. THIS is what Tapas really should be and the flavour profile had the punch to live up to it. You must oder these. If you happen to be a vegetarian, you should happen to take a night off and eat these wonderful morsels.

Shrimp were plump and served with a nice sauce which didn't rely strictly on garlic for taste.

Lamb meatballs were super tender nestled in a bright, zippy tomato sauce with both fresh mint and mint pesto. So delicious.

We had some cheese for dessert and a glass of wine each.

Then our amazing waiter topped off the night with some complimentary churros. 

This place is not getting all 5 stars for the food, but it is far more similar to authentic Tapas than many other \"tapas' places in Toronto that just want to charge you half the price of a main for a quarter serving size of food. Everything is always tasty and satisfying. 

The service is warm and friendly and so is the environment. The pillows the decorate the brightly coloured benches say \"Stay, and enjoy our food and drinks!\" The music is never so loud that you can't have a conversation, but tuned up enough so that you may occasionally need to do a quick chair dance. Have fun and love life! THIS is the essence of Tapas.

I have never had anything less than an amazing time at Torito and now that there are still a few things on the menu I haven't tried, I'll be back.

And to all you Toronto diners, there is no need pay money to scarf back tacos and be treated like shit by your server. Wise up and quit being so hipster that you always have somewhere cooler to be than out for dinner with whomever you're with. And if you want a taco, go to a taco stand. 

Or go to Torito and kick back for a couple of hours and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Would definitely go back.
This place is a great date spot, gathering for friends or somewhere to show off to your out of town friend (in my case:). 

Service- 4/5 Very friendly and knowledgeable enough. Service getting drinks and the bill were a tad slow, but the food came out at a reasonable pace. 

Food- 5/5 Ordered the daily special Rabbit Rilletes (cold rabbit spread topped with a light apple butter) on crostini, haddock ceviche, octopus and chorizo, lentil, beet and goat's cheese salad. Everything was delicious- The rilletes were something we've never tried before and were blown away with the flavour, the ceviche was delish and definitely a re-order and the salad was the perfect complement to the other rich dishes. I'd have to say that I didn't love the octopus/chorizo combination. The octopus lacked flavour and was an interesting texture combination with the chorizo (almost too similar). They did manage to cook the octopus properly (which is rare)... it was just the lack of flavour that was a personal miss for me. 
The drink menu offered spanish cocktails (including pisco sour), sangria, wine and beer, all at standard prices. We went with the margaritas and were pleased.

Atmosphere & Location - 5/5 Like I said, it's a great spot to bring a date, group of friends or an out of towner. Location is right in Kensington Market- very accessible by transit or by foot. Everyone seemed to be having a great time. Setting was dim enough to feel intimate but lively enough to let out some laughs and be comfortable. The decor is Spanish inspired with an industrial, hip flare. 

Overall- 5/5 I've already recommended this place to all of my friends. We had an amazing tasting of four different dishes and a drink each and it ran us $67 with tax- can't quite beat it.  I haven't found the perfect blend of atmosphere, food quality, authenticity and price until now. Check it out:)"}
{"text":"Delicious - that sums it up pretty good. What a nice little hidden gem this place is. After doing research on where to go for tapas we came upon this restaurant. I am so glad we tried it! Between the 2 of us we had nine dishes - yes nine, we wanted to try as much possible. Although for next time we will probably go with 7, because we were so stuffed after.  Not even one dish disappointed, each one was unique and yummy. The avocado fries were out of this world, so were the stuffed peppers with oxtail, and the steak.  The churros were delicious too!  Can't wait to come back and try more dishes next time."}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time.  Obviously, there's a reason and that reason is the food is GREAT.  My friend and I had an assortment of dishes but the standouts were some fried peppers, the churros for dessert, and the cerviche!  We had white sangria. We had an hour and half of good times.  It was GREAT.  I will say, the service was a tiny bit slow but it was a great experience.  I haven't been since 2009 but it is still just as good as it was back then."}
{"text":"A pitcher of red sangria started the evening at Torito off on the right note.  It was all uphill from the first sip.  We started with the arugula salad with manchego cheese with almonds and quince vinaigrette followed by grilled chorizo, dates wrapped in bacon, lamb meatballs and grilled octopus.  Stand outs were the dates and the manchego cheese although all were enjoyable.  Both the back and front patios were full so we ate inside--I will return to try for a rear patio seat again.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food served and the staff are friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Kensington Market is one of those places that I go to when I want to nibble as opposed to go to a sit-down restaurant because of the diversity of authentic and casual joints which makes me want to pop in to Seven Lives for some ceviche and perhaps a taco while still having the option to go to Pancho's for a dessert.  Why go to a Mexican restaurant that might do food well, but suck at churros when one of the best places for churros is right next door?

But once in awhile, for the sake of convenience and quality conversation, staying put in one spot makes the most sense.  I had heard many good things about Torito Tapas Bar, a Spanish tapas restaurant; so I decided to check it out (seeing as I had such a great experience at sister restaurant Carmen).

To quench our thirst we opt for a pitcher of Red Sangria ($35), neither the worst sangria (e.g. sugary) nor the best (e.g. good balance of wine + mixer) that I've had.  I digress for a moment to say that the best I've had to date can be found at TEN Restaurant and Wine Bar in Port Credit. The sangria was mostly apples and not much of any other fruit.

We opt for the White Bass Ceviche ($10) with corn, fresh chili peppers + cilantro.  We are told by the server that their ceviche is marinated for 3 hours, unlike most other restaurants that make it ready-to-order.  While marinating anything for longer periods of time is usually a good thing because it amps up the flavor; the citric acid may have \"overcooked\" the fish a bit as the texture was not as smooth as usual.  The flavours were well-balanced though as the ceviche was not overly sour.  The taro chips served as both a functional and delicious \"spoon.\"

We then moved onto a dish of Patatas Bravas ($7); a common tapas dish found in Spain which is served in a tomato sauce and topped with a√Øoli.   While the potatoes here are sliced into rounds as opposed to cut like fries and wasn't topped with cheese, I couldn't help but refer to this as a Spanish poutine.  The tomato sauce was very buttery and naturally sweet.

Rossejat ($10), a paella style pasta with shrimps + a√Øoli was a glorified plate of chow mein?  It was a tad too oily for my liking, but still delicious.  I wish there were more shrimp, but then again they're only charging you $10 a plate.

My favorite dish of the night, Piquillo Peppers ($14) stuffed with braised oxtail on a vanilla-scented pur√©e was very juicy and tender.  It definitely embodied more than just one dimension of flavour as the sweetness of the piquillos cut through some of the richness of the braised oxtail.

For dessert we had the Crema Catalana (sorry, forgot the cost) and it is very similar to a cr√®me br√ªl√©e save for the added citrus flavor.  It is a dessert traditionally served on served on Saint Joseph's Day.

It is also worthy of noting that there is both a front and back patio with more drinking space on the way as the basement is currently being renovated.  The food at Torito is very flavorful and being a tapas bar, makes it a great place to go with a (small) group of friends to be able to get a nibble of everything.  With most dishes under $10, it also makes for a less expensive option than the likes of Patria.  However, I think I prefer sister restaurant Carmen in Queen West (not sure if it's because chef Luis Valenzuela is focusing more time since it's newer (I saw him in the kitchen at Carmen, but no sign of him at Torito).  The dishes at Torito are delicious, but don't expect anything fancy."}
{"text":"Dear lord, I think I've found yet another place in the T-dot worthy of repeat visits. As if there weren't enough places in Toronto to catch my tummy's fancy-another one has now been added to the list. Torito the tapas bar in Kensington market has become a triple threat in my books: food, service and drink it hits the mark in all three areas. 

Let's start with the food because they do it very well here and so effortlessly too. Now, hailing from a small hick town in B.C. most ethnic cuisines escaped my senses till I left home including Spanish tapas. And so it is that with the 'enabling' of a friend, we set out to Torito one evening to open a new chapter in my gourmet journey. The restaurant consists of a small narrow room with a tiny bar and marble and picnic style tables along the perimeter for couples and groups. It's dimly lit inside with spanish film posters on the walls for decoration and the bouncy music adds to the charged, easy going atmosphere already present. We take seats at the bar and start off with their fantastic sangria, light and refreshing and white too! One of the handsome fellas working the kitchen gives us a wink and a nod as a greeting. Caliente!! Borrowing from Susan C's thoughtful recommendations we order the smoked trout potato salad, the patatas bravas and chorizo, a spinach chickpea stew and the shrimps al Ajillo. A small taste of everything as we were not raving hungry. The smoked trout salad is delicious and light, the trout is moist and tender and smoked lightly. Our patatas bravas dish and the shrimps al Ajillo are the standouts of the night. The patatas bravas consists of chunks of a wonderful chorizo sided with fingerling potatoes and a rich, concentrated tomato sauce. It's brillant-sweet, smokey and spicy accents all in one dish. The shrimps al ajillo are plump and juicy served in a delicious hearty sauce I could have again and again. We really ordered the chickpea stew as an attempt to 'healthify' our dinner but that was tasty too-cooked chickpeas and spinach in a simple cream sauce. To finish we enjoy or rather quickly pick apart some churros served with jam and dulce de leche. 

The drinks list features a number of latin inspired drinks and wines, we enjoy some of their refreshing white sangria and a couple glasses of malbec each. Although the place was packed and noisy, our server was friendly and charming and after noticing that we had been waiting a little while for our food, she graced us with a plate of bread, cheese and olives-normally $4 on the menu. How thoughtful! Our water glasses were always refilled and almost every server checked in on us once to see how we were doing. 

So bring a lover, friend or your own personal entourage-you're bound to have a lovely time in this boisterous bar. Haute cuisine it ain't but if you're in search of a fun time and a variety of tastes this is the place. I'll be back hopefully soon, this place looks perfect for a FARC outing! After all there's a pomegranate and lychee cava on the drink list that has my foodie in arms Christine's name all over it!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for a Tuesday night, however, it was totally unnecessary. They've got tons of seating with both a front and back patio and the actual interior of the venue itself. I would suggest you snag a spot on the back patio if you can. It's quieter, more intimate and quite lovely on a summer evening.

We got a couple of drinks (a Pisco Sour and a Dark and Stormy) to start. Then we ordered the avocado fries as they were the day's special and an off-menu item as well as the ceviche which seemed to be a popular item based off other Yelp reviews. The drinks were amazing, I definitely enjoyed that Pisco Sour. The food was okay. I liked the avocado fries. If you've ever had avocado tempura at a sushi house, this is basically the same thing. It came with a chili sauce which I found smothered the avocado. The ceviche was definitely not for me. It was a white fish, and I felt like the fish was too rubbery tasting. It wasn't quite the light and refreshing morsel I was hoping to have.

We also ordered the churros with dulce de leche. We got 5 churros. I found that they were a bit on the small side and a bit overdone. Or perhaps they felt overdone because they were smaller, with less filling? I would skip the churros next time. Pancho's makes them way better and gives you a bigger bang for your buck.

Overall the service was friendly albeit they were bit more focused on the large group ordering all the dishes and all the wine instead of us. The food was a bit disappointing but maybe if we tried some other items we would have enjoyed it more. And the drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"On the coldest evening of the year, I dropped in at Toritos for some tapas with some old colleagues.   This is a warm and casual kind of place where you definitely need the benefit of a few friends company to share different things.   Like a Spanish dimsum, we ordered a good selection of yummy plates to go with a few pitchers of sangria and shots of Petron.   
Having been warned off ordering the beef tongue, we had a good selection of befire us.  Each dish was very tasty.  I'd give Toritos a slightly higher rating based on the food,  the service and the cozy and jovial environs were it not for the high prices $10 - $12 for a small plate of admittedly well prepared food is a bit much.   What Toritos lacks in creativity, it does not falter in it's quality."}
{"text":"Yes, tapas place how it's supposed to be (outside of Spain that is). Each tapas I tried was cooked to order, all tasted great but these few especially deserve mentioning : avocado fries, patatas bravas with aioli, and Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail on a vanila scneted puree. Last one may as well go as desert. And their wine list have all you need to enjoy tapas - cavas, Rioja, Albarino and even Verdejo."}
{"text":"My friend from Barcelona always mentions the lil bull when we pass by Augusta Ave. We tried to go inside a couple of times but we weren't lucky enough.

Last Wednesday not only was this place open, it was displaying a flashy sign: \"50% off sangria\". We were in touristy mood trying to get the happy hour badge, so that advertisement  attracted us like flies. 

Once inside, the set up looked too formal to be a tapas bar. I mean, all the cutlery to eat olives, potatoes, and topped bread? We ordered some olives and bread to accompany our sangr√≠a. The waitress was really friendly, her smile was authentic, and she even joke about offering us the container of the drink to put on the fridge.

The ambiance was perfect for me. I was looking at the Almodovar¬¥s posters, when Manu Chao started playing. A group of 5 interesting characters arrived, sat on the window table, and got into an active hanging out-debate. The whole scene made me thought about how multicultural this city is... Manu Chao (France); Almodovar (Spain), my accompanied (Portugal), me (Mexican), other's (from at least 5 different mixtures or heritages).

The sangria was effective; it allowed us to seat, refresh, enjoy, read the menu, get philosophical, chair sing while half body dance, and think about going back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past weekend. Not a bad evening out, but nothing overly \"wow\" about it. 

Firstly, I'd made an online reservation via their website, and despite our arriving exactly on time, there was no table of four vacant. They actually had to move a couple elsewhere in order to accommodate us. Made me a little uncomfortable seeing the people being moved give us the stink-eye. 

Service was a little spotty. Waiter seemed confused. Didn't write anything down and as we suspected would happen, half way through our meal, the dishes stopped coming. We flagged our amigo down and he acted as though he knew we were waiting on something, but in essence he was fishing to find out what we were missing so he could go ask the kitchen to make 'em. It was odd. We sat with empty glasses a little longer that should be expected based on the price point of their menu. 

The food was quite good. For the most part, impressive - especially the bacon wrapped dates; ridiculously tasty! Solid turns with the chic pea stew, steak frites, and octopus with chorizo. Next time I'll skip the lamb meatballs - kinda boring. And I will DEFINITELY skip the straight chorizo sausage - this goes down as the most uninspiring plating I've ever seen. Just a plain sausage on a plate. No garnish. No accompanying sauce. Not even prepped or sliced or anything. And for a \"sharing\" tapas restaurant, it was a pain. Downloading the job of slicing the sausage to the patrons. I mean, if I want a single sausage served to me for $10, I'd like it ready to go, I'd like it to impress my eyes along with my taste buds. Otherwise I'll pay $5 from a cart vendor, and it'll come with a bun and condiments! Granted - they probably make the sausage in house, and it is tasty without question, but it's just way too unimpressive and borderline cheeky to be served a bare naked sausage on a plate. Stupid comes to mind.

The red sangria was good.

Might try this place again, but won't rush back, and probably only if someone else suggests it first."}
{"text":"A perfect place to share delicious little treats with excellent friends.  Terrific service, wonderfully prepared and presented food.  Also, it's in a terrific and funky neighborhood, Lends to the ambiance. One of my new favorite places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Meh, I think the hype is there but the food was expensive and very teeny portions. Tapas seems to be the \"thing\" these days but none of it was close to when i was travelling in Spain. Nice ambiance but too much of a hipster restaurant. I'd hit the other places in Kensington next time. 

side note: the sangria pitcher is so small i couldn't believe it. you need to get 3 of those, or like, drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"Specialty: Spanish Tapas
Menu items: Avocado Fries, Patatas Bravas, Grilled Spanish Chorizo, Rossejat & Churros accompanied with Sangria

Torito is a small place located in the Kensignton market area. Easy to spot with their huge red bull sign at the entrance. Their food roots from Spain but brings a modern twist using local flavours. The menu features close to 25 tapas and their atmosphere though trendy is totally unpretentious.

A crowd-favourite tapa that was ordered twice during our visit is their famous Avocado Fries with Roasted Tomato Salsa. These are basically lightly-breaded avocado strips that have been deep-fried to perfection and are ready for dipping pleasure on a house-made tomato sauce which has a nice kick to it.

Their Patatas Bravas covered in Aioli are probably one of the best executions I have had of this tapa. In Spain, this tapa is a staple and a crowd-pleaser. In the case of Torito, their potatoes are cooked to a soft inside with a crunchy outer-shell and light seasoning. The Aoili adds good flavour notes to the dish, but once again it does not overpower it.

When it comes to protein, and especially pork, the Spanish know how to make a Chorizo taste great. The Grilled Spanish Chorizo featured in Torito's menu has that perfect level of spiciness with beautiful grill marks and a non-chewy texture. A home-run for Chef Valenzuela.

My second favourite tapa from the menu is the Rossejat. A paella-style pasta served with shrimp and drizzled with the same aioli from the Patatas Bravas. The thin noodles are topped with green peas and cilantro, giving a lot of body to the dish yet keeping it light with the greens addition.

Dessert, like any traditional Spanish restaurant, always features our beloved Churros. At Torito these are served with a small covering of dusting sugar and dulce de leche. Though I would have liked a bit more of the dulce de leche, I was happy to see a twist on plating and found the treats to be fresh and moist, with a nice bite to them and good sweet-to-dough balance.

Y por supuesto, a Spanish restaurant and night are never complete without litres (note the plural here) of Sangria. I think we went through 4 of these that night and we were about to order a fifth as the Sangria was not overly sweet or overpowered the lovely wine taste. Our night was so great that we stayed at the restaurant until close, just like the Spaniards do.

Until next time Foodies!

Buen Provecho,
Foodies Inked."}
{"text":"I decided to host a little food event with all my closest friends.  The week before I was turned away due to not making reservations, so I was a determined MAN!! lol...
Lets just say in a party of 12-15 people, its safe to say we almost ordered EVERYTHING off the menu.

5/5 goes to their:
-Bacon wrapped Dates (Pintxos) with a drizzle of aceite (oil)...just decadent, and indescribable.

-Patatas Bravas, think of it almost like spanish taters with lots of tomato and cream sauce, cooked to perfection.

-Hand cooked Jamon  Serrano, served on a lightly toasted sour dough, and thinly sliced curred meat, much like prosciutto!! 

-Grilled Spanish Chorizo, one long piece grilled to perfection, perfect balance of flavors!

-Albondigas de Cerdero, spanish lamb meatballs served over with a mint and tomato sauce, cooked to tender perfection! perfect balance with the mint, since lamb is a warm meat.

Among other notables of creativity, their fried avocados was delicious as well as their Kale salad which was a nice re freshening difference.  Their ceviche was another delight as well.

For those avid eonophiliacs, they serve a delicious organic rioja, which was a nice surprise since I've never had organic vinto tinto! 

Their sangria was alright, however would have wished the fermentation process could have been longer when letting the wine and fruits mingle.

Overall a Gem located in the heart of Kensington!  que bueno!"}
{"text":"Torito was delightful.  We stopped in for appetizers, knowing we would have dinner later.  Every food item was wonderful, and the staff was charming.  The ceviche was perfect, and went nicely with the tarro chips.  The cheeses were remarkable, each with a subtle and complex flavor.  We ordered the ham by accident, and were glad we did, as it was very good.

The staff was very sweet, and seemed proud of Spanish food and culture, in a good way.  We had a lovely time here, would definitely return, and regretted leaving this charming spot for dinner elsewhere.  Next time we'd just sit and eat tapas at Torito!"}
{"text":"Sorry Torito - you missed the mark. 

Looked forward to visiting Torito based on Yelp reviews. As others have stated the ambiance is very nice well decorated, with a laid back kind of feel, which is its only saving grace. 

The food - we ordered the specials of the day, cheek and tongue tacos ($16) and the chicken sliders ($12).  

So lets start with the tacos, I would consider myself an \"adventurous eater\" as I would not generally shy away from eating tongue BUT and its a big BUT, it needs to be 1. cooked well and 2. have some good ol' flavour going on. Fortunately the meat was pretty melt in your mouth, however tasted like... wait for it.... nothing, A BIG OLD NOTHING!! The corn tortillas had more flavour! 

Next chicken sliders!! small bite sized deliciousness in a fresh brioche bun, aioili, haloumi cheese how can you go wrong?? I was imagining 3 beautiful little brioche buns with an glistening egg wash with a wonderfully seasoned chicken patty a piece of grilled haloumi, a wonderful aioili and something for freshness... sorry its nothing like we described, the bread was dark and dry... very dry... the chicken was over cooked, not sure where the haloumi was, maybe ground into the chicken? a wee bit of butter lettuce which didn't add any freshness as the slider was drenched in aioili.... unfortunate... could have been a great slider. 

Would never go back based on quality not being able to match up to the price, would much rather hit up the El Trompo down the street for much less."}
{"text":"My first introduction to tapas (latin for \"spanish dim sum\") was at a place called El Cid in the mid-1990s  up near Yonge & Eglinton. El Cid is long dead. And I've been long searching for a tapas place to replace it. I found one. In Seoul, of all places. Torito, alas, could not match El Cid. 

I came  here with two Japanese women I met at a Japanese movie night. The post movie night mixer I found them both drinking sangria and we arranged to meet later in the month for more sangria and tapas. The sangria pleased us all. A 1l pitcher ($35) served the three of us well through the meal. The wait staff was very helpful in pouring all through the meal. Service. Tops.

The tapas itself was just okay. The chicken pate I thought could have been served with a softer bread. It was hard to enjoy the pate richness while chomping on the crispy teeth breaking wafers that accompany the spread. 

The pork ribs tasted pretty much like ribs squirted with grocery store BBQ sauce. They were quite tender, however.

The decor is minimal but given tapas is about sharing food and conversation, the place was quite loud. It would be nice if they invested in a bit of sound supression.

Meh. Nothing much here to wow the senses. Okay. But I'm going to keep looking for a TO tapas restaurant to replace the long dead El Cid."}
{"text":"Cute little Spanish tapas bar with a cool Kensington vibe...

Their tiny dishes are meant for sharing so make sure to order 2-3 per person (more if you're really hungry). And sample everything, it's just more fun that way.

The red sangria was just okay, but we thoroughly enjoyed the avocado fries, bacon-wrapped dates, grilled chorizo, padron peppers (I'd recommend all of those dishes) and the lamb sausage was tasty too (daily special). 

After perusing a fellow yelper's review, next time I would also definitely try the patatas bravas and the rossejat. 

Bonus points for the front patio."}
{"text":"Torito is as good as the reviews suggest. The half priced sangria is worth every dime at $15 for 1L if you arrive before 7p (reg $30). The ceviche is loaded with fish and the lightly salted taro chips make for a good pairing. One small suggestion to the kitchen would be to serve it in a flatter plate so that the container with the ceviche sits flat, without sliding. The service is top notch and they even gave me the sangria special even though I arrived a little after 7p and made a reso possible even when none were available to book online. The croquettes were spot on too."}
{"text":"Great taps bar in Kensington.

Stand-out dishes: 

White bass ceviche with corn & yam
(tender chunks of white bass in insanely good cilantro-citrusy juices...the love only grows stronger) 

Shrimps al ajillo
(succulent & saucy... yep, my greatest description yet) 

Honourabe mentions: 

churros w. dulce de leche
(\"like beaver tail, but 100 times better!\" \"wait, like those cinnamon sticks from taco bell but 1,000 better!\" - ok, NOT our greatest descriptions) 

Piquillo peppers stuffed w/ salted cod & tapanade sauce
(would not have ordered...but ohh, the power of reviews. now, you go & try!) 

Grilled flatiron steak, gallega chips & fried egg
(medium rare) 

Roasted quail, pomegranate glaze & sweet squash
(too salty for my taste, but mixed w/ glaze & squash and it redeems) 

It pains, but easily forgettable: 

Crab croquettes w/ parsley aioli 

Braised beef tongue & cheek
(tongue & cheek. cute eh? not so much on the tongue action. PASS. 
won't even attempt to describe texture. never again.)"}
{"text":"Torito is a fun spot to go with a group of 4-6 people if you have a bit of money to burn and are looking for a cozy resto with a fun vibe. The place is built like a really dark bowling alley - long and skinny. I went with 2 friends and we had a great time ordering a bunch of dishes and chatting away amidst the very loud other tables who also seemed to be enjoying themselves. The dishes were very good especially the Grilled Spanish Chorizo and White Bass Ceviche. I'd skip the Patatas Bravas, but I've yet to be wowed by that dish anywhere. Kudos to Torito for their well-rounded sherry menu, which is a lovely pairing to cut through the strong flavours of many of the tapas dishes. Overall, good fun but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Torito is the perfect place to be if your looking to have a few drinks, socialize with friends, share some great food, and enjoy the Toronto patio culture without breaking the bank.  I always like to sit in the back patio because it's shaded so I can enjoy being outside without baking in the sun.  The tapas here are all more or less than $10.  The value-cost ratio is through the roof because both the taste and portions are great.  My favourites are the ceviche, octopus with chickpeas, and avocado fries.  Even though I'm not a big fan of lamb, I must say that the lamb meatballs were very well done.  They retained the distinct flavour of the meat but didn't make me feel like I was walking into a petting zoo.  The food here isn't fancy-shmancy, but everything is super tasty and the drinks are refreshing -- the quintessential Kensington Market experience!"}
{"text":"Spanish tapas can be a tricky one for us pescetarians. I used to adore Torito for all of it's heavily meaty offerings, but figured that there was no longer anything there for me now. How could I have forgotten that Spanish cooking does seafood oh so right? 

Flavourful dishes such as iced melon ball soup with fragrant spicy oil, plump and juicy on the inside crab cakes, garlic oil shrimp with charred garlicky bread, ceviche with fried corn kernals and yam, and warm churros served with dulce de leche did just the job to remind me that I'm still very welcome at Torito.

During warmer weather, the more intimate white canopied back patio with lime green walls provides a fresher dimension to the warm boite and small sidewalk patio seating options."}
{"text":"Despite the casual decor, I was very impressed with the food at Torito.  The ceviche in particular was our favourite as were the churros we had for dessert.  Yummy sangria and good wine list.  Overall bill came to $140 for two of us including drinks which wasn't cheap, but we had a great time."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant half a star if I could. Any alcohol serving restaurant that takes over 40 minutes to bring a drink is just an absolute embarrassment to the service industry. 

I came in around 6 pm on a Saturday with my girlfriend to have a drink. They had a half off special for the sangria, so we figured why not. The restaurant was empty, save for the back patio which was relatively busy. 

It took them a good 15 minutes to serve us a plate of bland bread and microwaved olives which might not have been so bad if I had not witnessed 2 other tables, which by the way had sat down long after we had sat down, getting the same orders a few minutes after they ordered. Not to mention ALL the tables around us had already gotten their drinks before we even got a small plate of bread( which I imagine should come after the drink). It took them over 40 minutes to get us a small jar of sangria.

With all that said and done the sangria itself wasn't that bad, hence why I would have given any rating at all. The bread and olive plate was absolute trash, I love olives and bread, how do you screw up olives and bread? 

I can't speak for any of the other items on their menu but if you can't even get something simple as this right,  I sincerely doubt anything else on the menu to be half decent. 

This place had managed to so seriously ruin my mood that I made a yelp account. I was a happy camper until I came to this place that evening, I came out of this godforsaken establishment for the worse."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in around 6 on a Saturday because we saw their sangria deal.  We decided to sit on their back patio which at the time was relatively busy, though the rest of the restaurant was empty when we walked in. 

We ordered the sangria and the Spanish olives and bread to snack on as we had already eaten dinner. The waitress took our order at a standard time but this is where it went downhill for us. The sangria deal was ending half an hour after we walked in, we did not get the sangria until past 7. On top of this we had asked twice about our order to any waitstaff we could get a hold of, none of them seemed to have the time to stop.

Personally I had felt a little sympathy as I noticed the waitress who took our order struggled with English a little bit. However, it did not change the fact that at least 3 other tables had gotten sangria as well as food orders before us. It didn't help that our order was a relatively simple one too. Had someone come by to acknowledge that we had been waiting for 45 minutes for some olives and wine I think my boyfriend would have not left as angry as he was.

The sangria was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Great food. Barcelona vibe. Friendly staff and I love their back patio. They have an incredible variety of wine and sherry."}
{"text":"Had a really great first time here celebrating a friend's birthday! They have a decent selection of tapas here, and having just returned from Spain, I was pleased to see that many of them were legitimate Spanish-type dishes. In particular, the ceviche was delicious, and the avocado fries were quite interesting (very flavourful, although I found the seasoning to be a bit heavy and too salty.) The octopus carpaccio, while quite smooth and buttery in texture, just couldn't compare to the freshness of the seafood in Spain. The sangria here (both red and white) was also fantastic! The two servers we had were great, they were super friendly and also spoke Spanish, which added to the authenticity of the experience. Overall it was a fun experience here with pretty good food - would recommend checking this place out if you're in the Kensington area! Bill can rack up quickly though, since each tapa dish is at least $8 and they are not that big, so don't expect to leave feeling super full unless you spend quite a bit. Definitely best to come with a group so you can share and try more things, or just pop in for a snack!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The atmosphere and service was great, and the food was amazing. We tried nearly everything on the menu, and it was all really good. Our favorites however were: Fried Avocado, Arugula Salad, Stuffed, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Patatas Bravas, and the Churros. The drinks were really good, and we can't wait to go back here next time we are in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Uhhhh... I don't think so...

Overpriced and underwhelming. Just because you serve tapas doesn't make you a spanish restaurant....

Nice decor and decent service but let's be honest, this is a restaurant and I'm here for the food. And the food just wasn't that good.

Tapas are meant for sharing but the portions were so small that our table kept 'fighting' to find something to eat. The prices don't help either and $10 for 3 slices of cheese is just silly. Especially when you can walk around the corner to Global Village and buy a whole pound!

Full disclosure: I'm from Spain and perhaps a bit more demanding of anything that calls itself 'Spanish' but this was a huge letdown.

Don't think I'll be coming back..."}
{"text":"This was the restaurant my good friend decided to host a great night out with good food and of course wine. My drink for the evening was the red sangria, it was a great addition to the meal but I didn't think it was the best sangria out there. I have been to other tapas restaurants before and I found the menu at this place was a little limited. We ordered multiple orders of

Cold Items
- Spanish Olives
- Avocado Fries with Roasted Tomato Salsa
- Tabla de Quesos (Cheese plate)

Hot Items
- Saut√©ed Kale with Lemon and Garlic Chips
- Stuffed Date Pintxos Wrapped with Double Smoked Bacon
- Grilled Spanish Chorizo
- Albondigas de Cordero (Lamb Meatballs with Mint and Tomato Preserve)

All in all the items we ordered were extremely tasty. Being as big as a group we were (taking up 1/2 of the restaurant) I did notice that the service was a bit slow. I also noticed that every time one end of the table would order something it would go to the other end or in the middle which then was eaten by the wrong group that placed the order. This caused people to have extremely long wait times between the orders. I remember having to ask the server multiple times for another pitcher of the sangria before we got to see it. I don't think they were expecting a long volume of orders from one group of customers but the kitchen staff and the wait staff did try their best.

The place was very dim and romantic. I like how they have a patio for nice summer nights, what I didn't like was the fact the washrooms were in the basement of the restaurant. Going down a flight of stairs in heals after a few glasses of wine was definitely no fun.

All in all nice restaurant, and if asked I would go back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located on Augusta avenue with a small outdoor patio that is fenced in, facing the street. Inside the long narrow space is decorated in hushed tones with a few tables facing the street, then a bar with the kitchen behind that. A corridor beside this, leads to patio in the back that is covered with sun sails giving it a nice bit of shade from the sun. The place oozes a polite sophistication that never tries to hard to be trendy. The decor is simple but elegant. The service while attentive is relaxed in that European manner, helping to create an ambience that is never rushed. Eating tapas is about relaxing over a languid meal while enjoying good food and good company. The menu features a selection of Spanish inspired tapas that all sounded interesting. We opted for a selection of dishes to try a diversity of flavours. Everything arrived plated beautifully. First came some olives, then a ceviche that was served with chips and came in tiny mason jars which the server then opened at the table. Everything showed an attention to detail and flavour. The padron peppers, little fried peppers were delicious, as were the fried mushrooms (which we had in olive oil rather than butter), there was also a really good lemon/garlic kale dish and patatas bravas (potatoes in tomato sauce) that were also really delicious. Our only issue was that we had to ask for bread, which should have arrived before the meal with some olive so that we could have used it to soak up some of the delicious sauces. This however is a minor quibble, Torito is a dining experience that should not be missed."}
{"text":"2 times here. Second was just yesterday. Nice warm night and very nice to find the back patio that is really quieter than the main dining area inside. 
For was just as food the first time although I noticed the summer menu is different from the winter menu. In the winter they had paella. This time there was paella styled pasta. 
The good stuff: sangria (half price before 7) avocado fries, lamb meatballs,  cerviche and chorizo. 
Not as  good: pear apple salad(too sweet as salad and not much), steak frites( steak was too well done for my taste and salty but the zucchini fries were excellent), only chorros as dessert (while they were very good but not always in the mood for deep fried stuff for dessert after zucchini and avocado fries) 

Will go back and try other stuff too. But note. Big parties will have 18% gratuity added automatically. I am okay with that since waiters were nice. Just not always sure if I can hear their announcement of what they were bringing to the table"}
{"text":"It was not the best place, over priced for the portion size, had to ask for refill of water, the service otherwise was okay, food was flavourful and good if you want something small, but to get many different plates is a little much."}
