{"text":"I ordered a chicken soft taco, it was my first time ordering from this truck. I was given 2 tacos that were filled with lettuce! No toppings were offered, no cheese, jalape√±os, hot sauce, nothing. Below the lettuce was a small amount of chicken and frozen corn. I have no idea what they're thinking."}
{"text":"The meat burritos can cost around $10 and the portions are big. The big but is that they are extremely bland. There seemed to be no sour cream or salsa inside the wrap and even though the service is great, I woul'd suggest going to a different place for a better $10 bite."}
{"text":"Filling and good wuality fresh and clean. Nice staff and supppppper clean, and my favourite food is their crazyyyy frisee"}
{"text":"Got a burrito bowl it was pretty good. But everyone was lining up to get fries. Don't eat the bowl FYI"}
{"text":"I had the crazy fries.  They were amazing.  So crispy, the toppings were generous and had a lot of flavour.  Some of the best supreme fries I've ever had!  I even went back to let them know and they were very grateful."}
{"text":"I went to the food truck. Absolutely terrible. I ordered the burrito bowl. It was cold and used ingredients from a can. Given the extensive amount of Mexican cuisine in Toronto, don't waste your time here. Even Mucho Burrito is better."}
{"text":"Not a very good experience at all.  It's sad that people jump into the food truck craze and produce a product they have no clue about.  I had this experience at Mel Lastman Square in North York today.  I'm writing this as I'm eating 3 \"steak\" soft tacos. Here's why I'm supremely disappointed:  1.  Their \"steak\" taco is actually ground beef.  Either you guys don't know what steak is or this is just blatant misleading.  You wouldn't be happy walking into a Keg to order an 8-ounce steak and be served ground beef.  Yikes.  Nothing wrong with eating and selling ground beef btw.    2.  They should have called this Lettuce Soft Taco.    3.  They don't have their own freaking hot sauce of some sort.  Dudes, even if you have to mix Saracha with mayo, it shows more effort than offering your customers packaged hot sauce that they give out when you order Chinese takeout.  The only bright note about this experience is that my cold pop was actually cold."}
