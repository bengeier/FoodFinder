{"text":"I went to Pasha a while back after hearing good things. I have to say that I ended up extremely disappointed. Although the table cloths and decor are nice, it is all a facade!  This place is trying way too hard to be a classy restaurant, and their prices are extremely inflated for food that is far from authentic anything. I ordered the Turkish Delight- a vegetarian dish of hummus and vegetables. What did I get served to me? A ring of hummus likely scooped out of a container from somewhere sitting in a puddle of oil surrounding some FROZEN VEGETABLES swimming in even more mystery oil and the smallest pinch of some unknown, bland spice. Worst $10 I have ever spent. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Pasha's is like your wayward older brother who you hope will mature, find himself and get a job. You keep hoping, and he keeps letting you down. Of all the cuisines, Turkish should be the easiest, and one of the best to showcase. It is not too spicy for many Americans, nor too unfamiliar, yet different enough that they will be encouraged to try it. Except for the unfortunate wall decor, it is a pleasant enough venue and intended as a sit down restaurant, not a fast food joint. The menu is traditional. However, the two biggest problems are: the food and the staff and this means there is NO ONE IN CHARGE , especially no one who knows the food business. This is why restaurants fail (which makes me wonder about their opening a new place!). I have been to Pasha's five times, so I know of what I speak: dinners, lunches, take out dinner). I originally wrote a litany of all of the ills for each time I visited, but I realized it is the above mentioned problem. It comes down to: the owners/managers need to have a passion-not just for making money, but for showcasing their country's food. it is hard to botch Turkish food, but a lack of caring and accountability will do it all for you. Otherwise, the owners would be better off with a Doner Kabob at the mall. We want a good Turkish cafe, but after spending $600 or more, I feel like I should be a part-owner. Actually, I am like that sister who kept lending her brother money after he kept promising to return it and live responsibly. But now, I say no more."}
{"text":"I was so excited that there was a Mediterranean restaurant in Champaign! I dragged my boyfriend along with me on a Saturday morning (around 11:30). It was the morning of the first big snow, and the roads hadn't been plowed yet, but such was the size of my craving... We were the only ones in the restaurant, and the two waiters looked a little shocked that we came in. We were seated, and after a few minutes we were brought some warm bread. It was alright, but not like the delicious breads I've been served in restaurants of this type before. We were given the menu which said \"dinner\" on it, and I asked if we had the right ones (I always check to see if the restaurant has a menu online before I go). The waiter said that they do not serve lunch on the weekends, which made me a little perturbed because we had kind of wanted pitas or something rather than dinner. I wound up ordering the imam fainted, a dish of roasted eggplant, tomatoes, feta cheese, maybe bell peppers... the dinner was served with rice and a salad of chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and onion. The dish was overwhelmingly salty. It was very tasty during the first few bites, but after a while it was too much. Also, there were only two slivers of roasted eggplant, and the dish cost about $12. The onions in the salad were so sharp that I couldn't really eat that either. I love leftovers, but did not finish this dish. My boyfriend got something with beef and vegetables and ate it all, but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very mixed experiences here. Some of the dishes are fantastic, and remind me of some of the best food I've had in the Balkans. All too often though, food seems to be sad and uninspiring, tasting like it came from a can and microwaved. Its too much of a gamble for me."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in quite a while. Started with the lentil soup, it was tasteless and need at least ten shakes of salt to even taste like something other than water. Ordered Lamb stuffed peppers an zucchini, and got two tiny pieces of vegetable loaded with tasteless rice and no meat whatsoever drowned in a tomato paste right out of the can and doused with vinegar, the taste was all \"store bought tomato paste\" and the worst thing was it cost nearly 15 dollars. Wish I could rate 0 stars, but Pasha earns a 1 because I have no other choice."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert and was appalled at how poorly prepared it was.  We tried the baklava and crème caramel, and each was absolutely terrible.  I was very taken aback that a restaurant would actually serve dishes as obviously bad as what was placed in front of us.

The phyllo in the baklava seemed to simply have been thawed and cut into squares as a solid chunk instead of separating out and buttering the layers.  This resulted in a dessert with the taste and texture of raw bread dough.  It looked and tasted as if it had not been baked.  The walnut filling was minimal, and the honey was somehow watery.  It was awful.

Even worse than the watery, doughy baklava was the crème caramel.  They didn't temper the egg yolks when making the custard so the eggs scrambled.  Instead of a smooth, rich custard, what we got was more like eggy cottage cheese.  You could tell just by looking at it what had happened.  My dining companion likened it to a cold, gelatinous omelet topped with caramel, which was also watery.  I actually gagged when I tried a bite.  It was absolutely disgusting.

While waiting for the desserts we looked over the menu and were excited to come back for dinner on our next night out.  One bite of the terrible desserts changed those plans. The experience made me feel kind of bad because our server was wonderful and I fear she may soon be out of a job if her employer doesn't turn things around."}
{"text":"Pasha is a new place that just opened in the rapidly developing retail complex at Windsor and Duncan in southwest Champaign.  They serve Greek, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean cuisine, and our first trip there was excellent!  We tried a delicious appetizer (I forget what it's called, but it was puff pastry wrapped around cheese and parsley in cigar shapes), but the flaming cheese seemed to be by far the most popular.  We got to see several shows of that from different tables around the restaurant.

Entrees were equally excellent.  Our server, Samantha, recommended the chicken, and we were not disappointed.  I had the Chicken Couscous, which came with chicken, potatoes, and various vegetables all served in a delicious sauce.  I don't know how they cook their chicken, but it's incredibly tender and juicy.  My husband enjoyed the Adana kebabs, which was a mixture of seasoned beef and lamb.  Wine selection was somewhat limited, but the pours were generous.

Our server was extremely friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was quite nice.  A bit on the noisy side, but when you combine a new restaurant on a Saturday night vibe with Homecoming, you do get a bit of noise.  One interesting feature is the corner table, where diners sit on the floor in true Middle Eastern fashion.  This seems to be the only table like it, so my guess is that reservations are required for that one.  Prices are reasonable, around $10-$15 per entree.  We didn't have room for dessert, but we'll definitely save room next time.  A welcome addition to Champaign's west side!"}
{"text":"This is an okay place, service was fine and the owner is very affable.  But if you have eaten this cuisine in Chicago or a larger area, it falls short.  Too bland overall.  And sorry, undressed cabbage as a side is not \"salad\", even if it comes for free."}
{"text":"first visit here...

for lunch. had a fab house salad with kofte - patties of seasoned lamb. outstanding! large portion, inexpensive: $5.95.

my son had gyros - he says: \"fresh greens, great tzatziki, sliced lamb;, \"fantastik!\" under $10.

the decor is nice - and there's one corner with traditional seating for a group. the dinner menu is slightly different, with more selections. my son says their fried calamari is great.

price range depends on when you go. you can get lunch for under $10. entrees for dinner run $11.95 to $22.95 per person for mediterranean lamb chops."}
{"text":"The longer Pasha has been open, the worse the quality of the food seems to be.  When it first opened, the bread served prior to the entree was excellent.  Now it's just kind of soggy and ick.  This wouldn't be a problem except that bread is a huge part of the Turkish meal: served with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Not to be knit-picky, either, but at some point they started serving lettuce with the entree instead of cabbage.  One never knows what a difference this makes until they get a pile of lettuce on their plate when they are expecting something more hearty.
I enjoy the layout of the restaurant as well as the wine selection and entree portions (definitely enough to take home for later!)  In a lot of ways, going to Pasha just makes me wish I could go back to Istanbul or even A La Turka to get some higher quality Turkish food!  On the other hand, the tabouli and other appetizers such as borek leave me satisfied enough to probably go back."}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better when it first opened.  I mean.. it's still okay.  Decent decor and it's relatively inexpensive for going out.  The service is kind of bad though.  Inexperienced waitstaff I think.

I think the food used to be better until they started taking short cuts (like most local business that first open and then they start trying to save money).  I used to like the Sultan's Delight but I really believe they now just precook it and then heat it up.  The Shrimp Pasha and Pasha special is also good.  The salad that comes with the shrimp pasha is pretty good.  So much better than the stuff you get at Zorba's.  I also like the calamari.

I'm not sure if I would come again though.. there is a definite decline in food quality."}
{"text":"My Beef Humus was tasty tasty tasty, but for real, why were the olives on my feta plate clearly just recently delivered from their can?  Canned olives at a mediterranean restaurant?  No dice.

Our server was trying to be attentive and friendly, but accidentally touched my boob while pointing at the menu which made me quicker to say that he was over-attentive and irritatingly friendly than I might have been otherwise.

Edited to add:  On my last trip to Pasha I had the worst dish I've ever  been served in restaurant in my life.  I've never been so close to sending a meal back.  Afterwards I went home and made myself mac'n'cheese.  The kind from the box."}
