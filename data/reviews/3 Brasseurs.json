{"text":"We came here before going to the Ricoh Colliseum for a Leafs pre-season game and had a fantastic time! The restaurant was quite busy due to the Leafs game and also the TFC game that night, but service was quick and friendly. The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious. There is great variety on the menu, and of course the drinks were fantastic. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good meal and good beer."}
{"text":"great service, a very friendly staff. As we sat down we were kindly greeted and offered a club membership card, which pretty much is a point card but the good part about it we were able to use $5 off right away. Where we were seated we can see the chefs in the kitchen, which I think all restaurants should be like. All in all great spot."}
{"text":"Came here last Friday with a friend - as far as brewhouses/pubs go, I love the decor and theme that they've got going on with massive brewing vats and pipes everywhere (might not be for everyone). Service was quick and friendly, the food was excellent, and overall great for an outing with friends and/or groups!"}
