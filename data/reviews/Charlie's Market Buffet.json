{"text":"Not good. Actually, the Frisco Market Buffet is the worst buffet that I have had in Las Vegas (or anywhere, for that matter). Nothing looked good, nothing tasted good. As others have said, the food looked like it had been sitting out for hours upon hours. The items that looked safe enough to eat were tasteless or dry. Even the desserts were stale.   There are so many other decent buffets in Vegas - even less expensive ones. I recommend passing on the Frisco Market Buffet inside of Arizona Charlie's and finding your way to...well, anywhere else."}
{"text":"Three stars only because the food was actually pretty good. The buffet, in comparisons to others I have been to in Las Vegas, was small and didn't have that large of a selection, though.  We were seated relatively quickly, however, our server came to see us once the entire time to find out what we wanted to drink and that was the last we saw of her. She didn't stop by to see if we wanted refills, if we needed new utensils, or just to see how we were doing. I didn't like that at all."}
{"text":"Absolutley the worst buffet in all of las vegas. I eat at alot of them. No variety. Bad food. And this after their so called revamping. Service dont come around much, they just stand in corner of room starring at you. Creepy."}
{"text":"After a night of hard-partying, my husband dragged me out of bed to get the extra cheap breakfast, which they stop serving at 11am.  When we made our way from our room to the restaurant, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get into the buffet.  Since we were not ordering buffet, we proceeded directly to the hostess stand.  We were seated and given menus and glasses of ice water.  I decided on the biscuits and gravy, and a glass of milk.    While we were waiting for our food, come cranky old lady started to yell at the waiter in a deep Southern accent (about how no one had come to take her order.)  I don't know how long she had been there, but that wasn't the end of her outbursts.  She later started shouting about not having anything to drink.  In the background was the neverending racket of the slot machines.  My biscuits and gravy were really tasty, and the price was under $6.  My three star rating reflects the ambience of the place-- you never forget that you are in a casino.  xoxox"}
{"text":"The worst buffet I have been visited! I was asked to leave by a very rude cashier, when lunch started and breakfast stopped.  What buffet asks you to leave because a new time of the day begins? I came 30 minutes before the breakfast buffet ended.The food was very cold, tasteless, and I didn't eat anything; thinking I could have lunch in a few minutes. The manager offered to take care of my meal, but I was totally disgusted and wanted my money returned.  Most Vegas places beg locals to visit; this place lost a customer in general."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the friendly service and food.  Was a very quiet and calm atmosphere, the staff couldn't have been nicer.  The food was just great!!  Great selection, yummy mashed potatoes, pizza really good, menudo, pisole, good desert section, good salad, nice selection overrall of home cooked tasting food.  My only complaint was the tamales weren't fully cooked, the massa was raw, and the ham didn't taste good to me.  But everything else was really really good.  Nice selection, again the staff was very friendly, they didn't charge extra for drinks.  Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Ate here  3 years ago and the I have to say the food here is terrible when I came here for my one and only time on my birthday I thought I was going to be wowed by this place as I am big on buffets and decent prices like this place but outside of the service which is good as the people have good customer service skills and are very friendly the food here is terrible most of it was hard or unedible outside of the chicken which is hard to mess up it was really delicious by the way also the desserts were really hard and not fresh at all I was very disappointed that I payed 20 dollars for all of that on my birthday as I was hoping for something decent overall I haven't came back and I recommend if you want a good decent buffet with a reasonable price there are plenty of places out here in vegas that has those and you won't be disappointed but other then that avoid this place."}
{"text":"They have revamped this buffet. It's definitely a lot better than it was before. Although it is an average buffet, it's now a lot cleaner and the quality of dishes has also improved. The staff was very good, always keeping our drinks filled and kept clearing our used plates, and we had a huge party of eleven! I would definitely recommend that if you're in the area and want to go to a typical buffet at a low price, give this one a chance."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  They sent me a freebie and they have completely renovated this \"grandmas diner\" type buffet.   All new and clean and revamped with a made to order grill w burgers (grilled onion mushroom and Swiss), ham and cheese and hot fries just like your (my) short order cook grandma would make for me.  Plus a decent small buffet w things like stuffed cabbage and lots of cream pies.  So if you are looking for yesteryear, you just might find it here."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast- it's the BF's favorite local breakfast buffet, mostly because it's walking distance from our house, but he's also a big breakfast fan in general.  Me? Not so much. This place is clean and the service is good, selection isn't huge but there's enough even for me to enjoy- fruit, made-to-order omelet station (heads up, they go super-heavy on the cheese), and a Mexican food station with nachos, breakfast burritos, menudo, and a great chorizo-and-potato hash.   Most breakfast staples are here (biscuits, ham, sausage, oatmeal, chicken fried steak, etc) and the price is low ($6-ish with players card, $8-ish without), and I like that it's never very crowded."}
{"text":"This buffet is hit or miss and it figures that the time I decide to review it, the place had a very off day, including giving me a mild case of food poisoning again. Usually, the fried chicken, if available, is the top attraction, due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day, which was a Monday afternoon, I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough, that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad, that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried, but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it, so it tastes just like, well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well, but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent, although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn, etc) he is all over it, taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet, but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner, it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch, which would include potatoes. Oh, the rice was excellent."}
{"text":"Poor seleccion of food. I waited 20 min. To get my drink refiilled. Waitress was only talking with her friends avoiding attending us.  Price is ok.....but im not going back. Arizona charlies in decatur is waaaayyy better."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch June 7. My relatives live there and don't have much money, so they like this place because it's cheap. If you join their slot club (which is free), you get a discount at the buffet. Also, we got the senior discount, so it was less than $9 per person.  They all liked it better than the Circus Circus buffet. I think I liked the Circus Circus one slightly better, but that one was way more expensive.  The chicken is really good. The ham was so not so great. I loved their \"no sugar added\" chocolate pie.  Nothing was marked as gluten free, so I was taking a risk eating there. They had some pretty good salad options. There wasn't much there that wasn't breaded and fried.  The waitress was very nice.  She told us about some other food we could order that was not obvious. I probably wouldn't go there again since it's so out of the way."}
{"text":"I had a bad feeling about this place and I should have listened to my gut. If I did I wouldnt be awake at 4am with what I call reverse food poisoning where it comes out....well u know. Sorry for the tmi but I ate here 12 hours earlier and im still paying for it. The only saving grace was that Friday night dinner includes ayce new york steak made to your liking. And I got there right before they switched from lunch to dinner so I only paid 8.99 instead of 13.99. Stay away."}
{"text":"Expecting the worse but was pleasantly surprised. They grill the hotdogs and burgers to order with fresh French fries. Had a 2 for 1 coupon and left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Good selection of moderate quality food.  Can't really beat the price, and extra 10% off just for joining their player's club.  Drink service was excellent our first night, our waitress brought us two glasses to start, and kept them coming during the whole meal.    The prime rib was actually quite good for dinner, and I managed to find a good selection of other things to eat."}
{"text":"I flew my 71 year old mother into Las Vegas for the holidays . She had been looking forward to having Arizona Charlie's buffet the whole time she's been here every time we drive by she mentions it . One of her church friends took her for lunch  buffet on New Year's Day after eating one plate she went back up to get another plate she walked up and this tall skinny female Chef's with glasses told my mother she can't have anymore and was extremely rude and nasty to her . my mom went back to the table she informed her friend and she told me when she got home . I made a phone call to the food and beverage manager and manager of the buffet and informed him of this situation and he just said that he's going to check the surveillance cameras and talk to somebody  about the situation. he didn't even ask our names or anything to even send an apology or call. The food and beverage manager never called it's just ridiculous that they can treat seniors this way how abuse of their position !! I wish I had been there because she wouldn't have been treating my mother like that . how many seniors get treated like their the dirt underneath somebody shoes because that female chief has a bug up her backside. Very unprofessional despicable uncalled for Behavior on all counts from the Chef & The Manager!"}
{"text":"Basic and filling, the buffet was great for the price. I discovered made to order burgers in the center section... and had a mah-vah-lous grilled cheese . Crispy, gooey, crunchy, smooth... yum! The day we were there was a birthday celebration and a very pretty cake was shared with the patrons. Only downside was the heavy smoke..."}
{"text":"No, no, no.   I generally view buffets with an open mind. After all, there is a variety to choose from, and if you choose the wrong thing, you can always go get something else. And if worse comes to      worse, just make a nice big salad and then hit the dessert bar, right? Wrong. Unless you want a heapin' helpin' of wilted iceberg with shredded carrots and canned beans, topped off with a piece of week-old sheet cake or a plastic cup of chewy Jell-o in one of the less desirable flavors like orange or yellow).  We had actually been here a couple of times in the past. Enough to know that the only thing worth eating is the made to order cheeseburgers and fries, which you can get cheaper in the coffee shop. Everything else (and it's not that much) seems like it's either swimming in a pool of sticky brown gray made from a powdered mix, or halfway through the mummification process in some desiccated tomato-based sauce. No, thank you.  BUT, I received a mailer containing the news that they had remodeled AND a couple of free passes, so we decided to give it a go. Went early on a Sunday afternoon. The place as packed and there was a line - unheard of! I took it to mean that there had been some great improvements made. Nope. Just meant they sent out a lot of free mailers, and the staff was dreadful.   We waited in line (VIP line, mind you) over 20 minutes, amazed by servers and bussers who were neither serving nor bussing, just kind of wandering. They were as adept at ignoring us as they were the empty, dirty tables. The only one clearing dishes and showing any hustle was a guy in a shirt and tie who I assume was the manager. Good for him for being involved, but bad on him for not doing his real job and lighting a fire under that listless staff.  Once we got inside, we could discern absolutely no sign of any remodeling. All the food selections looked exactly the same with one exception: there used to be a big bowl of cheap, store bought cookies on the end station (you know what I'm talking about - those 99 cent store Chips Ahoy). No one knew why it was there, but it had replaced by a giant plastic bag with cheap dinner rolls spilling put onto the counter.  I guess in their minds, that WAS the remodel.  Never again. Not for free. Not even if they pay me."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars!  Stopped by the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's Decatur because I heard they totally renovated it recently.  I must say it looks pretty good inside for a local's joint!  From what I vaguely remember what it used to look like this is a welcome improvement.  Much cleaner looking.  Visited for lunch one day solo.  If you get the Arizona Charlie's player's card, the lowest level gets you $1 off I believe.  The higher your card status, the bigger the discount.  Lunch time during a weekday was not very busy.  The dining room was more than half full, but there was no line outside by the cashier.  Reaching the buffet line was easy!  Various stations all located on one end.  There's an American section, Mexican section, Asian section, Italian section, as well as a salad & dessert section.  Surprisingly, there's even a sushi section as well as a create-your-own stir fry station.  Overall the food quality is OK.  Really, that's not a bad thing at all.  I was kinda expecting worse.  It has all the things you would expect at a local Las Vegas buffet, and the quality is on par as well.  Fresher things that arrive on the line of course taste better.  I tried not to eat anything that was sitting too long.  The fried chicken wasn't bad, and the meat lasagna was actually pretty good that I even had a second serving.  The sushi was not the greatest, probably made ahead and stored in the cooler because the rice was a little hard.  The rotisserie chicken was moist, and their pizza had a decent crust.  The highlight for me though was a bit of a shocker.  Behind the American/Mexican section of the buffet they have a grill where you can either order burgers, hot dogs, or....QUESADILLAS!  I swear these quesadillas for some reason were delicious!  I got one of each, one with chicken and other with carne asada (steak).  And damn, those carne asada quesadillas rocked!  Tasty when they are fresh made!  I think the chef cooked it just right for me because I like my quesadillas extra crunchy on the tortilla exterior.  Their quesadillas actually topped some of the other local Mexican places in town for me, and blew the chain restaurants out of the water.  I think I had like 3 of them - with a dollop of sour cream, guac, and a hit of Cholula I was into some mighty good eats!  That's why I gave the Market Buffet the extra half star.  Service was quick & friendly, I had no complaints since it wasn't very busy.  My drinks were always kept full, and my empty plates taken away promptly.  Lunch price isn't too bad either with the player's card, comes out to about $10 and change.  So it is a tad more expensive than the local Station Casino buffet.  I know the standards for the Market Buffet at Arizona Charlie's isn't exactly high gourmet, but in a quick lunch it'll do.  It really beats a greasy burger from a fast food joint, even though at this buffet you can get that too.  I'll be back for some more carne asada quesadillas!"}
{"text":"Ok , this is one of those looking a gift horse in the mouth type of reviews . We came here because my partner and I got free buffet coupons as we had recently played bingo here, so we decided to use them , we weren't really expecting much and this place did not exceed those expectations , lol . It is a rather small buffet but filled with a little something for everyone which is to say standard buffet fare , although most items were good , I did find most were already cold or barely warm and the buffet just opened for dinner service? This last comment is directed at the management and they can hopefully correct this issue. Their standout items were any of the carved meats , I did try a little bit of each and thoroughly enjoyed the brisket!! Each of the meats were flavorful, tender and juicy, the variety that day were brisket, ham,turkey, pork loin and sausage. The pork loin was a very close second and had an awesome spice rub on it, they also do make cooked to order burgers , hot dogs , grilled cheese and French fries . The burger was awesome and brought me back to an old school back yard BBQ & that was the only item I did eat every bite of!!! Desserts were standard fare and they also have a soft serve sundae station with a lot of different toppings. Service was good and we never felt ignored and beverages were refilled promptly, only service issue was the lady at the grill and carving section did seem to be bothered by being there and was a bit gruff . All in all it was a good visit and would definitely return if they correct their temperature issues because it was a decent meal for dinner 10.99 per  person and cheaper depending on your level of play with players card!"}
{"text":"Located in Arizona Charlie's on the Westside. Ok so let me start with this, it's a cheap buffet so I will not compare it to the likes of The Bellagio or The Cosmopolitan. It gets compared to other cheap buffets, and for that it gets the rating it does. Almost everything was great, I came at the tail end of breakfast and stayed for lunch. Everything except the hot dog was very good. I was pleasantly surprised.  hell I even had a salad, and that my fellow Yelpers, is a rarity. All that being said I dont know that I would make a special trip out there, but if you happen to find yourself in the neighborhood, stop in and enjoy this very inexpensive yet pretty good buffet. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Wow!! For being inside a small, okay casino this buffet really made my tummy happy. The looks of the casino looks outdated and kinda sad, but the buffet located up stairs is updated and clean.  They had fall of the bone pork ribs, delicious wings, prime rib, ham, pizza, pasta station (where they make infront of you and you select what you would like) the desert station was delicious.  I was not expecting how good the buffet was. Great job. Staff was very friendly and on top of it!! Buffet was always full, empty plates taken right away and full drinks."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, They don't know how to clean the tables my jacket got dirty from all the stickiness that was left on the table before. It's not the best food either, pretty crappy if you ask me. The food taste like it's been there for more than a day or two."}
{"text":"This place is awful and the service and food sucks.its cheap. All the customers look like the walking dead.The hamburgers are the only good thing in there"}
{"text":"I had low standards for the Arizona Charlie's Buffet and they were still unable to meet them.  Ethnic Food variety: 3 Stars. They do have sushi (looking scary), asian dishes, mexican dishes and typical American type food. Food Quality: 1 Star. If there was a negative star option, I would chose that. The food looks like it is 5+ hours old and previously chewed. The fish was like salmon-jerky.  Service: 4 Stars. I never went without a refill.  Price: 25+Tip for Sunday Dinner for two people... Not exactly a bargain.  The Good: I was able to stick to my healthy diet because everything looked so old and dried out I decided just to have a salad, refried beans and a chocolate cupcake."}
{"text":"Before I lose all credibility on yelp for handing this place 4 stars, let me mention what's good...  Every Tuesday is 2 for 1 with a free players card, which makes dinner under $6/person.  What else is good?  -Service was 5 star. The waitress never had our drink glasses empty, the people behind the buffet were also very friendly. -The Mexican station was exceptional with made to order quesadillas loaded with cheese. Head to Chili's or any restaurant and you are paying $8 for that alone. Well worth my $6. -The pasta station was surprisingly good. Chicken alfredo over penne with artichokes, mushrooms, garlic, pepper and whatever else he put in there was excellent. -The ice cream was creamy, not that cheap ice milk (think of the last Chinese buffet you went to...yeah, NOT that stuff) -Egg drop soup and lo mein were passable quality for most take out Chinese joints -Brisket with aus ju and creamy horseradish had me go back for seconds, not bad  I originally saw a billboard mentioning this Tuesday deal and saw a yelper rave about the quesadillas, figuring if they at least had a half decent taco station I'd find some value...sure enough I did and I will return."}
{"text":"We came here on a couple times on a Friday night and had their Prime rib AYCE for $12.96 (We used the Caisno Guide BOGO)  - The buffet is very simple. American, Mexican, Salad bar, pizza, soup and grill.  - The best part about this buffet and the only reason why we come here is just for Friday nights for their Prime Rib. - Great prime rib. They actually re-grill a somewhat rare slab and it is amazing! Very flavorful, and not dry. I love it.  - They make fresh cheeseburgers. We order the cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms with freshly fried french fries.  - For the price of about 6.50 per person, this buffet beats any fast food American restaurant.  - Free sodas with buffet.  - Always empty so service is always nice.  - I don't touch much of the other stuff. It's more like AYCE prime rib and burgers haha.  - Chicken soup is very salty.  - Compared to Feast buffet, Feast is better.  - 11.99 Fri Sat is for Blue Ace members.  - Closes at 9pm Friday. They start cleaning the buffet at 9:15 and it closes at 9:30pm"}
{"text":"So I came here specifically for their prime rib, that's all they had to offer,all of their other food looks like it was from last week. I got here at 5pmish, hoping they would have a nice slab of beef out, but all they had were scraps, so I wait patiently for the scraps to be picked up by people that didn't know better. So they got a fresh piece out, and it looked like it was from last night. This is my last time here, I'll have to play slots elsewhere."}
{"text":"My family and i went today for dinner, and i have to admit it's not as bad as we thought it was gonna be. We paid $5 pp bcuz the Buffet has a promotion this month only on Wednesdays.  It was decent for $5.  The place is very clean and the staff was super nice.  They have 3 cook to order station where you can get Fajitas,Quesadillas, burgers,hot dogs, and stir fry. They also have a small salad bar but i have to admit the lettuce had seen better days.  They also had a carving station with prime rib which could of been better,and ham. they also had fried chicken,wild rice w mushrooms. They had clams with cheese which were very good.  They also have a small dessert station.  All in all it was worth the price we paid"}
{"text":"Great service from Norberto our server at lunch today. Dessert station has FROZEN VANILA CUSTARD !!!  My husband said the Kung Pow Chicken  and Sweet Sour Pork were very tasty. We play a little bit here in the casino and they send us free buffet tickets in the mail. We love the Steak House here too !"}
{"text":"Simple buffet but priced right.  The selection is limited but nothing was gross or nasty.   The place is aged but clean.  I would not call it a great buffet but what do you expect for 12 bucks??  If you are hungry and want decent food for a great price, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"I just went here after the remodel. Almost everything I had was pretty bad. Of the entire buffet the only things that were OK we the rotisserie chicken, and the pizza. Everything else was bleh at best. We went there fairly early and everything tasted as though it had been sitting. Even the things that were clearly fresh, tasted bland and unseasoned. The rotisserie chicken was okay, and the pizza was the equivalent of pizzahut. They do have a few make to order options, however non of them were very good.  These make your own options consisted of things like: burger and fries hot dog and fries quesadilla - i did have this, and it was extremely greasy on the outside. It was almost as if they buttered the tortilla? gross. asain stir-fry and pasta dishes  I won't be going back, and I'm glad that when I did go I had a comp. However, if I get anymore comps I won't even bother going over there to use them.  Also, the desert selection is now much smaller then it used to be (however same crappy quality)."}
{"text":"The French toast was cold, everything isn't within arms reach. Lots of breakfast items were tough and cold, over prep for the big crowd or what?"}
{"text":"Great place for people with no taste buds and no taste. :^)  Service is not welcoming, ordering drinks at the front is strange, and the most important feature of all - the food.  The selection is sad and the food is definitely not fresh. I think Costco's snack bar has a larger variety of food than this \"buffet\". I don't know about you, but room temperature or colder food that is typically hot and fresh doesn't sit right with me. On top of that, the food doesn't taste good to begin with.  It takes 20 minutes for one of the servers standing around the edges to notice you calling them for a refill. If you can't wait for your drink refill, just go to the soft-serve ice cream machine to get your liquids in; that ice cream ain't thick, anyway.  Don't even bother going to the desserts. Nothing sweet about them..."}
