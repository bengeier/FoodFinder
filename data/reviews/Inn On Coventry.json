{"text":"Luv the egg benedict here?The blue and chew pancake was also good. Free coffee served here"}
{"text":"Came for brunch Sunday and had eggs, sausage, toast, apple cinnamon pancakes, which was all delicious. The place was pretty packed & the Staff was nice to everyone. Would recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"What's there to say about the IOC, except that it's THE place for breakfast on Cleveland's East Side.  It's not fancy, but it's not dingy either.  The wait staff know what they're doing and the service is quick.  Portions and prices are good, and the food is consistent in it's goodness.

It's very crowded on weekends for brunch, but if you get there before 10 a.m., you can usually get a table right away.

I think they make a great short stack of buttermilk pancakes.  I also really like the lemon-ricotta pancake, but I have had a few occasions when that one has come out a little \"goopy\" in the middle; I'm not sure if it has something to do with the ricotta .  I also like their omlettes. 

My partner almost always gets the biscuits and gravy, and he says they are the best he has had in Cleveland so far; not excessively salty and the gravy isn't too thick.


You're not going to leave here having had the best meal of your life, but you're going to get a solidly good breakfast, and unless you eat a lot more than I do - and I can eat a lot  - you'll leave fully sated."}
{"text":"I just came in this establishment this morning. I wanted a omelet that wasn't on the menu. The waitress was so nice about it. I turn around to hear the cook ranting and raving. He doesn't want to cook it. A chicken, bacon, cheese omelet. Nothing hard. Im willing to pay whatever it costed. The cook turns to me and tells me that he has been a cook for 30 yrs and only had 2 requests. Now what in the hell does that got to do with what I want for breakfast? He was very unprofessional. Now I don't think I want to eat this resentful food."}
{"text":"I think an Ok rating is fair based on my experiences to date. I will say that I've not eaten breakfast here yet so maybe that's where I'm missing the great experience other people have raved about.  So far I've ordered lunch and have found it underwhelming.
A BLT I ordered had burnt toast & bacon (like black not just really crispy), and pita sandwich had old wilted lettuce... both served with regular chips, kind of like generic Lays. Although I live in the neighborhood, I mainly go here because, when visiting, a family member likes a particular breakfast. I can't remember the name, but an eggs concoction with chorizo.  He seems to enjoy it a lot.  
Customer service is ok and we've always been seated quickly.  I would be willing to go again to try their breakfast options."}
{"text":"Great prices, big portions...Huevos pan de mais delicious through and through with a spicy kick after every bite...biscuits and gravy were good but gravy seemed like it was mushroom based...wash it down with unlimited coffee and it's a great way to start the day"}
{"text":"One of he better and cheaper places in Cleveland to get brunch food. They have a pretty standard menu consisting of waffles, omlet, and breakfast burrito. Not the best brunch food you can find, take a look at fire in shaker square you if that is your goal, but is very good for the price."}
{"text":"Yum! This is one of my favorite places for breakfast or brunch. The food is great and the staff are as sweet as can be. I love the Coventry neighborhood, so that is an added plus. It's a rare thing when you can take small children to a restaurant and know that they will be greeted warmly and treated kindly by staff and customers alike. You can't beat the food and dining experience for the price. I love the Coventry toast (aka French toast) and the pancakes."}
{"text":"Fab. Always a quality meal with excellent service. The staff is like family. Its been \"our spot\" for four years.  Though some of the heartier dishes (i.e. sisterhood) are on the rich side, you can't beat the menu. Lemon ricotta pancakes are foolproof and delicious. Any egg dish is fantastic. They've mastered the art of potatoes. And coffee refills keep you going for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Though it can be quite a wait sometimes, food is worth it. I'd suggest coming early or lunch time for quickest seating. Can be cramped at times, but staff is very polite and courteous. I suggest eggs Benedict Mando with side of corned beef hash. Good coffee too. Easy 5 stars"}
{"text":"It's what you would expect from a typical diner.

The food and service are both good.

There is no wow factor or any unique dishes.

So if you want to play it safe for breakfast or brunch it is a good option."}
{"text":"Three words: Lemon ricotta pancakes
Wait was long but worth it. Service was quick and the food was yummy. Prices are also reasonable. I'll be back for those pancakes (seriously, no butter or syrup needed)!"}
{"text":"My experience was OK. The place is cute. I ordered for take out. I ordered the chorizo scramble and the lemon ricotta pancake. It was tasty, but I think it would have been better if I'd have stayed in, some foods lose their way on the road...Also I found a hair in my chorizo scramble, and for me there is no faster way to lose my appetite. All in all not bad. But get that cook a hair net!"}
{"text":"We love a good breakfast. The Inn on Coventry delivered in spades. What a fun place! This is hustle-bustle to the max. It's small and busy. Tables are close together. No reservations. You show up and wait your turn. But the wait is well worth it. Tables turn quickly so don't despair. One of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing. They make their own corned beef. Wonderful!  Top it off with a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Had a post Christmas breakfast with a dear friend today. It was the perfect place  to be on a snowy winter morning.
It's a little bit crowded which i didn't expect because it was a day after holiday. We were seated as soon as we got there, hot coffee in our cups and menu on the table.:) our server was very attentive and nice. She's on top of everything specially making sure that we don't run out of freshly brewed coffee. 
I had the Eggs Benedict with avocado slices and a side of grits. I dont know why, but their eggs are delicious!! that eggs benedict was the bomb that i finished eating before my friend does AND that seldom happens.:) 
This added up to one of my reasons why I'm having a hard time leaving Cle..:)
I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"No Carb Bennie and Wholewheat Orange pancake...Enough said! YUM! Such a lovely place to have breakfast"}
{"text":"By far the worst experience so far in 2014. Restaurant was nearly empty but yet took several minutes to be seated. I was greeted with the \"ohh...sorry we didn't see you\" line. My omelet had eggshells in it and my lemon ricotta pancakes was under cooked. Waitress was not attentive to the point I had to have someone get her for me.  Maybe this was a fluke but I will never return."}
{"text":"I'm going to sum this little restaurant up in one word: AWESOME!  My first Inn experience was a year ago and I must say I judged the place a little bit when we walked in (small, old decor) and I have been smacking myself ever since for thinking that - this place couldn't be any further from my initial judgement.  The vibe is cozy and the food always tastes like your grandma just whipped it up for you in her kitchen.  One of my favorites is the veggie mando - basically an eggs benedict minus the meat but with avocado on top (I'm getting hungry just thinking about it - good thing it's time for lunch!)

Once you eat here, I'm pretty sure this place will be on the top of your list for breakfast joints - it certainly is on mine!  Just beware that weekends can get pretty packed, especially when Case and JCU students are back - it's definitely a favorite spot to cure that morning hangover so try and get there early."}
{"text":"The Inn on Coventry is one of my favorite places in Cleveland Heights and I have a lot of feelings about their lemon ricotta pancakes.
I love them. I think you are better off getting one large pancake than a short stack, unless you really want a lot of pancakes, in which case go with the \"super stack.\" Sometimes I do put syrup on them (I have a serious sweet tooth) but they definitely do not need anything on them as they are perfect on their own. They are almost creamy. It's one of those dishes where I look down at my plate and I start to feel sad once I've eaten half because I know it will be gone sooner rather than later. The lemon ricotta pancake was my \"last meal\" before boarding an international flight a few months ago. This morning I grudgingly shared a bite of my pancake with my roommate and she told me it was \"gross,\" so I guess they're not for everyone. I will admit that sometimes there will be a bite or two that will feature a large-ish, chewy piece of lemon rind. It doesn't bother me when the overall experience is so great.
The hash browns are very tasty. I've also tried the sour cream mango pancake and it was good but if you're going for pancakes, lemon ricotta is the way to go. 
Very reasonably priced and a pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for awhile so I finally made it and it was worth the run out here.
The selection is great.
Lot of thought was put into the menu with plenty of choices.
They can work with any kind of dietary needs with no complaints.
The staff is very knowledgeable of the menu and the environment is easy on the eyes.
I love poached eggs done correctly and this is the right place for your fulfillment.
I got the English muffin topped with bacon,avocado, Benedict and grits with butter on the side.
My friend opted for the homemade corned beef hash browns.
Both dishes were very good,warm from the kitchen and very timely.
Take my word for it and go.
 Bon appettit!"}
{"text":"I used to live Inn at Coventry and as a college student could over look the tight quarters and less than stellar service because the food was good. Recently they have started ridiculous rules of when they will take pick up orders and the person answering the phone is a complete ass. The one time we were actually able to get food the only thing edible was the pancake. The potatoes smelled rotten and the palettes were runny. Will be finding a new place for breakfast were the workers are interested in treating people like people."}
{"text":"One of my favs in Cleveland for breakfast reminds me of a true diner. 
 Good food.Grease.Good service.Close tables. 
My favs are the grits and potatoes
..redskins..yummy.

{"text":"OK, so it could very well be that I'm craving the Inn on Coventry's veggie mando at this very moment but I LOVE the food there. The only reason I didn't give it all the stars was because occasionally you'll get a crabby waitress. Other than that, it's always packed with peeps ready to eat some great food. Service is pretty fast and I'm a member of the clean plate club every time I dine there."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and reasonable prices. Small room but good ambience. Great neighborhood"}
{"text":"They need to do much better with customer service..I was a party of one and was seated..5min later a couple sat down next to me...then the waitress came over and began taking THEIR drink order...what am I invisible..how rude...I wont be back...its the little things that matter...i should have just left...smh!"}
{"text":"The wait is often long, but it's definitely worth the wait. The IOC specials are always the way to go. Pair a special with a single order lemon ricotta pancake and you will be a happy camper. I've been to Inn On Coventry a dozen or so times and I've never been unhappy. What's more? Full bar 7 days a week for breakfast. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A true slice of Cleveland from the friendly staff right down to the brown glazed coffee mugs.

On cold and windy days such as the one my friend and I chose to visit Inn On Coventry, the chorizo scramble with its sides of hash and liberally buttered toast is a fine choice to warm my belly.

Come here early because the crowds start lining up. We were lucky to get seated in 15 minutes even though we were told that the wait time was 45 minutes."}
{"text":"A delicious diner experience! They provide the old stand-bys, but also offer their own creative specials. The staff is friendly and efficient. Their lemon ricotta pancakes are a must-try! I ordered the Irish Benedict, which was hearty and lived up to its description. It might not be the healthiest restaurant, but the food sure is tasty!"}
{"text":"I've probably been to the Inn on Coventry around 5 or 6 times, and I've found the food to be consistently yummy, the ambiance to be sufficiently homey, and the waitstaff to be pretty \"Flo-ey\". It's just good home cookin' - consistent and very cheap! I usually get one chocolate chip pancake and a side of an egg with coffee and come out spending around 3 or 4 bucks. Same price as Dunkin Donuts, but with a more \"out on the town\" feel. Not that I don't totally love Dunkies :)"}
{"text":"Affordable, yummy, and huge! 
The only downside is the long wait time. 

But if you're craving pancakes or some brunch food, this place is perfect~"}
{"text":"This place is always voted best brunch in Cleveland but that is because there is no other places to get brunch.  I have been a couple of times but every time something is so disappointing.  One time I went with a group of 6 and they split us up into 2 tables 3 each.  Last time we went there was a wait so we went outside to wait.  The women came out to call us and we said here we come, she did not hear us so I had to run up to her.  We then walked to the trash can to throw away our coffee and walked inside when I got inside I heard here talking to the other owner and she was saying that she called for us but did not know where we were.  I then said that we were the party of two that she just called and she pointed to a table and told us to sit there.  I could go on but I will not.  I overheard one women complain and after she left everyone stood at the register and talked about her.  
I love brunch but this place sucks!!! If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"Going to brunch on a Sunday here, you know you're in for a wait, both for a table and for food. It's worth it. The coffee is good, the food is good, and it feels like the kind of place you see on a TV show about old guys reading newspapers in the best way possible. I had cinnamon toast, which I expected to be toasted cinnamon bread. It was actually toast with cinnamon sugar and it was amazing. I also had Eggs Mando, which satisfied the egg/avocado combo I'd been craving all week. Definitely a happy camper."}
{"text":"Classic American breakfast or spicy Mexican awesomeness?  Why choose just one? This place rules. I've had the regular ol' eggs/toast/bacon breakfast, which was done well. The juevos with chipotle sauce over cornbread though... punch-yourself-in-the-face good."}
{"text":"sure, i've babbled about their gigantimundo pancakes before. but that was before i stopped in on the morning of my birthday for a early morning meal with my best friend.

Reese.cup.pancakes.

I.love.you, reese."}
{"text":"No Carb Bennie with portobello mushrooms instead of english muffin is soooo good."}
{"text":"Few know, but the early 90s movie \"Glengary Glen Ross\" was originally about the lemon ricotta pancakes at the Inn on Coventry. Crazy, right? Anyway, my Hollywood source (full disclosure: it's Carrot Top) gave me the initial copy of Alec Baldwin's famous monologue where he tears into the employees for being awful salesmen. In the original pancake version, he's screaming at them for trying to drown out Coventry's fine balance between lemon and ricotta with a heavy, sticky syrup:


\"Put. That. Syrup. Down. Syrup's for posers only. Do you think I'm f---ing with you? I am not f---ing with you. I'm here from Bon Appetit magazine  and I'm here on a mission of mercy. Your name's Levene? ... You call yourself a pancake eater, you son of a bitch?

You taste this lemon? You taste this ricotta? ... That pancake has more intricate engineering than your car. I had 970 'Useful, Funny, Cools' on Yelp last year. How many you have? You see, pal, that's who I am. And you're nothing. Nice guy? I don't give a shit. Good home cook? F--- you, go semi-home make some Eggos with syrup!

You can't taste the delicate brush strokes of lemon on the ricotta canvas, you can't taste shit! You are shit! Hit the bricks pal and beat it 'cause your palate will not appreciate that this pancake is derived from a cheese batter and yet isn't too heavy and doesn't stray too far away from the consistency of a pancake!

You think this is abuse?! You think this is abuse, you c---sucker? You can't take this, how can you take the abuse you're going to get on Chowhound when they find out you perverted one of Cleveland's best pancakes? You don't like it, leave. Coventry Inn can go out there tonight with the materials you got and make 15 foodies wet their skinny jeans.\"

The film was later reworked as a sales movies when test groups didn't find Kevin Spacey's character believable as one of the sweet old waitresses Coventry has in surplus."}
{"text":"Cute old \"mom and pop\" joint. Good breakfast and helpful locals to point you in the right direction."}
{"text":"closed earlier than stated time and rather than nicely explaining an employee locked the door and rudely yelled out \"were closed\". Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food is pretty typical standard-diner fare.  They have a decent selection of specialty pancakes.  The service was good.  I especially appreciated that they did not seem put-out about our group waiting outside instead of in the small foyer area.  

A couple people in our group were running late, so in an attempt to speed up the process we ordered their food for them so it would be ready when they arrived.  They still had not arrived by the time the rest of us had finished eating, and the staff were frequently checking back with us (subtly or not-so-subtly hinting that they would like to use the tables to seat another group).  They earned a 4th star on this review by actually offering to comp those two meals that we ended up boxing (we refused).  Our group was definitely at fault for the complication, and that was an overly generous offer on their part."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, everyone is so sweet and friendly. I had the 2 eggs special and they were cooked perfectly. Our waitress suggested a lemon ricotta pancake and that was the icing on the cake for me. Everything was delicious, my wife had the Eggs Benedict and she swore they were one of the best she's ever had."}
{"text":"I really would give this place more of a 1.5 star review. This place was a major disappointment, especially considering all of the good reviews on yelp.

Inn of Coventry has a nice feel to it. When you walk in, you feel like you're in a close knit, mom and pop, type place. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for us. My husband and I were seated very quickly and the waitress came up and filled my cup with coffee and gave us waters. Little did we know, that would be the first of only two times we saw her. She came back again to take our order, but that's the last we spoke to her. We saw her walking around, but not once did she come over and fill up the water glasses or top off my coffee or ask how our food was. The latter was something I really wish she would have done because my food had some major issues. I ordered the eggs benedict with corned beef hash, but the corned beef had been burned somehow which rendered my whole main dish practically uneatable. Like I said, our waitress never came back and asked how it was, the checkout lady never asked how it was, and when we finally told the lady cleaning off the table next to us, she respond with a short \"Oh, okay.\" Not impressive. My husband ordered the classic eggs benedict and it was okay. The home fries were also marginal.

Overall, it was not an enjoyable venture and was a big letdown. It looks like Inn at Coventry is a better restaurant than we experienced, but we will not be back. Here's hoping you have better luck if you go there."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad about The Inn. Ultimate greasy spoon and like I said previously, cheap hangover food. But it's also delicious! The eggs benedict and grits are my personal favorite. It really doesn't get any better. My favorite grits by far. I also discovered the wonder of the lemon ricotta pancakes last summer when I got my wisdom teeth out. I mashed some of those pancakes in my immobile swollen mouth and almost cried. First solid food in a week and it was pure bliss! 

Beware the wait on weekends. (Remember: hangover food. All Case students come here for hangover cures if they can make it.) The dining area is small, so you might be waiting on top of someone either waiting or already eating their breakfast, but it's so worth it. It all makes the experience, which is ALMOST as great as feasting on the food. The servers have been here forever and seem a little frazzled and jaded, but they get the job done. 

I also tried lunch here once and it was pretty good too. I had some sort of sandwich with avocado, which was a disappointment. The avocado was overripe and there was only a tiny slice on it, but I really didn't expect much more. Breakfast more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Went there once for breakfast, wasn't too impressed with the food or the cramped atmosphere, and found a nice \"surprise\" in my pancakes in the form of a long hair."}
{"text":"The place was crowded on a Sunday morning, but the wait wasn't unreasonable - only 40 minutes. Wouldn't recommend for large groups since it's such a cozy place, but I enjoyed the Maryland crab cake benedict. The crab cakes were tasty, even if they weren't the fluffy type of crab cake. The hollandaise didn't have much taste to it though, which is the only downside. I'm usually indifferent to potatoes, but the side of hash browns was also delicious."}
{"text":"Great little Mom and Pop diner and a #CLE Heights institution right next to the Grog Shop.  The prices and serving sizes are just right,  the wait staff is on the ball and I strongly recommend the Irish Benedict (corn beef hash replaces the ham)."}
{"text":"NOT TODDLER FRIENDLY

I have visited this establishment many times over lunch during the work week. I was excited to bring my family and spoke highly of the place prior to this last experience. 

WORST FAMILY EXPERIENCE EVER... We paid and walked out I was so frustrated."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast!  I came here with my boyfriend on a busy Sunday mid-morning.  Most reviewers comment on how long it takes to get a table, but we thought this place runs smoothly- we waited 5 or 10 minutes at most.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive to our table, refilling waters and coffees as needed.

I ordered an 8-inch buttermilk pancake and a spinach feta omelete, a special for that day.  The omelete was great because I could tell they used fresh not frozen spinach.  The omelete also had black olives- I wish it were Kalamata because that could really step up the dish as a whole.  The homefries and pancake were great as expected.

The price was not bad for all the food we were served.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Delightfully surprisingly delicious  We were sat immediately. I got the chicken philly and the lemon ricotta pancake. The food came quickly and it was all delicious"}
{"text":"I picked up a friend at the Clinic for a much needed reprieve from the stress of waiting for news about an ill loved one. He hadn't been to Coventry for a while so we headed east on Euclid and up Mayfield hill. My friend is a meat and potatoes type of person, so my mind went to the Inn immediately. On a street known for young people, ethnic eats and boutiques, the Inn stands out for its mature clientele and ordinariness. For someone like my friend, I knew the menu would be approachable. 

Indeed, he found plenty of sandwich options to satisfy him. It's the sort of place that serves breakfast all day and keeps the coffee cups out at every seat. The atmosphere is typical family restaurant flair, something that always reminds me of the living room from That '70s Show. Service was speedy and we both liked our meals. The noise levels were moderate and I felt a bit like others could probably hear what I was saying, so it might not be the best place to go if you have a private legal matter to discuss."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot, fantastic service and just what my Sunday morning needed! I had an awesome breakfast and who couldn't love a peanut butter pancake????"}
{"text":"Lemon. Ricotta. Pancakes. Do I even need to say more?
Whenever I go here, there is always a wait, but it's never longer and it's worth it. I've gone here a few times and tried a few of their breakfast options and I've never been disappointed. The portion sizes are large and the prices are amazing. Plus they have booze."}
{"text":"Server was nice, and food was pretty good! I do wish I had ordered some pancakes since that's all that everyone raved about on Yelp, but I was feeling something a little lighter and healthier, and decided on an omelette with avocado. 

I did feel like we were a little rushed since they said they were closing towards the end of our meal and our server told us they could take our payment from us several times, but I insisted I'd just pay the register. Not a big a deal, but that's why I took a star off. 

Other than that, cool little oldish place. Sitting by the window was nice!"}
{"text":"Kinda old school, kinda 70s.  Watch your head if you sit at the table near the window--the blinds are so low they WILL conk you in the head!  Love the brown - colored mugs that remind you of drinking coffee at Perkins with your grandparents.  Loved the muffled sound of the Doobie Brothers playing over the speakers.  Went with the bacon, cheese, onion and green pepper omelette.  Very good.  Breakfast potatoes are great.  My man liked his apple cinnamon pancakes very much (and of course I had to taste them to make sure they were fresh...)  Service was friendly and fast.  The table behind us raved about their lemon ricotta pancakes.  Parking is a pain.  Pick a meter and feed it with quarters."}
{"text":"I am giving it 4 stars for now, because I try not to doll out the 5's too much.  But if the second time round is as good as the first, it will get 5.

The Corned Beef Hash is worth the trip.  It is the best I have ever had; and I have had a lot all over this country, especially in NE.  At first I was a little disappointed because the portion was a little small and they only served it with one egg.  At the end of the day, it was the right amount (but 2 eggs would be better).  The potatoes are fantastic as well.  We also had some pancakes at the table which reminded me of homemade buttermilk pancakes.  Should I say, they were as good as if not better.

French toast I was told was amazing.

So, aside from the sucky parking, this is a go to place."}
{"text":"Good (but not great) breakfast.  Service from waitress was adequate but felt impersonal/kinda phoned in (maybe cause I'm not a regular).  During my visit, ceiling fans made the area I was seated at pretty chilly.  Coffee was what you'd probably expect to have in a diner, could be improved.  (hint - Phoenix Coffee). Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This appears to be a local breakfast spot. It was busy but the wait was reasonable.  The restaurant is small and cozy.
The food was well prepared and awesome.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were unbelievable as were the eggs benedict.  No complaints at all with the food.
The service was really poor.  We had ordered something with our meal and had to wait to get it.  Our server never returned to our table until she delivered the check.  The hostess noticed that we were waiting for something and took care of us.   Coffee cups remained empty for most of the meal.
We would return to have breakfast again and just lower our expectations regarding the service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a brunch restaurant with quick service, an affordable price, and a menu selection where you just can't go wrong, then this is the place you need to try out. It's a crowded and bustling restaurant especially on Sunday mornings, and the tables are very close together, so you may wind up with some new friends after the meal, which makes for a pretty neat \"community-like\" brunch experience! If you go early, around 9:30am, you may be able to avoid the wait.

Once seated, there's very little waiting time from there on out. Service is excellent. They are speedy and efficient with getting the orders and also very attentive with filling up mugs at all the tables with delicious hot coffee - in fact I don't think my mug was ever empty for the entire time I was there. In terms of food, I highly recommend any one of the Eggs Benedict selections on the menu, especially if you are looking for something savory and filling. There's many other options to choose from besides Eggs Benedict (like pancakes, omelettes, etc.), so there's something for everyone. Overall, this is the perfect brunch place in the Cleveland Heights area if you want the the taste of a home-cooked meal in a vibrant and casual atmosphere at a great price."}
{"text":"Solid old-fashioned American breakfast joint. Everything is done well here. Bf loves the corned beef hash, and I've ordered the croissant sisterhood, eggs mando, and huevos rancheros in the past. I've never been disappointed. Pro tip- definitely order a lemon ricotta pancake on the side! Delicious and unique."}
{"text":"The wait here can be long if you come around the busiest times on the weekend (11 am). Come earlier or later and there is no to minimal wait, but it's always busy. The service has improved some over the years but most of the wait staff have worked here for years, are constantly busy and don't like answering questions or making substitutions. The lemon ricotta pancakes are fabulous, and are the biggest factor in this review. One is plenty - they give you a bigger pancake if you order 1 vs the short stack (I've ordered this consistently for 6 years). The biscuits and gravy are usually really great, but today they were lacking in flavor and weren't warm enough. Overall there are several staple options here. The price can't be beat."}
{"text":"always delicious. I got the corn beef hash with over easy eggs and it was so comforting to eat, and it was made right. come early for specials because they run out fast."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast! I usually get the Irish Benedict which is an eggs benedict with corn beef hash under the egg. It comes with a huge side of potatoes. It's a LOT of food, so for the price of ~$9 you get your money's worth. I get cravings for this dish all the time... it's that good. Service is okay, and this place is usually crowded on weekend mornings so you may feel rushed if you're eating at that time. Otherwise, perfect!"}
{"text":"Crazy Delicious food. The lemon ricotta pancakes are out of this world. It's a small restaurant that feels like a small town diner. Friendly staff and very reasonable prices. You might have to wait another on the weekends but that is because everyone is in love with this gem!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were good, and the food was served fast and hot. Would definitely recommend to others. My husband had the omelet and I had the special of the day crepes.  My daughters had the pancakes."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in Cleveland! We saw the reviews on yelp and knew we had to try the lemon ricotta pancakes.  They're just as amazing as everyone says they are!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 11:00 AM and ended up waiting 90 minutes when they told us our wait time was 45 minutes. Once seated, we waited another 45 minutes for our food to come out. 

I ordered an Irish Benedict which was corned beef hash eggs benedict served with potatoes. Food was pretty decent, but the speed of the service was not worth it. I would give it a 3.5/10. 

If you go early enough when there's no wait, I would recommend eating here! If there are a lot of people waiting outside, come back another day."}
{"text":"I really like breakfast/brunch food. The service was great and even though it was crowded when my friends and I went on a Saturday morning, we only only waited for 5-10 minutes. I had an eggs benedict with avocado. The benedict was really good, the potatos were ok, and it came out quickly. The portions are good as well. I tried my friend's  omelette and it was ok but I would definitely order an eggs benedict again."}
{"text":"First time last week. Fantastic food n a great, price and plenty of it. I'd recommend the tall stack pancakes and the eggs any way you like."}
{"text":"My first brunch experience in Cleveland. I consider brunch typically between, you know, breakfast and lunch, but for a breakfast connoisseur like myself, I can eat it at any hour of the day. It can get pretty packed as people are flowing in from church or waking up from the chaos the night before. I'm usually with just a +1, so the wait isn't too bad, but anything more than 3, you'll usually have to wait for a table.

The two times I been to Inn On Coventry, I ordered the classic two eggs breakfast with all the fixings (toast, potatoes, choice of meat) and the usual favorite corn beef hash. Both very good and perfect for fuzzy Sunday mornings. I also love how the nice ladies always seem to know when my coffee cup is empty. 

If I'm contemplating what to eat on the weekend, Inn On Coventry is definitely my first choice."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience EVER at this place I swear I thought we were going to love it. (Not the case) Fist, a lot of the server's/staff talk to the guests in a very demeaning way. This place was filled with angry employees who have probably been in the industry way to long.  When I first came in the man was upset that I was there it was as though seating us was a terrible inconvenience I asked my server to split the check a certain way and she said \"are you kidding me \" I also heard another server calling the woman at her table a skanky b****. I heard one server say she wasn't going to take the table because she knew they weren't going to tip. (I think you know what im getting at here) The bacon tastes as though it was microwaved and the sausage I think was spoiled.  I called after my experience to let the manager know.  When I called and the manager came on the phone I said I apologize I know your probably very busy... and she cut me off and said \"yeah, duh, it's a Saturday morning \" most of the staff but not all seem angry, hostile,  and very confrontational I've never seen anything like that!! Don't go here they're angry"}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here.  The Inn is a Cleveland Heights institution, like Lucky's Café in Tremont. It's a non-pretentious breakfast and lunch place. Usually open 7am to 2 pm.  The tables and chairs are a little worn and the decor is dated but it's very homey.  All the people that work there are extremely friendly.  The food is outstanding, fresh and very affordable.  It does get really busy on Saturdays and Sunday mornings but the service is relatively quick.  If you've never been, I recommend  any of their pancakes,  the eggs Benedict, or my favorite huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! The Eggs Benedict is on point. If I ever manage to wake up at a reasonable hour on a weekend, I think about how lovely it would be to walk down to Inn on Coventry and have a freshly brewed endlessly refilled cup of coffee and some more of that tasty Eggs Benedict. It's a small restaurant, so the wait can be long. Go early!"}
{"text":"Still a fan of this place after so many years.  Feels like the friendly neighborhood dive that it is.  Great fried eggs and hash browns.  Coffee is what you would expect at a neighborhood dive- generous and mediocre.  Prices are very reasonable for what you get.  I appreciate being able to sit at the window and watch Coventry life pass by."}
{"text":"Was thoroughly impressed by this place, I've only just moved here to Cleveland recently and I've already been here a couple times! The service is great, food is prompt and staff are efficient. Despite Inn on Coventry being busy all the times, the wait to get a table passes by fairly quick. My friend and I just walked around the street to pass time.

As for food I've gotten Lemon Ricotta pancakes, Reese Cup (chocolate & peanut butter) pancakes, Huevos Pan de Maiz, and Chorizo Scramble. I would like to highlight how delicious and savory the Chorizo Scramble was, and how the Lemon Ricotta pancakes are like dessert for breakfast. A+ for service and quality."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Inn On Coventry for a long time, knowing it was a Cleveland Heights institution with a reputation for good homestyle cooking and friendly service. We went on the 4th of July for brunch, and the place was packed, but we were seated pretty quickly by a lovely old lady. Being a warm summer's day, it was a little stuffy in the dining room with so many patrons -- I can imagine it would be a cozy place to be in the winter. Our waitress was efficient and friendly although it took a while for our order to come out. We had an omelette with olives, spinach and feta, the lemon ricotta pancakes, and a side of corn beef hash. The omelette was good, but the pancakes were a bit soggy and too sweet, and the corn beef hash was more glistening fat than actual pieces of meat, and I began to feel sick towards the end of the meal. I've only myself to blame, of course, for my ordering choices. Though I probably won't be back to Inn On Coventry for a while, I'd recommend this place to anyone (with a stronger stomach than mine) who wants a down-to-earth dining experience and some pretty tasty food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"townie\" spots. Breakfast is superb. Staff moves quickly, and the hustle and bustle is palpable.  Not for hermits lol. I'm a fan of their lemon ricotta crepes. Always brewing fresh coffee. Build your own scramble.  I could go on. I've been going there since the 80s. Of course they haven't changed the decor since then, but that's okay. One up from a diner. Check them out."}
{"text":"We love using the Yelp App to find hidden gems like this (though it was so busy I don't think this one is hidden). We put an hour on the mete (maximum allowed) and decided to take our chances.  We were met at the door, sat and coffee poured lickity split!  Within 5 minutes order taken and 18 minutes total food was served.  Service was perfect and so friendly.  Food was outstanding I think I could bathe in those lemon ricotta pancakes.  Back at the car after a wonderfully tasty breakfast with 11 minutes to spare!  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not my favorite meal to eat out because eggs, toast, bacon, home fries and pancakes don't get me excited about eating. I had the Irish Benedict and corned need hash. I thought it was very good. Coffee was yucky. Overall, good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Was seated quickly, maybe 10 people in the whole place. Sat waiting for a server for 15 minutes. Not one server approached us. Got up and left. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This place kinda rocks the universe. We're not from Cleveland, but ate here because our hotel was nearby, and the Yelpsters told us to! What a kick ass diner! One of the best Eggs Benny's we've ever had! PERFECTLY cooked eggs! Amazing hollandaise! Perfectly crispy English muffin! I got the Crossiant Sisterhood and it was awesome too. Both things had their hollandaise, which was amazing. Sweet, little ladies serving you.....all in all, was awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here on the weekend of my birthday trip to explore Cleveland. I should have gone with my first mind and gotten the breakfast sandwich with the salmon but I choose one of the pancakes instead...it wasn't good. It had a mushy, undercooked texture. Everyone else's food at my table was great though. I should have chosen something else."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. One of my favorite brunch spots in the city. It has that quaint, antique feel towards it. Most of the waitresses are elderly ladies who are oh so adorable. 

The restaurant itself is a little bit tight squeezed with small tables. It's worth it for the food though. Just get there early for brunch, as the wait can get a little bit long. It isn't really good for groups either due to the size. If you have more than 4-5 people with you, I would say pick a different place.

I've had a couple things on the menu, including the lemon ricotta pancakes (delicious), the veggie omelet, and the veggie mando (vegetarian version of eggs benedict). The veggie mando is my absolute fave, especially since they sub out the meat for avocado. I won't ever order the veggie omelet again, as the last time I had it, I bit into a huge dirt clod which was mistaken for a mushroom. That wasn't appetizing at all. In fact, it was probably the most disgusting thing that has ever happened to me in a restaurant. However, I love the place and the people so much that I didn't complain, and just went to rinse out my mouth.

The home fries are good, and the dishes usually come with toast. I love the creative spin on breakfast they have, especially their crunchberry pancakes! Haven't tried those yet, but need to soon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Its run by the same old ladies who have been there for a pretty long time.  They have a huge menu and everything I've ever tried was nothing short of excellent.  My favorite is the biscuits with sausage gravy.  Its a great place to come to on a weekend morning with a small group of friends.  Space is limited though and it can get very crowded at times.  But to everyone who goes there, its well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Inn for many a year now, and my reasons are simple; good food and nice people. The Inn is located at the top of the hill in Coventry, Cleveland Height's version of \"little Haight-Ashbury\". 

The fare is simple, tasty, and not too pricey and the folks up there are very good to their customers. In addition, if you're looking for an intimate little nook to take someone for breakfast or brunch, this place is great. Admittedly, it can get a tad close in the confines of this place, and you might wait a bit for a table at peak times, but any place this good is worth it.

There may not always be room at the Inn, but when there is, you'll enjoy it:)"}
{"text":"Brunch is fantastic! Staff, so friendly and the best eggs benedict in town. We have our dishes really fast and still perfectly cooked. I've been to a lot of places in Cleveland but this place is so far the best breakfast I've had. Yummmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service was really good too! Nice casual environment. It got a little loud but overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. My family (with two smaller children) walked in and waited at the hostess stand 30 min prior to the posted closing. A woman at the desk didn't even look up at us but instead \"we are closed\". We stood in shock by the incredibly rude tone she used and she again yelled \"we are closed\". Frankly I am embarrassed for the Inn On Coventry. I can only hope this woman was having a bad day and this isn't their normal level of customer service."}
{"text":"Though the service isn't always the greatest, the food is well worth it. In my opinion the pancakes are the best deal and you really can't go wrong with any of them. I personally love the pumpkin and the chocolate chip. Recently though my go to has been the eggs mondo, which is eggs Benedict with a generous portion of avocado. The coffee is also very good! It's a cute spot to have brunch but on the weekends the wait can get pretty long."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland institution.  There are numerous available flavors for pancakes, which are huge.  I especially like the lemon ricotta. It's an unusual flavor, but they do it so well. 

They also have great specials and tasty omelets. I love a good biscuit and gravy combo and this place just does it so well! Their biscuits are flaky and buttery. The gravy is not at all skimping on the sausage. You can definitely taste the quality in every bite. 

On weekends, it's definitely crowded, but the staff always tries to get everyone seated quickly. You usually don't have to wait too long to get a seat. The staff is also great at keeping your coffee cup well supplied. They truly mean a bottomless mug."}
{"text":"I went in for brunch alone (no loser feelings there!) while my boyfriend was in class. I had the benedict and a coffee. The benedict is amazing; I'm quite picky about the way my eggs are cooked, but I was definitely satisfied. There's also so much food! 

Service was 50/50 for me. I got kind of irritated because it didn't seem to be that busy. There were a lot of empty tables, but somehow, I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come to me to take my coffee order, and then I had to wait like another 10 minutes to even receive my coffee. The ladies were nice, but the one serving me even admitted to forgetting about me. That would've been rude, if not for her attentive service from that point on. 

If i'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely return! Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!"}
{"text":"The 8\" blueberry & walnut pancake ($3.49) was a very delicious sweet, salty & savory breakfast! And, it was HUGE!"}
{"text":"This place was not bad but nothing good either. They were doing a huge brunch business on Sunday when I went. The inside is very basic, very diner like. just seats and chairs crammed into the space. Waitress brought coffee over immediately. Then asked us what we wanted. I hadn't even had a chance to look at the whole menu yet. I got the Irish Eggs Benedict, its a normal eggs benedict with corn beef has instead of ham. I liked this twist on the normal. It came with food service potatoes. They lacked any good seasoning. Felt like they were just poured out of bad and thrown on grill to heat for a few minutes. Hollandaise sauce was fine but again was definitely not made fresh or on site, food service again I expect.The place was not bad but its was just very basic food service style food. With so many great brunch options in Cleveland this would not be my choice to go back to."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because that's somewhere between the Breakfast (4.5 stars) and dinner (2.5 stars).
All the medium-strength coffee you can drink, and try the crunchberry pancakes (granola and blueberry) they're fantastic.
You have to really like biscuits and sausage gravy to finish an order of it, though.  It's huge and rich and not terribly interesting.  But it will fill you up, cure a hangover, and likely clog your arteries

What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for brunch in Cleveland Heights! You can not go wrong with anything on the menu. 

My favorite item has got to be the Irish Benedict. It has corned beef and just makes the traditional Eggs Benedict 100 times more delicious :) They also have some amazing pancakes! I love the cinnamon and blue berry pancakes! 

The service here is absolutely wonderful as well. They're very, very attentive. 

If you're in the area and looking for somewhere cheap and delicious, try this out!"}
{"text":"Inn on Coventry is the perfect place to meet someone for a cheap but extremely GREAT breakfast! I absolutely love their banana but french toast, the bananas are always fresh and the french toast is made to perfection, just like you'd make it at home and not like other restaurants when it doesn't quite taste \"homemade\". the staff is nice and it's in a nice area for you to take a walk after you stuff yourself crazy! only thing i don't like is the parking but that doesn't really have anything to do with the business itself."}
{"text":"Great local spot for breakfast/brunch with just good and reasonably priced comfort food.  Their eggs mando was awesome, perfectly poached eggs and a tasty hollandaise sauce.  The only thing I would've wanted is the home fries to be just a little bit more crispy.  
Big plus - they have a full bar!  Definitely going to have to go back and try their dinner."}
{"text":"It can get quite crowded here so you might have to wait a bit, and it doesn't help that service here does seem a little slow. But hey, its brunch, so who doesn't expect to wait a bit?

As many others have said, get the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes! Funny story, the first time I got these here, I thought they served me the wrong pancakes because I didn't see any lemon ricotta on top. But nope, these pancakes are infused with the lemon ricotta, and somehow taste so much better. Be warned, it does give the pancakes an almost mushy texture, but the taste is really great. Seriously, this place has changed the meaning of lemon ricotta for me. 

Overall, Inn On Coventry is a great option for a no-frills kind of brunch (what can I say, I usually like a bougie brunch!). They serve delicious food at a reasonable price, and sometimes that is all you need."}
{"text":"I feel bad about this. My goal is to inform people more like me. I feel that everyone should try new things and come to their own conclusion. I would like to add data to the current reviews so that a proper decision can be made for those interested in making informed decisions. 

I found the food to be bland. Maybe I have a high bar for grits, being from GA, but the grits here should not be on the menu. They aren't worth the calories or money, or if you're a tree hugger, the trash space they take up by not being eaten. 

If you judge a place on the quality of the restrooms, the ladies room was poorly attended. 

The worst part for me was how uncomfortable I was. It was too busy, in my opinion, on the border of a fire code violation. The servers were in a frenzy and constantly bumped my chair. I felt spastic with the nervous energy and could not properly pretend to enjoy my bland food. 

If I ever come back, I would request a window table and not order eggs. The pancakes seem to be a better choice."}
{"text":"This is a definite brunch must! Come early. It's a small place that fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on my visit to Cleveland for the weekend and I had some really high hopes for this place. I went with a group of 4 and waited about an hour for a table. I did not mind the wait because I figured it would be well worth it. I am not sure if I am just spoiled by the good diners in NY but this place was not even mediocre. I ordered a Bloody Mary to drink and as soon as I took a sip I was disgusted by the taste. What did they put in there Barton's? It was not good at all. Then, we were suggested to order the lemon ricotta pancake. Thankfully we only got 1 because it was partially raw inside and it was gross! I ordered the crepe after reading the description of chicken,asparagus, peppers, Monterey Jack. Thinking it would be a crepe filled with just those ingredients. Well let me tell you I was in for a HUGe surprise. The crepe I ordered was filled with what seemed to me was soup. There was no trace of chicken or peppers. It was basically a cream soup with some little pieces of asparagus you had to look for in the soup like crepe filling. I normally don't complain but this was completely in edible. Even after I drowned it with hot sauce it was not good. The waitress was nice but too scary to even approach, I knew she was upset I didn't like my meal but honestly the description did not match what I received, they should probably change that. Everything else we ordered was just ok. The eggs, French toast.. Nothing special. I am sharing all of this so that another tourist doesn't go in and come out disappointed. Go somewhere else! If you are used to delicious breakfast joints with big fluffy pancakes this is not it."}
{"text":"The kings of the Eggs Benedict! 
I absolutely LOVE coming for breakfast at the Inn on Coventry. My personal favorite dish is the Crab Benedict but I've honestly never been disappointed with anything else I've tried! My boyfriend always gets some sort of hash every time we go and it always looks fantastic and he is always pleased with the quality :) We brought my grandma (a true pancake authority) recently and she enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes. The Inn can get quite crowded on Saturday and Sunday mornings but as long as you know that going into things, I don't find the wait to be a nuisance. We usually put our name on the list, walk down the street to Phoenix to get a cup of coffee, and then by the time we make it back it is almost our turn to be seated!"}
{"text":"Nutshell:  quaint mom and pop spot, simple yet tasty food, great service.  Definitely recommend a stop in.

Me and the folks came in town for my sister's graduation and she recommended a stop in here before we left.  One of the best breakfasts I've had!  The place is busy, like crazy popular with the locals.  They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is there, so keep that in mind.  We rolled in around 8am and were able to get seated right away.  I decided to take advantage of the early morning special.  I love food and deals. Man, what a deal!  For less than $5, you get eggs your way, homefries, bacon, and toast.  The bacon was cooked perfectly crispy and everything else was perfectly delicious.  I upgraded to raisin toast...good life choice.  The server was super friendly and helpful even though they got slammed with customers.  They also got us in and out in record time.  It's a great little spot, if you've got the time."}
{"text":"The breakfast Here is on point! I've been here multiple times and it's always great. Today I split the eggs mando (eggs Benedict with avocado) and the apple cinnamon pancakes. Both dishes were fantastic- the hollandaise on the eggs was flavorful and not overly heavy, and the pancakes were perfectly fluffy. Overall, there's a reason I keep on coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here it has been crazy busy! One Sunday brunch there was a line out the door and a bit around the corner! And while the staff can sometimes be a bit crotchety (honestly I would be too if there were that many people in that small of a space), the food is delicious! My favorite so far has been the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict with a spicy hollandaise sauce... woah. Parking can also be a bit of a nightmare around here, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great selection, quality, value, and service.  The atmosphere is outdated but homey.  The tables are a bit too close together and it can be hectic during breakfast/brunch time.  I would say this is more of a go in, order, eat, and be on your merry way type of place (as opposed to somewhere you'd go for a leisurely meal filled with deep conversation), but there's nothing wrong with that.  

I ordered the Huevos Verdes with egg whites.  This was a huge plate of crisp hash browns, scrambled egg whites, cheese, onions, and peppers atop a giant tortilla, served with sides of salsa and sour cream.  This is always one of my favorite combinations and I noted that the salsa was above average.

Others at the table had the crunchberry pancake (blueberries and granola are mixed into the batter) and the orange waffle.  The pancake was not incredibly crunchy but it did taste more hearty than a regular plain-old pancake.  The \"waffle\" was actually two big plate-sized waffles stacked on top of each other.  The waffles were delicious - you could really taste the orange.  They should offer the option of one or two waffles, because two of these amazing orange waffles is just a recipe for overeating.  

Everything was delivered promptly and the waitress came back frequently to top off our coffee.  With so many options, there's something here for everyone.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"I normally will not rate a restaurant if I've only tried one dish or entree, but for Inn On Coventry I will make an exception.  The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are that damn good!  I tried them on my way to the airport the last time I visited the area, and I totally fell in love with them!  They were light and lemony and lovely cakes.  I would love to get the recipe, which I hear is a closely guarded secret. My brother worked as a server here while in grad school, and my biggest disappointment in him is that he could not get me the recipe. *sigh* What kind of gratitude is that after all the help I gave to him helping him move??  

But I digress.  Ever since I tried these pancakes, I have ordered them at other breakfast nooks whenever I see them on a menu.  I've found a few good ones, but none have compared to these.  What a shame this slice of heaven is in Cleveland of all places. (No offense!) 

So yeah, try the lemon ricotta pancakes. So good I break my own reviewing rules!"}
{"text":"So you're on the East Side of Cleveland and you've stopped in Coventry for a Pour Over ( yirgacheffe if they have it) at Phoenix Coffee.  But your stomach tells you it needs a tad more than that for breakfast...  Perfect scenario! 

Drive up Coventry to Euclid Blvd and walla, the best home style breakfast in this area...

Everything is delicious so try a bit of each thing on every visit.  

Eggs Mando; poached eggs on top of Canadian Bacon? Splendid.. What no meat for you? Vege Mondo is here to please you 

Love Eggs Benedict? They do it many ways that you can't resist trying at least one..  I like the Lox option myself 

Love Omelettes? There are many to choose from meat or non meat.. Spinach Feta Tomatoes and onion anyone? 

Western Omelette with no ham but add Avocados? No problem! 

Swedish Eggs; scrambled eggs with smoked salmon within? Joyful

Lemon Ricotta pancakes? Don't leave here without trying them (order at least one for the table to try) Deliciousness! 

Your kids will love there many style buttermilk pancakes or their awesome French toast. 

Family friendly environment but you have to get there early, as it can get crowded pretty quickly. The neighborhood knows how good the breakfast is and they show up in masses! 

If you are nearby or want to impress your family that you know good places to eat, stop in and enjoy the food.  Truly a neighborhood gem.."}
{"text":"This place is a cozy neighborhood brunch spot! It's a tight squeeze as far as square footage goes so expect a little wait for your food. I have to say that the food was so good that I almost forgot to take a picture! I had an omelet and pancakes while my girlfriend had eggs Benedict. We were both more than satisfied! Waitresses are super friendly and keep the coffee coming AND they have mimosas! Can't go wrong with that. If you're into a good home cooked breakfast at a cozy neighborhood spot, look no further!"}
{"text":"I've been here many many times but this last time was a little ridiculous. The food and our server were great. The other staff not so much! I love everyone there too, but a staff member basically told us to GTFO because \"their line was getting long\". It's not like we were sitting there for 3 hours, it was an hour and 15 minutes (including our waiting and eating time). I know they close at 2:30 but if I'm a customer who is paying tax to sit in your restaurant I expect a little more respect. And they kept refilling our coffees so there was no innuendos that we should hurry and leave. Also I made it a point to leave our server a double tip because as a server I know how frustrating it can be when customers stay long and take up space (even though we weren't, I just wanted to make a point to the staff). Maybe they should stay open longer instead of kicking out their customers."}
{"text":"Apparently thus establishment has been voted best breakfast in the city. Not too shabby of a rating I might say. They had quite the diverse selection from a large menu. We went on a beautiful Sunday early in the afternoon for brunch. The wait was about 15 minutes. I do not believe they take reservations. 

Regardless, food was pretty good in my opinion. I wanted to try things I haven't tried before, so I ordered a feta cheese, black olive, tomato, and spinach omelette with a side order of two pancakes, one of which was the crunchberry and the other orange whole-wheat. The omelette was heavy (I ordered it to be egg-whites only for a healthier touch) mostly owning to the feta cheese and black olives I believe. The omelette also came with potatoes and your choice of toast (white, wheat, or rye of which I chose wheat). The crunchberry pancake was underwhelming in that it tasted no different than a simple blueberry pancake, so I don't know what they were trying to go for there. I actually enjoyed the orange whole-wheat pancakes even though it sounded like it would be the most bland option from my choices. I think it's more of an orange zest (perhaps shavings from an orange peel) mixed with a whole wheat pancake which gave a nice combo taste. 

The establishment itself felt extremely cramped, and having a full house did not make our experience feel more comfortable. However, we were lucky to receive arguably one of the nicest tables in the restaurant near the window so it was a bit more comfortable than if we had sat somewhere else."}
{"text":"My updated rating is based on the experience and not the food.   The Inn on Coventry was once, one of my favorite places.....after this past weekend's experience, not so much:-(.   My family normally frequents this place on Sundays, but my husband and I were on vacation the day after Christmas, and I thought that my daughters and I would treat him to a birthday breakfast.   We order our normal, lemon ricotta pancakes etc. and then proceed to the register to pay the check.   I presented a $20 gift card that I had purchased from a local Groupon type vendor.   I had been there several times since purchasing the gift card, but had been unable to use it, because it was not valid on Sundays, which is when we normally visit the restaurant.   The cashier (possibly owner/manager) was SO unprofessional when I handed her the gift card....she asked (with an attitude), how long ago had I purchased the gift card, I responded that I couldn't remember, but the card was clearly marked \"no expiration date\", so I hadn't been in a big hurry to use it.  The cashier/owner/manager responded snidely, \"we no longer accept these gift cards because the vendor had gone out of business and somehow shorted the restaurant.    Well in my opinion, the restaurant entered into an agreement with the vendor and I purchased the gift card, in good faith, so now I'm left holding the bag for a deal gone bad between two entities.  I couldn't believe that the employee had such an attitude with me.  The restaurant should have honored the gift card.  It's not the money, its the principal.   I paid the check and left.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Now I start this out by saying if you are looking for the absolute best breakfast there is this may not be it. If you are looking for gourmet, or fancy, or someplace a little more creative this is not your place. But if you're looking for someplace that is consistently good, cheap, and everything you can want out of breakfast when you are hungover, tired, looking for somewhere laid back and straightforward you cannot go wrong wit the Inn on Coventry. 

When I get up on a Saturday or Sunday and I haven't slept long enough and I'm feeling a little groggy from the previous nights events I make my way to the Inn. When I don't have work and want somewhere homey to meet a friend for a late breakfast where we can chat and just feel comfortable I go to the Inn. It's my go to. They have a limited menu but not in the sense that you really have to be in the mood to go there, but in that there are plenty of options but I don't feel like I need half an hour to make a final decision. They are known for their various egg benedicts and if they are good enough for Michael Symon they're good enough for me. 

They also have great pancakes! 

They have homefries and grits which are two of my favorite breakfast foods so thats great and while their alcohol selection is VERY limited, if you're feeling up to it (which I'm usually not) you can grab a beer or a mimosa. 

There is usually a wait mid morning, so go early or for a late breakfast on the weekends. The coffee is pretty touch and go, but they have juice and tea. 

I love this place. It's not perfect but warts and all, I always find myself coming back and leaving happy."}
{"text":"The epitome of family-style comfort food. Quaint little diner that is sure to satisfy any taste; the menu is full of options! I went for breakfast, but the roast beef sandwich looked mighty tempting...next time! 

My husband and I both ordered the corn beef hash. It comes with a poached egg on top, includes hash browns and toast and is sooo scrumptious. You get so much food for the price! The egg yolk paired perfectly with the corn beef flavor and the entire dish is perfectly seasoned. I was afraid of having dry, sodium diner mouth for the rest of the day but thankfully that was not the case. The food comes out super quick. Don't expect your server to say more than 5 words to you, but service is speedy, so what the heck. 

Wide variety of breakfast options, if that is what you are in the mood for. Those and the hot sanwiches looked most enticing to me and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed eating here very much. The waitress is very sweet and nice. Food was delicious. We would definitely recommend we both had breakfast he had a western omelet and I had the low card Bennie it was amazing. Yum!"}
{"text":"Not really a good experience. I ordered the bacon and cheese omelette and the bacon was burnt and salty. The bloody Mary was decent... Make sure you stir it up constantly or you will get vodka with a hint of tomato. My partner in crime; she had to hump a leg just to get some coffee. The waitress seemed as though she didn't really want to serve us, she was dry with us but all smiles with others. We didn't do anything to cause that. The best part about the inn on Coventry was how fast we were seated eventhough it was packed inside. This was my experience, but you don't have to take my word for it. #ReadingRainbow"}
{"text":"Got the greek omelet and it was very good. Great place to grab something quick for breakfast that is reasonably priced and tastes good. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Debbie has owned this tiny little local spot for 36 years and the food just gets better and better!

Kathy (\"with a K\") has been a fantastic server since..... always. She tends to every special detail with a smile and you feel like momma is right there.

My favorites are the homemade crispy corned beef hash, served with a hash brown platter and all topped with an egg, your style.

The fluffy and flavorful lemon ricotta pancakes lightly dusted with powdered suger. All you need is warm butter... no syrup needed. They melt in your mouth.

They actually have full bar service, but they specialize in the Bloody Mary and Mimosas. 

The freshly made desserts are always wonderful on the tongue!

If u go on the weekend, expect a certain wait, line out the door....but it is well worth the meet new locals wait!"}
{"text":"if you're looking for food, you can get food here. i wouldn't say good food, just food. i mean they make the typical breakfast fare, and it's the most typical of typical. eggs, pancakes, meat. a couple of the pancakes are alright i suppose.
they also have a blood mary, which isn't bad.
i am here quite a bit, and it may be the best breakfast in that area of town, but that's not saying much.
the only thing that's great really is that the wait staff are super friendly and this is a really homey kinda place."}
{"text":"A Cleveland classic! The best place for breakfast and brunch. You just can't beat the pancakes here. The Eggs Benedict and sausage gravy and biscuits are terrific, too. I've never had a bad meal here. The food is nothing fancy, but it's darn great. 

The Inn gets really crowded in the weekends but it's worth the wait. The restaurant is small so it's a little tight when it's packed but, again, it's worth it for the food.  The service is good and efficient. 

Breakfast at the Inn on Coventry is a uniquely Cleveland experience that everyone should try."}
{"text":"Before my visit to this place, my number 1 brunch place was wildberry pancakes in Chicago. This place now ties in my heart. It's a busy diner indeed, but everything that I ordered here was beyond delicious. I had Irish Benedict (corn beef was so amazingly yum), Benedict mando (not too heavy and avocado was fresh! Really really good as well), and lemon ricotta pancake (this simple dish really impressed me. Super soft and silky taste! I wish I could have this every day! I got the super stack and it was a bit too much for us in terms of quantity so be prepared!). Now that I am writing review for this place, I can't stop drooling about it. So wish that there is one nearby! Highly recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars for breakfast only.  I've heard it's terrible for dinner.  One of the great breakfast spots in town."}
{"text":"This place is very popular with people who live in the area (and especially amongst students at Case Western), and there is always a wait on the weekends. 

The environs are a little worn/tired, but the omelettes are terrific. Prices are a bit steep for Ohio, but I will be back."}
{"text":"The service and food are stellar from any way you look at it. Well worth getting up early to dine."}
{"text":"Ever feel like you don't know your own neighborhood? Well, that's what I felt like while finally discovering this awesome breakfast joint after practically living my entire life in the heights area. I don't know how many times I've been up and down on Coventry but never really noticed this place. But, wow! Am I glad I finally did. I read something about their \"insane\" lemon ricotta pancakes in the PD by some guy named Michael Symon. I live right down the street, so I figured I might as well see about it. Result? It's a shame I didn't know about this place sooner. Not disappointed at all! 2 of us got the corned beef hash and the Kentucky scramble - the sauce/salsa... amazing! I think it has bourbon in it! The highlight... insane lemon ricotta super stack, which we made our dessert. Wow! They have \"Homestyle cooking at its best\" printed on their shirts. Indeed!!! And our server... forgot her name, but she was great! Reminds me of a typical Italian grandma... very caring. You'll know who she is if you get her. So glad to have found this little gem. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and will definitely be back! The food was great- we had the mango pancake and cornbread and andouille sausage eggs benedict. The owners were lovely and very friendly. The only down side and why we didn't give five stars is bc it's a bit cramped and we were sitting less than an inch from another table so it was a bit awkward at first trying to have conversation. Part of the charm of this place though is that it's small and unique (menu and decor)"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, bit loud and cramped at times. Great service.

Came here on a Saturday morning with some friends, after a short wait we were seated. Our table was next to the window which meant that unfortunately the sun was shining straight in our eyes the whole time. The tables are very close together so we had to exercise caution moving around and getting up from our chairs. We were promptly met by our server, who poured us coffee and brought over some waters. 

The menu has what you would expect at a regular breakfast place, pancakes, eggs, toast, as well as some lunch time fare such as burgers. They have some unique variations on the eggs Benedict as well. I ordered a corned beef hash and a single lemon ricotta pancake.  I was pleased with the quality of the food, the quantity was adequate. I feel the corned beef hash could have more corned beef in it, but other than that I was pleased with my meal.

Service was prompt and polite. The server checked on us multiple times during the meal, our coffee was always hot and full. The food did take a little long to come out, but that was understandable as the place was jam packed, and the server made sure to keep us updated. 

My biggest issue was the noise level, it is quite loud and at times it became hard to comfortably hold a conversation. Overall though I think the pros out weigh the cons and I will not hesitate to return here and recommend friends visit here."}
{"text":"I've walked past the Inn on Coventry many times on my way downstairs to La Cav - I figured it was about time to give it a try.

We arrived around 11am on a Sunday. The restaurant was bustling, but we were seated right away. I ordered a short stack of cinnamon apple pancakes with a side of bacon. My friend ordered poached eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast. The food was delicious and very fairly priced.

The service was OK... we had to make a point to our server that we needed our drinks refilled. And because the restaurant is located in a tight space, another server kept asking if I could scoot my chair closer to the table. I understand that they need to get around, but I like to be comfortable too.

Overall, good breakfast, good prices, worth a try."}
{"text":"Right in the heart of Coventry. Theyre known for their breakfasts. The eggs benedict and lemon ricotta pancakes are out of this world. Parking is a bit tough on Saturday morning. Service is fast and friendly. No frills, just great comfort food."}
{"text":"A masterful breakfast with a rotating menu.

All of the usual breakfast favorites will great you; pandcakes, sausage, coffee, fruit, hash, and french toast. Everything comes out fresh, hot, and with that extra love that is usually found at grandma's. The usuals are spiced up with crepes, nifty omit fillers, and crisp veggies."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go-to brunch places. I love their corned beef eggs benedict and the sisterhood croissant (croissant with smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce). Their pancakes are meh. I'm not really a pancake person, but I do enjoy a good one. I thought the pancakes here are a bit dry. 

I would definitely stick with their breakfast menu. One time I thought I'd be adventurous and go with their au jus sandwich. Big mistake!! It was just a soggy old hamburger bun with a few thin slices of meat. Definitely disappointed!

The place is pretty small so there can be a long wait. I'd recommend going before 8am on a weekend. They don't take reservations. On weekdays, I've never had issues. They're also not able to accommodate super large groups--6-8 is probably their max."}
{"text":"Amazingly busy and I can see why! Huge breakfast selection with what has to be the largest variety of eggs Benedict that I have ever seen- lox, corned beef hash, turkey sausage, etc. plus so much more! Servings were generous and even with the crowd, service was excellent. For a little spice- try the huevos pan de mais with andouille sausage and chipotle sauce! Hash tasted fresh and homemade"}
{"text":"The look of this place is very cute and old fashioned. It took at least seven to ten minutes for our order to be taken though and the place was clearing out. I got an omelet and it said that It was a three egg omelet and it was actually quite small. Probably the smallest three egg omelet I've ever seen. Which makes the price of nine dollars seem a bit much. Overall it was a decent breakfast but probably wouldn't be back. They said the waffles were good but didn't try them!"}
{"text":"Incredibly cozy. Fast and friendly service. Ah-mazingly good food! With that being said, although the lemon ricotta pancakes are good, they are NOT for everyone. Go for the weekday breakfast special and stay for the mimosa, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time at the Inn On Coventry. My fiancé and I were early birds so there wasn't a wait and the seating area wasn't too claustrophobic. My first visit, the restaurant was a little too squished for my liking because it was later in the morning, but the food is worth it. The prices are reasonable, the menu has just the right amount of choices, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"As many of these reviews have stated- get there early AND get a lemon ricotta pancake. It practically melts in your mouth. There are two tucked away tables in the back, see if they are available. The only thing is that the coffee is AWFUL. Drink it at home or stop at Phoenix coffee afterwards."}
{"text":"I don't know guys. The foods pretty good, the coffee plentiful, and the area is always nice to visit. But man, the service is horrendous.  It's like a hot guy who knows he's hot; it takes away from the whole experience of engaging in any contact with him. This place thinks they are so phenomenal that eating here should be its own reward. So if you get the hostess to find you a table, or call your name when you have a table, or refill your coffee, or NOT take away your plate before you are done eating and stuff a check in place of it...even when they have no one waiting, WELL, sir, you are just lucky.  Because this establishment is above all of that."}
{"text":"Still the best breakfast and/or brunch on in the Heights.

I can't believe that I havent been back in so long, but there's still lots of life in the old lady yet! It was just how I remembered, but even better. I'm not sure if it was getting seated right away, the company, the food--any way you slice it though, was damn good.

I went for my usual veggie omelet with dry rye toast and once again, my standby didn't fail me. But, this time I opted for a side of biscuits and gravy for the dude and I to share--my first ever Inn On Coventry sausage gravy experience. Nom. Who the hell is Bob Evans? They've got nothing on the Inn! 

The same little, old ladies are working there with the exception of a few newbie teens, who were surprisingly pleasant and efficient. Our server in particular was awesome, not that I expected less. She was patient with me while I took forever to order and catered to all my last minute request and needs (i.e. dry rye, hot sauce, egg whites, etc.) And trust me, I can be a pain in the butt.

Please, if you find yourself in Cleveland Heights in need of an amazing, home-cooked breakfast or brunch that's like grandma's but way better--this is must try."}
{"text":"This place is a cross between a diner and a quaint restaurant.  It's generally busy during weekend brunch hours, but if you don't have a large group, it's not so bad.  The staff are efficient even though they may not be the friendliest. Don't let that stop you from checking this place out.  Their lemon ricotta pancakes are divine. Their omelets are also a good choice. I haven't tried anything else because I always go for the pancakes.  I always enjoy making the trip out to the east side for this restaurant because it's reliably delicious!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and I will be coming for many more. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Family owned and they treat us like family. I would suggest coming for breakfast because they have a very creative selection of breakfast and brunch on Sundays. I love the veggie mando which is eggs Benedict with avocado instead of ham. It can be cramped, but that's to be expected in spaces retrofitted into 1920's buildings."}
{"text":"I go to the Inn every brunch opportunity I can, because of their amazing pancakes and eggs benedict. I also recommend a southwest omelet but ask for their salsa! Their juice cups are small, but the orange juice tastes fresh. I LOVE the blueberry as well as the peanut butter chiop pancakes."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever experienced. Came in at 1130, we ordered mimosas and coffee and it took 15 minutes, on top of that we were judged for our drink choices. DO NOT COME HERE. (we didn't even order food because of how long it took)"}
{"text":"First time I tried this little place and it was excellant.  Very affordable and very fresh and homemade.  Will definitely go back for more"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite mom and pop breakfast spots in the city. It has been a staple here on Coventry for the past 35+ years.  It's so popular but so cramped in the dinning space. If you're claustrophobic this is not the place for you. 

I highly recommend the Irish Benedict. My husband swears by it. I usually get the corned beef hash. Delish!  Today we tried the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were to die for. Very delicious and not too lemony. 

The wait staff are all nice and very accommodating. This isn't a place for a group more than 4 since it's always packed but definitely a good place to get brunch on a Sunday for you and your bestie or sweety."}
{"text":"Good: Efficient service, solid breakfast/brunch offerings (eggs benedict!), great pancakes (chocolate and crunchberry are my two favorites).   Not too busy for breakfast earlier on the weekends or during the week.  Decent prices, I think, for the quantities being served.

Bad: Definitely busy on the weekends, so be prepared to wait.

Sarah, if you can't find other places to eat brunch in Cleveland, you haven't been looking nearly hard enough.  Just around here, there's Grumpy's, Oui Oui Cafe, Sal's, Heck's, Yours Truly, West Side Market Cafe..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised it's taken me this long to write a review of the Inn.  This is my favorite breakfast/ brunch place in town. Taste and friendliness of staff are the two areas is like to focus on today.

1. This isn't a swanky brunch place. Rather, it's a mix between a diner and mom and pop shop. The food, however, is tasty. I've had 6 of their egg dishes (the Pan de Mais and Avocado, Mushroom & Jack omelet are my standbys) and never have to use salt or pepper, just a little hot sauce for kick. Everyone knows they're lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious, so I'll just say I really like that you can order them by piece.  I ALWAYS order just ONE as my dessert. Their home fries always approaches that line of being too oily, but never crosses it. They're tender with lots of crispy bits and and perfectly seasoned.  I sometimes opt for the grits (when I want to feel \"healthier\").  While they're pretty plain, they're perfectly cooked and delicious with some butter and shredded cheddar, which they'll gladly give you.  Oh, they also offer egg whites for those who want to sub. One last thing, if you want a hot sauce (that isn't from a jar), ask for their chipotle sauce for their Pan de Mais. It's smoky, a little creamy and delightfully spicy.  It goes so well on any of their egg dishes!

2. The staff here is just the nicest. They're typically very busy on the weekends (get there before 11a to decrease your wait time), so their staff hustles, but I never feel rushed.  Rather, I always feel welcomed and cared for.  Across the board, the management, the servers and the bussers are nice people. They joke, they're patient and will help you out.  I once asked the busser to please get our server because we needed more sweetener and instead, he went back and got it himself. The busser still let our server know and she came by a minute later and apologized for not doing it herself.  Another good example is whenever they're busy, they all help each other out with running food, refilling coffee and checking in on folks. It's a tight space in there, but they make it work and do it well.

I love this place and as long as they remain consistent, they'll have a happy customer out of me, my friends, my colleagues, my students, my out-of-town guests and anyone else who asks me where to go for brunch. Lastly, if you're looking for two more reasons to come, know that they're local and women-owned."}
{"text":"We came around 11:45 on a Sunday and only had to wait twenty minutes (party of two)! I am new to exploring this area and I'm very happy we dropped in for breakfast! Hometown feel... We got a seat right next to the window! 

I had the no carb Benedict (picture added). Very good, but very liquidy. We tried the chocolate chip and apple cinnamon (needs more apples) pancakes and both were very good. We also tried the lemon ricotta pancake. Great lemon flavor (not too powerful) but I think there was too much cheese. Other than the texture it was good. :) We will be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"The Irish Benedict is amazing because they make homemade corned beef hash.   Try it."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time recently and I must say that I WILL return.

The wait was not long. In fact, there really wasn't much of a wait at all. Your mileage may vary, however. A party of two generally has less of a wait anywhere. We actually sat before other parties that had been waiting since we got there.

It seems there is a back room as well? I saw people going back there. Maybe for a potty? Maybe for a seat? Not sure. Either way, there seemed to be plenty of seating for this restaurant.

The fooooood! I had sausage, gravy & biscuits. My girlfriend had the most delicious omelette with toast and the potatoes. We both left full, stuffed full, and happy.

The price was right on. No complaints here.

Edit: Went for my second time. MMmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town was a good excuse to turn to Yelp to find a great breakfast spot.  This place did not disappoint.  It has the feel of diner food but is well made and extremely tasty.  We tried the egg sandwiches, egg platters, the corned beef hash, and the lemon ricotta pancakes. 

All of the normal breakfast items were as expected and very tasty.  I honestly didn't think that I would like the lemon pancakes but since they were recommended by our server we gave them a try.  I'm glad I did because they were perfect.  Light but tasty and I never would have imagined \"lemon\" or \"ricotta\" improving a pancake in any way.  

Service was as good as it gets for a breakfast establishment.  The coffee was flowing and we were well taken care of.  Great breakfast."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast. 

My boyfriend is a breakfast connoisseur, and having recently moved to the area, we're happy to have a good standby right around the block. He got a little overzealous and ordered the super stack...way too many pancakes. Probably if you aren't ravenous, stick to the short stack. I didn't think the peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes were anything too special, but they were good.

My no-carb benedict was fantastic! I feel like most breakfast foods are super filling and wind up making me feel sluggish, but the no-carb benedict (poached eggs over portabella mushrooms with tomatoes and artichokes, covered with hollandaise) was perfect."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this place, I forget how much food they give you! I can never finish their food. Unless you can eat A LOT or you are starving, it's okay to share a plate with your friend. I love their breakfast though! :)"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff who makes you feel like you're at home. The food may be average, but they have a large menu with many options. I would call Inn On Coventry to be slightly better than most diner food and this is coming from a Jersey girl. 

I came with my parents on a short visit to Cleveland. We had some business to do in the morning so we skipped breakfast. This restaurant was nearby and provided my hangry self a nice brunch fix."}
{"text":"Just order the lemon ricotta pancakes... and all will be right with the world. I love this place because it is simple and you always know what you are going to get. The service is great, even though they are always packed, and the food is wonderful. We always enjoy our experience and leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"My experience with the food was not great. I should give 2 stars, but because I've only had one dish, I did not think it would be fair. I made the best of it. 

I had the Irish Benedict with a side of home fries. The home fries were very bland. Many of the pieces were not cooked all of the way. I am pretty sure I tasted a chocolate/PB chunk in my potatoes. The Irish Benedict itself did not have much flavor. I used salt and pepper on the entire meal. Ketchup and Frank's sauce on the home fries. 

I asked for my eggs to be poached hard. As you can tell, this was not close to being done. I told the waitress and she asked me if it was ok...not if it could be made how I requested. Well, clearly not, because that's not what I asked for. I didn't ask them to remake it, because the wait was already pretty long. I just pushed the yolk out and pushed it to the other side of my plate. Smh. 

When I went to pay, I told the cashier, and nothing was done. The wait was not worth the food at all. I don't think I need to go back. There's nothing else that I can't get at another restaurant."}
{"text":"Sunday I got a chance to finally check out The Inn on Coventry for Brunch. Upon arrival it was very crowded, further adding to the expectation of delicious food being served that I've been hearing about. It's a very intimate restaurant,  the service was good but a little slow. The food was good but nothing special. I wouldn't rant and rave about it, but I'd go again for Brunch just to try something else and see if it was better than what I got the first time. I had a western omelet and french toast."}
{"text":"Great food, nice cozy ambiance. Homestyle food at its best. Had brunch on a Saturday and the place was packed, but service was still fine. Will go back."}
{"text":"Lemon Ricotta Pancake: 5+ stars
Cute old ladies: 5 stars
Everything else: 3 stars

So, that comes to something like 4 stars overall, right? I've been here many times, especially when I lived in Cleveland Heights this was my walkable go-to brunch spot on weekends (it is one of the only spots of the kind). Its good, and consistently so. The omelets and scrambles aren't anything special, and now that I actually go through the effort of cooking at home more often, tend to leave me underwhelmed. But if you want something less easy like the many specialty pancakes, portabella benedict, anything with lox, etc this is where its at.

Don't be put off by comments about the wait. Its as long as you should expect it to be at any brunch spot in any town in the country. If it were shorter I'd be concerned. Its a relatively small restaurant but moves fast, I've never waited more than 20 minutes, even with a line out the door.

And please, please get at least one big lemon ricotta pancake, regardless of whatever else you order! It is so good, time and time again. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Patronized based on Yelp reviews. Wow! it was good! I love the small, \"greasy spoon\" type places. But the silverware was clean, the coffee hot and the Irish Benedict outstanding! Service was excellent and I already have a few people in mind that I am gonna drag along next time I go."}
{"text":"Coventry Inn is THE best breakfast place in Cleveland, OH.

I don't even know where to start. What's to die for there? The homefries, egg mando, lemon ricotta pancakes, chorizo, buttered toast, coffee, and almost everything else...

I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here even after dozens and dozens of visits. Coventry Inn has never failed me (except if you come at the wrong time and have to wait). I usually come here later in the morning to avoid the wait times since there are always soo many people coming here to eat.

The first time I came here, the place didn't really stand out to me. But the food is so freshly made, so delicious, and so homely that I've been coming back here as many weekends as I can make it to.

If you haven't been to the inn yet, it's a MUST. For a first timer, if you're stuck in the wait, it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Notwithstanding the wait and the crowded dining room, I always enjoy this place with one exception. There is one member of the wait staff who, I am convinced, really doesn't like his or her job."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice and each time I love it more!  The Inn on Coventry is a family owned breakfast/brunch establishment that really pushes all the right buttons for me.  Perhaps it's my Pittsburgh blue collar roots, but there is something so comforting about a bustling restaurant that serves a large, warm breakfast.  The decor is not particularly unique, but it has a great home-y feel that is very fitting with its food.  I've ordered the eggs benedict and corned beef hash on separate occasions, and both have been hearty and filling.  The plates were large, piled with the benedicts (or hash), potatoes, and toast.  A friend had ordered some pancakes to share the first time I had been there.  I was such a fan that I had to order one for myself the second time I went!  I ordered a lemon ricotta pancake when I went again.  The pancake was fluffy and sweet, with just the right touch of lemon flavor.  It has enough flavor that there is no need to add maple syrup.  in fact, my friends were so impressed with the pancake that they ordered an additional one for themselves!  All in all, I highly enjoyed my dining experiences here.  In addition, the waitstaff have been a joy to interact with.  Delicious food, large plates, and kind people.  One of my favorite breakfast places in Cleveland!

Just a note for groups, though:  If you're coming with a large group, make sure everyone gets there on time!  They won't seat you until the whole group is there."}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes in the city of Cleveland! The people that work there are always so nice."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the quarters are tight.  Service is good, but not great.

As I've been here multiple times over the past decade, the quality of the food has remained, but the space itself has gotten a little dingy.  A face lift is an order and would probably bring my review up to a four."}
{"text":"A great hidden gem found on the corner of coventry.  Busier place than most, you sit side by side other patrons in a homey breakfast atmosphere ordering great breakfast food. I got the crab cake Benedict which hit the spot. I really liked the sauce and the crab cake had actual pieces of crab, which if you are a seafood fanatic like myself you are pleasantly surprised. The prices are moderate and not too expensive but watch!!!!!! I ordered hot water honey an lemon and was charged for the honey???!! First time ever. After I explained that no one told me they did graciously take it off my bill but this was one of the first places ever I have been charged for honey and lemon aka the drop in my rating. But all around great service and great food just be prepared to wait a while before you get your table. Business here is good :)"}
{"text":"They open at 7 so it is the perfect place to get your early morning fix of pancakes. As far as pancakes... the classic and apple cinnamon are very good. Stick to the breakfast classics here and you will not be disappointed! Super friendly service to start your morning right!"}
{"text":"Breakfast food is as good as it gets! So good, in fact, that I called to to place a take-out order for a double stack of pumpkin pancakes at 10:30am on a Monday BUT an employee told me sternly \"we're too busy to do take out orders right now.\"

Sorry I bothered you with my business, Inn on Coventry."}
{"text":"Lemon Ricotta pancakes! Enough said!

I love you guys!

Yall are my favorite, your staff is just amazing and your food? Mouthwatering!
I just had the Irish Benadict and OMG! Every time I walk in this place you guys just amaze me with your food. I've never had a bad experience. There's a server with short black hair that I absolutely LOVE. The hugs, the conversation, she reminds me of my mother. I love coming in, the food, atmosphere and company is just amazing. Everytime we're here, my boyfriend laughs and says, man you can taste the love they put into their food. Yes, you most definitely can. We love you guys and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I came here because many gave the place great reviews.  It was packed for brunch and we were seated in the corner with no room.  I had the sausage biscuit and gravy, I don't know if it was because they were busy, but my food came out cold.  It was okay and I've had better.  Our waitress was a nice elder lady...super sweet.  The next time I come back I think I'll order something different!  The prices here are great and fairly cheap."}
{"text":"I have only eaten breakfast food here, but I can tell you that was AMAZING.  My friend and I went here for Lunch one day and both tried some of the pancakes (which a coworker had recommended).  I had the blueberry and she had the pumpkin.  Both of these varieties were great.  They offer like 5 other types of pancakes too, including Lemon Ricotta (which I considered but didn't try).  

I can't tell you that their non breakfast food is good because I haven't tried any, but they did have a large menu and about 10 specials when I was there so there are plenty of options for event the pickiest eater."}
{"text":"Cleveland Heights is a great city, with lot of cool places and an active nightlife, but what about all the young families in the area? Where do they go in the neighborhood that's not national chain blah. We have just moved here, and love finding great food, but with a small child (about 14 months now) it can be hard to find places that are appropriate. 

Cue Inn on Coventry! The small town diner is small and a bit cramped, but they had a highchair! Bonus: since there wasn't a lot of space between tables, my son had a great time flirting with all the girls sitting nearby. The staff were all nice and plenty stopped to say \"hi\" to the little guy. 

The food was also good, and definitely priced right. For the three of us (two adults and a toddler) it was about $20. My husband had the Heuvos Pan de Mais, and ate all of it. It is spicy sausage with spicy sauce over poached egg and cornbread. Very spicy. 

I had the . . . . .you guessed it, the corned beef hash. Yeah I know I'm predictable at this point, but I like finding something unique that's easy to compare. I mean we're talking apples to apples here - or as the case may be corned beef to corned beef. The corned beef hash was, umm, interesting. While the hash does not have potatoes in it, it does comes with home-fries - so do your own mixing. I also thought the corned beef had an interesting flavor, it wasn't as buttery/savory/fatty as I wanted it to be, but rather a little tangy? I'm not sure what it is, but its not for me. But all in all, the food was good and cooked well. 

I am not a breakfast person - most mornings I have dry cereal or maybe a piece of toast. But I love for someone else to make a full breakfast for me on the weekends. It may be a bit dangerous considering how close this good breakfast spot is. The last place we lived, we had to drive 20 minutes to get great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have often said that in order to get 5 stars, the restaurant must not only be great, it has to give me something I simply can't get anywhere else. Inn On Coventry in Cleveland Heights OH certainly did that.

I walked in wearing my Ohio State sweatshirt on the day of the Ohio State/Michigan State game. A lovely woman who worked there was wearing her OSU sweatshirt too and we high-fived with vigor before I even got to my table. It seems the place is run by women and they are all fantastic; warm, friendly and eager to make sure I enjoyed my breakfast. They even gave me a quarter from the register to use in the parking meter and a traveler coffee to take with me when I left.

Another guest also started talking to me right away as well. If I had ordered a beer I would have felt like Norm at Cheers. Looking at the menu, I could see that there was a odd twisted combination of Eggs Benedict, pancake and Mexican-style breakfast offerings. I asked what was best and my waitress pointed out the Eggs Benedict and the Lemon-ricotta pancakes. But my eye was drawn to the Huevos Pan de Mais. The Who-What-Where you ask? Huevos Pan de Mais. Remember it.

Huevos Pan de Mais consists of two luscious poached eggs balanced on top of two butter-grilled corn bread slabs. Tucked in between the corn breads is some spicy andouille sausage, and the whole mess is topped off with this creamy smooth chipotle sauce. Oh mios DIOS! And on the side they sent out a pancake. I told them to call the Cleveland Department of Public Works because I was sure I had the missing manhole cover on my plate. Made from scratch, this pancake was just great! I have never seen a breakfast like this before, and I never expect to see it better.

I can't wait to go back. If you are in the area and looking for breakfast in the friendliest atmosphere imaginable, stop in. But bring a quarter for the meter. Better yet, bring two quarters and stay an hour."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and just figured we would find a place for breakfast.  We stumbled into this place and was not disappointed.  All of the food was great and was surprised to find such refined items on the menu.  This is really good diner food.  I had poached eggs and andouille sausage with a chipotle sauce.  The wife had a quiche and the boy had the best blueberry pancake I have shoved in my mouthhole.  The place is small but was not a problem.  A really nice little neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"I hope my review gets posted. Somehow I thought I was reviewing a Japanese place.
the Inn on Coventry is a great place for breakfast or brunch. The portions are huge. The food is delicious. They make a powerful Bloody Mary.
 I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really dig the breakfast here and would visit again. Has a casual family-diner feeling. Only problem I had was the seating: I really couldn't move an inch for fear I might disturb my neighbor. I ordered an omelet with avocado, Monterey jack, and tomatoes: cooked to perfection. The blueberry granola pancake that I split with a friend was a sweet treat as well. Even the though the service could have been better (I felt as though we waited a bit to long to place our orders), I have to be sympathetic to the servers who were running around at top-speed the entire time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch!  My husband and I love going to the Inn on Coventry on Sunday mornings.  The pumpkin pancakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning with a party of 9. It was after 10 am on a Friday morning. We realized there was going to be a wait. We waited in the hallway as there was a lot of people inside waiting. I sent my son in to put our names in. A couple - 2 people walked in after us. The hostess told my son give her a minute. I walk in And she says are you with the party of 9 . I said yes. She said give me a minute. Meanwhile the party of 2 who came after us was already seated at a table for 6. When I asked her about it she said well Maybe I didn't see your son standing there and proceeded to tell me it would be an hour wait . An hour . For a Lil mom and pop restaurant. When we waited over 10 mins just to put our name in only to be looked over . Well clearly they didn't need or want our business. I really couldn't tell you how the food was so I would hope it's better then the service. We were visiting from out of town so yea probably not a restaurant I would ever some back to. We ended up right down the street at Tommys who was very accommodating."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good pancake place and ended up here bc not only were the pancakes suppose to be good, but they also had some interesting ones! THEN, we both ended up ordering something other than pancakes - 

When they sat us, in a very crowded restaurant at a very small table, they just brought water along! I love that! 

My husband ordered the Lox Benedict with well done home fries. He said the benny was delicious and the home fries were perfectly done 

I ordered a bacon and cheese omelette with home fries well done. My omelette was good and the home fries were well done and amazing. They had a seasoning on them and a little tiny bit of onion. We are not normally people who finish their home fries and both of us finished these!! 

We both had coffee and we both thought it was good. 

After finishing our meals, we decided to share some of the regular pancakes since they were suppose to be so good - plus, that's why we came. They came out smoking hot and we dug in.  All I can say is BLAH. They were flat, boring pancakes. Not bad, but not great by any stretch. 

The restaurant itself was a 4star, the pancakes were a 2star. 

We would come back"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and wanted to try something local. The Inn On Coventry is a cute little spot to temporarily get away from the outside world. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes with blueberries and banana on top and a side of 2 scrambled eggs. When I got my food the waitress explained that the cook put the blueberries inside of the pancakes because it's what their used to doing. No big deal. They were delicious regardless. The size of the pancakes were huge! I couldn't finished and had to get a to go box.  The eggs were cooked harder than I wished but I still ate them. I also don't think those were a full two eggs. Overall I had a great experience and plan to go back to try their specials"}
{"text":"Breakfast is the one meal of the day that I've never worked professionally to prepare. I've catered private events, worked the line as a short order cook during busy lunch hours and had the pleasure of working late nights preparing dinners of all varieties. With that said, and perhaps inexplicably above all others, I am partial to a good breakfast. Simple, unpretentious & soul satisfying, breakfast doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Said to be the most important meal of the day, I enjoy the comfort of breakfast more so than any other meal of the day. I also enjoy visiting different breakfast locales in curiosity of their take on morning's first meal. The Inn on Coventry was my latest venture.....

A homey, comfortable spot, The Inn on Coventry has been serving consistently reliable meals since 1981. While best known for breakfast, the Inn is also open daily for lunch and once a week (Friday) for dinner. 

The breakfast menu contains the typical morning staples, along with a few unique surprises including the \"Huevos Pan de Mais\" which consists of poached eggs over cornbread with andouille sausage, a spicy chipotle sauce and home fries. This sounds like a hangovers best friend. Among others, another dish that caught my eye was the \"Croissant Sisterhood\" which was lox & eggs over a croissant, smothered in Hollandaise sauce. Both sounded mouth-wateringly desirable. Unable to decide between the two, I settled upon a personal favorite; the sausage, gravy & biscuits which was equally satisfying. 

The East side has quite a few notable breakfast spots and The Inn on Coventry will most definitely have to be added to my rotation."}
{"text":"Our first stop was in this restaurant for having lunch. Before start eating, I visited their restrooms.... and that was a huge mistake! OMG... was so dirty... no paper towels, the sink was clogging and so dirty almost everywhere.... and keep in mind that the restroom is right next to the tables....i think that i lost my apetite :( 
About the meals... all the plates that we tried were below the average. I am sure that Cleveland has better restaurants than this one! They definetely care more about your money than the food that they provide."}
{"text":"Cozy and quaint restaurant in the Coventry area. Great food and decent place for brunch or breakfast  I tried the Greek omelet and ricotta & lemon pancake. Portion sizes are great. Wish they had 2 for 1 mimosas, lol! Tennessee has really spoiled me on brunch experiences. Only complaint was the flies... Once we got our food we were constantly fanning."}
{"text":"The Inn on Coventry is an intimate diner. I drove 20 minutes to try this place out and it is completely worth it! While it's not a place for a party bigger than 4, it's very nice!

I had the Crab Cakes Egg Benedict with home fries and couldn't be happier. The service was relatively quick and attentive. As for the food, it tasted delicious! The hollandaise sauce was superb! I wish this place were closer to me to enjoy more often. The meal was only $8.99 and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Popular spot in Coventry, 20-minute wait on Saturday late morning-not bad, tables are very close to each other so don't go if you're wanting to have a private conversation. Omelette was pretty good, hash browns were good until I chomped into a huge chunk of undercooked onions. Not a fan. Will go back to try the pancakes. Really friendly service!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in Cleveland Heights for weekend breakfast. We've been twice and haven't been disappointed. It's not the fanciest place in town, but there's pretty standard fare, it's quite tasty, and reasonably priced. I've had a version of pancakes both times (the short stack was more than enough), and there were rave reviews on the crepes. We didn't have to wait for a table though we arrived by 8:30am both times; not sure if it gets more packed as the morning goes on."}
{"text":"Very delicious little spot! The ambiance is like visiting grandmas house. All the servers and hostesses I saw were older women and very friendly. We had a table of 10 and went at around noon on a Saturday. They were PACKED but accommodate us after shuffling a couple tables together. 

I ordered the Lemon ricotta pancake and it was AMAZING! So light and lemony I really should've ordered a stack. I also had the eggs Benedict and home style potatoes. The eggs Benedict was really tasty too. The English muffin was so crunchy my poached egg yolk absorbed into it and it was still super crisp. YUM. The potatoes weren't crispy they really were just cooked potatoes mashed up a bit and I didn't care too much for them. A friend tried the Bloody Mary which were a bit weak and heavy on the celery flavor. The food came out quick, the ambiance was cozy and homey and if I ever find my way back go Cleveland I will def hit this place up. Holy lemon ricotta pancakes. Get.In.My.Belly NOW!"}
{"text":"This breakfast is delicious, but I don't go often because of how long the wait is. Waiting an hour for a table there has almost become their signature \"thing\", but I'm pretty impatient, especially when I'm hangry."}
{"text":"Really like the egg benny there. Nice atmosphere, good food, good service."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty much everyone's go-to place for a basic brunch in Cleveland. The food is cheap and delicious. However, the place is small. That means that there is pretty much always going to be a wait when you go on a weekend, particularly Sunday.  It'll range from 20 minutes to an hour, but it's always worth it. 

The service isn't great here. The lady who takes reservations always looks angry. You are lucky if your waitress comes back once to see if you need anything else, and sometimes food takes a while to come. You pay at the desk. 

All of that said, I love this place. All of the omlettes are delicious, and I love the hash browns. I moved away, but I will for sure be back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Inn on Coventry is a pretty convenient brunch place that doesn't get slammed full of people and doesn't make you wait for long.  It offers a nice hole in the wall feel that's part diner, part sit-down restaurant.  They don't carry a huge range of breakfast foods, but their food is pretty good.

Being a huge eggs benedict fiend, I ordered the eggs mando -- which is essentially eggs benedict with avocado.  I was pretty disappointed at how little avocado there was -- considering that they made an extra dish out of it on the menu.  My friend ordered the corned beef hash and found it enjoyable.  We also shared an order of the mango and sour cream pancake.  I've heard good things about their pancakes -- so I wanted to order something that sounded the most unique.  While it was fluffy and pretty tasty, it had more of a citrus flavor than anything.  

I'd recommend the Inn on Coventry for a casual brunch over the weekend.  The portions aren't unreasonably large here and service is pretty quick and friendly.  All-in-all, it's a decent breakfast restaurant that doesn't offer too much fluff and gets down to good food."}
{"text":"What a lively place to have breakfast/brunch in Cleveland. The reviews suggesting the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes is what drew me here.

Not only was the atmosphere great to be among the locals but also the Eggs Benedict and the pancakes were excellent!

If you are from out of town and need a place to pick up some breakfast head here.

While there is metered parking everywhere Sunday when I went the parking is free at the meters."}
{"text":"Absolute Breakfast Heaven.  

First, I must say that the wait staff here is on top of their game like no other.  My water glass--always full.  My coffee mug--always topped.  Our waitress was everything I want my waitress to be--sassy, sharp, and quick.

Our table was stocked with all the basics--syrup, sugars, salt/pepper, ketchup and frank's. 

Our meal was stick to your ribs diner grub done right.  Drool worthy hollandaise sauce, perfect poached eggs, loads of avocado on my benedict, russet home fries with the skins still on, and the most divine lemon ricotta pancakes to ever touch this tongue.

Strong, black coffee.  Cheap prices.  I just can't get over this place.

Thanks for making my Cleveland trip so magical."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You won't get a better tasting breakfast or brunch in Cleveland. Plus, it's a great value! Try the lemon ricotta pancakes. They're awesome! If you do order pancakes, be aware, they're huge! A short stack will likely last you two meals. 
The decor is simple, tables small and tight. It's always busy and full of locals and regulars. These are all sure signs of a great local spot. Don't think twice, just go there!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! The price was right, and the meal (breakfast special) was excellent. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely be grabbing another meal here."}
{"text":"I SO wanted to like this place. Reviews are ecstatic about this special brunch location, the wait times were long, and the wall is lined with myriad awards and honors.

My boyfriend and I ordered:
-- Huevos pan de maíz (eggs poached on cornbread with Andouille sausage, spicy chipotle sauce and home fries): The sausage tasted dry, was missing flavor, and didn't have the quality taste in other sausages I've tasted. The flavor of the dish did not have the unique seasoning and flavor the description suggested, and the cornbread was extremely dry. There was a hint of freezer burn taste, suggesting that the cornbread was previously frozen and reheated. The ingredients of the cornbread stood out individually, like mix that had separated, and the bread was falling apart and was barely lukewarm, missing the mark on the potential that could've been (cornbread with the freshly-just-out-of-the-oven finish).
-- Omelette with spinach, tomato, and sausage (originally bacon, which was substituted):  This may have been my mistake for switching bacon with sausage, but the eggs in the omelette were thick and slightly well done, and the overall omelette was very bland and missing flavor. I prefer to have my dishes ready to eat, without the need to add additional seasoning unless it is a personal preference. While the lack of any seasoning is a great thing for people with limited sodium diets, I had to add salt onto my omelette to try and kick up the flavor, which is rare for me, as I prefer blander dishes. Overall, the omelette just felt like a big ball of blah with each bite.
-- Lemon ricotta pancakes: What an extreme disappointment. Our batch must have been undercooked or something. It was soggy and our two pancakes stuck together. They were extremely mushy and missed the mark completely. I was near tears (yes, I am very passionate about food), having had such high hopes from the reviews and really looking for and craving a key pancake go to restaurant. I regret not asking for a new batch now, because re-reading the reviews, they must've really messed up our order. 
-- Home fries: Served with our entrees.. I am still trying to understand the intended taste of this side. Some pieces were slightly undercooked (too hard), others were mushy, and none had any unique seasoning or flavor. It felt like there was a missing attention to quality that could be here.

If indeed our pancakes were not prepared well, I would advise management to review the quality control standards and checks. Overall, it felt like the reheating of seemingly frozen cornbread (or at least, extremely poor prep of it), extremely bland omelette, undercooked home fries, and mushy pancakes should not have seen the light of day outside of the kitchen.

The restaurant also is quite packed, making it difficult to have a private and quieter conversation. It makes me wonder almost what the maximum occupancy is, given the tiny space and tight squeeze of all the chairs and tables next to each other.. though it is necessary, given the large amount of visitors. 

I will have to give the service a true two thumbs up- my boyfriend and I are extreme coffee drinkers, and she did not disappoint with our consistently refilled cups, and her ability to keep up with us. She also was very good at providing us with hot sauce and other necessary condiments to complement our dishes.

The reviews here are truly great for this restaurant, and I was told later that we were sitting next to a celebrity of the food world- so this place must have missed the mark on our visit... right? I left the restaurant with a feeling of unrest (probably from drinking too much coffee to wash down the taste) .. I really wanted to like this restaurant. When I gather the courage, fingers crossed the quality control will improve .. I need to try this place again .."}
{"text":"The Inn on Coventry has been a staple in my life for the past 4 years I've been in Cleveland. You'll feel right at home in this family run place no matter where you are from. Don't be alarmed if they tell you there is a wait, the line on the weekends move fast and are well worth the wait. All their pancakes are fantastic but if you haven't yet you must try their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. No need for syrup, and always cooked to perfection. If you're in the mood for something more savory the Croissant Sisterhood (eggs and smoked salmon on a warm croissant topped with Hollandaise) and the Irish Benedict (think eggs Benedict but with homemade corn beef hash) are delectable. And a huge secret? If you get the quiche or the crepe always go with fruit and a muffin instead of homefries, the muffins are made fresh everyday and are amazing."}
{"text":"i am madly in love with this place. when i am away from the CLE, i crave it. actually, when i am in the CLE i crave it. its just that good. they get busy on the weekends so big groups probably aren't the best (its small) and either get there early or be prepared to wait patiently. trust me it's worth it! the eggs mando, a version of eggs benedict w/avocado are awesome. and their pancakes...omg... get the lemon ricotta or the mango sour cream. the huevos rancheros were awesome. basically, you can't go wrong as long as you are ordering off their menu!"}
{"text":"I hate to only give 3 stars bc the food was actually really good. I got the ricotta and lemon pancake and the corned beef hash with hard over eggs and home fries. The only bad part about my meal was that I asked for a side of avocado and they brought me back a completely brown one, sat it on the table and said \"that's the best one they have\". I wasn't asked if it was ok or not, just \"here\". But I take away two stars for the waitress that we had. Her attitude was very poor. When we first sat it took quite a while to even order drinks, which all I ordered was a cranberry juice that didn't come out until a minute before the food.. And when we were done eating she walked past our table about 7 times before she brought the check. It just seemed as though everyone around us received much more prompt service than we did. I would get food again, but onlyu takeout during the week seeing as though they don't do carry out on weekends."}
{"text":"Great service.  Get there before 10a on weekends to avoid crowds.  Get the ricotta pancakes.  Trust me.  The reviews don't lie.  Loved my eggs Benedict.   They have a few versions.  I got the corned beef hash.   Also a nice variety of pancakes."}
{"text":"This morning's meal was acceptable, but not awesome.  I asked for the fruit side instead of the hash browns, and received a huge slice of melon, which seemed bizarre.  There was only one waitress on duty in the morning, and the poor thing had a busy restaurant to deal with - I didn't want coffee, she didn't ask for my drink order, and I forgot about it until later.  Oh, well.

The omelette (sausage and cheese) was fine - not the best, not the worst.

The ambience was seriously retro - classic dark brown coffee cups, music from the 60's and 70's - I can't remember the last time I heard The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, but ... I could have stood a few more years in between.

If you need breakfast and you're in Coventry... might as well."}
{"text":"great food cool atmosphere, heard the eggs Benedict were popular and its no secret why. my and i really enjoyed our meals, and we both left satisfied."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever! The lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing. You don't even need the maple syrup, but it just makes it even better."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was on point.  The place is dated looking."}
{"text":"have no idea why people are so in love with this place .. I am obviously missing something .. but is it the poor service (they rush you out of this place) .. the mediocre food? .. the long wait for poor service + mediocre food? .. I won't be back .. ever .. waited forever to be seated .. the food was nothing special & the waitress was obviously \"tip hungry\" because she could not wait to rush us out the door & turn the table .. it was not like we were finished eating & loitering .. she kept insisting it was too much food & we needed a box .. WTF? .."}
{"text":"I was only in Cleveland for a weekend, but if I go back again I will be once again visiting the Inn on Coventry.

Good service and good food.

We arrived around 1130 for brunch and had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated but it was worth the wait.

The lemon ricotta pancakes are just absolutely wonderful.  I also tried the whole wheat orange pancake. It was good as well but it just doesn't compare to the lemon ricotta pancakes.  Also had poached eggs on a crab cake with hollandaise sauce.  Another tasty dish.  However the lemon ricotta pancakes hit it out the park.  I totally see what all the rave is about.

This is a college area but you can still find some families or young couples dining here.  This was the last place I dined before leaving Cleveland and I'm so happy I found this place via Yelp."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch is a rare meal for the typical graduate student.  I can count on two hands the number of times I have gone out for brunch in the last few years.  So when I was asked to pick a place to go for brunch, I didn't really know where to go.   At first, I wasn't sure what to think of a restaurant branded by fellow Yelpers as a place with \"good food for people looking for a hangover cure.\"

I have to say that the food is really amazing here even if you've been sober for the past 24 hours.  The line was out the door when I came here, but it moved fairly quickly.  Very few restaurants offer the variety of pancakes that Inn on Coventry serves.   I ordered an apple cinnamon pancake and a pumpkin pancake.  The apple cinnamon pancake had nice large chunks of apple and the pumpkin pancake was delicious.  Reading that the corned beef hash was freshly made, I ordered a side of that as well.  It was really good.

So is this a good place to go to cure a hangover?  Probably.  And if you want to leave your brunch buzzed, cocktails are served after 11.   Beyond pancakes the menu is huge.  When someone asks me to go for brunch again in 6 months, Inn of Coventry will be on my list of suggestions."}
{"text":"This little place was an amazing breakfast spot. Warm, friendly staff and servers. Looks like it's stuck in a different era but in a good way. Coffee kept flowing. Ordered original eggs Benedict with the potatoes. The English muffin was just right. The poached egg was cooked perfectly! Share the lemon ricotta pancake which melts in your mouth. It sounded strange but you have to try it!!"}
{"text":"After finding this place on Yelp my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  A nice  family owned feel with some tasty food.  I had Googled best breakfast near Case Western and this place popped up.  We weren't disappointed.  I had the Maryland Crab Cake Eggs Benedict while my daughter enjoyed the Turkey Eggs Benedict.  

The food was delicious, the coffee very good and the service friendly.  If you are in the area and looking for a place for a good breakfast this would a restaurant I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch scene was rather chaotic waiting line. Seems to be popular in the Coventry neighborhood probably due to the pricing and unique entrees (chicken liver something for brunch; didn't try that!) The vegetable omelette was OK. The coffee was terrible; watery!"}
{"text":"1st meal after landing and oh i loved it!

took a red-eye flight to town for my bro's graduation so we were there pretty early before 9am and there was no line YET! food was good (LOVED the egg benedict), server was nice... didn't have to ask for coffee refills cus she made sure all our cups were full at all times... had to went to the restroom and as i walked towards the back of the restaurant it got REAL warm... perhaps it's where the kitchen or the heater was... anyways, was so glad that we were seated in the front area nearby the window!

love the surroundings too! such a nice area... definitely recommend if you are closeby and would like to have some real nice home-made breakfast at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Very upset by the service we received this morning. We were seated and then asked to move our table, move my purse, move my child so that the waitress staff could fit in behind us. We NEVER should have been sat at this table if there simply was not room, we would have readily waited a few minutes longer. I was appalled at how the waitress literally moved our table out of the way and told me to remove my purse from my chair and place it on the ground because it was in her way. The owner/manager came to our table later and offered our son a coloring page, but at this point I was over it and there was never a formal apology made. The food is good, but not good enough to return. Definitely not a kid friendly environment."}
{"text":"This place had an awesome breakfast that was super comforting and warm and delicious. I got the corned beef hash and it was amazing!!!! Definitely worth checking out for breakfast. It was a bit of a wait but not too bad. The pancakes were also really delicious"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast or Sunday brunch. Expect it to be crowded with very little table space. Only wished the servers would be a little nicer. Overall alright."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent! The brunch menu is extensive! There is something for everyone. The potatoes are fantastic. My dining partner and I each had an omelette, they were cooked perfectly, and LOADED with the items the menu promised! We dined at around 1 on a Sunday afternoon, it was crowded, but the wait was only 15 minutes and the staff moved quickly, without making you feel rushed. We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years and have recommended it to many people but we will not be back.  They have always been independent and have turned us away because they decide to close early.  Today, during a long holiday weekend, we arrived at 1:45 and it takes us over half hour to get there.  Once again we were turned away as the waitress said \"we close at 2:00\".  When I said it was not 2:00 yet and we did not live close by, the waitress got the manager(?) Who said they were closing early because the kitchen was \"really hot\"!  I guess they don't need our business.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I forget exactly how many \"Cleveland's Best Breakfast\" plaques hang on the walls of the Inn on Coventry but its more than just a few. Arrive late on any Saturday and Sunday and you'll see why this place is around when other places are closing up.

The Inn serves amazingly good and hearty breakfasts. They have a couple of signature dishes (Croissant Sisterhood is my fav) along with the typical make-your-own-breakfast method.

Don't be put off by the slightly outdated decor and well-worn tables and chairs. Think of these as beauty marks that show character and longevity.

Stop by on Sunday, I'll raise a up of coffee your way when I see you!"}
{"text":"An old friend brought me here from Lakewood one morning, telling me \"they have the BEST breakfast\". Assuming he was right, I went along.. especially since there are so many places in Lakewood that serve breakfast but we were driving 25 mins away, he must not be exaggerating.

HE WASN'T!!!

Since that day, I have been back at least 30 times. The pancakes are HUGE, sweet and unlike any pancake you'll see anywhere else. My favorite side (if you could call it that because it's bigger than the plate) is the peanut butter pancake. Make sure you get some milk with it! My favorite meal is the Chorizo Scramble. Peppers, cheese, eggs, chorizo, sour cream.. Yum! 

This is your warning: if you go on a Sunday morning or for brunch, it WILL BE busy. You might have to wait for a little bit. But that's a good sign, right? It's busy because everyone loves it! It's a small place as well, like really small & I wouldn't recommend groups larger than 6 going here unless you can be split up."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches we have had in a very long time. I ordered one of the specials of the day a crepe stuffed with artichokes, spinach, and avocado in an Asiago cream sauce. WOW!!! I could barely stop and breathe bc every bite of this savory crepe was fabulous. The crepe was cooked perfectly, it was light an airy, the filling was cheesy and packed with so much flavor from the delicious fillings. The potatoes that came along side the crepes were also cooked to perfection and super tasty. It was so inexpensive and was a big portion, I could barely take two bites out of the second crepe. My fiancé ordered the Irish Benedict and it was also amazing. The corned beef was flavorful without tasting too pork like and with two large of pieces of corned beef. It was shaved, light yet filling and the poached eggs also cooked to perfection. His was also a good size and price. The only bad thing is this place is always busy, a smaller group is more likely to get seated before a larger group, but their was a constant flow of people and it didn't seem like people waited way too long, although it's likely you could. We waited for 10 minutes but it would have been worth a longer wait! A must brunch spot, bc we've been to some of the best places in Cleveland for brunch and this place was the best!"}
{"text":"First time we ever ate here was when we didn't even live in OH yet. We were apartment hunting in the dead of winter and stopped in for brunch and to thaw out. I ordered the egg sandwich. Good story: the egg was kinda runny and when I bit into it, the molten egg yolk squished out all over me! Seriously, my hat, hair, shirt, pants, everything had liquid egg on it.  Had this place not been so good, I may have been left with a bad memory. Instead, it's a funny story and I remember the rest of my egg sandwich being really tasty! 

Thank God this place exists. If it didn't, it would leave the Heights with practically zero decent breakfast options. I love hitting Tremont or Lakewood for awesome AM food as much as anyone, but sometimes it's nice to stay closer to home. 

The Inn on Coventry is a nice little breakfast nook tucked into the corner of Euclid Hts. and Coventry. They serve solid standard breakfast and lunch fare. Good specials, good coffee. Nice homey feel to the place. Highly recommended for breakfast in the Heights. Just watch out if you order the egg sandwich."}
{"text":"A last brunch is way more important than a last supper, and the Inn on Coventry proved to be a perfect pick for my last brunch in CLE (at least for now).  

After parking (free on Sundays!) I headed in and was greeted immediately by the hostess.  There were several tables available, and she was kind enough to let me choose one of the 2-toppers by the front window.  Just because I'm eating alone doesn't mean I have to be relegated to a cramped table in the back :)  

I already knew I wanted something that included both eggs and home fried potatoes, and I was trying to decide between several omelets and eggs benedict.  I usually try and make healthy choices when I visit brunch places (egg white omelets, low-carb, or splitting with friends), but today was a day for gluttony.  In addition to the everyday menu, they also had a menu specific to today with what they were offering.  After a little waffling and asking the waitress for recommendations, I decided on the Eggs Benedict.  

I was not disappointed (see the \"before\" and \"after\" pictures I added for this visit).  Everything was the perfect temperature when it arrived, and I quickly dug in.  The creamy tang of the Hollandaise sauce, paired with a salty slice of Canadian bacon and the crunchy goodness of the toasted English Muffin below made for one tasty bite!  A few times I was even able to cram some home fried potatoes onto a single fork when I went for a mouthful, which just made it even more delicious.  

The waitress was super-efficient, refilling my water in a timely manner, and bringing my check right as I finished my last taste of omelet.  If you're looking for a solid brunch spot on the East Side that warms both the soul and the stomach, give Inn on Coventry a gander!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. All I can say is this is THE PLACE to go for a great ass breakfast (excuse my French). Absolutely everything we had was delicious! The downside to this place is the wait if you go on a busy day, we came on a Sunday after church so of course wait time was about an hour but oh sooo soooo worth it. Hash browns? Uh yes. Biscuits and gravy? Oh hell yes! Really some of the best I've had, I can't stress this enough. We also tried the ricotta pancakes which are huge!! I couldn't even finish the whole thing. Needless to say I left with a very very happy tummy :-)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this locally owned restaurant for brunch ever since I've moved here and I love it. Its not the healthiest breakfast ever, but its 100% better than a greasy diner. My favorites are the eggs mando (Benedict with avacado), the huevos pan de Mais (cornbread and sausage), and the huevos rancheros with a side of chorizo.  They all come with home fries, but I prefer the grits. 
The pancakes are also deliciousss. 
The service here is always hit or miss which is the only reason it doesn't get a 5. Some of the servers are a little testy and I'm scared to upset them with extraneous requests.  Maybe that's the charm of the place? I'm frequently reminded of that scary kindergarten teacher everyone respects and is scared of at the same time. The food is obviously good enough to keep me coming back though. The one thing that is super annoying is that they won't seat you until your whole party is there, even when the place is empty. 

Haven't tried the lunch menu yet, but haven't been able to tear myself away from the bfast menu!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the bad...  it is loud and crowded on the weekends.  Thats it!

Now on to all that goodness...  This place is a hidden gem!  They serve lovely breakfasts and brunches at Denny's/IHOP/Bob Evans prices.  It isn't a fancy place, as the name might suggest.  Think of the decor as more like a locally owned, more historical Denny's and you are good.  But again they are NOT serving up Denny's food!

What they are serving up is awesome breakfasts.  I LOVE their Eggs Benedict and they are always cooked to perfection.  I have tried them many ways, and love them all, save one.  The Maryland Crabcake Eggs Benedict just does not work for me.  But I am very finicky about crabcakes.  My hubs gets their Huevos Rancheros and I believe a Breakfast Burrito.  He very much enjoys them both, which is a rarity, as he doesn't really like breakfast. 

I really like to bring out of towners here. I love that they are accommodating to my in-laws ever changing dietary needs.  You need an Eggwhite Omelet with a side of tomatoes and fruit - no problem.

Ok, you have read it in the other reviews, but it is worth another mention... the Lemon Ricotta Pancake.  You have to try it!  They are light, very moist, almost undercooked.  Delicate lemon, without being overpowering.  Not super sweet either.  I have tried to recreate this dish many times and haven't come close.  I even make my own ricotta cheese.  Just buy one, split it with the table and see what I mean.

As far as service goes, these hardworking, often older, ladies are busy and it shows.  You might get some nice small talk out of them, but really they are doing their job and not kissing your ass.  It might take a little longer than expected to get in your order, but once in, it will come out pretty quickly.  Coffee (which is ok) is flowing and you will always be refilled.  It can be curt service, but never rude.  They are just trying to get people in and out.

All in all, this place has lovely breakfasts, at a great price point.  If my hubs is actually willing to brave the crowds to eat here that also says something.  It makes me so pleased to have a place like this in the Heights,"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Good breakfast. Nice service. Too cramped and not good for private conversations."}
{"text":"The best place to cure your hangover. I'm not even kidding, I come here every single time I'm hung over. The pancakes are absolutely heavenly, I've had lemon ricotta, pumpkin, peanut butter choco chip, and choco chip. None have disappointed. This place is perfect for a comforting brunch experience.

The atmosphere is so cozy, I feel like I'm at grandma's house! The wooden tables and small space just go to show how they aren't trying to be something they're not. The servers are cute little old ladies that are always friendly and smiling.

It took me a long time to eventually go here--this place can get overlooked by its small entrance and it might be overshadowed by other brunch/lunch places on Coventry, but the Inn is totally worth a try! I always try to go here when I'm home!"}
{"text":"Love the Reese cups pancakes....GO TRY THEM
My first time here & I really enjoyed the food I started eating the food before I took the picture it was that good everyone was so friendly the waitress was so nice you have to try it."}
{"text":"Usually good lemon ricotta pancakes, but on Sunday morning 11/6 the pancakes were very running and doughy. I asked for them to recook them and they did and the outside was burnt. So I'm thinking they got a new cook or they were just cooking them really fast. Then as we checked out, my boyfriend's card was swiped twice because the lady didn't think he had the money on his card. Very disappointed in them because I really like their food!!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, cute Cafe vibe. Nice location. Tasty food. I would highly recommend, just note, it was super loud. The place was filled and that is a testament to how good the place is!"}
{"text":"Great sunday brunch! Super crowded so getting to the table was a challenge, but service was very nice! definitely felt homey! Food was very comforting!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. Why???? Awesome food lemon ricotta pancake is my favorite breakfast app. I don't typically order appetizers for breakfast only at Inn on Coventry. Service no matter how busy is always good however Sundays I can't have my pancakes as an app. Their way to busy. My eggs always cooked perfect that's poached soft if your a breakfast expert you'll know poached in a restaurant can be tricky. All in all still a favorite place to start the day."}
{"text":"I love this place. First, they have the best possible omelette, the one with monterey jack and avocado. Conceptually the #1 omelette ever. The home fries are just so food-like -- just regular, imperfect, delicious food -- that I adore them. But even more, well, ALMOST more than the omelette, I love this place because of the no-nonsense service. When I come in alone, they are the ultimate efficient servers, letting me read and do my thing while still making sure my meal goes well. Kudos to the staff for striking an elegant balance between functionality and warmth."}
{"text":"It's like your grandma opened a diner in her knotty pine home except your grandma was the best Benedict maker in history.  Seriously, the hollandaise here is like cocaine for poached eggs.  Super delicious breakfasts!!! The Irish Benedict is my favorite offering but really all the eggs Benedict are top notch.  The service is super quick and friendly and your coffee cup is never even half empty.  Definitely my favorite place to grab breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"We went to the Inn on Coventry around 1pm on Sunday for lunch/brunch. The place was pretty crowded, and we had a 10-15 min wait before getting seated. It's like a typical brunch place, with omelettes, pancakes, eggs benedict etc. They have a lot of items on the menu. The prices are pretty typical for brunch places- around $8-12 for each item (before tax/tip)

I got the inn egg Muffin with homefries and it was good.

The service was good and pretty quick."}
{"text":"The best breakfast food I've had in Cleveland so far. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent. Their service has been great. The space is a little tight but it makes it possible to have a conversation with others.

The Egg Benedict was awesome. It comes with home fries (basically baked potatoes - not the average french fry). There are other versions of their benedicts that are great as well. The egg mando is an egg benedict with avocado; their irish bene and crabcake bene are delicious as well.

Lemon Ricotta Pancake - i always try to order a different dish every time I come to this restaurant. This pancake is the exception. I normally don't enjoy pancakes all that much but this is a perfect combination of pancake mix + ricotta + a hint of lemon. A must try."}
{"text":"Service is fast and accommodating and they have the best pancakes I've had in Cleveland. The peanut butter cup pancakes are perfect- fluffy with a good mix of chocolate and peanut butter. The lemon ricotta pancakes were light and slightly tart with a sweetness that made me want more, they describe it as tasting like a lemon cheesecake and it really does!! I can't wait to go back here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"So I would have liked to have actually rated the place; however, after a bit of a drive, we showed up to a sign in the window saying they were closed for vacation July 1st - 6th. I had just been on their website shortly before I left - no mention of this, nor does it say anything on their FB page - in fact, the FB says they are open. Maybe Inn on Coventry only caters to locals who would know they were closed but I am disappointed in the lack of communication."}
{"text":"Such a friendly atmosphere and a great breakfast spot. We walked in and there was a decent wait list however we were seated within 15 minutes! I had the vegetarian Eggs Benedict with avocado and a berrycrunch pancake. Good food, great service, and a super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and also ordered takeout from here multiple times, and the food is phenomenal. However, I called this morning to order takeout and they said they were too busy to handle takeout orders. Really. First time I've ever heard of a restaurant not taking orders. You would think they would want the extra business."}
{"text":"The Inn is one of my favorite breakfast locations.  It's small but kind of like hanging out in grandma's breakfast nook.  The food is excellent.  Breakfast food is pretty standard fare, but they do it well.  They tend to have some pretty enticing specials.  

The prices are good and the hostess is a sassy older lady.  I like that.

FYI If you are dining with a group, they will not seat you unless all the members of your party are there.  Just be aware."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. I loved my eggs benedict w/ Maryland crab-cake. It went down very smoothly with the mild, but smooth coffee. I had great experience here.

To note, I waited about 15\" to sit on a Sunday around 12:30pm, and the food took some time to come. I was in a mood to enjoy anyway, so I had a great time."}
{"text":"We returned for breakfast on Sunday morning. It was busy, but we were seated immediately. I ordered 2 side eggs and a side order of bacon; my husband got the 3 stack of buttermilk pancakes and we shared our food. The pancakes were light, fluffy and delicious. Our eggs and bacon were all cooked perfectly. It was the perfect amount of food for the both of us. Got out of there with a $9 tab! You can't beat the Inn On Coventry!"}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast or lunch.  They serve breakfast all day so I can basically have biscuits and gravy whenever I want here.

They have all sorts of breakfast foods on their menu, eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage, omelets, and really most of the regular things you'd have for breakfast and then some.

The Inn has a great location and is close to so much stuff on Coventry.  There are always tons of people around and it's a pretty popular place."}
{"text":"Not bad for brunch. Bf, me and two friends came here for brunch on a Saturday morning earlier in January. There were a lot of people at the doorway, but the wait for a table of 4 was surprisingly not TOO long (20 min). 

I had been wanting to come here forever based on the other reviews raving about the eggs benedict and the lemon ricotta pancakes. I ordered the eggs benedict with crab cakes, bf ordered regular eggs benedict and sausage patties on the side. Don't remember what our friends ordered, but we split a stack of lemon ricotta pancakes. Friends asked for coffee, and the waitress started pouring coffee for everyone. Bf said he didn't want coffee, and the waitress took the poured coffee from his cup and poured it back into the main pot... that move struck us as odd and sort of like... potentially not sanitary even?? We also ordered a large glass of orange juice, which ended up looking very small, and very expensive for how small the glass was (I think 3.99). Food comes... eggs benedict are quite tasty. I enjoyed the crab cakes in mine. Sausage patties were unfortunately small, considering that they were pretty expensive for how small they were. The most disappointing was the lemon ricotta pancakes. Didn't taste the lemon. Seemed soggy and flavorless with some weird soapy taste mixed in. Even with syrup and butter, they did not live up to the other reviews on Yelp. I guess pancakes are just not for me."}
{"text":"haha it's funny how i have never felt so strongly about this place. Maybe it's cuz of their service.. So this place is usually pretty crowded - I attributed it to the fact that this is the only up to par breakfast place in cleveland heights so people just naturally come here. But honestly, i was never wow'd by breakfast food cuz they are all pretty similar to me. The wait is usually not that long, but the service is usually not that great either. For the past multiple times I was there, especially on weekend mornings, the waitresses were so busy that no one came to fill my water cup AT ALL. Like i had to chew on my ice in the end. They also dropped the bill on you when you are not even done eating, then take your plates away as soon as you are done. If you sit there for 15 min or so just chatting, they will eventually come get you and kindly ask you to get out - of course they don't say it directly like that. This is prob also why the wait was never too terribly long. It's a double edged sword - you dont need to wait as long but you definitely will feel rushed and not getting well taken care of when dining there.

Food wise: I enjoyed the egg benedicts. I also liked their corn beef hash - it could be a little salty sometimes. I also tried the crepe of the day today - it was chicken and spinach. I thought that it was way too cheesy and not enough spinach in them. Their muffin was good though. Overall, a cheap, quick place to go for breakfast, if you don't care as much about the dining atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp. Excellent choice. I had the sour cream mango pancakes, feta omelette w tomatoes and olives, turkey sausage, and grits. My grits were lack luster and my sausage could have used a little more seasoning. On the other hand my mango pancakes and omelette were amazing!!!! The service was really good and we received our food really quick. I am really pleased with my experience. I'm not from Cleveland but if I ever come back I'd definitely consider this place."}
{"text":"Inn on Coventry is home to very dependably good inexpensive diner food. They have really good breakfast and brunch specials on the weekends!"}
{"text":"You're only hurting yourself by not dining at the Inn on Coventry.  Service is quick, and dishes are decently sized and priced. My personal favorites are Huevos Rancheros, lemon ricotta pancakes (you have to try at least one) and any of the Benedict dishes. The Bloody Mary mix is very fresh, and fairly priced. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for a table on the weekends because the dining room is fairly small. Service is average but efficient. Can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"My missus had the 'croissant sisterhood', I had the corned beef hash.. both were stellar.  We drove here from Detroit directly, so we were all very hungry and we were pleased with everything about the restaurant.  The hash browns are why I am giving 'Inn' 5 stars, best I can recollect having.  The 2nd best is now Smith & Wollensky.   The neighborhood is really cool and it was fun to walk around after having a very enjoyable breakfast.  Places like this are why I like traveling. Definitely worth a detour."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here today. Peanut butter chip pancakes were to die for. Arrived at 8:45 AM and was seated immediately. By 10 a.m., long line out the door.  Great service. Fun place. Great food"}
{"text":"Love the food after visiting my first time today. Delicious and fresh with wonderful portion sizes. You will leave stuffed! Definitely will be a favorite for brunch when I come in town to visit family."}
{"text":"This is for the person who left a comment that I only review negatively. Not so, Yelp reader.

This morning, I set off to go to the Inn on Coventry. Friday 10 AM. No crowds in Coventry so I can't complain at all about wait time. I was seated immediately by a very welcoming lady at the cash register. I had already perused the menu online from home so knew what I wanted. Not being very hungry, I ordered the Inn Egg Sandwich, a side of hashbrowns and as I was a first-timer, a single, obligatory lemon-ricotta pancake. 

Let me tell you, the first few bites of the pancake nearly made me forget everything else I ordered. Without syrup, delicious. With a very light drizzle of syrup, even better. They have almost an eggy, custard-like consistency which I loved. The lemon is just enough and most importantly  it is REAL lemon, not omg tastes like furniture polish. Summarily, if you go for nothing more than the pancake - go. Next time I'm planning to get it with blueberries  :)

The egg sandwich - maybe the thing I liked best is the English muffin was grilled and buttery, like it had seen a few minutes on the flattop. The Canadian bacon looked real too, and by that I mean cut from a bigger hunk of meat and not just a McPortion of something that may or may not be Canadian meat of some kind. It was good and salty which was a great counter-balance to the sweet, desert texture of the pancake ... the pancake ... oh I could write poetry about the way it lay there patiently, almost smiling at me with the knowledge of it's own irresistible nature. 

The hashbrowns were also tasty and real; cut up potato pieces of all sizes and shapes, not just hello frozen out of a GFS bag. They were very crispy, well-cooked. Some may have thought them too cooked, but I actually like them that way. Next time I'll ask for onions in them to make them even better. 

Service was friendly and prompt. If I had to knock anything it would be that I personally would love bigger coffee mugs, like the 2-cups worth that I'm used to having at home. It would be great to see odd cups styles but yes, bigger cups and not standard 5 oz restaurant cups. Early in the morning, that java goes down fast, y'hear? 

My server confirmed that they are only open until 2 pm weekdays, so I'm definitely going to invite the lemon lover in my life and treat him to what I know will be a definite regular on my list of go-to restaurants in the Coventry-University Circle area."}
{"text":"Very tasty breakfast. Not the nicest decor - kind of a divey diner."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch today while passing thru Cleveland. Service was friendly and prompt and the food was excellent. We enjoyed eggs Benedict and a peanut butter chip pancake on the side and it was exactly what we wanted, the hollandaise sauce was the best we've ever had.

Pro tip: bring some quarters for street parking."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot on the east side. To be honest, the only thing I've ever tried is the Irish Benedict. Maybe I'm a creature of habit, but I can't bring myself to order anything else. This spot is greasy spoon for sure and super old school. The staff  is laid back and friendly. There is usually a line out the door (a great sign of a quality restaurant). However, they cycle through tables pretty quickly. For the cost and taste, you can beat the Inn."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Benedict on rye with no hash brown  and upgraded to a salad instead. The eggs where cooked amazingly, no question about it. My mom ordered an avocado omelet which wasn't out of this world but again well cooked. The hashbrowns are a little heavy but not overly greasy and not seasoned (always appreciated, im not a fan of over salted potatoes). My dad ordered the huevos rancheros which he really liked as well. We all shared one 8 inch blueberry crunch pancakes (blueberries and granola). They were fluffy, delicious, not overly processed and well cooked. 

The servers are all very attentive and friendly. I appreciated that they suggested a few items at the beginning and only came over twice during our meal (which was about 45minutes). 

Overall a great place, i would definitely recommend and I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I am visiting from Los Angeles and was looking for breakfast. This place has good food and a friendly staff although it's small and cen get busy."}
{"text":"People are always writing \"I came here with my girlfriend/boyfriend\" etc and whatnot in their reviews on Yelp. I avoid using this distinction because that can change like the weather and then you have a slew of reviews you will have to correct to past tense. I will sometimes mention if I am with my Ace Boon Coon Steve L. because enshallah we will be breaking bread for years to come. I came here with Steve L. It was packed as warned by Yelp reviewers. The breakfast was excellent. The staff was wonderful. As I would like to sing the Golden Girls theme \"Thank you for being a friend\" to my homie, it reminded me that the staff here reminded me of the Golden Girls themselves. I say that with nothing but love. The option to add a side of avocado is something that all spots should do."}
{"text":"After a search for \"best brunch places in cleveland\" I came across a list that included Peir W, Lucky's cafe, XYZ the tavern, the flying fig, etc.   The inn on conventry came up as \"honorable mention\".   While I haven't tried Peir W (yet), I've been to lucky's and the flying fig.  I completely understand why the Inn gets only honorable mention compared to these other places, it's not as classy, the dining tables don't come with table cloths, and you don't feel like the silverware is actually made of real silver. 
But for 1/3 or even 1/2 the bill and food that tastes like what grandma makes, who cares for snobbery?  

I've had the eggs benedict and their \"no carb bennie\" (eggs benedict with artichoke and portabella mushroom instead of english muffin) and both times the eggs were poached to perfection with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce.  The service was pretty casual as was the dining environment.  We got our food pretty fast and it was overall a very pleasant experience.  So go for the delicious food, no mess, no fuss."}
{"text":"We stopped by Inn on Coventry for an early breakfast during a long weekend in Cleveland. The paneling, dark vinyl chairs and fake-wood tables - diner all the way. Great coffee, solid food, diner hospitality. We were in and out quickly, but we did not feel rushed. There was a line forming by the time we left, so get here early or be prepared to wait a little. Also, they're only open until 2-3pm, so don't wait too long or you'll be out of luck (and lunch)."}
{"text":"Eating here kind of feels like you're having brunch on an ERJ regional jet. The seats are closer together than any other restaurant I've been in. While sitting in a window seat (which does give quite a busy view) your head is literally right under the venetian - they use every available space to the max. Service is efficient from the kitchen and on the floor, but not overly friendly, and while the place was packed when we got there and there were 2 people ahead of us we were sat in fewer than 4 minutes. 

The menu is big and breakfast is served all day. I got the huevos rancheros. It was a big portion and the potatoes served with it were flavoured amazingly. Good coffee too, which was topped up several times without me asking. I'll definitely be back to try some other menu items - like the options involving chorizo. 

Our waitress didn't tell us, but you pay at the register on your way out. 

Also - high five to the hostess. When I walked in from the freezing cold and snow my glasses fogged up. She noticed when she was asking me how many people were in my party. When we sat down to wait she appeared in a few moments with a napkin for me to wipe my glasses with! She earned the restaurant their 5th star! Thanks whoever you were!!"}
{"text":"Regrettably, I will not be going back to Inn on Coventry?. For many years, despite the horrible service and rude staff, this restaurant was a staple of greasy but great Cleveland food but no longer. Today, not only did they get the orders wrong, give us bad service and rush us out of there, but the food was horrible. Not even on the level of a Bob Evans or Dennys.

Crepes were made from pancake batter, bacon tasted like re-heated, pre-cooked bacon you buy at the supermarket and the home friends were mushy and not crisp.

Thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"We hauled ass over here in the rain on a Friday AM last week based on the yelp reviews.  OMG such a fabulous place to have breakfast. The lemon ricotta pancakes were AMAZING. The Reese's pancake was AMAZING. We made our own omelets with bloody mary and mimosa to match. The service was awesome. The staff was amazing. It comes with large portions so if you want to try a pancake one will do - I ordered the short stack and it was too much with only 2....enjoy the place is rocking and we would totally go back. Only downside is street parking....plan ahead."}
{"text":"Although I had a 10-15 minute wait, which more times than not deters me and ill go elsewhere, I waited this time. Well worth it, Corn Beef hash was out of this world, had raisin toast and a side of Avocado. Glad I waited. Portions were definitely filling, my buddy was hungover and his meal replenished his energy without a doubt. The seating was that of a small breakfast establishment, just as you would suspect. I like the vibe it has because of this. By the way, its snowing for the first time as I am writing this, smh... Ive lost ambition to elaborate on my experience here. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Disappointing I had been wanting to try the inn for a while now and finally got to today. The service was poor. My pancake was undercooked. I could also tell it was cooked on the same griddle as the savory items because my supposedly lemon pancake tasted like peppers and onions. I had to ask for after my pancake came out. Over not a good experience."}
{"text":"The Inn on Coventry was great!  I visited for breakfast and loved the No-Carb Bennie (with a substitute of hash browns, they looked too good).  The food was excellent and the restaurant was very clean and had a pleasant environment."}
