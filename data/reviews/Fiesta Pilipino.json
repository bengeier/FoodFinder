{"text":"I love me a good Filipino bakery. And growing up in California, I was fortunate to be nearby several of them. Nothing like fresh hot pan de sal! So when I moved to the CDN area, I was pleasantly surprised to find out there was bakery just a few blocks from our apartment: Fiesta Pilipino. I do my laundry at the buanderie next door, which is always an opportunity to pay a visit!  Highlights: - During the warmer seasons, drop by for a frozen bubble tea. My favorite: Taro! (also known as \"ube\". It's purple). - Their siopao (chicken or pork steamed buns) are on point. They give it to you with a sauce which is like icing on the cake. - Make sure to ask them if they have fresh pan de sal (not the ones that are pre-packaged).  - They also have various desserts and pastries that are worth a try.  I do wish they served empanadas. That's probably my one gripe."}
{"text":"This is a pretty damn good Filipino bakery. They're stocked with an extensive pantry of fresh, dried and canned goods from the old country. If you're looking to cook an authentic Filipino meal I'm sure you'll find your ingredients here. I, on the other, frequent this bakery ever once in a while when I'm craving sweet delectable morsels with that beautiful warm Filipino flavour. The coconut buns are amazing indeed! The freshly shredded coconut filling is sweet, creamy and oh so tropical tasting - the bun component is always light and fluffy! They also have quite a tasty sweet red bean paste filled doughnut. Get a coffee and a coconut bun or a doughnut, sit down and listen to the sweet sounds of the Philippines. Perhaps the television is on and tuned to the proprietor's favourite Tagalog soap opera. Enjoy the authenticity."}
{"text":"I was not even aware there was a Pinoy/Filipino area in Montreal. Definitely a great surprise and now I have an awesome bakery for all my needs. Many of these items I grew up with having many friends from the Philippines. So hanging around their houses I was introduced to lots of Filipino food at family functions. Filipinos love to cook and they love to share their food! In the summers and for big events it was whole roasted pig (lechon),  kare-kare (oxtail in peanut butter) , pancit (their version of mixed-fried noodles in many forms my favourite  palabok), lumpia (Filipino spring rolls)  even diniguan (pork blood stew). I could keep going on and on but I'm not here to go on forever about how fantastic their food is!  For bakery items my faves were siopao buns (a Filipino version of the steamed Chinese char siu bao) and ensaymada - a very delicious sweet bun. Seriously people.....I was able to find a freaking amazing bakery that does two of my favourites. For siopao they have chicken and pork Asado. Fantastic for me to bring home and freeze and then bring them out and microwave for a minute to eat fresh and delicious! Their ensaymada are so light and fluffy and the butter and sugar coating is sinful. I did also see they also had some (Ube) purple yam filled desserts that I will have to try also. Filipinos are as crazy about their Ube as they are about halo-halo. Many other fantastic bakery items I picked up a dozen siopao and 4 sweet buns. Definitely I'll be back to sample other items. The siopao and ensaymada were both amazing.    Salamat at sa iyo para sa mga mabuting pagkain ako dumating muli!"}
