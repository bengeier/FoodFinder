{"text":"This place is great. The food is delicious and at a reasonable the price. The owner who seems to be the only person running the store is very friendly and always courteous."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fresh, delicious, well-made sandwich, this is the place to go! I've tried a couple of their sandwiches and have not been disappointed. My personal favorite is the Turkey Bacon Swiss. The pepperoni bread is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. They have really good burgers and fries. A bit of advice though, since Max and Erma's is out of business on route 8 and since we have lots of burger joints but no really good burger places, they need to advertise outside of their store windows. People crave a good burger."}
{"text":"Charming, hospitable - best grilled cheese sandwich ever! Wonderful baked goods by the owner. Highly recommend! Oh, I forgot to mention. Very reasonably priced too! You"}
{"text":"Really great deli food.  I wish they were open later!  If you like hot wings try the raspberry hot wings (I forget the name).  I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you order. The place is ALWAYS really clean & Keith is a nice guy. The Just 8 Deli is a great local business for lunch and catering."}
{"text":"Great stuff fantastic flavor totally local and fresh  eat here now!  I had the chicken Caesar wrap and my wife had the chicken feta wrap both perfect..."}
{"text":"Great food.  The Reuben and pasta salads are always good.  Always dies a great job catering our event."}
{"text":"This new deli uses fresh ingredients and lots of them.  The sandwiches are delicious and a good break from fast food.  Everything is made fresh exactly the way to want it."}
{"text":"Love Keith's food. His fish sandwiches are the best in the north hills. I have been coming to Keith for over 10 years. His food is the best!! Hands down, this guy can cook....he , and just 8 deli, are the best!!"}
{"text":"Not a fancy deli....reasonably priced and really great sandwiches.  I would absolutely suggest stopping here for lunch if you're not with a huge group.  Seating is limited to two small tables. They do a a lot of takeout business."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times now and the sandwiches are just average. The prices are reasonable. The french fries and homemade chips are usually terrible. The last time both fries and chip were so greasy you could have wrung them out. So greasy, but yet they looked burnt. Not even edible."}
{"text":"We grab lunch here at least once a week. It's fantastic. Huge selection. Keith is great and always very accommodating! Haven't had anything we didn't like from here."}
