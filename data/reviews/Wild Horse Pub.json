{"text":"Probably the worst waitress we have ever encountered at any establishment we have been to! No greeting, no thanks, no nothing.
This young lady absolutely hates her job and has no skills for this kind of work!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings (lime & chili), not overly spicy but definitely juicy. If you're into wings I would say these are good wings. Not overcooked and still juicy and then tossed in the flavour of your choice."}
{"text":"This is a mini cowboy saloon type of pub with horseshoes on the walls and country music blasting in the background. The atmosphere is laid back and the servers are friendly and casual. They dress like extras from Hee Haw with cut-off jeans, cowboy boots, and western shirts. A previous reviewer wrote that the servers are so friendly it seems like they're hitting on you. He's right. Of course, I'm irresistible anyway.

The menu is the usual: burgers, sandwiches, chicken fingers, etc. - all stuff that you would expect from a pub. I got the steak sandwich with fries which also came with onion rings. Did I I take a picture? No. You'll have to take my word that it was good.

I was here late on a Friday afternoon and there were only eight customers in the place including myself. I was greeted and seated right away. Some of the negative reviews talk about how busy it gets here in the evening and on weekends. I can only imagine how crazy that must be because this place isn't very big. It's just a small add-on in the casino.

Yee haw."}
{"text":"When I'm in Calgary, I stay near or at the Deerfoot Inn.  I've been told to avoid the Mohave Grill for being unremarkable. I may one day check it out just to ensure it gets a fair shake at the Yelp.

So for the Wild Horse Pub, I feel a fair review is definitely needed.

The service is usually really friendly (in fact one might think the servers were hitting on you, if you were naive.. lol).  Sometimes the establishment gets crazy busy though, and you're best to wait 10 mins and then move on, because you might be waiting a fair bit longer before anyone sees you.  I once waited 20 mins before I was formally greeted.  Normally this would piss me off and I'd never come back, but in some cases, a place like that just can't know when they're going to need to staff-up and be ready for it.

The food has been mostly above average.  Their burger will satisfy most burger enthusiasts.  I can say I've never walked out of that place still hungry."}
{"text":"My friends and I like to go dance here on the weekends and watch the band, which is great.  However the bartenders are the worst I have ever encountered.  Not only are they slow and rude, they are totally inexperienced.  We are excellent tippers so there is NO reason for these young girls to be so pathetic.  It's a shame you can't hire some decent bartenders.  You used to have a great gal who was friendly and efficient, you have really went downhill lately."}
