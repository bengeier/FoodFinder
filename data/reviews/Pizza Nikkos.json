{"text":"Their pizza is awesome. I come from laval-ouest so I had Alfa which is very similar to this place. I have to say though the reason why I put 4 stars and not 5 is because of their subs sauce is lacking. Its good but not awesome good. The pasta my wife loves it. I find they put to many spices in the meatballs which ruin the taste a little but I am picky when it comes to pasta. Guess its my Italian blood"}
{"text":"ESSAYER leur sauce à spaguetti (poutine,pizza et pâte) elle est excellante. Meilleur place qualité/prix pizzeria à l'île perrot. Le service est assez rapide. L'endroit est petit , peu acceuillir une vingtaine de personne. Pour la livraison c'est parfait !"}
{"text":"It is down the street from my grlfriends house. I have  been there 3 times already. I have had their all dressed Pizza and 2 different subs. The Best off the Island food along with Smoke Meat Pete's. This will become a weekly stop for me now."}
{"text":"Best pizza on ile Perrot and probably the west island too."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend trying their subs, pizza and poutine. In the area I'd have to say it's my favorite place to get a sub because they're always so good and worth the price. Delivery is always done in a reasonable amount of time and great service!"}
{"text":"Fermé"}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect from a typical pizza joint.  Made an order late before it closed asked them to call and not use the doorbell as my gf was sleeping.  Driver used the door bell woke up my gf who then stayed up with me to talk and ate half my poutine.  This order was placed for 1 not 2 and they fucked up my alone time.  Poor delivery good pizza joint."}
{"text":"By far the worst pizza I've ever ate (well we tried to eat some of it). It was so bad I gave the whole pizza to my dad who usually eats everything. Although he managed to garburate it, he himself told me it was one of the worst things he had ever eaten. The cheese felt like rubber, the sauce had an after taste, the dough was dry. On top of it all it was the most expensive pizza I've ever bought.

Never again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza I have ever had the misfortune of eating. I write this 5 am after a long night where our whole family got ill. This is first and last time I ever eat here. A total waste of money, as we threw the pizza out after one slice each, which we could not finish. Just one slice was enough to make my wife and I sick. Not sure most of the reviewers here ever had a good pizza, because based on reviews and scores it seems like these people need an intervention. Please save yourself multiple trips to toilet and avoid this restaurant"}
{"text":"I order a pizza from Nikkos almost every weekend. You can't go wrong. My favourite is the number 9. Fresh toppings and generous. One of my favourite pizza places in the West island if not my favourite.

Update: I have come to the conclusion that their #11 is my favourite.

I would give them 5 stars but I have not yet have eaten a 5 star meal and I have eaten great meals in Paris."}
{"text":"Superb food, especially the subs and the service is quite good. Globeater 
highly  recommends."}
{"text":"Best poutine ever!!! Great pizzas loaded with toppings. Everything (dough, pizza sauce, salad dressings) made in house and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"Found myself in the neighborhood and went in after consulting my bookmarks on the Yelp app.

- It's a small place with a few tables and a small counter with a huge sign on the wall where you can order a variety of pizzas and subs.

- We ordered two all dressed bambino pizzas and a poutine. The pizzas were decent, yet nothing special considering some grossly exaggerated previous reviews that claimed this place was 5 stars other than an unexpected spicy sauce. The poutine was equally decent but nothing special compared to some other places that offer poutine in a non-specialized environment (aka poutineville, banquise)

- The service was quick and efficient.

- The price tag was 24$ which I found slightly expensive for 2 bambino pizzas lunch specials and a poutine.

Would I go back? I didn't hate it but at that price tag and not using the place as a local delivery place I won't be back. However, I do suggest trying it out."}
{"text":"Awww ! C'est un vrai pizzeria avec ses sous-marins dans leur menu.  Très excellent en pizza et sous-marin. Je suis allé trois fois. C'est très recommandé !"}
{"text":"I would give it a 4.8... Just because the french fries are too thick. Lol. 

Nikkos was once my childhood favourite, Mercier pizza in Lasalle. When i began dating my boyfriend here on the west island..I was forever disappointed at their *idea*of pizza, myself being from the mecca of pizza...the Bronx!!

So...I relied on Yelp to lead me here..and guess what..the owner remembered me from the age of...15...to now at age 40. Imagine? 

Personal service(they now fawn all over my boyfriend. And im ok with that. 

Enough about that..gooey pizza and perfect crust. Prices are fair. Delivery quick...lucky to live in the area as eating in is very basic...but everyone talks to you and are all amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza is not bad full of cheese. Probably more cheese than anything else... Even bread. The poutine is average, was not a big fan of the fries. The service was great and delivery was very quick."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Pizza Nikkos all the time. I do not choose any other pizza place. They are very consistent with their delivery times, freshness of the food and very courteous over the phone. If you are in the area, drop in and try them out, it is worth it, or even call for delivery, you will not be disappointed. My only issue is they do not cut the pizza all the way through, you will need to do it yourself when you get your pizza delivered. It is not a big deal but it doesn't take much to have it properly cut before sending it out to the customers. Nevertheless awesome place."}
{"text":"Le choix de pizzarias de DDO et Pierrefonds est médiocre mais chez Nikkos, les pizzas sont vraiment bonnes!  Ce sont des pizzas de style traditionnel nord-américain, bien \"grasses\" ;-)   Garnitures (très) généreuses avec suffisamment de fromage (miam!)  - ce qui fait tellement défaut à toutes ces pizzarias du coin!  Les prix sont tout à fait raisonnables considérant la quantité de garniture!   Juste les frites qui sont un peu ordinaire, au moins, elles sont livrées encore chaudes!

Je n'ai jamais été sur place, j'ai troujours fait livré!"}
{"text":"The pizza is yummy. It's thick crusted and they don't hold back on toppings. It's a greasy spoon feel. Great to nurse a \"hangover \""}
{"text":"If you like the homemade style pizza with some authentic Greek flavor. This place cannot be beat.  All the ingredients are freshly made ( I know this because I used to there) and no where else have I tasted a poutine quite like theirs.  Nick & George are the best"}
