{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. Been coming here since I was a child. Huge portions for a great price. Excellent for take-out and very cozy if you want to stay in. They serve a few different beers and they have some mixed drinks available. They also have an awesome mix of Canadian & Chinese classics so it's perfect for everyone. 

Best. Chicken balls. Ever. Soooo crunchy. And their Shanghai Noodles are the best I've had."}
{"text":"Husband and I love the club house sandwiches. That's the only thing we order. Nice owners and the price is right."}
{"text":"Decent food with large portions. Delivery time was long but I attribute that to a busy night. Three stars for \"not too greasy, inexpensive\" Chinese food. If I hadn't found out about Seaspray in The Beaches, I'd still order from them."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Sandy's today. Nice big selection at great prices - meals include a drink. Food was fresh and healthy. Batter on chicken was crispy and light. Restaurant is clean as a whistle!"}
{"text":"This place is a great option for decent food at a cheap price.  They sell both Chinese and Canadian dishes but to be honest I've only had the chinese.   The portions are big and the service is friendly.

The neighbourhood leaves a little to be desired but the restaurant is a 2 minute walk from the subway and it's one of the better option for lunch in the area.  I recommend the #116."}
{"text":"A Chinese Canadian restaurant? THAT I had to see, heh! I checked in today. Green pass from health Canada, that`s good enough for a test, and I was hungry. The place is bright and clean, lots of teens from a nearby school come by for a snack, poutine or whatever. It is run like a take out-place with some tables in the foreground. It is operated by a sort of squirrely couple, not unfriendly, but shuffling around quite a bit. They dont accept cards which is strange for a restaurant on the Danforth. Oh well.

I had the beef on rice with spicy sauce and black beans. It was a quick lunch grab and I did not expect much, but I thought it was decent. Not great but decent. The vegetables were crunchy, the beef alright and the rice fluffy. It is certainly a far cry from some greater other Chinese restaurants, but passable considering far worse places and the great value ($5.99 for a lunch main!). 

Worth a try! Bring cash though, no card machine available."}
{"text":"I really do love this place.

Affordable, large portions, solid variety and the staff is incredibly nice.

I don't know if it's the BEST, but it's consistently good and I keep going back for more :)!"}
{"text":"Great hidden spot for Chinese food!  The food is consistently excellent and the service is always excellent.  The hostess Sandy is the sweetest person you'll ever meet and the restaurant has the personalized service of a small family run business.  The shrimp dishes are my favourite - shrimp chop suey, shrimp w mixed vegetables, and salt and pepper shrimp in particular.  I also like the chicken wings and items like the homemade chicken noodle soup.  I would highly recommend Sandy's for Chinese!"}
{"text":"I ordered General Tao chicken, and it wasn't crispy and lacked flavour. I had to call the restaurant because delivery was taking a long time. Had heard good things about Sandy's, but I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here we just stopped in to pick up some food for my friends daughter who is a fan."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I'll definitely be back! The portions are big and the food is tasty. Glad to have found a great neighbourhood spot for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great little joint. Almost Perfect variety great service really good food.
I dunno why I don't give five stars a little greasy and not super decor. Great"}
{"text":"so it's been a few years since I first reviewed Sandy's.  We keep on going back. Not frequently but regularly.  I love the bbq pork fried rice.  Huge portion of comfort food.  Makes me happy.  Kind of a funny crowd sometimes and I wonder what goes in those coffee cups when they disappear behind the bar but really I'm there for my rice.

Friends like the old-school chicken ball kind of specials.  

Clean and reasonably fast.  Definitely friendly service.  There are often kids around doing homework so the atmosphere is family-friendly.   I've been told the coffee is good and that the best poutine in the neighbourhood is at Sandy's.  Have to try it sometime.  In the meantime - rice."}
{"text":"Decent and affordable Chinese food. Don't expect to be amazed but expect to be satisfied for what you pay for. lots of options too. owners are friendly and funny."}
{"text":"Decent chinese food at a decent price. I find that the amount of meat in some of the noodle dishes varies. Sometimes I get more sometimes I basically bought a big box of pain noodles cooked in soya sauce."}
{"text":"As basic as chinese food can get. Was given a tiny glass of water when we first sat down, and was not topped up even once after that. Found a long black hair in the puddle of sweet and sour \"sauce\", which is not necessarily the dealbreaker for this review - but rather the tired, bland stuff they try to pass off as food. I guess I expected a too much for a $7 meal that was prepared in about 2 minutes.

Also ordered won tons as an appetizer, however apparently that order consists only of the wonton skin/pastry, deep fried. Basically, won ton skin crackers..."}
