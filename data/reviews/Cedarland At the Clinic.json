{"text":"The food and service is always excellent.  The Hummos and Baba are incredible.  The chicken shwarma platter melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend stopping in this small mom & pop place for lunch.  You'll be coming for years and years!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Shawarma was great.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Steak sandwich tastes like Mom used to make. I'm completely full."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, as my dad is a patient at the clinic. I agree it's not a place to come when you're in a hurry but the food is well worth the wait. The hummus, the fattoush salad with chicken are to die for! I dream about them from the time I leave until i return. The owner is very friendly, I have never had bad service there."}
{"text":"Cedarland is a nice break for me and my co-workers who are tired of the offerings in the Cleveland clinic. It is a Mediterranean grocery store and a restaurant.   It is a typical mom&pop store, they have limited but good options here. The food is very good. I have been here couple of times and they have never disappointed me or my friends who have come here only because of me. The owners are very keen to explain about food if you have any questions."}
{"text":"I thought I'd written a review of this place!  Across from work, this little hideaway provides a ready change from the hospital based McDonald's, Au bon pain, and other cafeteria standards.  Mom and pop shops are the bomb, and this is one mom and pop shop that has withstood the presence of the Clinic across the street.  Fresh food, and friendly service, the place is oft buzzing at noon.  I've had better, but it's definitely not bad... and the relatively fast service is certainly a plus during busy work days.  Wonderful stuff."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant I have ever eaten in.  Went on a Saturday evening at about 8 PM.  Place was empty, should have left right then.  Food was abysmal.  One of our party order the fried fish fillet.  They brought a perfectly square piece of processed frozen fish slab that was inedibile.  When waitress asked about order, we told her that had we known it was a frozen fish stick, we would not have ordered.  Her response - \"What, do you expect me to go to the ocean and catch a fish just for you?\"  The hummus had a strange off taste, worst I have ever tried.  The baba gannouge was the same.  The topper was the pita bread, a few stale pieces, not heated, served in the plastic bag from the commercial bakery.  That took the cake.  We left most of the food uneaten and left as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Worth fighting the Euclid Corridor Construction   I was introduced to Cedarlands while working at the Cleveland Clinic. We went for an office lunch there and I have frequented there since. The food is amazing. Very light, traditional and best of all inexpensive.  Service tends to be a little on the slow side and a couple of the waiting staff may not be what you would call rays of sunshine but the food makes up for any lack in service.   I would best describe the decor as the love child of a Lebanese restaurant and American diner ( Let me finish you'll agree) On the tables are a beautiful tile mosaic while prints of Lebanese art adorn the walls while the shelves sport hot dog and hamburger candles and various American and Lebanese trinkets.  It is most certainly an odd decor but you won't care the moment you get your food.  The food can best be described as heavenly. Everything you want in a lunch. Filling but light enough it doesn't send you into the infamous food coma. Nutritious yet yummy. And best of all inexpensive. A sandwich there runs around $5 but will make enough for a meal.  What I recommend The Falafel is TO DIE FOR YUMMY Hummus (yup its homemade) Baba grape leaves stuffed with anything lentil soup (only available before May 31st and in the fall but honestl who wants lentil soup when its 80 degrees outside?)  Hit or miss The amount of time lunch will take A waitress with a smile  Avoid like the plague A fast lunch Shwarma (there are much better places for shwarma) Custom orders."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken shwarma and hummus entree.  I was a little surprised when it came out because it looked more like a giant appetizer than an entree.  (see picture)  I guess I was expecting it to be served with a side of rice or something?  Maybe there was a miscommunication when I ordered.   No rice aside, the chicken was very flavorful.  I can't really describe the flavor maybe tangy, zesty, earthy? (It definitely tasted better than my description of it, I'd eat it again)   The hummus was also smooth and delicious although not magnificent like others may lead you to believe.  My meal came with pita bread served in that plastic bag it was bought in.  They did heat up the pita, but the bread was nothing to write home about.  My portion was huge ( 2.5 meals in one)  The ambiance is interesting.  The restaurant looks like at one point it was a diner that would serve eggs, pancakes and hash browns.   In the kitchen area there appears to be a makeshift office.    Service was a little slow although very pleasant.  I enjoyed my meal and I'm curious enough to return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"First I was thrown off my the mobile phone sign covering the door.  Then the inside seemed over crowed with tables.  There was a little side room that had misc products form olive oil to Tide.    I walked in today to order take out and was surprised at the $8.25 Fattoush salad.  So I decided to order a spinach pie to go.  For $2.25 I received a dry over cooked, microwaved spinach pie that was tiny- like cocktail party size.  I was very disappointed and will NOT return.  Best to stick with the Aladdin's factory on Carnegie or Oasis Bakery  on Detroit (they make the fresh spinach pie while you wait)"}
{"text":"Classic lebanese food that was delicious and so much better than heading to the Chicago Deli or some other homogenous lunch spot.  They have everything you could want and many things that are fairly mainstream.  Don't be intimidated by the non-American fare because you will feel like you've traveled somewhere once you've eaten here."}
{"text":"I came here for an impromptu lunch with a co-worker.  The restaurant has a laid back atmosphere, and some desert civilization motif inside.  The menu choices are varied Mediterranean dishes.  What killed it for me was the price and quality.  $12.50 for a Veggie lunch plate consisting of hummus, baba ganoush, pita, 2 falafel balls, and a small tabouleh salad seemed a bit expensive.  Quality was ok, but prices really killed it for me."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shwarma today which was not even close to authentic. It seemed to have been fried it oil and there was not enough tahini and no pickled turnip or anything in the sandwich. Drippin oil an pretty gross in my opinion. Service was horrible, never got refills on drinks. They didn't even bother to tell us they don't bring your check to the table oh also they don't accept credit cards under $10 and said that I was making them lose money."}
{"text":"LOVE Lebanese food happiness, and Cedarland is DEFINITELY a place to indulge that love!  We did a \"family\" style array of yumminess which included: Mutabal, Fattoush Salad with chicken, Shish Tawook, Lamb Kabab and Hummos with Shish Tawook style chicken.  Everything was to die for! The hummos is some of the creamiest I have tasted! My father was in heaven with the garlic sauce too...and proceeded to compliment each of his portions with it.   The Mutabal was a nice change of pace from your typical Baba (which is on the menu as well...).   The coffee? FABULOUS! Each cup is individually brewed!   The owners are some of the nicest folks too...So welcoming! Serge came right over to talk to my parents, as this was their second or third time there, and being \"new\" to Lebanese cuisine, they were so excited to return because of the service they received from Serge!   Lunches are well under $10, and entrees under $20. Great food and great price...with fabulous owners!  Keep up the awesomeness Cedarland!"}
{"text":"Great hummus, very smooth and flavorful.  The chicken dish that came with the chicken was quite good too, grilled and marinated.  I didn't really like the baked kibbee too much though, it was kind of bland and after a while the texture of it was too monotonous for me.  I'd definitely like to come back here to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Disappointing, as I have an affinity for Middle-Eastern fare. Shawarma, hummous, kebab- I'm there.  Unfortunately, Cedarland does not live up to most of the other local Middle-Eastern hot spots in the Cleveland area.  I did a double take when I saw that a stuffed grape leave (Diwali) platter w/ rice was $11.50. I asked the waitress if I could order a side or half size of stuffed grape leaves. She could not understand my request and called the manager/owner (a large man, who can be viewed \"lounging\" in the back of the establishment politicking and barking orders) over to the table. He sternly replied \"no\" and stated I must buy the full platter. Of note, most if not all middle east restaurants offer appetizer portions of grape leaves, and even sometimes salad. The owner also came by and emphatically  insisted that we all try the fattoush salad ($8.50) with grilled chicken (an extra $3.00), which is what I ordered. I also ordered the homemade lemonade, which was $1.99, and very tasty. Traditional Lebanese lemonade is made with rosewater, and it was the best part of my lunch!   When our food arrived, I noted that the chicken appeared to be a generous portion, but appeared awfully greasy. It tasted as such. The fattoush salad also included cucumber, toasted pita, green peppers, lettuce, parsley, and mint tossed in a lemon-garlic-oil homemade dressing.  The salad lacked the traditional depth and flavor. The parsley, which provides a welcome crunch and freshness was sparse, and there was very little lemon flavoring the dressing. Traditional fattoush should have a \"tangy\" flavor, yet this was subtle and mellow, not at all what I have been accustomed to. I sampled my co-worker's hummous platter, and while it was tasty, seemed to have a \"pastier\" texture. It was not bad, just not what I have had from typical restaurants.  This would be a great restaurant if someone is new to middle-eastern food, and maybe skeptical about the flavors. The waitress and manager  never asked me for a refill, although they came by and offered several other guests in our party refills of water. While they do offer traditional middle eastern fare, I would not come here again. I think their prices are too high, but given it is in the Cleveland Clinic district, I can see why.  They do offer an expansive menu, but some of their American cuisine (fish dinner, hamburger) seems awfully high in price."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service.  All hand made fresh items. Best baba ganoush anywhere! Will be going to Cleveland Clinic for the next 12 months. Plan to make this place a big part of my eating experiences."}
{"text":"I love Cedarland.  I love the owners, Lilian and Serge Elias.  I love the baba.  I'm completely warm and fuzzy about the place.  THE FOOD:   From the regular menu:  Serge claims that they whip the hummous for two hours.  I don't doubt it.  It is the creamiest, most complex hummous in the city.  The baba is perfect-- smokey, tangy, smooth.  Lilian makes her own yogurt.    The arayiss (pita stuffed with cheese and meat)  is gooey and lovely.  The kefta is juicy and nicely char grilled.  The kibbee balls are better than the baked kibbee.  This is one of thethe few places where I would trust the kibbee nayee (raw kibbe).  The kebabs are wonderful and the fallafel is crisp and perfect.  There is some American food.  Why?  Wash it all down with Lebanese lemonade-- fresh lemonade scented with orange blossom water.  It is different, refreshing and addictive.   The pastries are either hommade brought in from some of the better Lebanese bakeries around.  Lillian bakes arabic cookies sometimes during the holidays.  Her french macaroons are not to be missed.     Off menu:  The staff will not tell you about the specails unless you are a regular, if you look particularly Lebanese or you ask.  They are not advertised or listed anywhere.  This is not because the staff is rude.  Far from it.  Serge and Lillian are two of the kindest, most gracious people I have ever met. I simply believe that they don't think the average American would be interested, or would find them appetizing.  This is completely wrong.  The specails are divine.  Utterly spectacular.   If God smiles upon you, the special will be kibbee lebaneh-- kibbe balls stewed in yogurt, mint, garlic and rice.  Have mercy.  The koosa and shek el meshi-- stuffed Lebanese squash and eggplant are so tender and delicious that I have dreams about them.  The loubie bil zeit (green beans and tomatoes) are to die for.  If you think okra is slimy-- think again.  Cedarland's tomato stewed okra is tender, firm and not at all slimy.  There is usually a briyani special-- a Lebanese version of the Indian classic curried rice and chicken.  Sometimes Serge does roasted chickens, also lovely.  If he makes Lebanese spahgetti, eat it.  THE ATMOSPHERE:  Kind of funny.  The tables are beautiful arabic inlay.  the walls feature a middle eastern/ greek-ish mural.  Then there are hysterical candles and flower arrangements placed haphazardly here and there.  There are great drink coolers and deli cases humming away.  Behind the deli counter is a table where cops congregate to drink coffee and watch television.  THE SERVICE:  The service is a bit slow, but sincere.  They run on Arabic time-- sit, enjoy your meal, talk for a few hours!  The crowd is a mixture of doctors and staff from the clinic, Middle Easterners, tired, hungry visitors to the Clinic and hipsters in search  of great hummous.    Serge is the big guy with the fantastic accent.  He will brag shamelessly about the food-- with good reason.  Lillian is the spectacularly beautiful woman with the thick wavy black ponytail and huge dark eyes.  She is a true gem.  I've been eating there for years and will continue to do so untill there is an injunction."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service, and authentic Lebanese Dishes. This is by far my favorite Lebanese restaurant in the area. If you go you have to try the combination platter. It comes with a skewer of chicken, lamb, and kefta (ground lamb/beef and spices). All served on a bed of rice with a side of garlic mayo which is delightful.  I've eaten at the Cedarland many times and have never been disappointed. All the appetizers are fantastic especially the hummus. The fatoosh salad and the kibbee are also great starters.  You should give this place a try if you like Lebanese or Arab food. Much better than Aladdin's. The food is much more authentic and the staff is much friendlier."}
{"text":"We went for a group lunch. The portion is kinda small compare with similar Lebanese food places. The wrap is hard to bite as it was from bagged flat bread.   BTW, they will move to a unknown location as Cleveland Clinic will torn down the building."}
{"text":"Cedarland has solid food. I mean... if you're truly Lebanese - how can you mess it up, right? The problem is that the place is so icky inside. I really wish they'd spruce the place up. Cracked linoleum, random, dusty, artificial plants... it's a whole hot mess inside. Good food - get it carrry out... and try to imagine that the kitchen is cleaner than the dining area."}
