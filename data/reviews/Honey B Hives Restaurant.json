{"text":"MMMmmmm honey b hives!   Order the 8oz steak dinner! Cooked decently and the flavour is there considering it's $9.99! You also get a mound of mashed potatoes plus some veggies on the side.  The chicken and mushroom tortellini was good in portion but a little bland in taste.  The $4.99 breakfast portion is pretty good too, potato just needs a bit of salt and pepper and you're good!"}
{"text":"Was here the Sat of Thanksgiving weekend around 8:30pm with the sis. I was a bit hesitant at first, since there were no other customers there when we got there. A few more customers showed up after 9pm, while we were eating. The waitress greeted us right away and sat us down in a prime location facing 4 TVs (1 playing CP24 and 3 playing the Jay's game). Then she brought out waters and the menu. The prices on the menu were quite reasonable which got our attention. We decided to share 3 items.  Mussels with White Wine Sauce ($6.99), Carbonara Fettuccine ($8.99), and a Philly Cheese Steak ($5.99). Our Mussels showed up in under 10mins. When the waitress brought out our Mussels, she asked if we would like the rest of our food to come out now, or wait till we were done the Mussels. Since we were sharing, we told her to bring them out all at once. 3mins later, she brought out the rest of our food. Talk about fast, of course it helps that we were the only ones there.  The Mussels were a really good portion size for only $6.99. Mussels were not super fresh, probably the frozen kind, but they were still good. The white wine sauce it was in was so good, me and sis gobbled it all down, completely ignoring the other food. I would order it again, and next time I'll get some fries as well to sop up the sauce with. Yum. The carbonara was ok, slightly different from what I was expecting. The potion size was good. It had scrambled eggs in it though, which means it wasn't made well. Taste was ok though if I didn't think of it as a carbonara. Just a tad blander than I would like. The Philly tasted ok, but I would have liked a bit more filling. The bun wasn't toasted for very long, so the bottom bread got slightly soggy while it sat there waiting for us to finish with the mussels.   Service was good and fast. Our waitress remembered to check on us regularly, and removed our empty plates and refilled our water without needing to be asked. The place was pretty clean for a 24hr place. Overall, the food was probably a 3 star, but the attentive service, good portions, and reasonable prices makes it a 4 star. It helps that its very close to where I live, so I'll probably be back whenever I don't feel like cooking to try more items. The BF has already requested that I bring him here after seeing pics I took of the food and menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very fresh and very delicious. The staff are very attentive and are always there if you need them. The interior design is somewhat modern but homely at the same time."}
{"text":"My all time breakfast place. Way more worth the money you spend at Eggsmart.  Portion just right and food are fresh,. Love the staffs here,  they always friendly and smile."}
{"text":"Dined here because of the Yelp reviews, but was extremely disappointed in the food and service. Comparable to hospital food, bland and tasteless. Do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place and I will definitely come back again. Fair price, good food and good service."}
{"text":"Came here close to noon on a Saturday, was pretty full. I had the steak & eggs breakfast. Affordable, taste good, home fries are the more crispy skin kind which I like. HK style western restaurant, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Came for late breakfast on a Saturday and we were seated right away. They recently renovated and the decor is really nice. The food was really good and totally worth the price. I usually leave food on my plate at other restaurants but the portion sizes here are just right and im not left feeling bad about wasting food or forcing myself to finish. Definitely recommend visiting if you want good food for a good price!!  BONUS. They are open 24/7!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from their breakfast menu- steak and eggs and western omelet. It was ok and it's a lot of food for what you pay! It's also family friendly. Service was quick and pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Good value for ur dollar! First time try all day breakfast that is quite convenient. .. serving fast and nicely.  the squid ink we ate was not that much impressive,  a bit salty to us!  Soup is nice,  but for my favorite was the sandwich and oatmeal!"}
{"text":"Good food.. skewers a little hard to chew.. mashed potatoes made out of fresh potatoes however it is not creamy enough.. overall it was good. Will visit again."}
{"text":"This place offers great value for the money. It's almost a well-kept secret because I visited the place and there was barely anyone there.   The eggs were well-done and my daughter, who is picky about her pancakes, ate it all up without complaint! That in itself is reason enough to return. I was hoping their home fries would be more flavourful. However, I'd definitely go back there."}
{"text":"Chill environment and kind service at all hours of the day.  You'll be surprised at the quality of food for a great price."}
{"text":"I got a recommendation on yelp to try this place out a while ago and after putting it off for a few months I decided to give it a try one sunday morning.  The first thing that caught my attention and definitely sets this place apart from most places is the fact that it is open 24 hours and serves breakfast THE ENTIRE TIME! That alone is already an incredibly attractive feature (cause who doesn't get the munchies at midnight?)  Upon first glance, the outside was highy unattractive to say the least, but based on some reviews that recommended I ignore the exterior...I ignored it and was so glad I did.  The inside is a different world. Newly renovated, screens all around, comfy seating and a decent size sitting area. It was very shiny and clean, had nice tables and chairs etc. (Even the washrooms were clean!). An environment that seldom exists in a 24h joint thats for sure! +1 star  There were a few people ahead of us in line but we waited a total of less than 10 minutes before being seated...which for a sunday morning is unheard of! +1 star  The menu was comprehensive. ..easy to follow, not too crowded but not too limited either. The prices...wow! 2.99 eggs and toast, 5.99 breakfasts 6.99 bennies?! My expectations dropped a little due to the prices because I knew id be leaving with a bill lower than $15 bucks. (Infact, I paid $10!!!) +1 star  I ordered the eggs bennie with a side of home fries (to replace the fruits) and 2 pancakes. They accomodated my substitutions happily and the service was VERY fast (we had our orders in 15 minutes) and the waiters were definitely friendly. +1 star  The only downfall is that the spinach on my bannies were a bit to salty, my eggs wernt runny like I like then and the pancakes were good but not the absolute best. Overall the food was very decent considering all the other perks this place has to offer. My food complaints take a back seat to the prices, portion sizes, service, hours of operation and cleanliness this place had to offer. This place would also more than satisfy any 2am cravings without putting a dent in your pocket! Would come back :)"}
{"text":"Just had a black ink squid seafood pasta and a omelette with pancakes, $26 in total. Prices are good because they're portions are bug especially the breakfast. The omelette with cheese and bacon is very very good, their home fries is great as well because it is literally little pieces of potatoes. The pasta is very delicious although it doesn't have a lot of seafood but the black ink  booth is fantastic."}
{"text":"Honey B Hives is a great place to go for a fast and cheap meal. Their breakfast special, that comes with toast, a choice of meat, eggs, and home fries is only 4.99! There's nothing special about their food, but you really can't beat their prices. I like that their food taste more homemade (and less oily) than most breakfast joints. This restaurant seems pretty sketchy on the outside but it feels very homey on the inside!"}
{"text":"A 24hr diner that serves everything from a steak and eggs ($8.99) to black squid ink pasta (about $15). The interior is very clean, modern, and bright. The breakfast food was a solid 3/5, but the value made up any shortcomings. I plan to be back for their dinner offerings, which looked incredibly aspirational (but sounds like they're good!)."}
{"text":"This place is atrocious. The steak was not only 1 cm thin, it was served completely COLD. When I told the server about this, after apologizing for complaining, first they told me they couldn't do anything for me, then they told me that they could heat it up (i.e. overcooking it), and then after another round where I just asked if I could get half of another side, they tried to blame me and told me that I already ate too much of it for them to do anything. I had literally 2 bites. On top of everything, the pancakes my friend had tasted dusty and the women's bathroom was gross.   Unless you feel like being called \"lady\" in a sarcastic way during an argument over your terrible food, don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Their Working B Breakfast portions are huge!  All the food is fresh and served promptly.  It's solid food at good prices with reasonable friendly service.  Would definitely recommend for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"pretty big portion. good price. food taste average for breakfast food. fresh fruits. asked for almost well down egg for poached eggs and got a pretty runny ones :p (coffee is not included)"}
{"text":"This place is located in a very sketchy looking plaza on Markham road. We came on New year's day at around 6am. The restaurant was empty with one waitress and a cook in the back.   They offer a decent selection of breakfast plates. We got the working b breakfast plate and steak breakfast plate. $9 for a steak breakfast plate ? Yes please. After food came fairly quickly. And the portion size was huge ! They give you alot of food. Nothing exceptional, but for the price and amount of food you get, this place deserves a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great place to go when you want affordable breakfast at whatever time you want. It's cheap, the pancakes and sausages were really good, and the home fries are actual chunks of real fresh potatoes (healthier than most places). The food comes pretty fast and the service is good. Plus it's open 24 hours!! I usually order the Honey B Breakfast - really worth it. Would definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my girlfriend based on the reviews and the good priced menu. Girlfriend ordered the 8oz steak a beer, and I the fish and chips and a beer.     The prices are pretty cheap $9.99 for the steak which came with mashed potato and broccoli. $7.99 for the fish and chips and $3 for a bottle beer. We also got the waffle with mango ice cream.   Now the food quality: the steak wasn't seasoned and was pretty dry for it being medium, which means all the cook had done was put the piece of meat on the grill. The mashed potato was pretty bland tasting as well. Should have asked for gravy.   The fish and chips were OK, not the best I've had but not the worst! The fried were good and not too salty like a lot of places.    The waffle was pretty good and tasty, wish it were a bit softer though.   All in all, for the price, this place is decent."}
{"text":"Shittiest place. It looks great inside. By my peeve is I went there with my girl cuz she wanted waffles, you know like homemade waffles. When she ordered them, they brought waffles or alright......Kellogg eggo waffles. Smdh. Should be put out of business for that alone. And dig this, they wanted $10 for the waffles. We laughed and walked the fuck outta there. Fucking lame. And their poutine sucks, no cheese curds, just shredded mozzarella. For real? Trust me, don't waste your time"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap breakfast, lunch, or dinner, this is the place to go. I usually get the breakfast deal for 1.99 and it fills me up just enough to leave me satisfied. I've also tried the fish and chips and that was pretty bomb. The fish was soft and tender and not dried out like most places I've been to. The steak on the other hand isn't what most would picture. It's a pretty thin piece of meat that spans the length of your hand so I wouldn't recommend ordering that. Overall, service is great and friendly and it's a convenient place to grab cheap food at all hours of the day."}
{"text":"We ordered wayyyy to much for two. Everything came in big portion as you can see in pictures. Really great value, worth every penny you paid. Next time we will try their breakfast. But don't try to compare this with those restaurants that charge over $20 for pasta, they might have a bit better taste for sure (or not :P)."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie ... It's food I could probably cook from home if I took the time and care into what I was cooking.  But for a 24/7 resturaunt that's in the immediate area, it's the best around. I've been here twice, one for a super late night dinner at 2am, and breakfast ... Which I believe was literally the next day.  When I came for dinner, I ordered the chicken kabob. It came with two skewers of some pretty small chicken pieces, but filling enough. A salad and a heaping serving of some pretty damn good, greasy fried rice. It was only the fried rice that was a good memory for me.   The next day, I came for the worker b's breakfast which seems to be the popular dish here. I'm not a fan of buying pancakes from restaurants, because it's never as fluffy as I want it. But this hits the spot. The worker's b breakfast is literally enough to feed roughly 3 people, it's no joke.   Honey B's is never packed, no matter what time of the day I come.  At the end of it all, the place looks pristine and newly renovated. Always clean. Staff is ALWAYS super friendly and warm (that's the one thing i love). Food is what you pay for, and it's not half bad. The only bad thing about this place is that it's super hidden. I had to drive up and down Markham road twice.  It's on the West side of Markham road, in this cheapo looking gas station plaza. Pretty unfortunate that a bunch of trees actually block the immediate restaurant, it's a little tricky to be seen from the main road.   If you're an often go'er to Markham Station at Markham Road/Sheppard, I suggest going up the road to McNicoll and trying Honey's B instead. It's A LOT more reasonably priced that Markham Station, and offers better food. Take my word for it. You won't leave with that weird 'grease' smell like you do when you dine at Markham Station."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast with friends.  It was ok.  The Eggs Benedict was pretty good, but a bit sparse.  I like the fruit cup - fresh fruit.  One of the eggs in my Bennie is significantly smaller than the other.  I feel that this dish is lacking something.  But the price is very cheap - so I suppose that is a trade-off.  The service was very good.  Location is not far from the 401."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. Tasty food , reasonable pricing and open 24/7 . They serve breakfast specials, lunch specials and more. Menu is mostly breakfast(eggs, sandwiches etc), pastas, burgers steak . I have been there countless times since I found it. The pesto pasta, sausage penne and the breakfast special is value for money. The portions are good size and you will get full for sure. It has good seating , serves alcohol and has around 6 screens playing sports news etc. Overall good place to grab a bite ."}
{"text":"Great food for the dollar you pay!!  Where else are you going to get a decently made GRILLED AAA 8 OZ. STRIPLOIN for $10.00!?!?  And this place is legit 24 HOURS :)  They have great apps foe $2 like beef skewers and really good $7 mussels with white wine cream sauce.  Their dinners include potatoes and veggies or add $3 to include soup OR salad AND dessert .... or add $4 include soup AND salad AND dessert. And their dinners include the striploin, lamb rack to ribs. Decent right!? From $10 to $20!  Their pasta .. most special I'd say is the BLACK SEA GOOD SQUID IN SPAGHETTI for only $17.  They also have all day breakfast of course.   They do have liquor license which Includes beer, wine and cocktails ... but their wines are limited to only one red that they have ans one white that they offer. It's not the greatest but it'll do ....same with cocktail ... there's not a lot of selection... oh you CANNOT bring your own wine.  The inside is nice and simple. Not bad! My friend's son owns this place :)"}
{"text":"24 hours all day breakfast joint with generous portions for a good price. Food is seriously average but you can't complain when you're craving for breakfast food at 4 in the morning. Severs are nice but there isn't enough when it get busy."}
{"text":"The main attraction of this little gem is their prices, it is a good bang for your buck.  The interior decor isn't much to speak of.  Wife and I were looking for some affordable breakfast before we started our day.  This place fit the bill on the affordable criteria.  The food was very filling.  I had a bacon and cheese omelette w/homefries and toast and my wife had 2 eggs/toast/homefries/bacon & sausage.    On a previous visit, also tried the pulled pork poutine and their chicken & lamb skewers.  Worth the visit for the pulled pork poutine at a price point of $4.99 + taxes.    the 4 stars is primarily the value for your dollar spent."}
{"text":"Took a while for waitress to take our order I asked for the Steak and Eggs and when she asked how I liked my steak, I asked for medium but ended up getting well done. The eggs were sunny side up and the whites near the yolk were raw and I sent them back. The toast was also cold when I got it.   Food is nice and cheap and for the most part, the food was tasty."}
{"text":"The north side of Markham Station. Food is pretty good, prices are good for the portions. Plenty of seating, but their main drawback is lack of wait staff. Been here a few times now and they seem to only have 2 waitress on staff. This place seats about 40-60 patrons at once. If it is a holiday, both of these poor girls are running around like a chicken with their heads cut off. I would give is a 4 or 5 stars but the service is not good enough but this is not on the waitresses but more of the owner who is unwilling to staff a 3rd person to wait on customers. Only if they realize if they have 3 or 4 waitresses, the faster they can get the customer in and out. The more money they will make, the avg seat time for customer is 1hr-1.5hr. Breakfast on avg is only 45 mins-1hr per table turn around. Big opportunity missed in my opinion. I usually order the \"working B\" breakfast with 3 eggs, 3 choices of side and served with pancakes for $10. Great Deal if only I can get in and out of there in less than 1 hour. BTW this place is open for 24 hours."}
{"text":"Pricing is at 5 stars, food is at a humble 3.   HoneyB Hives, is on the corner of mcnicoll and Markham in an older plaza. It's very affordable, okay breakfast food. No way is this a five star breakfast- it's good but not delicious or anything. But for $2.99 is Amazing!  Food 2/3 stars 1 extra star for the price and service  No frills, not bad, decent   Yes cheap, affordable and OKAY. By no means is the food worth the 4 or 5 star. I was a bit surprised by the number of highly rated reviews- but I guess people are surprised by the price? No idea why it's 5.   I went for breakfast food- offered 24/7 (I think there's a small additional charge out of normal breakfast hours). But for 2.99 you get 2 eggs, toast and home fries- you can add on a pancake or waffle to this for a small charge of $1.  I'm not complaining at 2.99 They have affordable lunch/dinner options (pastas, steak, sandwiches).  The eggs and home fries not bad. The waffle looks promising but tastes like cake batter in a waffle machine- I highly suspect some sort of super sweet premade mix.  It's okay food that's affordable but not worth 5 stars.  No offence but I  find that way too generous- at least not five stars for breakfast food!  3 stars at the most    Service is decent too and the interior isn't bad."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place.  Extremely huge portions - 3 fluffy pancakes, 3 meats, 3 eggs and home fries for $8.99?  Where are you going to find these prices anywhere?  The eggs Benedict is decent at $6.99 and both meals included some fruit.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This place is an option to go to if you're ever wanting breakfast at any time of day since majority of the menu are breakfast options and is open pretty late. The recent time I came I got the eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce and also comes with fruit. For the price, it's a reasonable amount, that leaves you not being too full. The quality of the food is okay, nothing amazing. I would say most people come here for convenience and if you don't want to spend too much money. They have limited things on the menu, some other meals apart from breakfast, but I would say their breakfast deals are pretty good. They also have an option to customize your own pasta which my friend got, which is nice. Overall this place is average, with cheap eats if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Great value bfast. Starts as low as 2.99. I got the Working B Breakfast which is a LOT of food... 3 types of meat, 3 eggs, potatoes and 3 pancakes for $10. I highly recommend that if you're hungry. I usually don't like pancakes (especially thick ones) because they seem to doughy. But I did like these... they weren't doughy at all.    We also shared a pulled pork poutine (only $5). This was fairly good, although I wasn't the biggest fan of the pulled pork.   It loses a star because the wife's  eggs benedict were pretty mediocre.   Bfast is served 24/7."}
{"text":"Good place to grab some breakfast late at night/early in the morning since they're open 24hours.  Food is decent."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and brunch joint. This one's a hidden gem. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but give it a try. The food is great. Wonderful family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food: 9/10 ---- Value: 10/10 ---- Service: 9/10 ---- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10  This place was the perfect combination of good food, good prices, and good service.  The Working B Breakfast ($10) has three eggs, three pieces each of three sides (ham, peameal, bacon, turkey bacon, or sausage), three pancakes, and home fries. It is a huuuuuge portion, so perfect for sharing. Compared to the Steak & Egg ($9) with one smallish steak, two eggs, toast, and home fries, the Working B Breakfast is far superior in taste and value.  The pulled pork poutine ($5) is a big portion too and great for sharing. It's a little on the sweet side and they use shredded cheese instead of cheese curds, but it's still very tasty.   One time, I was feeling a little healthy and decided to go with the Eggs Benedict ($7). Had I not replaced the fruit cup with home fries, I probably would've been REALLY hungry. The Eggs Benedict is good, but the portion is too small to be a filling meal on its own.    Servers are always friendly and quick. Pair that with great food and value and you have a winning combination."}
{"text":"Came to honey b hives with a couple of my girlfriends for a quick bite and the service was great. The server allowed me to bring my puppy (in a carrier) in the restaurant and was very polite about it. She served us in a respectful and timely manner we were never waiting on anything. The food however was Okay, I liked my dish (I got a mussel and white wine cream sajcs) but the dishes that my company got weren't the best. The reason I give the restaurant two stars is not the service however the quality and attention to food detailing. I ate here once before and got a pasta and had a medium size peice of ceramic plate in my food. Below is a photo of my mussel dish!!!"}
{"text":"O. M. G.   This unassuming and somewhat sketchy neighbourhood (well at least at night) restaurant was a pleasant surprise.   Yelpers did not steer us wrong.    The most surprising thing was walking into this ''Italian'' restaurant to see Chinese staff.  I thought... Oh.  It's one of those places that serves weiners in your spaghetti instead of pancetta.  Luckily the food was way better than initially anticipated.    We ordered two pasta dishes, salad, 2 orders of wings and the pulled pork Poutine.   The chicken and mushroom basil tortellini was amazing, so flavourful!! The salmon luigini was quite good.   The pulled pork Poutine yelpers kept mentioning was well worth it.   The pulled pork was soft and juicy on a bed of fries.  The wings were decent, not full of batter.  And the hot wings are indeed Spicy.    Overall, I'd try this place again.  But I'm hesitant to do so at night time when sketchy kids hang out in the side parking lot and use the restaurant's washroom to deal drugs. (-1 star for location)."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer service and food that is great valve and great taste..   keep up the good work guys !!!!"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews but this place was awful.  Chicken skewers was an absolutely pathetic, dried out, previously frozen, chicken breast cooked on a flat top.  The mashed potatoes and rice sides were bland and tasted like they had been sitting around all day.  We literally threw both meals out after about two bites.  I would have gotten more enjoyment out of flushing my 20 bucks down the toilet.   I'm always fascinated when places like this have high ratings.  It really indicates that price point is the most important aspect for most reviewers.  Cheap people shouldn't write reviews.  Their reviews are a really inaccurate representation of what the place is really like because cheap people are satisfied by anything, even crap like this, as long as it's cheap."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant anytime because they open 24 hours. I love honey b combo. 4.99 value combo which is better than CORA. Also they offer funnel cake after 9:30pm each day and it is a must try food here better than BIG Mose. Good customer service and the staffs are friendly. For dinner wise, squid ink spaghetti is the best!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap eats, then you should try this place. It opens late and have a secret happy hour. 6 piece wings for $2.99 (dine in only 2pm-2am).  Portions are quite big for the price that you pay. Service is good - she also kept filling up our glasses with water.  Don't expect high quality food. However, this place is decent with good flavours. You will be stuffed and you get your bucks worth."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for late night breakfast after drinking or hitting up a rave. Honey bees offer up a wide variety of diner food that perfect hits the spot for that all night greasy cravings.  Food: Like I mentioned before they have a variety diner style food, however the main draw I believe is the all day breakfast that provide. This probably the best spot to satisfy those late night cravings that you can't really get as they are open all night long.   Service: Staff is friendly enough as I don't expect any quality service.   Ambiance: Its basically a diner almost like a Denny's. It is what it is. The area outside looks sketchy but I usually stop by at 2am in the morning so what do I expect.   Recommendation: Highly recommended if you are not feeling magic noodles or hitting up a McDonald's at the time. Otherwise, I wouldn't exactly dine in on a regular occasion."}
{"text":"Very affordable, great decor and friendly service.  Food is all very fresh, meets my expectations for a great Sunday morning breakfast. Bonus that it's in a very quiet area and I can fill up my gas outside."}
{"text":"I would definitely go back to this restaurant if I don't live too far away. This place is interesting coz they got almost everything I want from all-day breakfast to steaks and pastas. They even have sandwiches and value meals in the daytime. So we went for dinner and ordered mussels with white wine for appetizer, 8oz. striploin, ribeye steak, full-rack bbq ribs, and spaghetti with meatballs. All of them were delicious and better than what i expected. The price was very good, the food quality was great and the portions were huge especially the pasta. Even the appetizers and +$4 combo (soup, salad, and dessert) were big that we almost got full before the main course was served. The dessert had options of either crème brûlée or fruit cup. I wish they would serve refillable iced tea though and some cocktail drinks like margarita. The ambience was nice. The flat screen TV's were a plus. You can't really complain considering the price of the food and the server was very nice. The only thing that's strange was the location especially at night. It was quiet but it was kinda odd that it's beside a gas station and an empty space. Overall, I am very satisfied with this place and I would recommend it especially late at night when all the other restaurants are closed already."}
{"text":"This place gets you the BANG for each BUCK! I was genuinely surprised by what they served and how much each dish cost. I decided to try this place once and for all after all the talking and stalling. Came with my cousin tonight and both of us said we will be back soon. First of all, this place is twenty-f'en-four hours, seven-f'en-days a week.. Who the hell beats that? This place got all day breakferst and pasta. This place serves booze. This place does motha f'en take out.. And had a dart room away from the dining floor. Too awesome..  When we entered, we were greeted by a young asian female. She was soft spoken and had the biggest and most genuine smile as she welcomed us. She made my day.. My cousin and I both ordered the AAA steak and eggs ($8.99). I was planning on ordering the Worker B breakfast but couldn't because I had too much kit kat from Japan that my cousin bought me. I can tell you right off the bat that the steak was only decent. It was cooked thoroughly, which I do not approve and way too thin. I was expecting the thin part, not the well-done cook job. The meat was fresh, just over cooked. It didn't look like it was seared.. That's what happens to steak in a Chinese kitchen lol jk. The home fries were fantastic and the eggs were regular to large size, in total egg heaven. We also ordered the pulled pork Poutine for $4.99 - the cheapest and decent tasting Poutine around the area. Fries were fresh and the pork had bbq sauce lavished all over with a hint of tangy-ness to it - gave the poutine a slight kick. I totally approve and recommend this place to all my fellow breakferst lovers! I suggest the worker b breakfast because it's $9.99 for 3 eggs, 3 choice of meat, home fries, toast AND pancake. You won't have to pay extra for pancakes like you do at Eggsmart or Cora's. Took off a star because this place was so hidden + the \"open\" sign was not on; thought the place was closed when I got there."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner, after a recommendation from a friend. What can I say, the place is really good, nothing bad to say at all. The food is fantastic and the service was excellent.  The place is nicely decorated and cosy. They have tv's around the walls with different channels on, it was the sports channels and CP24.  My kids ordered a kids burger with fries, chicken fingers and fries and my eldest ordered a oatmeal and fruit breakfast combo with an extra side of bacon. I got the striploin steak and it came with mashed potatoes. My friend got the regular burger and we ordered a side of chicken wings too. All the food was delicious. Most outstanding were the burgers. The kids burger was huge, the regular burger is half pound of pattie. The patties were juicy, flavourful, good texture and cooked to perfection. No black charred bits!  My daughter's breakfast was oatmeal and fruit. It came with milk and brown sugar on the side and the fruit cup was really fresh chopped fruit, much better than Coras. Steak was lovely, for a few extra dollars you can add soup, salad and dessert to dinner entrees to create a full 4 course dinner. Only thing I would criticize is the wings. I personally like breaded wings, the wings here are huge but not breaded. If you like unbreaded wings, these are for you.  Absolutely great place to grab a casual bite to eat. I'm definitely coming back for breakfast next. Prices are fantastic too, cost was just over $60 inc tax. (2 adults, 3 kids plus 4 pops) It cost me $55 at Montanas for lunch today, and we were 1 person down.   Fantastic food and really affordable prices. It's behind a gas station, so you need to keep your eyes peeled or you might miss the place."}
{"text":"I love going here. This is my go-to breakfast/brunch place. You can also have lunch and dnner here as well. It's not expensive and you get a decent amount of food that fills you up! Overall food is good and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came by again after a yelper messaged me that Honey B Hives had completely renovated.  Definitely an improvement from before in decor.  The place is so much brighter and feels much cleaner then my first visit.   The menu seemed much more streamlined then before.  I decided to try the western omelet breakfast this time.  The breakfast was decently portioned and equally tasty.  Ordered a side order of onion rings which came with generous portions.  My girlfriend ordered a half pound burger which was a bit salty but acceptable. Overall the food was average but is a great deal for the price and large portions.   Service was a bit lacking however.  The waitress was very awkward and not very friendly.  But food arrived promptly.   Overall I think I would consider coming back for the great value of the food. Especially considering that it's 24 hours it's perfect for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Our new go-to breakfast place.  Food - BIG portions Mister and Missus were craving breakfast food at 4pm. The food here hit the spot! Portions are huge at a very reasonable price.   Service - fast and friendly  OVERVIEW: - Highly recommended for lovers of classic breakfast food - Don't be fooled by exterior of restaurant, inside was very clean with a great diner feel"}
{"text":"Unfortunately there was nothing we really liked about this place . The calamari had a good batter but there was no taste to it and the dip was just a squirt of mayo and ketchup. It left a fishy after taste. The smoked salmon in the eggs benedict was fully cooked and the sauce was bland. The siracha chicken was bland and the mashed potato was lumpy and tasted starchy. But the prices are low and the facility was clean."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast. The service is fast and well manner. The food is 3 star but the service is 4 star. The price is pretty good and fair for what it is so I would come again."}
{"text":"The food is great 5 stars for the food. Coffee not so good 2 stars for the coffee. Service is soooooo hit and miss. We sat for 10 minutes with our menu, no drinks/water or a glance. It was not too busy either for a Saturday morning, if I wasn't super hungry it wouldn't have bothered me much. Once we ordered though the food came quickly and was hot and perfect, totally made up for the long wait to order.    So if someone had said \"hey are you ready to order\" a little sooner I would have said 5 stars for sure! But food is great and prices great too."}
{"text":"It took an hour for our food to arrive overcooked and warm. No apologies for the long wait. Orange Fanta is really sprite mixed with orange juice, but they won't tell you that.  It's unfortunate that my first Yelp review is a negative one."}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars!! This is an amazing breakfast place and I will most definitely be back. Everything from food to service to atmosphere gets 5 stars. The prices are so cheap and the portions are huge!   We tried two different breakfast platters and they were great. And if you're in the mood the pulled pork poutine is soooooo good. cheese gravy and honey flavoured pulled pork.  Coming back a second time we tried some different menu items. As for the seafood: I love calamari but the calamari here is nothing exciting..I wouldn't suggest this over other apps. BUT the mussels in the white wine sauce were to die for! A must try for sure. We also ordered the spinach stuffed chicken which after all our delicious appetizers was mediocre...just plain mashed potatoes and lightly cooked chicken. So I would say stick to the breakfast and the apps. I have yet to try the pasta but I will definitely be back to do so!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends after badminton for dinner. The menu was reasonably priced; good quality was satisfactor; and the seating was comfy. Overall this place was good and it is open late so good place for a late night dinner option."}
{"text":"In Markham we have got few 24hr diners; and if we're comparing - Markham station sucks. The Mussels in White Wine sauce will surprise you for only $6.99 and literally all of the reviews here for Honey B talk about their Pulled Pork Poutine.. Stop reading reviews and just get out of your bed and get the best breakfast for the buck out here."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by during dinner. I haven't been here for over a year and decided to give it another try after seeing a lot of recent reviews.    They definitely revamped the place completely, before it was really dark, dirty and old.    There was TVs around the restaurant, comfy booths and chairs now.  Great to sit and watch some cp24 or sports.  Before it was more like a fast food restaurant where you would order and get your own food, but I was surprised to see a waitress ask me how many people.  They have a variety of all day breakfast, pub food, pasta, Chinese steak and rice dishes.   I just wanted to try something small, so I got the 1/2 pound burger, but instead of upgrading to a combo with fries and pop for $2.00, I decided to order a side of onion rings for 2.99! My boyfriend ordered the all day breakfast western omelet.    The burger came and it was huge!! Had lettuce, tomato, ketchup, pickles, relish, mustard, hot peppers and mayo.  It was pretty messy to eat.  I found the patty to be pretty salty, and it didn't seem home made as I hoped, but it was hot, and a good size for 4.99.  The onion rings surprised me. It came in a basket and was filled with onion rings!!   My boyfriend's western omelet was pretty good.  The home fries were good, but the portion wasn't as big as we expected, but can't complain for 6.99 (paid an extra dollar because it was ordered after 3pm)  Didn't get to read the yelp reviews until after I ordered, so next time I will definitely try the pulled pork poutine recommended by so many!!   The meal came up to 16.00 taxes in, so pretty good fresh food, decent portion and good prices.   They have dart boards and the blurb on the chalk board is so funny!!"}
{"text":"TIP first of all: Try their poutine.. you will be surprised at how huge the serving is and it's so cheap!! They offer breakfast all day, however there is an extra charge of $1 after 3PM for breakfast food. Also, the 2 times I asked for their Egg Salad Sandwich, they have always been out of stock, so I never bothered trying to order that again.  I think it's safe to say that I am one of Honey B Hives's most frequent customers :)  Honey B Hives has great service, and waitresses are very polite and friendly. Good location. Fast service. Clean restaurant, and also fairly cheap prices.  They are open 24/7, which is a plus.  This restaurant is probably one of the most underrated places out there. Honey B Hives is so much better than Markham Station in many ways (food, service, price, and did I say service?)  Most of the time, Honey B Hives is not busy, and I wish there would be more customers.  When you come in, you are greeted and immediately seated.. Food comes pretty quickly, I would say in around 5-10 mins. The ambiance is great, there are 5 TVs (some sports channels and CP24).   Regarding food portion, I would say portion size is decent, they have a huge breakfast menu, but their pastas are a must-try as well!  Every food that I try at Honey B Hives has been delicious and tasty, I keep coming back. I could even have a craving for greasy breakfast at 2AM and I could go to this place, so convenient!   No seriously, try this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely my go-to breakfast place, the prices are amazing! I always get the \"Honey B Breakfast\" which comes with 2 eggs, choice of side (ham, bacon...), toast and homefries (I usually sub this for French fries because they are yummy!) - all for $4.99. There is also the value breakfast for $2.99 if you're not that hungry which doesn't include the side. :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my usual church crew and feasted on delicious breakfast platters and sandwiches! It's located in a pretty random plaza that's kind of run down but the interior is quite decent. They have all day breakfast and its an impressive spread! Lots of meat and perfectly cooked eggs plus beautifully fluffy pancakes (better that Cora's!).   I had the pulled pork sandwich which was very yummy though a bit on the sweet side. My daughter gobbled up the spaghetti with meat sauce! Generous portions all around and hardworking staff. The place was busy from the time we arrived until the time we left so be prepared for a wait. I guess the word had gotten out about this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Summary: all-day-breakfast restaurant offers quality food in big portions for a reasonable price with superb service until very, very late (formerly 24-hours)  Top Must-Get: meatball sandwich/pulled pork macaroni Top Regret: skewers  One of our most frequented late night food places serves all day breakfast until the wee hours of the night, in addition to a variety of sandwiches, pastas, skewers and other items such as poutine, wings and fries.  I have received outstanding service each time I've gone: they're smiling, positive and I also notice they take orders on a tablet, which makes it feel more professional. They also have TVs on the walls, which is a nice touch; the place has a humble vibe, but a touch of upscale-ness.  First, let's talk the Meatball Sandwich, which has replaced the pulled pork macaroni as my favourite order here. The bread isn't the softest or the most fresh, but by golly, you get GIANT meatballs, and I've gotten more here (4-5 in a sandwich) than I have in dinners at other restaurants! Plus, they're not just big - they're big AND delicious. Quantity plus quality is a victory!  Pulled pork macaroni is phenomenal. Well-flavoured, good portion, and enough sauce to mix in with the macaroni. I've tried the other pastas which were not nearly as tasty, but the pulled pork mac is definitely a cut above.  All-day Breakfast:  They disappointed a friend of mine who insisted their iteration of poached eggs was not correct, but their all day breakfast is usually quite good besides that.   The Honey B breakfast at $4.99 is VALUE. Their sides are solid, and unlike most Asian-run breakfast spots in the area, their sausages are in the Western style - delicious!  Their home fries are good, but not super outstanding.  I personally like the steak and egg, although they only make steak medium (nothing more rare, including medium-rare)   Skewers - especially the lamb skewers - are pretty good, but to me, very overpriced ($2 for one skewer - that's 60 cents a bite... put another way, for $5, you could get a Honey B breakfast with two eggs, a side, and homefries with a bit fruit on the side, or two and a half skewers. )  The only other complaint I have is the fact that they're located near a dumpster. Once, the entire plaza absolutely reeked. It was better when we went inside, and they let us know they had already called the company responsible for picking it up. Still, not exactly the smell you want to be in your nose before eating!  All in all, it continues to be a solid late night option!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place.  Very standard breakfast food like at coras, eggsmart or any other breakfast joints, but cheaper. Omelettes are only $6 (with toast and homefries), rather than $14 you'd get at a trendy brunch place.   We went at 5:30pm on a saturday and had only one other customer."}
{"text":"We ordered Working B breakfast, hot chicken wings and western omelette. Totally satisfied and the good is great value for the money we paid for. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Horrible first time experience. We were a party of 5 people and when we arrived they had about 4 empty tables. However, they didnt allow us to sit until 15min after they finished taking orders from all the other patrons. We were already not pleased with the unnecessary wait to sit and when we got seated, they gave us 1 menu for the 5 of us to share.   When we told the server we were ready to order and she walked over, for some strange reason she said we needed more menus and she went away to bring us 4 more menus!?! As she took our order, before we even started, the first thing she said was we arent splitting your bill in a very blunt manner.  I ordered an orange Fanta and when they brought our drinks, the server said it was orange juice! I tried it and it basically tasted like orange juice with sprite!   It took about 45min to get all our food and it was all simple breakfast food! Their eggs benedict was basically hard boiled eggs. Most of the food was lukewarm. They didnt bring all our food at once, there was a 5 to 10min wait between each person. 3 of us ordered the same order, but it took extra long to finish cooking 2 of then than the 1st one. The wait for food and every other step til the end was just remarkably slow and unorganized. The servers never once apologized for the wait or said any nice pleasantry.   I do not recommend."}
{"text":"-went for breakfast only- This place seems to be located in a sketchy plaza which took a little guessing to find (it is not a really outstanding place). No one really greeted us when we first went in so it wasn't clear whether we just take a seat or wait for someone to direct us. The staff were not very attentive and I believe only one person was taking orders. The menu has a lot of variety which is good. We ordered many typical items which were alright but nothing too special. The plates were also pretty big and the same size for most things which barely fit on the table all together.  Overall, it was a little disappointing and more average than expected. Also, I do not live in the area so I would most likely not purposely go again."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that I would probably give Honey B Hives a 3.5-star rating if I could. Today's visit was average, but I have been there a few times before and fared better.  I was up early this morning, and decided to head up to Honey B Hives for breakfast before some wintry outdoor skating. The restaurant was not at all what I expected on my first visit. While it is a 24-hour all-day breakfast place in a very out-of-the-way industrial part of Scarborough, it also has a surprisingly polished-looking interior and some unusual pasta dishes on the dinner menu. I have only ever been there in the mornings for breakfast, and the service has always been quite fast.  The breakfast menu is fairly simple: a few egg plates, an omelette plate, and pancakes/waffles/French toast. There are no special features, but the food is generally good and the serving sizes are fine for the low prices. This morning I chose the steak and eggs with home fries and toast. As I read in some reviews, the steak was a thin-cut piece, but it was not small and was done to a good medium. The home fries were big and just a little crispy outside, and the eggs and toast were fine. The coffee is always really hot, which is appreciated on a cold morning like today.  Overall, a decent filling breakfast for only $12, but I could easily have eaten well for $10 or less. I am sure that I will return in the future, and should go some time for dinner to try their Black Squid Ink Spaghetti. They also have a make-your-own-pasta meal, with a lot of different options, as well as meat skewers and fish."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold Sunday afternoon. No lineups and we got seats immediately.   We ordered Egg Benedicts with peameal steak and eggs with an addition of sausages and finish it off with waffles and vanilla ice cream.   The eggs benedicts were very good and filling. Two eggs on an English muffin. Very good price $5.99 for eggs benny.   The steak was ok and the sausages were good.  The waffles was ok a bit on the dry side. The server was good - did not have to wait long for service."}
{"text":"Solid food at great prices is what sums up Honey B Hives in my review.   Came here on a Sunday with a bunch of friends and we were the only table for a good portion of our dinner. No issues with service of course!  I felt like really getting a pasta and decided for the cheaper option of spicy Italian penne in a rose sauce with pulled pork poutine and calamari to share. The poutine was pretty standard - the gravy was somewhat lacking (which is unusual because some yelpers have suggested it was dynamite). It was a bit bland but the fries were nice and crisp and the pulled pork was tasty too. There were onions so there was a tinge of sweetness to it. The calamari was good too. The batter was crisp and light and the sweet (thai) chili sauce and mayo dips that were provided were great. The pasta was decent, nothing too special. Did feel it was on the bland side as well.   I was extremely tempted by the sirloin steak but will get it next time for sure! The food here is solid, either I just expected too much from here or had a one-off experience but I will definitely return and hopefully will be more pleased on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Must try the black noodle (the most expensive course, I think it's $16). The other items are inexpensive (less  than $10). They also open 24hrs!"}
{"text":"You can come here late at night or early in the  morning and it won't matter; you'll always get a good meal and a reasonable price.   I've been here maybe twice in the morning and many times at night. Great place to go to when everything else is closed. Usually I get the standard breakfast and sometimes I get the pulled pork poutine with it.   The breakfast always hits the spot. Good eggs, great meat, and the home fries are pretty good too. The pulled pork poutine is nothing special but I still order it every time for some reason.   Overall this place gets a 4/5 for the late night availability and consistency."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I ordered the Honey B breakfast and had a great first impression, especially since the combo was a great deal (meat, scrambled eggs, potatoes, orange slices) Decided to venture out and try different menu items because they seemed to have a good variety:  Make Your Own Pasta (~5.99) The rose sauce penne was good the first time, but then the second time I came back it tasted like mould D:  Grilled AAA 8 oz. Striploin (~9.99) jaw hurt after eating the steak, the carrots and peas are standard, the mashed potatoes are homemade and nice but lack flavour  Lamb Skewer (~1.99) tastes better than the beef skewer   If you come here for anything aside from the Honey B breakfast or similar breakfast items, you will be extremely disappointed. There are inconsistency issues in the menu."}
{"text":"Our server Nanette was great as usual  .. had small greek with smoked salmon and spaghetti with Italian sausage and mushrooms"}
{"text":"This place is just wonderful. Purchased the daily special, which was parmesan chicken, it was $8, and the portion was huge. Tasted great.  The fallback, the potatoes that came with the meal were clearly boxed mashed potatoes, and the glasses of water were all warm.. not even an ice cube. The waitress was very friendly and considering it was $8 for awesome chicken, I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Worker B breakfast and it was huge.  Everything was well prepared and it was such great value too.  The service was also very attentive.  The waitress noticed I used my napkin before the meal arrived so she brought another out with out even being asked!  All in all, this is an amazing place with great food and super prices."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and the last time I went I was quite disappointed.  The service wasn't the best, or .. we just didn't really experience any service at all.  We ordered steak & eggs, and pancakes. The steak was way too overcooked. My favourites from this restaurant is still the pancakes and potatoes.."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. I was stopping in for a late night bite, and was blown away at the quality of their burger. It is truly a thing of beauty. Everything made for me, nothing was sitting around. Fries were fresh and crispy. I was very excited to open up a burger that was very filling and abundant. For $8? I think it was cheaper than any I've had for what I got.  Don't waste time with McDonald's paper thin burger patties.  I got a 1/2 lb. and it was amazing.  I met the owner who was very friendly and quickly accessed the menu on an iPad which was excellent. He was able to put my order in and get it going before I even knew what was happening.  Very friendly guy, even offered to call ahead of time if I wanted the order ahead of time next time. That was a definite plus point.  Looking forward to having pancakes this morning because it was a really great experience. And... I only got take out."}
{"text":"Came here because it had a relatively high rating in the area we were in. Food pictures look great on Yelp; however, the taste is just okay. For the price you pay, the taste is decent. Pulled pork poutine was good. The steak special tasted okay but it it seem to come with frozen-like vegetable, and the spaghetti (kid's meal) was not bad either. The portions are big here and it definitely fills you up. Their breakfast looks amazing and I might just come here for breakfast next time :)"}
{"text":"Food: OK Service: good  Price: cheap Ambience: meh   Probably the cheapest steak you can get in GTA. Wish they know what they are doing though. Asked for a medium rare steak, and get a rare steak. Rice for chicken skewers was dry and had those cheap frozen corns, peas, and carrot pieces in it.   Their concept is interesting...or should I say confusing...They don't have any story to tell. The ambience of this place reminds me of a food court. It is just a cheap restaurant that serves whatever they can make. They have a make your own pasta menu going on which sounds interesting.   Overall...I recommend their breakfast menu and ribs (OK for the price). Don't expect too much from this place."}
{"text":"This was the worst breakfast food I've ever had. I would rate it negative stars if I could.  A friend and I came here for breakfast because it was on the way of our drive and the reviews seem very decent. Got in and place was pretty clean looking and fairly empty. First issue was, the waitress was extremely rude and basically stood there without a word while giving us the stink eye for absolutely no reason. So anyways we order the standard breakfast plates with toast, bacon, potatoes, eggs, pancakes. When the food arrived, it looked GROSS. The bacon looked and tasted like it was leftover and microwaved from last week - it was stiff and rubber like. The potatoes were also dismal, looked like it's been refried multiple times and also tasted old - I couldn't eat it without dunking it in ketchup. The eggs were borderline okay for me but my friend said he had to force them down. The whole time I'm regretting eating this food. The bill came and it was around $20 after tax, a total waste of money. And as the cherry on top, I felt physically ill around an hour afterwards, with actual stomach pain.  I can't believe people rate this place anything higher than a one."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and totally a fan! It's rare to find a 24-hr sit down place that isn't completely sketchy or totally packed. The food here is pretty cheap and you get soo much food!! So far I've tried the build your own pasta($7.99) and sweet potato fries($2.99) and both were amazing! I also make an effort to order chocolate milk every time because for $2 you can't go wrong!   Service is fast, place is nice, and I'll be back again! Definitely recommend to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write a review for this place! Went here for breakfast on a saturday morning, there weren't many people.  The food is amazing, and the price is really cheap ( a small steak for 5.99, really?) and it actually is very tasty.  The coffee is a little weak, but I have not had a stronger coffee in any other breakfast place either(Cora, Eggs breakfast etc)  The pancakes a re pretty good too. If you don't mind having meat in the morning, they have something with Eggs + Steak + potatoes + bread, for under $10, and its very filling and tasty."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often for breakfast because it's a great deal with decent food. For about  $10 you get bread, 3 eggs of your choice, fried potatoes, 3 meats of your choice, and 3 pancakes! I usually upgrade my pancakes with blueberries (I can never finish everything on my own) It's definitely a much better deal than what you'd get at a chain like Coras. Coffee here is not great though, it almost tastes like instant coffee.   Service is good, the food usually comes out really quick. Although when I went on a holiday they were really understaffed, there were only 2 waitresses and I felt really bad that they had to serve what looked to be 10+ tables.   Overall decent place to grab breakfast food, I haven't tried their dinner items yet but I'd be interested in trying it. Good value and it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Went to this place based off of the great reviews on Yelp.  This place is good if you got a hangover and need to grab a bite overnight. If it's during the day, I don't think the quality of their food is the greatest in Scarborough area.  I had the steak everyone talks about on Yelp. Their famous AAA sirloin steak are only 1cm thick. They asked me how I wanted it cooked and when it came, my medium steak was well done. I've worked in kitchens before and the meat was dry. (big sign that it's been cooked and left on the warmer) They cooked me a  new one but she had to go to ask someone before taking it back. If it was me, I would've taken it back on the spot and apologized. Their customer service was not very impressive.  2. Quality control for 24hour restaurants are not great. I feel like they focus on supplying their food to customers rather than quality.  3. Portion sizes are very small. My girlfriends egg Benedict for 6.99 and barely filled the plate.   If you're looking for cheap delicious steak, the Metro Square Café knocks this restaurant out with a 6.99 deal with rice on the side and tea. Always cooked to order!  Sorry for the bash, but this wasn't all that impressive as everyone claims."}
{"text":"Meh... don't understand the hype tbh... especially with the funnel cake gone... standard breakfast affair and can't say it was done well either... just ok... a little on the dry side... just - meh"}
{"text":"When we pulled up outside I almost left, but this is true don't judge a book by its cover, clean inside, very nice people, great environment and the food was super fast and very good."}
{"text":"This place is a good value for breakfast if you're in the area. Although I have only come here for breakfast, they put out good portions and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"I think it's been a while since I've truly been unable to give even a star (but Yelp has a 1 star minimum to leave a review).   We walked in and it wasn't a full house yet. There's a table to seat the 5 of us but the staff curtly tells us to wait because she will set up the table. 7 minutes later, table not set... She doesn't even go near it because she's busy going to all the tables taking their orders. Finally she just motions to us to go sit. Another ten minutes later she THROWS ONE menu on the table and without a word, walks off. It's 20 minutes since entering before we can finally order and she only asks every other person if they want a drink...   My friend gets a Fanta which is just Sprite with what tastes like Sunny D.   We wait a full 30 minutes more before one dish arrives. Mine. And it was very very very NOT worth the wait. I ordered over easy eggs with turkey bacon and it comes with home fries and toast. Not only did this take 30 minutes, but it came cold. I didn't want to wait another half hour so I just ate it. 15 minutes after that, the rest of the dishes start to arrive. The last was the most unappealing looking eggs Benedict which was made with a soft-hard yolk rather than a runny one. Sorta defeats the purpose of a poached egg. Every dish arrived cold or just slightly warm and the service was so so so so rude!! I can honestly get over the food but the service was the absolute worst!!!  This woman gestures more than speaks and when she spoke, it was rude, curt, and like she was mega annoyed. Restaurant, by the way, was not full at all!! The only time she said more than a few words to us was to tell us \"no split bill\" and \"don't touch the door, it's broken\".. and she's rude about that too!! I don't think I've ever encountered a more rude staff.   110 minutes on the worst service and bad, cold food.  I would never return and I wouldn't recommend anyone spend their hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Living in Scarborough for the past 13 years, this has become my best replacement for what was once my \"go-to\" place for late night cravings at Markham Station.  Going here for the best time, I came in with low expectations due to their location and cost efficient food options. Surprisingly, I was impressed by the quality of not only their main entres, but also their bar food as well.   Service is often quick here no matter what time you come in.  Their portions are also big and fulfilling with an average price point ranging between $5 to $12 per menu item.   So far, I've tried their AAA Striploin Steak dinner for an affordable $10+tax and a variety of their bar foods such as their fried chicken wings, onion rings, and their popular \"Pulled Pork Poutine\". Their portion sizes for their bar food are quite generous, so bring a friend when you order some of their options. I did find that their steak was often under cooked or overcooked when requesting medium rare, otherwise was still a fulfilling meal.  At this place, don't expect a meal prepared by a michelin star chef. However, if you're looking for very affordable and good tasting food both at day and late at night - this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Had Saturday brunch here. It's not a greasy spoon diner, but it's also not gourmet brunch - somewhere in the middle I'd say. Price is decent, but food was mediocre.   Smoked Salmon Benedict was too fishy tasting. Bacon on the side wasn't crispy enough, but had a nice smokey flavor. Sausages on the side were good and crispy on the ends.   The place is open 24 hours and is very clean and new inside. They also have large screen TVs and dart boards in one of the rooms.   Overall, I probably wouldn't come back and I'm not sure why this place was rated so high."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/brunch on a weekend afternoon. They seem to have a mix of things here: breakfast items and some curry dish specials. I ordered a Working B breakfast, and my girlfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The portion size is quite large for the Working B: comes with your choice of 3 meats, 3 eggs, and pancakes. In comparison the Eggs Benedict looks a little lacking. A little greasy, but for the price, it was quite good. The pancakes were nice."}
{"text":"When I think of having brunch, I usually gravitate towards to this neighborhood diner. I've been here a handful of times, but mostly on weekends during lunch. The service is always polite, the noise level is perfect for chatting and the food is acceptable. They have the usual array of brunch items, from the usual eggs/pancake/meat combinations to the fancier eggs benedict. There is nothing that will blow you away, but the prices are more reasonable than Cora's and the portions are large enough for a hearty meal. The waitress come around periodically to make sure you have enough coffee (which is bottomless) but otherwise will leave you alone to enjoy your meal. They are also open 24/7, so no need to worry about if they are open or not!"}
{"text":"It's a really great place for those late (late late late) night cravings. It used to be 24h but now I think they cut it down to 4AM. Still, it's one of the only late snack places in Scarbs. Better than Markham Station for half the price. A lot of selection, pricing is so cheap, quality isn't bad but definitely not amazing. Worth the price. I made my own pasta dish of cheese tortellini with tomato sauce ($5.99 + an extra $1 for the cheese tortellini) and it had a weird taste. My friend tried it and said it tastes like pasta cooked from the boxes sold at Walmart. Will come back because their hours and prices are amazing, not so much because of the food."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times and so far I quite like their food. Their portions are very big and generous for its price. I particularly love the Honey B breakfast, it's big enough for two people to share! I've also tried their pasta and it's pretty good too. overall all the food is quite tasty, and great for kids as well because they have a kids menu! They have adequate seating room and if it's a big group they have a room that is kind of away from the main area with doors so it's nice to be able to accommodate a group that size. Would definitely be coming back for more food! Their coffee is unfortunately quite terrible, but otherwise their food is good!"}
{"text":"Yelp is correct again; Honey B is a good enough all day breakfast greasy spoon that opens 24/7.  I had the regular all day breakfast that comprises of 2 eggs, 2 toasts, choice of protein (ham, bacon, peameal, sausage, etc) and home fries.  Everything tasted freshly made.  The services was friendly.  The washroom was clean.  Good prices and good opening hours add 0.5 star.  Overall, 3.5 stars for all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Always a go to before heading off to Costco.  Portions are huge, and if I may add, inexpensive.   I've only been here for breakfast.  It's your traditional western style breakfast restaurant, just run by Asians?  I once had a piece of hair in my egg but they replaced it quickly."}
{"text":"Pretty average place; was excited to go because of the hype I've heard. The place is Asian run and feels like it too: you need to raise your hand to get the servers attention, the place is somewhat run down and feels dirty, you need to repeat your orders since some servers don't speak English well etc   The price can't be beat though, cheap breakfast and lunch options. I had the chicken fajita with sweet potato fries (stick to plain fries, the sweet potato fries were extremely greasy and just batter) and my partner had the BLT and fries. The coffee was watered down. All in all, cost $16 for both including tip."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, ordered pancake, waffle, egg Benedict ..   The pancake, we choose to add banana, which gave perfect sweet taste and didn't need to add more syrups. A healthier choice for someone who is watching the weight  The waffle is 3-4 star (? I guess). I don't feel much special about it. It only have sugar power added on top of plain waffle, no whip cream, ice cream etc.. But if I crave for waffle again while on diet, I will come here..  The egg Benedict is okay. I chose smoke salmon to pair with it, so I guess it got a bit too salty, and the salmon flavour didn't go well with the egg and sauce.. Tasted weird.. If I will try it again with something else? Probably not..   Overall I give 4 stars because I will definitely be returning for the waffle pancake and try the working b breakfast French toast and squid ink spaghetti!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a realllllly late night meal.... probably this is one of the best places to go.  Good food at AMAZING price!!! Round the clock they have a wide verity of meals available... Even after midnight!! The server is great... very polite, helpful with good suggestions and very prompt. The quality vs price is really amazing... probably it can not get better than this in GTA.   Definitely, we'll go there again, especially if we need a meal after mid night  :-D"}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim. This place serves all day breakfast and is open for 24 hours and is likely a good spot if you're for some decent food at a great price if you're craving in the middle of the night.  The service was very friendly and the place was fairly empty with a group or two coming in while we were there to sit down and eat. The menu contains kids meals, dinner (steak and pasta), sandwiches, and breakfast. Everything is quite cheap! Note that for breakfast after 5pm there is an extra dollar charge.   We ordered a steak and eggs breakfast and chocolate chip pancakes. The steak I asked to be cooked medium rare, but it is quite a thin steak and I found it hard to chew. The flavor was okay. No complaints for something that cost 8 dollars! The eggs were good and the potatoes were the best part if the meal. They were hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It also came with two slices of buttered toast.   The pancakes were super cheap for quite a large portion, but they were a little chewy. It might have been more fresh if we had eaten in the morning. They came out at room temperature and they weren't hot enough for the butter to melt.  We also decided to order some of their pulled pork poutine which I thought was okay. It was a little too salty but the flavor wasn't bad. The fries were a little starchy feeling and I felt like it was more cheese and pulled pork on top of fries rather than poutine.   Overall a decent experience. Will we be back? Maybe. If you're looking for something cheap with decent food give this place a shot :)"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick, cheap breakfast. Service was prompt and polite. Our server was the only one working and the place was half full but we never felt neglected nor that it was slow at all. Food portions were really decent for the price point. I ordered the working b breakfast and I was stuffed! Pancakes were fluffy, I had 3 protein choices and there was a fair portion of everything.   Will this place blow your mind with service and dazzling food? Of course not. Its just great for what it is, a small hidden gem of better than reasonably good tasting food with a cheaper price."}
{"text":"2nd visit was not as perfect as the first but still a very good experience. Ordered the eggs Benedict again and though the smoked salmon was given in smaller portion.   What really disappointed me though was that the funnel cake was not available because the person who usually makes them was not there. Apparently if you want to absolutely have funnel cake then make sure you visit after 3pm on weekdays or after 1pm on weekends.  I also got the cinnamon French toast for $3.99 - It was litterally two slices of thin bread. Such a small portion and the taste was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap breakfast joint! $2.99 for 2 eggs, toast, fries and tea! Only wish they were open all day!"}
{"text":"Don't be weirded out by this weird...sketchy-esque location.  If you're looking for some post-hangover, cheap, down-to-earth, no-nonsense food, this is the place to be.  I have not been able to find anywhere else that has a cheaper breakfast menu and their portion sizes are great as well.  Would I come here deliberately again...probably not.  But in passing...most definitely!  While their food wasn't mind-blowing, if you're looking for somewhere quick, easy, and plain/simple (and cheap), this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Docking one star for a few issues that arose since my first visit.  It appears the wifi connection only works for Android devices. Both my mom and dad, who are iPhone users, have been unable to log into the wifi network, even though I could.  Not everything in the menu is excellent. I tried a few \"out of the ordinary\" items tonight, such as the poutine, honey garlic chicken wings, and beef skewers. The poutine's gravy and fries were good, but the cheese was simply shredded cheese, not cheese curds. The honey on the honey garlic chicken wings was delicious, but the chicken wings had no taste as well, which meant it was likely previously frozen. Finally the beef skewers were way too tough.  On the other hand, the striploin and philly cheesesteak are definitely highly recommended here, as well as the 1/2 pound burger and any pasta combinations."}
{"text":"Not bad but not as amazing as the reviews made it out to be. The food was just on the better side of ok but not quite 4 stars.   The service was prompt and polite - 4 stars.   The place was clean and spacious - 4 stars"}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by the plaza this restaurant is in.  The food is great, wonderful service and excellent value.  I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and I have never been disappointed.  You can come as a large group, twosome or alone for a fantastic meal.  No WiFi unfortunately but still a local hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast alot just went here today their breakfast is so cheap 2.99 for eggs and potato hash they give it so fast and absolutely delicious. I had chciken and waffles and I was surprised it was better than dirty bird which is a complete rip off. The chicken was really moist and they had dirty sauce even better than dirty birds sauce.  I hope the y become more successful in the future"}
{"text":"Service is good. Price is reasonable. And the pancake there is awesome! Just that personally i don't like the home fries there"}
{"text":"Just went for brunch for Mother's Day there and the food was good but they took a long time for one of the orders which was the hamburger combo. Most of us were finished our food by the time that order was completed. The service was OK since I could barely understand the girls English. That was tough. Cheap food though."}
{"text":"Be careful with this place. There was a fly in our food, and I feel sick the morning after eating from here. Potential safety hazard. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"A $10 dollar steak dinner??  Had to check it out for myself  Pros: Super good value  Cons: Not enough servers  It's hard to believe you can get a steak dinner for $10 these days but Honey B Hives has one and it's pretty decent for what you're paying.  On top of that, the rib steak dinner is only $17 which is pretty crazy too.  We ordered both steak dinners and a create your own pasta for our little one.  I added a soup and dessert to my meal for $3.  The soup that comes with your meal is a pretty big bowl.  It's much bigger than the bowls used elsewhere for soup. The steak dinners come with a potatoes and veggies.  The potatoes were a mix between scalloped and mashed but they were pretty good, very buttery!!  So let's be honest with the steak.  It won't be the best of the juiciest steaks you've ever had.  But for the price, they are very good steaks.  It was a very satisfying meal to say the least,  If you want a steak and don't want to break the bank, this place is a good option for you,  My little one's pasta was crazy big for the $7 price.  The table beside us got the poutine and it was huge for what you're paying as well.  It's basically the whole theme to this place if you ask me.  The only thing gripe-able about this place is the amount of servers they have.  They had exactly 1 server for a place that can serve about 30 people.  I don't know if this was a one time thing or not.  The server herself was excellent but once a party of about 12 people came, obviously she couldn't keep up to well. We came in before the group but you knew the two tables that came after would be waiting a bit longer than usual.  All in all, this is a great little place to go to get the most out of your buck.  It won't be anywhere near the best steak you've had, but for what you're paying, it's a decent trade off."}
{"text":"Food is good.  I was looking forward to try the Squid Spaghetti but unfortunately they didnt have it that day.  Should have infomed me after everyone's meal came though.  Service is not good,  there was only 2 waitress serving.  All in all,  food is good but need improvement on service."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my boyfriend because ... well, we were craving breakfast food!  I got the bacon and cheese omelette for $5.99. It came with home fries, rye toast and a few slices of oranges. Overall, the meal was okay, nothing I will come running back for. I was quite disappointed that the omelette was made with processed cheese instead of cheddar cheese. However, I can't really complain because of the low prices. My boyfriend got the working B breakfast ($9.99) and he got the turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This was my first time trying turkey bacon and I'm not sure that I can go back to regular bacon... Lastly, we had the assorted dim sum. It was good, but I would suggest going to a regular dim sum place just because it'll probably be cheaper.  We also came here for dinner one night because I was curious to try their pasta menu.  I got the black seafood squid ink spaghetti ($16.99) and I added $3 to make it a combo which came with a soup or salad and dessert. The sauce on the spaghetti was very creamy. They were also quite generous with the amount of seafood. I opted for the soup which was carrot that night and it was quite a generous portion. I was almost full just from drinking the soup. With such generous portion of the first two dishes, I was surprised that the dessert was just a square slice of cake.  Overall, I think this is a A-ok cheap eat type of restaurant but I won't be rushing back for anything in particular."}
{"text":"First time I came here for breakfast I wasn't all that impressed. I had the eggs benedict and it was cheap but it didn't taste too good. The egg is overcooked so none of the yolk oozed out. The peameal bacon was very very oily. Hollandaise sauce came out of a package and the English muffin was so salty it was inedible. The fruit cup was the only thing that saved the dish. It was nice bite sized chunks of fresh fruit and the portion is pretty generous for its price point.   The second time I came and I was instantly a fan. My boyfriend and friends wanted to come here to watch a game and grab some cheap food. So I ordered the half pound burger. It took a while for the burger to come and when it came my boyfriend was drooling. He stole half of it! The burger is juicy and oh so satisfying. The price is also great, only $4.99. Or add fries and a drink for $2 more?! All of the snacks were alright. Wings were fried crispy and wasn't dry or tiny. Service was great.  After my second visit I've been visiting this place about once or twice a month. I feel their food is good for the most part except the breakfast. Their food is a 3 star rating but the cheap prices and good services gains an extra star."}
{"text":"Really good bang for the buck. Not the BEST food around or anything, but for those prices, you can't compare. Better than most eggs smart and even some coras for half the budget. Will def go again when I crave breakfast food."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I am not satisfied at all.   The first time I came here, it was very busy. Based on the reviews, I was not surprised. As I was waiting, a woman walked in and sat down at a table that hadn't been cleaned off yet. I was waiting about fifteen minutes at this point. The staff did not acknowledge her. She hissed at them and they brought her a menu and she placed her order and had been eating it by the time I got a table.  Once I sat down, I waited about ten minutes or longer for someone to take my drink order. When I finally got the attention of someone, she told me that the other waitress was taking orders and took our menus. Now I had to get the attention of the other waitress. When I finally hailed her, I ordered my food. My boyfriend and I ordered the same thing. We got our coffee which was terrible. It was very burned. I love coffee so much and I have never tasted it this bad. When we got our food, which was steak and eggs, it wasnt fantastic. The steak was thin and salty, and it was cooked to medium, not to rare as I had requested. When the food was initially brought to us, I got mine first, then about halfway through my meal, my boyfriend got his. I never finished my coffee. I asked for the bill, requested debit, and I waited another ten minutes for the machine. If I was a dishonest person, I probably could have gotten away with walking out without paying. We stayed and paid but it was a long wait. The whole experience was probably like an hour and fourty-five minutes long.   We decided to give them another shot. We came here today. I was holding off this review until I could give them another chance. We walked in and we got a seat right away. Hurray! Things were looking up. We waited fifteen minutes before someone came to us for our drink orders, and I had to hail her down myself. My boyfriend ordered pancakes. I ordered eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. The coffee came and it was horrible again. Tasted burned. We waited again for the food, and when it as brought over, I was terribly disappointed. The plate was practically empty and I had ordered the second most expensive breakfast on the menu. The English muffin wasn't toasted. It was still cold. The smoked salmon was hardly there. The eggs were tiny, although cooked just the way I asked. And that all would be fine if it wasn't for the hollaindaie sauce. Oh my god, it was the worst thing I've ever tasted in my life. It reminded me of spoiled milk. Honestly it was like someone tried to make fondue with spoiled milk and spoiled cheese, except they put too much milk and now its a sauce. I hailed the waitress over, and I told her point blank that the food tasted like shit and feet. She took it away, told me she would talk to the kitchen, and never came back. My boyfriend finished his food. I had to hail her again to inquire as to what was happening. She came over and asked me what I would like to replace the food I ordered with, but my boyfriend had already finished eating. I knew it would be a while before I even got my food, and I felt like it would be so rude to make him wait, so I asked for the bill and we left. I spent an hour there and had a taste of horrible food that made me feel sick after."}
{"text":"Happy to have found this 24/7 all day breakfast joint in the somewhat markham area!!  Strolled in 5:45am on a Saturday morning and the place was completely empty.. But open!!  $7.99 for a steak and eggs breakfast, 4oz AAA, 2 eggs, home fries (potatoes), and 2 toast. Great deal!!  $1.99 for a side order of 3 breakfast sausages, not so great deal..  $2.30 for a cup of coffee including refills.  Coffee was made fresh, I drink mine black so my review would be - not the best coffee, tasted mild..  Steak was great!!  Home fries was great!!  Sausages were just as expected! But pricy compared to the breakfast steak combo..  Bill came up to $13.97 plus tip.  Solid 3.7 stars Canadian Breakfast place! Took off points for the coffee."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of HK-style western cuisine. It's fantastic, the unexpected use of fried rice in the souvlaki plate, the bread rolls, and the unexpected variety of dishes (many of them honey-themed). Oh, and the staff spoke Cantonese, which may have definitely added to it.  I was pleasantly surprised that the souvlaki platter came with 3 skewers, for $10.99 along with a bowl of salad, fried rice and steamed vegetables. The tzaziki sauce was small, and the  souvlaki was more tender and juicy than what I normally get. The bread rolls were glazed with honey and served with a container of cinnamon butter.  Service was excellent. The one waitress did well making sure our water was topped up and was friendly, contrary to my experiences at many Chinese-run restaurants. The washrooms were modern and clean. Angled parking is plentiful and the decorations were very modern - I noted a party room as well. Would love to come back and try one of many other dishes on their menu if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the small plaza of a gas station is this little gem.   Located in Scarborough, this is a 24 hour restaurant with food that's not only delicious but extremely affordable. We came here for a quick bite of food and definitely were not disappointed.   The day we went, it was busy if that. Only one server was in, so it was definitely stressful for her. She sat us down, apologizing for the wait and seemed very polite. I ordered the Waffles with Ice cream, and my friend the Eggs Benedict with Peameal.   The waffles were creamy, and paired so well with the vanilla ice cream. Two really were not enough!   The Eggs Benedict was also so good, but we found it a bit too buttery towards the end. It didn't stop us from eating it though, delicious!   We've definitely put this on our \"Must Go Back\" list for another time!"}
{"text":"Honey B Hives is a small little all day breakfast restaurant that has a very affordable menu. The value you get here is great and a much cheaper option than going to somewhere like Cora's.  Service is fairly quick and orders are placed by the servers on an iPad ordering system. The restaurant is clean and nicely furnished.  Have only tried the standard breakfast items like eggs, bacon, sausage which are good. One stand out is their home fries which are so good! Their waffles and pancakes are pretty good as well.  Will definitely head back to try other menu items and its recommended as a cheap and fast breakfast option."}
{"text":"Another what is supposed to be a friendly family diner ruined by mediocre borderline rude service below average food and drinking glasses smell like eggs"}
{"text":"Great place, great service! Nice family restaurant and the food is good too!! This place has special memories for me and I try to go when I am in the area. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Super basic breakfast menu. Great prices and absolutely no frills.   Not sure if i would go back to this place. It was just so basic, makes me feel like I could have made myself eggs at home. I'd go back if I was ever in a pinch - since it is 24 hours."}
{"text":"Well worth the value.  2 eggs, sausage, toast, home fries for only $4.99   You might as well get pancakes for an extra $4   Pretty good brekky food. Lots of tables and quick service.   Bottomless coffee !!!"}
{"text":"The price is cheap here but the oil they use for French fires sometimes seems not fresh every time ! They are quite busy make sure you have patient to wait ."}
{"text":"A very affordable and nice breakfast place. Only $9.99 for a very filling breakfast. I got the Work B Breakfast which came with 3 fluffy pancakes, 3 eggs any style (I got scrambled), and sausages/bacon/turkey bacon. Turkey bacon is much better than bacon, so if you already have turkey bacon and you're contemplating between bacon and something, I would go with something. The bacon was still alright though. Service was pretty fast and good considering there was only one server serving everyone. She was nice the whole time."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu, everything is insanely cheap here! Meals range from $5 - $12, and the servings are large.  The biggest regret I have, however, is ordering this Honey Dijon Chicken Burger. LOOK AT THAT PICTURE. IT WAS LITERALLY JUST A BUN WITH CHICKEN AND HONEY!!!!!! Honestly, this is not what I was thinking when I read \"chicken burger\".... it was just very, VERY bland and dry.  As for the breakfast meals, the portions are large but not fresh. I was looking forward to the potatoes, but they weren't crispy at all ;; I will say the omelettes taste the best out of everything included.  Overall, this restaurant is a pretty great deal. The price is extremely ideal and the service is great too! However, the food just doesn't taste amazing.... so it's give and take. I may come back in the future if I'm looking for a quick cheap eat (especially late at night because this place opens until 3 AM). I will never order the chicken burgers here ever again tho!!"}
{"text":"I cannot, cannot, cannot stress how impressed I am by Honey B Hives.  I tend to avoid 24hour restaurants and I've been trying to do so until there was absolutely nothing opened at 11PM on a Tuesday night. I've already tried Magic Noodle (which is definitely worth a try - take a peek at my review! [[shameless self-advertising]]) But I looked over the Yelp reviews of Honey B and decided to take a shot.  This restaurant is tucked behind a gas station, next to a bar, an Indian restaurant, and an adult video store.  After going over some oddly placed speed bumps I arrived at a very ordinary restaurant.  Inside is bright, it's clean, and it definitely smells like breakfast.  The server was polite and efficient - he seated us, got us our menus, and then took our orders on an iPad.  When he got me my take-out box he pulled the bag apart and placed it so it would be easier for me to fit the container into the bag.    I had the Working B Breakfast and I would've paid double the amount for what it costed me.  The pancakes are fluffy and happy (not like the soggy ones you get from 24 hour diners), the peameal, ham, and bacon were tasty and not too oil, the home fries (my boyfriend ate all of them), and the eggs were done perfectly for an over-easy.  The only thing that I was unsatisfactory was that they sprinkled a little powdered sugar onto my eggs from my pancakes and I was mad confused for a second or two.  My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs.  He destroyed everything on his plate and then helped me destroy the pull-pork poutine.  I had to order thanks to the previous reviews and it was most definitely worth it.  The pulled-pork + fries + cheese combination was dynamite.  The fries were crisp, the gravy was 100% and everything mixed together is something I am re-ordering when I come back next time.  This meal costed me roughly $30.  This place was excellent from service, to decoration (read the chalkboard where the darts are haha), and to quality of food.    Never mind comparing it to other 24hour diners it is in the same league as higher end restaurants.    My boyfriend has already issued his statement of returning here if he ever decides he needs late night drunk meals on the weekends. (Note: I will be sober driving and will kick him out of the restaurant myself if he disturbs the peace)"}
{"text":"Came here for early morning breakfast. EARLY (1AM) the food is good, and the service is even better!!  it's a super cute restaurant. highly recommend... way better, and inexpensive for what its worth. rather eat at honey b than coras to be honest."}
{"text":"This place is great to stop by for a quick breakfast! Literally you can stop in any time as its 24 hours and their pricing is ridiculously cheap! Portion sizes are just right and the best part; they're SUPER FAST. Friendly staff, fast service, clean environment... they've got the basics down to a great breakfast place! For the pricing; you can't do much better!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and thought we'd give it a try as we were looking for a  brunch spot. Sad to say we were disappointed.   I got the Working B's Breakfast which came with 3 large eggs, 3 sides (I got bacon, peamale and sausage), fruits, and 3 pancakes. My girlfriend got eggs Benedict with spinach and a side of sweet potato fries. The pancakes, sunny side up eggs and eggs Benedict were delicious, and the rest were only mediocre or not good at all. Everything else tasted soggy, especially the sweet potato fries. It had an odd texture  and it felt like the deep fried part was melting off the potato... it wasn't satisfying to eat at all. My girlfriend felt nauseous after eating it because she didn't like the softness of the fries. It also tasted bland. The home fries were good though, if you like the bigger less crunchy ones. The fruits (orange, honeydew and cantaloupe) were fresh and sweet, better than the ones served at Cora's.   There was only one server working so she was pretty busy. When the rush was over it seemed like she was more occupied cleaning the tables than refilling our water/checking up on us. She was friendly though and made sure the food came out quick.   Overall it's a pretty inexpensive place and they give you a large portion. If you're looking for breakfast/lunch/dinner anytime during the day (they're open 24 hours), would recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"They're open 24 hours AND they have funnel cake! The chicken wings are really cheap and for $2 you get more fries than you can finish. Food may not be the best, but their desserts are really good. For the price, you can't go wrong.  It has a good old school diner feel to it and the staff are friendly. I usually go in the later hours of the night so my experiences may be different from others. I like it because there aren't very many 24 hour restaurants around that aren't drive-through."}
{"text":"Whether it's a early morning or a late night adventure, Honey B Hives is my go to. Their breakfast food is fresh, delicious, and surprisingly cheap. Value breakfast for $2.99...$2.99 !! (After 3pm add $1). BUT $2.99?!?! If you're not a big eater, the value breakfast is good enough. It includes 2 eggs, toast, and home fries. I always order their Honey B Breakfast (which comes with 1 side - bacon/sausage/peameal/ham) for only $4.99 with a cup of coffee. Servings are really big and service is very quick. But my number one favourite dish here is the Squid Ink Pasta. Mmmmm so delicious. You really have to try it to know how delicious it is. Warning..Don't order this dish though if you're on a date or going on a date or anywhere important.... Don't wear white when you're eating this either. Because this dish turns your teeth and mouth black! And if you're a messy eater, your clothes are gona get black too, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Saw that this place is open 24/7 and wanted to try it out. Seen some other people say they're only open till 3, I didn't see any indication of that though.  Here was our order  Pulled pork poutine: serving was quite big. Probably larger than the entrees to be honest. However, it's not heavy like you'd expect a poutine to be. Pulled pork also has some onions and mushroom as well. The only knock I have on the poutine was that it was it was too much poutine and not enough pulled pork in regards to flavour.  Carbonara: very simple creamy pasta that isn't over powering in flavour. It's a nice plate of pasta, but if you repeatedly need to get a carbonara fix, it won't satisfy that craving.  Eggs Benedict with peameal: thing you'll notice immediately is that is a very big plate that seems a bit lonely/empty. You get your 2 poached eggs on English muffins, 3 small slices of Orange, and a few cubes honeydew and cantaloupe. Would've liked some home fries. The biggest disappointment though were that the eggs were too cooked. The yolk needs to be runny. It's got to be soft boiled.  As critical as I was. I saw some other patrons order the big breakfast and it certainly did look big and delicious as well. It's definitely a place I'd give another go."}
{"text":"Came here twice in a week for breakfast.   Food: portions are good to massive in size. Home fries seem very fresh. A bit big than I would like but you know they're potatoes unlike mcds fries (still love them tho).   Service: customer service isn't their greatest forte but food comes out quick. They are very on top of things.   Price: super reasonable. My eggs benny on smoked salmon and English muffin with a fruit bowl of honey dew and cantaloupe was 6.99 plus tax. Other places I've been to is about 10.99 (comes with home fries).   Decor: comfy homey ambiance (not quite like ikea tho). Clean and organised.   Final thought: great place for all day breakfast that is open 24/7, it's like a cheaper Denny's. Will definitely come back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First of all, I didn't like the look of the place. I had breakfast here, it was very bland and didn't even touch half of it.  However, it was cheap, which is why a lot of people like it. That's the only good thing I can think of."}
{"text":"i think i just found my all time favourite breakfast place!!!  You're looking at between $5-$10 for breakfast, super affordable. The best part is , there's no line up on weekends."}
{"text":"3 star + 0.5 star for opening 24/7  I have only been to Honey B Hives Restaurant for Breakfast so my review is based on my breakfast experiences.  Good Value: $2.99 for a simple breakfast is definitely an excellent value. My sunny side up eggs were cooked perfectly. Home fries though was hard and dry.   Well Prepared: $5.99 for Western Omelette was really fluffy! Hardly recommended!  Lack of Consistency: Egg Benedict ($6.99) with Spinach. Hollandaise was really good as it was made fresh when ordered (20 minute wait if kitchen is busy). Love the nice bite of the spinach. But one of the poached eggs was perfectly runny while the other was well done?   Service was OK both time but I don't know why the waitress would go around asking other tables for coffee refills while never bother with my table?  I will come back to try out their lunch/dinner offering and maybe even their funnel cake!"}
{"text":"I wanted to write this review after visiting last night, but came home and immediately passed out in a food coma. The portions here are massive especially considering the price you pay, so we may have overdone it a bit by ordering four things for two people last night... blame me and my gluttony...  After reading reviews, I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to try, and I did NOT hold back. I ordered the pulled pork poutine and mussels in white wine sauce to start, thinking they would both be fairly small appetizer portions, but no, they are like full plates. Followed that up with the squid ink spaghetti while my mom ordered the salmon linguine (they ran out of linguine so she substituted with spaghetti.) I also decided to add $4 to make my order a combo, with a soup and salad and dessert (creme brulee). For $3 you get a choice of soup OR salad and a dessert.  I think my expectations were quite high, so the food didn't blow me away. The poutine ($4.99), which everyone raves about, was good and was my mom's favourite dish. I liked the barbeque sauce they used on the pork, which added a nice bit of sweetness to it. I think it could have used more cheese and could have been warmer. I would have liked to see those stringy bits of melted cheese, which were a rather lacking. 3.5/5  I liked the mussels in white wine sauce ($6.99) and was surprised that my mom didn't find it flavourful enough. But I thought the flavour was fine, the sauce was tasty, and the mussels were abundant. 4/5  The salmon spaghetti ($13.99) was unfortunately a miss for both me and my mom. The sauce (was there even sauce?) was really really light, I think it might have been just olive oil based. As a result, the dish overall was a bit bland, and the noodles were a bit tough and dry. The salmon was okay. 2/5  Luckily for me, the squid ink spaghetti ($16.99) I ordered was a lot better. With all the squid ink sauce, it was definitely nice and moist, and also made my noodles softer. There was a decent amount of seafood in there - a couple of shrimp, small scallops, squid, etc. Flavouring was pretty light and let most of the natural seafood flavours shine through. I mostly just love the look of the pasta with all the noodles being all dark and black and ominous looking... mmm right up my alley. Be warned though, the ink will get all over your lips no matter how carefully you try to eat - I thought I looked pretty badass, mom thought it was hilarious. Probably best to avoid ordering this one on a first date... unless your date is into that goth look. 3.5/5  The salad, soup and dessert that came with my meal were pretty standard. The soup (I think it was cream of cauliflower) was way too watery, not creamy enough at all, and a bit bland. The creme brulee was okay, although there were parts of the top that weren't hard enough so didn't crack when I tapped at them, they just kind of... sank into the custard. Tasted fine though.  There was only one waitress working, but also not a lot of other patrons. The waitress was sweet, and I thought made a good effort to provide good service. She brought us an extra spoon when I asked so we could share the soup, and also an extra bowl. She was also pretty attentive and brought our food out super quickly from the kitchen.   I think this is a cute little diner to check out if you are in the area. The prices are reasonable, but not like dirt cheap or anything, especially for the pasta. The portions are, however, substantial for what you are paying - we only finished the mussels and most of the poutine and maybe half of each our pasta dishes. In total our bill for the night came out to about $53. Some of their other items however are a steal e.g. steak for $10, so may come back for a second try. In general I didn't have any problems with this place, I think it's pretty decent, but just didn't find it to be as amazing as other reviewers did."}
{"text":"Don't get the eggs Benedict. I gave it another shot, this time with peameal. It was disgusting. The English muffin was not toasted enough and became soggy. The hollandaise was less edible than the last time I came here. If you do come here stick to bacon sausages and eggs and stay far away from the eggs Benedict. There was no finesse in this dish. I couldn't finish. Eek me thinks not is an understatement"}
{"text":"Man the food was so terrible!!! The worst breakfast I ever had in my whole life...actually I couldn't even eat the whole thing..tasted so nasty! Chicken breast tasted like paper, like turkey, I don't even know what the hell it was, it smells bad too, I just fed my dog with it.. Asian people own it and run it.. they should stick to their Chinese food.. they can't make breakfast at all.. I wasted like $15 there. never ever going back there"}
{"text":"Came here due to the great ratings and because I rarely find myself in the area.  This place has 2-star quality food and service. We had the Italian sausage pasta and the salmon pasta; both watery.   This place gets an additional star for the prices which does increase the value of this place a bit."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap prices , awesome selection, good portions and our waitress was very nice.     I would come here if ur hungry and want something cheap   This place is way better than markham station and they are also 24 hours. Better food quality and cheaper prices.  Next time I might try the black seafood pasta"}
{"text":"This place has everything from price to quality and best thing is it's open 24/7!! I ordered the breakfast for $4.99 for my girlfriend and got the 1/2 burger combo with a drink and fries for $6.99. That is way cheaper than most places I've been to and very hard to be able to get that kind of a deal with that large of a portion. The only reason why it's not a 5 star was the patty was slightly overcooked so it wasn't as juicy as it should have been but overall I am really digging this place and I can't wait to try their funnel cake and pasta."}
{"text":"i really dont know why i keep coming back here time after time.    i feel like im always getting tricked when i come here. the picture shows a grilled steak with grill marks.. then when it comes out... its a pan fried tough rubber shoe.    i understand you get what you paid for.   Theres also that one time i got the steak and breakfast combo..  i told the waitress can i get that cooked medium rare?  she goes.. you cant select how done it is .. because its too thin...  I thought for that price i was maybe getting the same type of steak as the 9.99 steak special.  but nope...  if you get the breakfast version you are getting the worlds thinnest steak.  practically two slices of hotpot beef.   feel so jipped everytime.  i'll probably return still :("}
{"text":"Yes! Just to confirm ~ you get the most bang out of your buck!   This is the first time I came here as I received a message a while ago from \"possibly\" the owners asking me to try this place out. Let's just say, the service was great - refilled my coffee like 4 times within the hour, and the food was decent for the price.   Refillable coffee ~ $1.38 Onion rings ~ $2.99 Jr. B Breakfast ~ $3.99 (2 egg-cheese omelette, toast, home-fries)  Honey B Breakfast ~ $4.99 (2 eggs, 1 choice of bacon, ham, peameal bacon, sausage, turkey bacon, toast, home-fries)  Cinnamon French toast ~ $3.99   Will come back to try other foods!"}
{"text":"Came here for a small lunch with a friend, and it was quite easy to spot where it was even though this was our first time coming here.  The waitress was busy attending to another table when we arrived, and it seemed like she was the only one there. But they weren't busy either.  I got the pulled pork sandwich, and the waitress suggested I can upgrade $2 to add some fries which I declined. My friend got the honey b breakfast. My sandwich was really juicy, and it had lots of mushrooms and some onions in it too. There are no descriptions on the menu so watch out if you don't like anything like mushrooms. The sauce started to leak everywhere as I bit into it, which resulted in sticky hands.  The bill was really cheap too, quite similar to City Hollywood Cafe pricing (located at Market Village). Its a nice small spot for families with the noise level being average, and next time I will try some of their breakfast items."}
