{"text":"This was my first time to eat at Fazoli's...ever. I've heard amazing things, so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the Lunch special with Fettuccini Alfredo & side salad. The noodles were a bit dried out but the sauce was super yummy. The side salad had quite a few issues; half of the lettuce was mushy/wilted and the red onion pieces were slimy and inedible. The breadsticks were most definitely the best part (rivals Olive Garden)! I'll try again, but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru."}
{"text":"I stopped in after lunch at Lola's just for the breadsticks!  They are heaven and about 100 times better than Olive Garden if you can believe that!  The food is just ok. But what you expect to get for a fast food Italian place. But the breadsticks....oh those bread sticks are well worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"Ah, they are cheap and drive-thru is alright. The food on the other hand is kind of crappy. I find it extremely salty, probably masking the fact that their food has no flavor without it.   I got the sampler combo, it comes with twice baked lasagna, spaghetti w/meat sauce and alfredo. The lasagna is probably my favorite out of the three, the alfredo being the least favorite. The alfredo lacks any flavor! Its just eating noodles with some thick sauce slathered over it with no apparent taste. I didn't detect any hint of cheese or anything. The combo is about $7.99 and comes with a drink and breadsticks. It used to come with a salad or pizza but now have to add $1.49 to the price. I was stupid enough to add a caesar salad to the combo. What a waste of a buck fifty!! It was just iceberg lettuce with some cherry tomatoes and shredded carrots (The kind that is pre-bagged at the stores) It didn't even have romaine! Never again. If anything I should have gotten the pizza and make my own damn salad at home!   My boyfriend got the chicken penne with basil. I tried it. It kind of sucked. I didn't taste any basil. No flavor at all.  Sometimes if going through the drive-thru, you might have to wait 15 mins! This last time, we got our food  fast, but the time before that, I swear, we were waiting for at least 20 mins!   Probably will still return if really craving some crappy italian food for cheap and am lazy. But, I might as well make my own food at home!"}
{"text":"Stale breadsticks and undercooked pasta. Unprepared for lunch rush. I used to love grabbing a quick bite here, but not anymore."}
{"text":"I haven't had this in yeaarrrrsss! Still same great food. But the breadsticks are the real mvp!"}
{"text":"I think the food here is nice for inexpensive, fast food.  The baked lasagna is pretty killer good.  But what really makes this place awesome is the service.  Seriously, the people that work at this place are so totally kind.  I think it is the management because they are super nice and I think it makes the employees treat the customers really nicely.  If you are sick of rude customer service, go here for a refreshing change!"}
{"text":"Awful. Frozen over cooked chicken with a grey-colored covering (think it was supposed ti be cheese). Seriously you can find better Chicken Parm at Sara Lee.  The red sauce was straight out of a can.   The pasta is not fresh made and I doubt any consideration is given to quality of food.  Really really disgusting!  Not sure how they stay in business. This is not the kind of food that I go out to eat."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place & its sub par food. I had some type of penne dish & a slice of pepperoni pizza. I would liken the pasta to something you might find in the frozen food section at any grocery store, something you would pop in the microwave. I have definitely had better frozen pizza than what they serve here. I would probably rather eat Italian food from an airport or mall food court before I would ever come back here. Scusa Fazoli's."}
{"text":"From my experience, the team they have at this store has done a phenomenal job of turning this place around.  It was never terrible, but I had a couple of meals here over the last several years that weren't great.  I think that's changed as I've been here 3 times in the last month and it's been great every time.  It's nice to have a fast Italian alternative that's a good value for the money and the employees here seem to truly care about the customer experience.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten here in a long time. Went through the drive thru to get 2 sampler plates and the portions were tiny. Spent almost $20 without drinks and we were still hungry afterwards. Not a good value."}
{"text":"I love the baked ziti. The breadsticks cannot be beat. When I get my craving for simple pasta, this is my go to place. However, I have ordered meatballs to go as a side...And have never received them."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian spot, been coming for lunch for a few months. Staff always friendly. Missing my chicken Asiago melt they franchise took out tho :("}
{"text":"Definitely good when you're in the mood for a carb-overload at good price. The breadsticks are unlimited when you dine-in (idk if that's a good thing...we went overboard). The staff was very friendly.   All in all...an excellent fast food meal, without the fast food feeling."}
{"text":"My daughter loves the spaghetti and breadsticks. Food quality is average for he price."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. And for the price its even that much better . Most of the employees are very pleasant and have great customer service but the female manager is not so friendly. Other than that this place is amazing"}
{"text":"Eh, it's good for drive through Italian food when the kids are hungry and I don't feel like cooking. Breadsticks are good, probably cooked in margarine (eck). The other food is not bad, and I love the concept of fast Italian food."}
{"text":"Giving two stars only because the food was mediocre. My fianc√© and I stopped at this location on our way back from vacation passing through Madison and the customer service was awful! We decided we wanted drinks after placing our order in the drive-thru and so, like most places, we thought adding the drinks at the window would be perfectly fine...wrong!   First the lady working the window was just rude beyond belief (rolling her eyes when we asked to add the drinks, not saying please or thank you) but she recalculated the price and we handed her the money. Then we asked her to toss some parm packets in the bag, again..is this unacceptable behavior nowadays because she acted like we just attempted to punch her in the face continuing her rudeness. Then..she comes back and says \"I am sorry it won't let me do the transaction together (for the added sodas)\" and hands our change back. Okay..we are now under the impression she is going to come back and take the rest of the money and ring the drinks up separate...NOPE..she hands us our food bag and says \"Sorry again...have a nice day\"....what just happened here?!?!?!!!   Then we parked to eat and realized the parm packets weren't in there either...I had water I was willing to drink with my meal and say screw the soda but really now she neglects to do the other thing we asked politely for her to do? My fiance goes inside and the manager says to him \"Yeah I will talk to her about it, she knows how to add items to an order\". At this point I would imagine for the issues we had to deal with he would do the appropriate thing and comp the sodas and apologize...nope... He says he will charge us for small sodas and give us the bigger size...   The last thing we are is crooks trying to get a free dollar something soda but as a manager myself I would have definitely comp'd them and sent the customer off somewhat satisfied. Horrible customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"I normally do not like to review fast food establishments, because they are normally large chains that have about the same stuff all over. Fazoli's is a little different. First it is Italian and not the normal burger or chicken place. The food is good, not a great Italian meal that you would find in Italy, but good and filling. It is served hot and fresh. The breadsticks are above average and you get as many as you want.   If you want fast food, but not the normal, give Fazoli's a try."}
{"text":"Awesome service and the food is great! The alfredo is a bit lighter than Olive Garden which I personally like and the breadsticks are to DIE FOR. Also if you save your receipt there is a website to fill in a survey and you get a free spaghetti/sauce entree (regular sized which is good sized) for the price of a drink (turns out to be less than $2)! This is a great deal because even if you do this they give you another receipt and you can keep getting the deal. Also if you go before 3 they have a good lunch special which is 2 1/2 portions of pasta/lasagna and a drink for $5! Great fast restaurant and the manager is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Fazoli's for me just isn't a restaurant. It's a lifestyle. The food is fantastic, the employee's are beyond kind, plus the breadsticks are one of the greatest things I've ever consumed."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating from Fazoli's and it was amazing! My food was made correctly and was delivered early. The cheese pizza was amazing and I wished I ordered more! The breadsticks were very flavorful. I also got a cookie and it was very soft and delicious! Would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Fazoli's does not make their food fresh like they say they do, the customer service is horrible and the wait time is 30 minutes to 1 hour. Very slow waiters and management is not very nice and does not solve problems, the back of the restaurant has  cock roaches and ants it is very dirty and not sanitary. Go to the Olive Garden for italian food instead! They are so much better trust me."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this drive thru restaurant! The food is yummy and it's drive thru! Perfect on a work nite when u don't want 2 cook. We have tried the spaghetti, lasagna and bread sticks."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Fazoli's for about 4 years.  The service has only gotten better!  Julie started out as an employee who was always friendly when I went throught the drive-thru, now she is a manager.  This store goes out of their way to ensure that they get you customized order perfect and they'll even throw in a couple breadsticks if the wait is too long.  Speaking of those breadsticks, they can't be beat.  When you combine that with good consistent quality of the other food and new items that keep giving you fresh options :)"}
{"text":"Be careful coming here. I had bad service here before but I wanted to give them another chance. The Service was good but what happened after made me sick. Roaches were crawling on the walls and my table. My family freaked out and left. We told the supervisor what happened.  She said ok we'll take care of it. Good luck fazolis."}
{"text":"I am not a pasta person but I am a sub sandwich person. I had the Italiano for lunch today. It has turkey, ham, bacon, lettuce, provolone, tomato and mayo. I am not sure what made this sandwich so good. Probably all the sodium and mayo. It is toasted and they toasted it just right with a little bit of crunch around the edges. The bacon was crispy which is a really nice considering most places just heat up raw bacon and its chewy and disgusting."}
{"text":"The older woman with red hair & gray roots is a horrible representative of this establishment.  She has been the counter worker the last 3 visits and she is always unpleasant and upsetting. There is supposed to be a $6.99 whole pizza special on Mondays per in-store flyer, when we ordered it she told us we have to do carry out to get that price or it is $4.00 more to dine in for the pizza. It does not say this on the sign and it's such a unfriendly policy- there were tons of tables. Last time I order the special in the driveway it took 25 minutes to get my pizza & they had me park in the lot to wait.  This time they make it in 10 minutes & demanded we leave. We sat down while waiting for the pizza, so my child could have his drink, my mom ordered a salad. After we got our order my mom wanted to eat her salad- not be kicked out- that lady came over and said \"THAT PIZZA IS TO GO!\" I said, \"Yeah it's to-go, we didn't open it.\" What a crazy yatch- like she owns the place- it's so rude to do to your patrons- yeah that pizza was, \"to go\" like \"to go in my mouth.\" Next time I'll take my business \"to-go\" ELSEWHERE.  Don't run these wack specials with wack stipulations."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places until the last time I ordered a submarino and I found a piece of kitchen sponge in my sandwich  I will try again soon because I have always had good experiences with Fazolis"}
{"text":"Very frustrating experience.  Our order was very simple but the cashier couldn't get it right.  While waiting for our food I watched the beleaguered manager apologizing to every table.  Every customer had a problem with their food or order.  We waited twenty minutes for our food and decided to leave.   I have never experienced more incompetence.  Never again....."}
{"text":"I had a coupon so stopped by for lunch. It was still to expensive. I had a Turkey Club  and a double slice of Cheese Pizza. With coupon it was still almost $11 and my pizza was burnt to hell. I couldn't even eat the pizza because all of the burnt black spots just didn't look right. The turkey sub was just okay. I can get a bigger sub from Subway that tastes better. With the right coupon I do like certain things here but they aren't consistent as far as the taste and quality of the food. There is a drive thru or you can eat inside and get free bread sticks."}
{"text":"It's a quiet place to enjoy an inexpensive lunch; the food comes out quickly and the staff have great personalities. We were served by Kevin who was friendly, funny, and very attuned to getting you what you need.  Honestly, you get good food for very low prices in a comfortable environment, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Terrible service waited an hour for my food and it wasn't even hot... won't return back to this location because of the service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing here... and service is great... but today I was in the drive thru and I saw the manager and another emplyee walk out from the trash can area outside... which is fine... but then a few minutes later thet walked back there again... with no trash! Why would they be hiding out in the trash can area? Something doesnt seem right about this. It seems too suspicious. This makes me feel very uncomfortable comming here. I cant say that I know what they were up too, but it didnt look good! Besides... what normal person hangs out with another dude behind the stinky trash cans?   This manager was wearing a blue shirt and had long dark hair in a pony tail. The other employee was wearing a red shirt and a hat. Looked like he had a shaved head. Both were skinny.   Not a good look for you guys!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay for a fast food Italian restaurant. They bring you our food and they clean it too; it's like they are trying to convert to an actual restaurant with waiters and bus boys. The unlimited breadsticks are for dine-ins only. Have only had one bad service where they took a while for my one meal but they did handle it well by apologizing and giving me a coupon for a free meal next time."}
{"text":"Fazolis is always delicious.  Unfortunately I don't have one in my town but whenever we are here we go to Fazolis.  I always love the spicy sampler and everyone loves the butter soaked breads ticks.  Great place for a good, inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"I got the pasta combo dinner, I think it was like $10 and I got a side salad, breadsticks and pasta dish.  The meal was ok for being hungry and not wanting to go far from home :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Free breadsticks...And probably the best breadsticks I have ever tasted. My favorite dish is the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. And then filing up on the amazing and endless free breadsticks. Better than olive garden and more than half the price. After all...it's fast food."}
{"text":"The service was not spectacular. Started ordering with one guy, he walked away and another jumped in. Then we ordered the chicken parm and was sadly disappointed to find out that it was pretty much a frozen processed chicken breast. The only good tasting items were the breadsticks and the side salad that we could have easily made at home."}
{"text":"Who knew drive thru fast food Italian could be so delicious! I mean the marinara is on point and the breadsticks put Olive Garden to shame. They have a strawberry Italian ice that is super refreshing and the customer service has always been great. Never a complaint. I drive 20 min to feed my craving for some Fazolis... So does my hard to please bf. This says a lot."}
{"text":"My wife said let's try this new place I was hesitant to try Italian drive-through food .But I must say it was way better than the Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby. The large pictures on the walls of kids monochromatically eating noodles was a little off-setting, but otherwise, you get what you pay for. I had the chicken margherita for (I think) $4. The crust wasn't crispy, but there were a solid amount of good tasting toppings. The breadsticks were also a nice addition. The key to this restaurant is finding the cheap, big servings and not expecting too much. For this particular day, that's all I asked for."}
{"text":"Longest wait for food ever.  Came in and there was only one table sitting down.   Ordered food at 12:05 (kids spaghetti and a chicken parm and spaghetti).  Watched people come in for lunch and all were served before us.  The girl came to us twice with food that wasn't ours.   Finally at 1230 the guy who took our order walks by and notices our number is still on the table and no food.  I dont know if they forgot us or gave our food to someone else, but a 25 minute wait for fast food is crazy."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  I typically order the chicken parmesan meal, which comes covered in cheese and spaghetti. The garlic butter breadsticks accompanying the meal are soggy, but flavorful.  In need of a filling meal and craving Italian? Consider Fazoli's."}
{"text":"I love Fazoli's, and this one is in a nice area and is always clean. I wish there were more of these in Vegas! If you eat in they include unlimited breadsticks. Always eat in! I have never done the drive-thru but I have always been curious."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad, everything Is frozen and microwaved, stood there and watched the trainee warm up the food. And everything taste like lean cuisine meals, portions are small prices are pretty high for the quality of food"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Very fast service! So far I have had the chicken carbonara and lasagna and peperoni pizza. They were all delicious. I love their strawberry drink."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but the food was tasty and the customer service was excellent.  Very friendly staff, especially for relatively young adults. I was most impressed by this. I had the chicken parm and my husband had lasagna and a slice of pizza. Good for when you want something quick and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Excellent service by Denzel! Great, reasonably priced food. Try the chicken carbon. We wondered in and were impressed by the service and then the food! The all you can eat breadsticks were yummy too! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The only saving grace of this restaurant are their unlimited breadsticks. I've tried their pasta and it leaves much to be desired. The pasta tasted like the frozen pasta that I microwave at home. So not good!   BUT I've also tried their pizza, and their pizza is pretty good and pretty cheap too. So if you're looking for a place to get pretty decent pizza by the slice at a reasonable price then come here. Their breadsticks are awesome though. I would probably come back just for that."}
{"text":"The place was horrible and food was well not very good . It did have good bread sticks , pizza was atrocious . I live nearby and the place is Closed. The signs have been removed and the interior is being torn out ."}
{"text":"As Mark also stated I don't like to review chain places (although I have). Fazolis is different, yes its a chain. I grew up in the Pardeeville area and the closest side of Madison was the east side. My mom always took my brother and I here whenever we came down. We always loved the pizza and free breadsticks. The pizza wont win any awards, the breadsticks however far superior to Olive Gardens. Within the last year they revamped the interior and menu. Prices did go up and they offer more expensive combos. The pizza is always good, I hear the Chicken Alfredo is about Olive Garden quality.   Overall this place is pretty quick, accurate and the bread sticks are always fresh! I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If you decided to have some quick Italian food, then come here. Everytime when I come here to dine in, I usually order the Spaghetti with meatball with Pepperoni Pizza and drink. The best part is that if you dine in, you get unlimited breadsticks. The food here is good and delicious. Would come back! :)"}
{"text":"First let me give you my take on Fazoli's. Fazoli's is to Italian food, as Panda Express is to Chinese food. It may not be authentic, it's fast food, but I like it.  I had the Ultimate Sampler, Fettuccine Alfredo, Meat Lasagna, Spaghetti and Penne Pasta with Meat Sauce, endless bread sticks, $6.99, with a soda and tax just over $9.  I will start with the bread sticks, they were very good, by themselves or using them to sop up the left over sauce, very tasty.  Lasagna, noodles with ricotta and meat sauce poured over top,  Penne pasta with meat sauce poured over the top. Spaghetti with meat sauce poured over the top. Fettuccine pasta with Alfredo sauce poured over the top.  If you keep in mind it's fast food, this is how you would make lasagna and the rest of the food. You have pans of sauces, pans of cooked meat (chicken, meatballs, etc) and vegetables, with boiling water to quickly cook the different pastas. Then combine them in as many combinations you can. You boil the noodles, add meat or vegetables (if the dish calls for it) and pour sauce over the top, Voila, Italian fast food.  It's not going to compare to, nor intended to compete with, an authentic Italian restaurant, old family recipes, sauce cooking all day long. For what it is, it's good.  They also have salads, pizza and sandwiches. The sodas are Coke genre,  If you have eaten Fazoli's before, this is a nice location, with a very good staff, always checking to see if you need anything. If you haven't been to Fazoli's, I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"CLOSED  This place was pretty decent for a cheap \"Italian\" meal, though it was hard to eat here on any day but Sunday since Montesano's Italian Deli is within the same block.  It will be missed!"}
{"text":"Why isn't there a Fazoli's in AZ!!?!?!?!?  There used to be and now they are all closed.  I wish they would come back.   Every time we come to Vegas, we have to make a trip to Fazoli's and eat as much food as we can.  The bread sticks, which are my favorite, are soft, buttery, garlicky, and have just the right amount of salt.  No matter what you order, red sauce, white sauce, pasta, pizza, their new flat bread sandwich-things...everything is super good!  The only thing I think they  could improve on are the salads.  You can tell they have been previous prepared and sitting in the fridge.  Either way, it's fast Italian food...it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a busy Wednesday evening with a couple of good friends.  I had the classic sampler with lasagna, Fettuccini Alfredo, and spaghetti combo drink and pepperoni pizza.  Shared some desserts with friends while catching up.  Ordering and service was satisfactory.  Great family atmosphere and even got free bread sticks!  Pasta is OK for the price, good enough for fast fix if you are craving some Italian food."}
{"text":"Likes: The breadsticks, lasagna, and the fettuccine.   Dislikes: 25 minutes of waiting, so my stomach growled louder than my dog! While you're bored with your long wait, you can listen to among the loudest, most annoying music on Earth! (At least there was no swearing in the songs, but they were bad.) And when your plate comes, you get the good part, and then the under-heated spaghetti and the penne with meat sauce! (I got the Ultimate Sampler.)   I would steer clear of this place on a time crunch, but if you are really bored, bring a newspaper (which you'd most likely finish before your food comes), and only get the fettuccine with the breadsticks!"}
{"text":"If you want tasty, quick Italian-esque food, come here.  No, this is not a fancy-pants sit-down establishment with candelabras, cold-pressed olive oil, and linen napkins, but it's not selling itself as that.  It's selling itself as an option for tasty, quick Italian-esque food, and it does that admirably.   I am, in all honesty, obsessed with the garlic breadsticks.  They're soft, they're buttery, they're garlicky, and they're warm.  I could make a meal just out of these (though I haven't tried as I think that would likely take me to a carb-induced coma).  The food I've had here, again, for all accounts, is tasty, Italian-esque food and it's served quickly and without fail by a pleasant person.  I only drive-thru here, so I can't speak for the sit-down.    Yes, I will be back.  Those breadsticks are addictive."}
{"text":"If you want \"Italian food\" that has the look and feel of a Stouffer's t.v. dinner, Fazoli's gets it right.  Actually, I take that back.  If you are heating up a t.v. dinner, at least you are guaranteed it will be warm."}
{"text":"The service here is so slow. My first indication that something was wrong was that there was one person taking orders and the line was put the door. I should have left. Instead I waited 10 min to order. Then I waited 20 minutes to get my food. It was one order. That's ridiculous. There was no sense of urgency from the place and they're clearly not staffed to handle a lunch rush. Everyone was waiting and getting frustrated. I will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is good. I love Italian food, this is fast food. Thats why only 4 stars. But it is still great. I always go here when I cone down to Vegas...they need to expand and build some in norcal."}
{"text":"Great food, had their lunch special for $5, I had the lasagna and ravioli in meat sauce, it comes with a drink and breadsticks. I was full by the time I was finished."}
{"text":"It is hit or miss with this place. I miss the good ole days before the menu changed several times. The pizza they had back in the day was so darn good! I don't like to go here with out a coupon just because I don't want to pay full price for something that just tastes OK. But with a coupon I feel better. We don't have a lot of options over here besides the Burger King (that location is terrible) and Capriotti's (which is tasty-full heaven) so it is a nice change when o a bargain. The bread sticks are unlimited if you eat inside which is a nice perk and you can get free refills on your soda. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I remember at work we had a joke about Fazoli's being the McDonald's of Italian food xD  I really like going to this place when I have a sudden craving for Italian food and want it, fast. Hint fast. Which i basically what Fazoli's is: a fast food Italian restaurant that you can eat in, or go through the drive-thru.  I always order the Fettucine alfredo because that is my favorite, ANYWHERE I go. Haha, and I like it because it is accompanied by a thick paste, not a runny one, even though it is sometimes on the salty side. My boyfriend always gets the chicken parmigiana and I have had a bite of the chicken. It was not dry which was a plus but it was sooo cheesy so it was not for me! Getting an entree only is about $6 or less and it comes with breadsticks. They are way too salty for me though.  There are a lot of seating arrangements but most of the time, the place is not packed at all. The food is inexpensive and you have to consider that you cannot get authentic Italian food here so do not come with high expectations. As previously stated, only when you have a sudden craving for fast Italian food."}
{"text":"Fazoli's is just a fast food restaurant, although the real dinnerware is a lot better than eating off of a foam plate with a plastic fork. Price-wise Fazoli's is more expensive than going to other fast-food chains. The new thing is toppings for their baked pasta dishes. I tried the Mediterranean topping and it was greasy and overly spicy. I would not try it again. The bread sticks that we received were obviously not fresh and were actually a bit mangled. The kid who brought more to our table was a little surly, \"Want more bread sticks?\" he mumbled. On the positive side, the counter staff were super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I feel really bad whenever I come to this place. They have really nice employees that are running around like crazy people trying to serve the drive thru and their dine in guest. My last visit here they had a long drive thru line and nobody but me dinning in. It took 30 minutes for me to get my sub because although I ordered before any of the people in drive thru they were so busy trying to get the line down that they made my food last. They are really understaffed which makes it difficult to make going here worth it. I suggest going before you're to the point of starving because it will take a while before you get your food."}
{"text":"Took a while for food. Picked up baked spaghetti and salads.  Good value.   Salad dressing was a bit off, enough to set that aside and toss.  Otherwise a 4 star.    I'm rating this for \"fast food\" expectations"}
{"text":"Think itialian fast food.......not amazing, not expensive, not bad. The one \"must have\" thing this place has is the bread sticks! Wow those are tasty little guys. Good spot to grab a quick meal of pasta or lasagna. (they have a drive through too) If you are short on time, and like my self, cant bring yourself to eat Mc Donalds or Burger king this is a great alternative but probably still not the most nutritious place in the world."}
{"text":"Fazoli's has somehow managed to screw up a breadstick, which I thought a task impossible. I took a bite and instead of Italian goodness, I was smacked in the mouth with buttered popcorn flavor. Or maybe more accurately, a buttered popcorn flavor Jelly Belly. What is this?  When I arrived, nobody was at the counter. For a long time. I perused the menu for a quite some time before anyone came to take my order. Then, the staff was extra loud in talking to the people behind me: their friends, not customers.   I had had a pretty traumatic day and just wanted some damn pasta to make myself feel better but this place, believe it or not, actually made me feel worse.  Also how hilarious is it that a piece of pizza is considered a \"side\" here? Yep, load me up with pasta and then instead of a normal person side, I would like some more cheese and grease."}
{"text":"We really miss having a Fazoli's close by and this location was a great find in the Vegas area - just a few minutes drive from the main strip.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in.  The food came out quickly and they brought us fresh-out-of-the-oven breadsticks.  They followed up about ten minutes into our meal to ensure that everything was going well, and to offer us more of the unlimited breadsticks.    The spaghetti was exactly the delicious meal we remembered it to be.  The pumpkin cheesecake was delicious!  Overall: A When we are back in the area, we will return!"}
{"text":"I usually love Fazolis. Considering the price, the food is good and you get plenty of it. There isn't a Fazolis near me so it's always a treat when I get to have it. But this Fazolis sucked -- it was my first bad experience. The breadsticks are usually the best part but these were dry, hard, and burned on the bottom. HUGE disappointment. :/"}
{"text":"Zero stars. The sign says unlimited breadsticks but in an hour, staff came out zero times. Unlimited=one, apparently. Lots of other issues but bottom line is avoid this location. Put your big girl pants on and go to the Olive Garden. It's faster and better."}
{"text":"I've generally been happy with this restaurant. The service is fine. The food is good and reasonably priced. I'd change the plate and garbage situation.  Annoying  to try to throw things away in the little hole in the trash can that they've done so people don't throw away the dishes.. Either make it sit down full service or use disposable.  This way is a hassle.  Love the $5 lunch and the bread sticks. Especially when they're fresh with garlic butter. Yum"}
{"text":"Pros to Fazolis: 1) cheap 2) fast service 3) self service so no tip  4) free UNLIMITED breadsticks  5) clean establishments   Cons to Fazolis: Good luck finding one"}
{"text":"So good and affordable. The bread sticks are the bomb. Must try the pizza it's amazing."}
{"text":"Usually have have decent meals here for the price but this time was mediocre.  Both our pastas were runny and flavorless."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent and didn't take as long as I would have expected. Almost every booth was not cleaned off on a Sunday at about 4 pm. One worker sat there on his phone with literal flip flops on while the other was working his tail off to get food/breadsticks out. No break room??? Also there was no ice in either of the 2 Ice machines and we were only brought breadsticks once, basically when we were already done eating.   Giving 2 instead of 1 stars because of how quick the food was brought out."}
{"text":"Keep on driving! There are too many good restaurants in this area to waste time on this one. We used to eat at Fazoli's restaurant often before we moved out of the Midwest. We stopped on our drive through IL yesterday and we were totally disappointed. The order taker was surly and not helpful. The restaurant was almost empty, but the tables were dirty. The pasta was bland. The bread sticks were AWFUL. They delivered 4 with the meal, but they were soaked in oil/butter-like substance and actually dripped when you picked them up. Yuck! We requested new bread sticks and got them, but we were close to being done eating before they arrived.   Sadly, what used to be a good chain restaurant, has declined substantially in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, we were going to eat at a different Italian restaurant.  However, it was closed on Memorial Day.  This was our second best option considering our location and, the fact, we were so hungry!    Prices:  Average considering it's fast food Italian. Service:  Average, also considering it's fast food Italian. Food:  Salty!!!!!!!  But it tasted good because we were really hungry.  Will we go back?  I hope not.  It's not because the food is horrible or the typical reasons I would choose not to go back to a restaurant.  My reasoning is the food is incredibly salty!  It's over processed, fast food with an Italian theme.  We got home after dinner and literally couldn't drink enough water!  The meal made us so thirsty!"}
{"text":"Never will I return here.   Eh food and rude management!! Willing to lose a customer over $2 well he succeeded!!! Internet here sucks so I checked in on four square 2 min after I paid when I sat down.    I went up to the manager with my receipt and showed him the four square check in special which is $2 off a $5 order , we spent almost double that.  He refused to honor it because the transaction was done.  It was done 2 min ago!!! I won't be back and I told him that.  It's not that he couldn't do anything it's that he didn't want to.  Horrible management and customer service here.   My first and last time here.   They lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"This is the worse Fazolis I have ever been to and I have been to many. They just don't care and very unprofessional. I can't believe the franchise isn't pulled from them as they are terrible! I will never go to another Fazolis after this one... Place is dirty, employees are dirty, employees are as dumb as a box of rocks and can't get anything right!"}
{"text":"So this is updated from my one star review when our entire order was wrong and the promised gift card never arrived.  While the district manager followed up.  We used the gift card tonight. Everything was as ordered and restaurant was clean.  Only wish a few more breadsticks had been offered.  It does appear their new efforts here are working"}
{"text":"I don't know why I like this cheap drive thru food so much haha!!  Food has always been hot and fresh.  Like I said it's drive thru Italian food but for some reason I love it!!  I'd rather eat here any day over the OG.  I've only hit up the drive thru but it has always been fast.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"Food OK but it took 35 minutes to get my food.  The cashier just said \"what can I tell you. We just got one cook\". Not trying this agsin"}
{"text":"Worst drive thru experience ever.. 35 min wait only one car in front?  Wasn't even greeted at the mic."}
{"text":"Great food!! If you're craving good Italian food, this is your place!! Can't beat the value and fantastic flavor that is served up at Fazoli's, even through a drive through! Perfect meal whether on the go or dining in."}
{"text":"I believe this location is now CLOSED.   I always come here whenever I want Italian food in a hurry. This place has a drive thru which I love. Makes it easy to pick something up quick and yummy for dinner. The chicken parm is my favorite along with the bread sticks. The chicken parm is always hot and fresh with a amble size portion. This location is kind of hidden in the area behind business offices but if you are lucky enough to find it, enjoy."}
{"text":"We initially ordered 2 Endless Pastas and 2 sodas. That went fine, food came quickly and was hot. We went up to re-order. Your management trainee Tonia was at the register. She pretended to be doing on it for the 5-10 minutes we stood there. Another couple stood behind us, the whole time. We waited but she never look up or acknowledge us. That was extremely rude, some would say, She is Rude Bitch. After awhile we sat back down. We were going to leave, but our original cashier walked by to deliver an order. I asked her how I could re-order. She asked what we wanted and told us she would re-order it for us. Your Rude management Trainee Tonia needs to be Fired. Her demeanor, attitude and  just rudeness will sink business! We are going to inform everyone we talk too and post on Social media, Facebook, twitter and Yelp our experience about your Manager and how incredibly rude she is! This is at the Fazolis in Madison, Wi on Zier Road! Avoid at all Cost! Unless you like rude people who ignore paying customers that pay their salaries!"}
{"text":"I came in to check out the food for possible catering. I was so impressed with the atmosphere. It's relaxed, clean, pleasant.  The food is really good. All of the staff  I encountered were pleasant, courteous and really seemed happy to be there. I am soooo impressed!!"}
{"text":"Have not been to one of these places in a long time and I was reminded why, it is ok.  I can get way better food for the same price in a fancier place.  The choices are slim and the prices are ok for what you get.  This is not a place I would hurry back to ever, but if you are in the location of this place, there are not many choices unless you drive about a mile or two down the road, this literally is the only place in there right now.  A new restaurant will be opening up at some point and this may force this place to step up their game."}
{"text":"I had the Cherry Almond Chicken Salad for lunch, I was going to go for a good ol Ceasars Salad, but got a little turned off by the bacon bits. My salad was good. Exactly what I expected. They toss the salad in the dressing for you, and do go a little overboard, so next time I will get it dry. Great place for a quick lunch or dinner to go!"}
{"text":"Fazoli's is not the first place you think of if you want some good pasta. Contrary to that comment, they actually are pretty good. Menu is small which is a plus for me. You're not overwhelmed by so many options that often times are repeats. The serve a variety of pastas, salads and pizza. I like their Chicken and Broccoli Alfredo Bake. The name says it all. Very simple dish with good flavor a even better portion sizes. It comes with a breadstick, however, you can ask for as many breadsticks as you want which is a really sweet deal. Someone comes around offering tables more breadsticks throughout your meal so you don't have to get up and ask for more at the counter.    Price? VERY friendly!!! You can get a complete meal ( entree, side salad, pop and breadstick(s) for less than $9.C'mon! You can't beat that price!  They also cater which I would recommend if you're office is having an event. Overall, Fazoli's is a good place to dine."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was introduced to it about 5 years ago. We were always here on vacation about once a month. and this was a place we had to eat at. I ate there yesteday and ordered the primo sampler and it was yummy and humongous. My fiancee and i shared the food. I love the breadsticks, i can eat like 10 of them. I can't complain about the price either."}
{"text":"Went there again a few months after my initial visit. This time it was awful. Cold food, filthy dining inside (I did drive thru first time), and long wait time. Not going back."}
{"text":"Decent food. I used to eat at the one on eastern and always had decent food with great service.  This location had v e r y slow service. I like the food so I put up with service. I am sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Just like Sbarro, Fazoli's is the Panda Express of Italian restaurants. Good fast food in a pleasant environment.    This has been my second visit here. On both visits I was satisfied with the food. However, I think that they could of been slightly more generous with the quantity of food.     I took advantage of the current lunch special, served daily up to 3 PM. For $3.99, I had two choices out of a few items, that included lasagna, fettuccine, ravioli, and spaghetti. Two bread sticks come with the special. I chose spaghetti and meat lasagna. An additional $1 brought me a fountain beverage (free refills at the self-serve fountain).    The food was decent. I know that there are frozen dinners in the supermarkets that taste as good as the food here. But, to be fair doesn't competitors sell frozen dinners in the supermarkets?    The eating environment  in Fazoli' s makes this it a good choice for dining. The classical music is relaxing. Fitting for people like me that need to wind down. Another bonus is that the person who took my order delivered the food to my table.     Chances of returning: I'll probably return if the Feast Buffet in the nearby Sunset Station raises their prices."}
{"text":"Sometimes you want cheap fast food Italian. And sometimes Fazoli's can be just what you need. But then there are nights like I had on my last visit where the food tasted like high school cafeteria food. Bleech.   Thankfully their breadsticks never suck and if you order a dozen of 'em at least you can give the dog the rest of the food and your stomach has something to keep it from growling.   2 Stars: Only because the breadsticks saved them from a 1 Star and placement on my \"It's so bad my dog wouldn't eat it list\". Because truth be told the dog didn't eat the ultimate sampler platter either.  And as bad as Fazoli's can be, even at their very worst they still beat going to Napoli across the street as that place is unfit for human consumption."}
{"text":"Pros: -it's fast  -it's cheap -the bread sticks are bomb -the food always tastes good  Cons:  -the restaurant is hidden in a shopping center that's never busy. So a little hard to find from the main streets."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick quality meal they've got you covered here. Reasonably priced. Good food, plenty of bread sticks and nice people."}
{"text":"Super-yummy! Super-affordable! Super-nice employees! Super-clean! I wish there were more Fazoli's!!!"}
{"text":"It was fast, clean and all the staff was quick attentive and professional, we had Pila (I think that is her name) take care of us...she did not stop working the whole time we were in there. Definitely will be coming back during lunch when we are on this side of town. Also got a discount because of where I work so ask about it, it was nice to get really cool."}
{"text":"Good and fresh food. I like it here a lot. One time I have lunch at this place 5 days straight. There were a couple times they messed up my food, but they offer apologies. Friendly staffs. Overall, I still give it a 5 because I recommend it."}
{"text":"I always get something good no matter what I order! Quick, easy and affordable. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Unlimited breadsticks if you dine in and the customer service is very welcoming.   I usually stick with my usual which is spaghetti with meat sauce and get the meal which also includes a slice of pizza. Good enough lunch portion size.  Honestly Fazoli's is probably a notch below Olive Garden but it's not bad and definitely not going to be as crowded as Olive Garden usually is."}
{"text":"I have literally had everything on the menu, multiple times. It is a great place to mix things up. Breadsticks. They are fantastic...I would love to just have them. But, it is cheap, fast, italian. So qualifying that four star with that, it is a four star with those expectations set out. Service is pretty good. I mean it is usually high school kids and stuff, but they do a decent job."}
{"text":"Good food, fairly good service, but they need more drink options and/or Coca Cola Freestyle machines.  Fazoli's is essentially an Italian fast food restaurant, with a number of dining option and entrees available which are surprisingly delicious and transcend the \"fast food\" label. They once had four locations in the Las Vegas Valley, but for reasons unknown the others have closed down, and this is the only one left.  As far as variety, the menu here has no shortage of that. Pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, they have it all. No matter who you are, you should be able to find something that you like on their menu. My personal favorite entree on the menu is the cheese ravioli in marinara sauce, but I am sure you will find something that suits your tastes.  The service I have gotten in the restaurant has always been good. As a semi regular, they recognize me and know what I (usually) want to eat, which actually speeds up my visits a little. It is good to find a place that knows the regulars.  Prices are a little high on some items, but I cannot entirely fault the restaurant for this; there are likely factors that go into pricing food that I myself am not aware of. It is still far less than a traditional \"dine-in\" Italian restaurant and nearly as good despite the casual approach and atmosphere.  The problem I have here is the lack of drinks; there are only a limited number of sodas to choose from, and things like teas, milk, lemon ices, and such. They need to add vitamin water and/or sports drinks to the menu to give customers some variety. Why have they not installed a Coca Cola Freestyle machine here yet? In this day and age, and with only ONE restaurant in the Vegas Valley now, there is no excuse for this. If anyone from the management team is reading this, PLEASE install a Freestyle machine (I have already requested this on the official website). If I am using a coupon that requires me to buy a drink, I need more variety than what your outdated machines offer.  Overall, Fazoli's provides a quality dining experience, though the lack of Coca Cola Freestyle machines is a major weakness that needs to be addressed in the near future. Still, I would recommend eating here despite that. This is quality Italian food, and fast."}
{"text":"In a world of fast food dining establishments that is dominated by burger joints and the like, Fazoli's comes as a breath of fresh air.  The restaurant is essentially an Italian fast food establishment - something we have needed for quite some time. If you're a fan of Italian food but you don't have the time to do a full dine-in experience, this place makes for a fine alternative.  A little bit of everything Italian is available here - pasta dishes, pizza, breadsticks, the list goes on. Quite honestly, despite being a \"fast food\" place, their food is above average. No, it doesn't hold a candle to that of dine-in restaurants, but it's better than typical fast food fare.   The service at their restaurants is usually very good - I typically get through the drive-thru quickly. However, like a lot of places they do tend to make the occasional mistake on your order, and they tend to hire a lot of people that can't speak English well. However, they satisfy more often than they don't. I haven't had any major negative experiences here.  Fazoli's is the best thing to happen to fast food in years, it's just a shame they don't have more locations around the valley. At present time, I believe they only have 3-4 in the Vegas Valley. Still, you're bound to have one in your area, so give them a shot if you're in the mood for something other than burgers and fries for lunch."}
{"text":"Good, filling, inexpensive Italian food with a drive thru. The Italian donuts are not to be missed! Even my picky-eaters were impressed that a fast food place would serve Italian food this good."}
{"text":"Decent food at a good price. Feels much better than most of the typical fast food places, good breadsticks and fresh salads."}
{"text":"Wow, are they serious? Just the idea of Italian fast food should have been a warning alone.  Very mediocre borderline nasty food. The pizza is like rubber and the pasta cheap and the service was SLOW. Anyone could have  boiled their own penne by the time service came through.  I rate this as an emergency I need some ravioli and gotta get back to work type of place.. I'd never just eat here for pleasure."}
{"text":"It is a warm day and my dog wanted to get out with me, so I took a ride with her and we did the drive thru here.. It was not too busy ,as it was at Taco Bell drive thru .that was next door . I ordered the 'original submarino'- it was 880 calories, tasty ,but a little too much mayo, it is something I would not eat everyday? Anyway the sandwich included a drink of your choice.. Fast and friendly service at the drive thru window,too  Only thing their website,doesn't list any prices for all items on their menu?? But is doesn't have the nutritional info,fyi..  The pasta do come 2 ways full combo and/or entrees only? Reasonable priced,granted it is not like being in Italy, but  it is a change from burgers and fries..."}
{"text":"It's fast. It's inexpensive. But it's not tasty. However, I'll give them an extra star for the breadsticks. The food isn't horribly but it doesn't satisfy any Italian cravings you might have. I tried their Fettucine Alfredo and it was very bland. Then I had their Chicken Parmesan. They put the very dry breaded chicken on top of the cheese which is melted onto the spaghetti underneath. Definitely strange."}
{"text":"Stopped in this place and could not get past the lack of cleanliness and the terrible odor upon entry. This location definitely needs some attention to detail and cleanliness. We decided not to eat here based on the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Sooo I know most of you wouldn't call this *diet* food, but surprisingly the kids meal choices have been awesome dinners for me when I have few points left on WW. Sometimes I'm in a rush and don't want to cook pasta for dinner (yes, it's easy, I know). The kids ziti is fresh, low calorie, and delicious! I'm also a huge fan of the surprisingly good pizza. My fiance and I were both shocked at how good it was for drive through. The breadsticks are also awesome, but very not diet friendly! They have some awesome salad options (chicken with fruit.. etc, etc), and a wide-varied menu. My fiance adores the sampler platters.   Yes it's junk food... but it's lower in fat than burgers or mexican, and satisfies my craving for italian. Oh and it's crazy cheap. They have good sized pasta dinners right now for $2.49. Service has always been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"If i want badly cooked pasta i can do that at home. But i like when people bring me breadsticks so i gave 2 stars. I guess ok for the low price."}
{"text":"Fast italian food... it sounds like a good concept.  In reality, it's a wreck.  I had the cheese ravioli along with salad and breadsticks.  The salad was fine, the ravioli was nothing special, and the breadsticks were just bad.  Tasted like something old and microwaved.  I usually can't turn a breadstick down (especially when they're unlimited) but here, I just didn't enjoy them.    The service was okay and the restaurant was clean but I just can't recommend the food, even for the price.  I'll spend a bit more money and time and go to Olive Garden next time."}
{"text":"I'm Yelping about this Fazoli's because I had the most amusing, but at the same time frustrating, experience trying to obtain dinner for my fiance and I last night.  \"Baked Spaghetti Parmesan with Meat Balls, and Meat sauce instead of marinara.\" I was instructed specifically to say it just like that, and that I did.  I ordered a Caesar salad, bread sticks and a Roasted Turkey sandwich.  I'm patiently waiting for my order.  As the food order starts to take shape behind the counter, I see her stack a dish that I didn't order on top of my sandwich and attempt to place it in the bag.  Irritated, I exclaim, \"Excuse me? What is that you just put in that bag?\"  \"Spaghetti with Meatballs\", she said.  \"I didn't order that. I ordered Baked Spaghetti Parmesan with Meat Balls, and Meat sauce instead of marinara.\"  She makes a second attempt to make the order correctly. This time, Baked Spaghetti with Meat Sauce with a Breaded Breast of Chicken Parmesan comes out.  \"No, that's not it either\", I explained. \"Can I speak to the person in kitchen?\"  Finally after explaining to the person making the food in the kitchen what I wanted, it was correct.  Normally, that Fazoli's is pretty reasonable. Their pizza has always been extremely mediocre. Other than that, this is my first bad experience.  The bread sticks were really good that night, so I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"It's all about the Bread Sticks!  Been a long time (years) since I went to a Fazoli's, was in a hurry so stopped in.  Placed our order; got our table number & drink glasses BUT NO BREAD STICKS?   Saw a server working the dinning area BUT NO BREAD STICKS?  Delivered our meal to the table and rationed our bread stick while we ate our salad and entre because we realized that there were NO MORE BREAD STICKS!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fast and cheep Italian food. $5.99 lunch special is awesome.   Special shout out to the breadsticks! Sooo garlicy and delicious :)"}
{"text":"Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better.   I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God, really, for the love of balls, these circular beef objects were filled with some sawdust like material and blander than Jennifer Aniston's movie career). Not good. We also tried a chicken Alfredo like dish that apparently was made with Elmer's glue.   Pasty. Bland. And, yes, it does stick to construction paper.   I wasn't expecting much. But I wasn't expecting to be grossed out. All I can say is \"Mama Mia, papsa a pee'ah, daddy's got the diarrhea\".   There.   That's classy. And Elite of me. Don't ya think?"}
{"text":"This place stinks!!!! It has seriously gone down hill. Dirty plates and tables everywhere. You only get one breadstick unless you ask for more. My daughter was grossly overcharged for her food...it was corrected...but only because I caught the error. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"Good basic food. Tasty sauce. Reasonable prices. Plus, it's a terrific place to take your single digit aged nieces, nephews and grandchildren. Fast food that doesn't taste fast.   I'm a fan."}
{"text":"For a fast food restaurant, the food is okay. It's the only fast food Italian place I know of near me which is why I tried it. I was told that the food was cheap and they had free \"refills\" on their breadsticks which was said to be the best thing there. I ordered fettuccini alfredo and did not end up eating it because it was cold and very soupy (when it should've been thicker considering it's pasta). I don't plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's just your typical chain-restaurant pseudo-Italian eating establishment. Nothing special. It's fast food. If you like to fill yourself up with high-sodium pasta entrees on your lunch break, this is your place. That's all I've got to say."}
{"text":"First, let me say that Italian eateries appear to be a dime a dozen. \"Italian\" has become watered down into a bland mix of spaghetti, lasagna, pizzas and some bland salads on iceberg lettuce.  I got tired of these so-called Italian restaurants eons ago.  But someone suggested Fazoli's so I tried it. YUCK!  It fits right in with the bland, pseudo-Italian stuff I've been talking about. Does that mean the food is bad? Not necessarily, but you can see from my review my basis for judging it unsatisfying. It's just kinda nondescript, nonspecial, \"blah\" to me.   But that type of blandness could make it a good choice for a group of friends or a family with kids who want a casual dinner with familiar foods."}
{"text":"Met up here with a good friend here last weekend, Fazoli's is a  place we both enjoy very much but there aren't any on our side of town:( Service at this location from the cashier who gave by buddy a cup to have his drink while he was waiting on me to arrive to I believe her name was Mary delivering all those warm, delicious bread sticks at the table.  Our visit here for a sit down, fast food type place was overall a much better experience than at most of the regular sit down style places.  We left there with a smile on our faces and in our belly...maybe we'll make this a routine until we can convince someone to open one up on the north side of town.."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place, but I can never put any fast food joints better than 3 star because of the quality of the food (meaning it's a fast food place). Other than that, I've never seen a fast food Italian food spot, which is why I love this place so much. Pasta pasta pasta pretty much any kind of pasta you want, plus slammin' salads w/pizza also.....YUMMMMM!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at a Fazoli's, I was blown away. They had great sandwiches, good pasta, and a solid business model.  One of my favorite things to do when I was young and poor was to go to Fazoli's to do homework.  I would have lunch, then sit there all afternoon refilling my drink cup and saying \"HIt me again\" to the girl who came around with the basket of breadsticks every  fifteen minutes.  By the time I was done with my studying, I would be so full of breadsticks that I didn't need dinner.  Fazoli's helped me through college and grad school.    Since those days (many years ago, sadly), they've gone downhill faster than a Red Zephyr wagon with two fat kids in it.  They tinker needlessly with the menu.  Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you.    I used to love their food.  Now, it's just okay. Mediocre, really.  I no longer look forward to going to Fazoli's.  What once used to be a weekly thing when I was younger has become a once, maybe twice yearly thing.  And each time I go back, I remember what used to be and swear that I'll never return.    But those breadsticks--they're like crack, man."}
{"text":"Me and hubby are enjoying our lunch. Thanks for great service and good food. Terrific value too."}
{"text":"Visiting my brother this last weekend.  He took me to this place.    I have no Idea why I had never thought of this before but it is so smart.  Italian Fast Food.  And Good fast food too.  My brother had some coupons so we were expecting to get a killer deal just like he had done in the past.  This place has some really cool deals.  On Weeknights (just weeknight I think) kids eat free!  My brother and his wife have two kids so they both got a slice of pizza and a small kids soda with a plastic keeper cup.  My brother and his wife enjoyed two meals for the price of one thanks to one of their coupons.  I also used a coupon to get $4.99 all you can eat spaghetti!   I think the whole meal for all 5 of us came out to less than $15!!!  The problem was that the manager on duty did not like the idea of us mixing the \"kids eat free\" deal with the coupons.  I can understand how she felt; I have worked my share of fast food and restaurant jobs.  The problem is my brother has been coming to this exact location for dinner a few times a month for a couple months now and he has never had a problem before.  In the end the manager let us mix the deals we were eligible for but she made us do it as 3 separate purchases.    Now, about the food.   This is not Olive Garden or Old Spaghetti factory.  You are expecting too much if you think you will be getting some kind of Gourmet Italian food for $4.99 a plate from a restaurant with a drive-thru.  However it is good.  The breadsticks were also very good and all-you-can-eat. (Again, no Olive Garden breadsticks, but good, think decent pizza place breadsticks)  The portions were also decent.  Even with the All-you-can eat meal that I got I only had room to get seconds, but not thirds or fourths etc.    I would like to try the pizza, if I am in the area again I will go back."}
{"text":"Fazolis has really deteriorated in the last year. Went there yesterday. The store had no customers, but it took 20 minutes for our order. 4 staff members on duty. 5 tables dirty with no one showing any signs of going to clean them. Dining room looked completely unkempt. We won't be going back.  Food was bad as well. I had the Ultimate Spaghetti. It was a dish of plain spaghetti with a glob of sauce with the meatballs all in the center. It looked like it had been out awhile and microwaved because the edges of the spaghetti were dry and hard. My husband had the lasagna and the edges of that were hard and dry and it was barely warm. The breadsticks were way under baked. There was nothing good about this dining experience."}
{"text":"Restaurant review For a family dining on a budget, this is a great place for pasta and sandwiches. Yes it is a fast food italian restaurant, but it is significantly better than a CiCi buffet quality. Depending on what you order the food is actually quite tasty. The chicken bake was slightly below a italian restaurant quality, but it is not something you can make at home and all of the price of 6 dollars. You also get unlimited breadsticks which is quite a deal. If you have kids this is a great place for a meal. If you want cheap italian food then this may also be the right place. Now if you are taking a date here then maybe you should look elsewhere  Pro: inexpensive, fast, pasta cooked well, great for kids  Cons: none  Hidden gem: 1. Sign up for e-club on website for coupons and free pasta coupon 2. Daily 5 dollar lunch deal - 2 lunch portion except meat lasagne will cost you 1.5 more and a drink 3. Monday 6.99 whole cheese or pepperoni pizza 4. Tuesday 0.99 cent kids meal and family night activity 5. Wednesday seniors night dine for 4 dollars 6. Thursday 4 dollar off family meals"}
{"text":"Not the best italian food but if you're in the mood for italian and dont want to pay at a sit down restaurant, this place is a good option.   Their spaghetti with \"meat sauce\" doesnt have that much meat. The alfredo sauce is  a bit salty, but their breadsticks are yummy.  Sign up for their emails for coupons!"}
{"text":"It wasn't as good as I remember. We used to come here a lot as a family ( back about 10 years ago) but today it was not nearly as close as it used to be. The girl that works here obviously hates her job. The breadsticks are so soggy, and their menu is not as big as it used to be. The one boy that's works there is a great worker though and he earned most of the stars lol"}
{"text":"Fazoli's is now closed I'm kind of sad to hear that this place closed down. I got a email saying it was closed and so I just called to see if it were true. Unfortunately they closed on Sunday. If I new that they were closing the last time I ate here I would've visited a few more times. I liked getting the $5 lunch. I'd normally get 2, one for me and another for my kids, but we'd all share."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's an Italian restaurant with a drive through....the food was solid. I ordered the Twisted Chicken Parm, which was a twisted noodle, with a pesto sauce, chicken pieces, and cheese. It was served with two breadsticks. I would not have minded to try a slice of pizza, which I thought I had ordered, but it was neither charged, nor delivered, so I guess I had not ordered a slice of pizza.....Admittedly, I had been on an Italian craving. Though the entree I had was tasty, this just did not cut it. My meal cost about $10 bucks, which included the pasta and a large drink, but this is not a place that I can look back on and think \"I can't wait for my next Vegas visit so I can go here!\"...That said, I imagine that for the locals, it is very convenient to have the drive-through."}
{"text":"While on lunch break from work I decided to check out Fazoli's again after my first experience about six years ago at another location.  Nothing has changed other than the prices going up, up and up and the flavor going down, down and down.  I ordered the #8 which cost $9.79, it is Penne with Creamy Basil Chicken and a slice of pizza w/small drink. The pasta dish I did not eat because the balsamic tomatoes were just too overpowering and the pasta being the main course of my lunch I was truly disappointed. The slice of pizza was actually very good and I began thinking that I should have just ordered the two slices of pizza combo instead.   Anyways, I did contact a store Supervisor later to inform of the bitter tasting pasta and she did advise it was most likely that they added too much balsamic to it which could have ruined it.  She was a sweetheart and put my name in the credit book as that I may return and get a replacement meal to make up for the bad pasta dish I had.   The bread sticks were tasty and flavorful!  I will give them another shot as I really think I just ordered the wrong pasta dish at the wrong time!"}
{"text":"I did an online order tonight to simplify our evening.  I ordered 3 entrees and extra breadsticks at 4:30pm for a 5:00pm pickup.  When I arrived there was nobody behind the counter.  When somebody did come out, I let them know that we we were here for our online order.  They said it wasn't ready.  It was 5:20pm before it was ready.  No apology, no free drink, no offer of breadsticks while we waited.  I haven't eaten at any Fazoli's in over ten years and don't think we will be back.  Awful customer service."}
{"text":"Really good spaghetti with meat sauce! Nice atmosphere, and employees are friendly. Unlimited breadsticks when dining in! I tried the new spicy marinara sauce, and it's very good! The menu has a variety of meals, including salads and flatbreads. Lots of good choices!"}
{"text":"For what it is, Fazoli's really isn't that bad at all. I've dined in the restaurant, ordered for pickup, as well as ordered for catering. Personally I have never been disappointed.   Fazoli's a quick and easy way to satisfy your pasta craving, without breaking the bank. Now, is it top-notch best quality Italian? No. But is tasty and hot and served with a smile? Yes.  I am a big fan of their new pick-up option. It's similar to Panera's Rapid Pick-Up in the way that you order, set a time, and go get it presumably from the shelf. When I arrived there today, my order was not on the shelf, but they were just packaging up. Hot and fresh and ready to go.   Overall, you really have to know what to expect here. It is FAST FOOD Italian. And for fast food that tastes pretty good, I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Hard to recommend as the food really isn't special at all and full of grease.   It's hard to pinpoint any items to highlight as pastas are full of sauce -- but lack flavor otherwise. Their preparation seems to vary greatly as the pasta is sometimes too wet.. or the sauce is a bit dry.  The pizza tastes like spaghetti sauce with cheese on a flat circular breadstick. There's nothing special about the crust or flavors that stand out at all (Papa Del's is a lot better).  Subs are fairly standard -- but not tasty enough or fresh enough where I wouldn't rather go to Subway or McAlister's instead.  Overall, food does not really deliver in terms of texture or flavors."}
