{"text":"We just moved to Mesa and were happy to hear about this place. We love Mexican food.  We were looking forward to a green chile burro enchilada style.  The meat in the burrito tasted like canned meat and was gravy like.  The rice and beans tasted like canned food too.  Not authentic at all.  We did not finish our food but ate a lot of chips and salsa which weren't bad.  Finished our drinks and left.   I am not sure why everyone raves about this place..... They must not know good mexican food.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Love the hot sauce, chili rellenos and ground beef soft tacos. Of course all of that with their sour cream!"}
{"text":"Been eating at Mattas since the original location on Main Street. The food is still made with the same family recipes. 

We love the chili rellanos as they are filled with beef, versus most places having cheese filling. Chips and salsa are fresh. 
They are closed on Sunday's."}
{"text":"This is the only remaining outpost of the once proud Matta's on Main street in Mesa.  The old Matta's closed out in 2007 due to the oldest Grandson wanting to go out on his own.  They were scheduled to open a Matta's in the Mesa Riverview complex but haven't seen that materialize yet.
This one on Higley has some of the same things from the original (salsa, cheese crisps, standard tex-mex fare).  It's really a counter service location with tables.  It has a drive through as well.
I'm not going out on a limb saying that this is good but not great Mexican especially for the prices.  A single taco - $3.75.  Single Enchilada - $3.75.  For those prices, you would expect much better than you actually get.   And you don't get any service to boot.  Clean up after yourself amigo.
So, they get a OK rating from me give that it is counter service and expensive.  I miss the old Matta's.  2-star."}
{"text":"Had a very poor experience at this place. The food was bland without any spice even in the salsa. The service was slow, but the kicker was the drinks. For a ordinary Jose Cuervo Gold marguarita they charged $2.50 for the mix and $8.50 for a shot totaling $11.00 for each.  The waitress was asked why and she said that was the cheapest way to go for that type of tequila. We were not told ahead of time that gold was a premium tequila in this place. It is not, if you have lived here in the valley awhile you know that. 
So that was our first and last trip to this place. Back to Tee Pee we go!"}
{"text":"Tried Matta's on Higley for the first time.  Ususally went to the one on Main Street but discovered it is no longer open,.  Although different set up the food was just what I remembered.  Had the Sandy Special and Robert Tacos.  Food came out hot and quick.  They were quite busy but we odered and got our food pretty quick.  Very Hot as well.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating...  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Food is ok. I always just get the Roberts tacos. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. I think its a good lunch meeting place, clean tables no interruptions from servers, and not usually loud. They started offering daily specials and so that has been nice as before it was pretty expensive for average mexican food. My bro loves the place so we still go all the time. Its worth a visit, you may like it."}
{"text":"My parents take me here when I come to visit, quality has been consistently good and food is the same as the location on Main that just closed. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. My parents go there so often they know everyone there and the chips & salsa keep flowing. I order 2 soft beef taco combo, the meat is ground, although i think you can order shredded. Food is Tex-Mex, not to be confused or compared to authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"I've been here often (husband loves the louies) and it seems like everything I try isn't my favorite.  Last straw was last night - ordered the los albondigas soup (one of my favorites from other mexican restaurants) and was sorely disapointed.  6 HUGE slices of carrots, 3 medium sized meatballs and a few other vegies (tomatoes, celery) floating in a broth.  Smelled like stew - tasted like stew.  Not what I wanted.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed, fish tacos tasted like they were cooked in old fry oil, pork burrito had no real flavor.  I was embarrassed to bring my girl  friend there. We didn't finish the meal and went to in n out burger for dinner."}
{"text":"Family favorite! We come here for every family birthday. We love Sandy, she's so great! The cheese crisps and rice and beans are the best around."}
{"text":"The original Mattas was the place to go for good food. Not this one. The chili relleno tasted like a stuffed pepper with no flavor in the meat. Really disappointed for price I paid for family meal. I can honestly say I now know why they are never busy. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Just like everything else, prices go up, quality goes down.  This place is definately not the Matta's I grew up with."}
{"text":"If you were lucky enough to grow up in Mesa Arizona, then you probably love Matta's. One of the saddest days of my life was when I heard they were closing on Main Street. I was excited when they decided to open a couple of other locations. The food is still the same taste we've all grown up on... but I miss the \"restaurant\" experience. This new location feels more like a fast food with the walk-up-to-the-counter and order first vibe. Best salsa in the universe!"}
{"text":"I read mixed reviews of Matta's but since it was near our hotel I thought why not give it a try. My wife and I arrived at the restaurant at 7:45 and were told the kitchen was closing. I believe the sign said they were open until 9PM. We were able to order our meal which was good but not the best Mexican we ever have eaten.  The server never brought us a refill on the chips an salsa. Would we return? Maybe , but we would try to arrive earlier."}
{"text":"Used to frequent the original Mattas on Main St in Mesa.  This is similar but I wouldn't say it's the same.  Hot sauce is definitely milder.  Roberts tacos were good, lots of shredded beef and cheese.  Chips were just ok.  Didn't really like the mild salsa.  Lots of beans and rice on the combo platter.  Will I come back?  Maybe if I'm in the area, but probably would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"It is a far cry from the original mattas.  I think the food is mostly average.  Loaded with salt. Very overpriced for a non sit down restaurant. But still okay if you just have to have something local."}
{"text":"Of course it goes without saying that I miss the old Matta's on Main Street. Grew up going there as a kid and even lived next door to the original owners. The food here brings back those memories. It's great food and the service is spot on. Great place for a grab and go or dine in."}
{"text":"I just brought my family here as they were looking for some TexMex instead of Sonoran styled Mexican food.
A few warnings that we ignored: 1. Empty parking lot and dinning room. 2. cost was in line for a sit-down restaurant and not that of a counter/walk-up. 3. Not a Hispanic eating in the place.

  The chile relleno was recommended here on yelp and it was a bad experience. It was stuffed with ground beef (oily) and the skin was still on the pepper. The battered outside was not light and fluffy but soggy and over salted. 0.5/5 for the chile. The enchilada was a passable 3.5/5 stars. The shredded beef tacos were resting a pool of oil and sauce instead of atop a bed of lettuce (to keep the del Oro/shell) crisp. I never ate a taco with a fork, and I wanted to slap myself for even doing it, but I had to give the taco a taste test. I should have passed. It was a shadow of a taco. wet Iceberg lettuce in atop an overly salted shredded beef innards. 1.5/5 for the taco attempt. Lastly we ordered beef chimichanga. It was a mediocre chimi, not crispy, same issue as the taco but only much more salt as if hiding bad meat. 2/5.  

All in all if I was going to pay $50 for a meal for 3 than I expect service and a quality I can live with, not gas station taste and self-serve atmosphere.  Pass this place up, there are FAR better businesses that try to win you over."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Overpriced and beef taco was like shoe leather. Rice was much like instant rice . The cheese used in the enchilada was like cheese wiz. They won't see us again. We had a gift card, so naturally we used it but if we had to pay out of pocket, we would have kicked ourselves out to the empty parking lot."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night ordered take out for myself and my wife. I ordered a Red Chile chimichanga and my wife ordered the Lisa taco salad also I got a large hot sauce. The Red Chimichanga meat was tough and the red sauce was refrigerator cold the Red Chile tasted like it was made from a mix. My wife's taco salad had old wilted pieces of lettuce in it, and the hot sauce was way watered down if you dipped a chip in it without using a spoon there would by no hot sauce on the chip. all of this for $ 30.00
best part of meal was cheese crisp and plain chips. What happened to the old Matta's used be the best Mexican food in Mesa Taco Bell taste better than this."}
{"text":"If I could give NO stars that would be perfect. Seriously, the \"good\" reviews are from people who do not know what REAL Mexican food tastes like. This place sucks. The \"ground\" beef in my taco was undercooked and probably canned meat. Who the hell puts meat paste in a chile relleno?! Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for fast Mexican food that won't kill you (Filibertos?)

Happy Hour prices are good for margaritas, but I'm convinced they make them smaller...

Don't get the chicken though.  It has some weird creamy sauce that tastes like soup."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. The food is excellent. My favorites include the bean and cheese burro, the chicken enchiladas, and the chimichanga.

The service is ok, but certainly not bad.
And I always buy the salsa they jar."}
{"text":"Super friendly vibe, clean place (N. Higley Road), excellent service and very good food my first time here. I ordered \"Sandy's Special\" (I think that was the name) with cubed pork and green chiles in a deep fried burrito smothered in melted cheese and sour cream. Great texture and flavor! Free chips and salsa were A-OK. The menu is not fancy (no chicken mole or enchiladas suizas), but the kitchen here has a soul, not just a fast food assembly line."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the menu is not correct.  I ordered the 4 mini burros which state it comes in the four different varieties. The cashier informed me I can only get two types and upon arrival at my table they were mini chimichangas instead of burros.  Food is good just disappointed in the deception of what the menu says."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite Mexican restaurant. I always order the bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Both their red and green enchilada sauces are awesome. Their chips and salsa are my favorite as well. The chips are typically very fresh and come out warm and the salsa is unbeatable.

The restaurant is well lit as well as acceptably clean. The staff is generally attentive to your needs as well. Other members of my family order the chili relleno combo and their \"Robert's tacos\" combo. The food always comes out in a timely manner as well. 

For those like me that care, they do have a drive through and carry Pepsi products. Overall it's a great restaurant with a rich Arizona history! 5/5"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Matta's all my life. Not only are they my favorite Mexican food restaurant, but they are my favorite restaurant period! I love the food there!"}
{"text":"As a long time native Chicagoan, having worked stints in Mexico (multiple areas) eventually moving to AZ from Aurora, IL 7 months ago; I am without question,  a  Mexican food expert. Decent vibe and atmosphere for a Mexicantina but the food less than mediocre at best.  Matta's messed up a simple request (no tomatoes) on my order the first and last time I will ever go there. For the price, you are better off going to Filiberto's, but for quality, go to SENIOR TACO.  Yes its a mile or so away, but the food is an order of magnitude BETTER than this garbage."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews we almost didn't go, but I remembered some green chili pork I got there last year and wanted to go back. It was delicious!  Big chunks of pork in a couple enchiladas. Mine had (mild) green sauce and my husband had (spicey) red sauce. Highly recommend!

Admittedly, the chips and sides (beans and rice) were nothing special, but we'll go back for the green chili pork. The young man who brought the chips and meals was very pleasant and did a good job too!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and I don't know what happened! I went on a Sunday night with 3 other people. We all ordered different entrees and ALL got extremely sick the next day. I did notice in one of my beef tacos, I took a bite and had to spit it out because the ground beef was pink. I usually have great service and food, but this really ruined it for me and my family. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The chips and hot salsa are the rave here. My family does here sometimes just to buy large containers of salsa and chips to take home for snacking and parties. The beans they offer as a side are great as well. The fish tacos are ok. If you are from AZ then you will know their cheese crisps are delicious, simply cheese."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican places.  Really delicious chile rellenos!  I also love their chips and salsa.  :)"}
{"text":"I use to eat at the original years ago so thought we would swing by. First off empty parking lot. Second so expensive for a walk up counter. Better off down the street at boca. Third ground beef taco was slop and undercooked on a plate. Food just ok, equivalent of greasy Mexican drive thru.,Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the potato tacos, they don't come with the sauce they came with at the original Matta's on Main St but it's better than loosing them all together. Salsa is good and food is good. I miss the Main Street location but this place is great for take out."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Salsa out of a can, beans tasted canny, rice looked good but no flavor, good enchilada but was ruined with the funny tasting sauce.  Three dinners that were an 1/8 eaten. $43 wasted. Mattas had a great reputation. I wonder what happened? Not the cooks fault, np6r the employees. The staff only follow direction. I could have had a better dinner at taco bell. I wish Mattas the best!"}
{"text":"Went there the other nite for dinner because we frequent the Matta's on Dobson. I thought it would be the same, however, it just wasnt the same experience!! I will not go back to this one again in the future. The menu is hugely shown when you walk into the restaurant, however, by the time i got up to the counter to order, I'd forgotten what it was I wanted. and with the line forming quickly behind-I felt horribly rushed and uncomfortable. It just doesn't seem to be a very easy system for ordering. Also, by the time I was done ordering for 3 simple items from the menu with drinks, it was over 35 dollars( and this was without the tip)

The lady at the counter was extremely friendly and helpful!!! That I appreciated! The restaurant was very clean. It was busy, however, I just don't feel I got what I should have for the price. I will continue to go to the Matta's on Dobson. :)"}
{"text":"I should have know better from the look of the  empty parking lot how bad the foods will taste. Since we were with some friends and they told us before hand how much they like to eat at this place I got all excited. I like trying new restaurants especially Mexican foods. I thought the overall experience was okay except for the tasteless and bland foods and overprice! My son and I ordered beef burrito, chicken enchilada, and red pork tamale with rice and beans. Out of all these foods I thought the bland beans and rice were okay. Too much cheese on top of  the enchilada and very greasy. The shredded chicken inside it was dry and tasteless. The pork tamale was horrendous .It was very dried and hard. I could barely cut into it with a knife. It must have been frozen too because it taste like.  I don't think I ever had a tamale this bad in my life!! My son had the shredded beef burrito and it too looked very dried and there was some sort of juice kept running out of it as he was holding to bite it. I did't want to bother to taste his burrito from the look of how unappealing the juice keep dripping down on the plate.
The salsa for the chips was also terrible. It was bland and taste like can tomato sauce. The chips were okay. I would not waste my time or money at this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Chili Rellenos are awesome as are the cheese crisps.  The down side is the staff, they are not friendly and seem like anything you ask is a bother to them."}
{"text":"Great food, great lunch specials. I always get the three item combo, their tacos are damn good in my opinion. A kinda beans/ meat combo that works well. They put lots of cheese on everything which is a good thing. 5  stars!!!"}
{"text":"We had stopped going to this location a couple years ago. One day we took my 89 year old grandma for lunch and asked her to sit at a table while we went and ordered (she has a hard time standing for long periods of time). A member of the staff told her she was not allowed to sit until we had ordered. It was not particularly busy and there was plenty of available seating but they insisted she could not sit until we ordered. So we left and decided there were better places to go. Fast forward to today, we decided to give it another chance. Again, my now 92 year old grandma was with us and wanted to order something off the children's menu because she wasn't particularly hungry. After receiving our food a member of the staff came over and told us kids meals were absolutely for kids only and we were not allowed to order them for anyone except for a child. Seriously!? You went out of your way to make a point to tell us not to order from your kids menu next time? You have to be kidding me. Well you are in luck because I will not be ordering from any menu here again. To be honest the food is average at best. I like chicken tacos and the chicken tacos here are weird...the chicken meat is covered in some kind of gravy. Not very appealing and pretty salty. Chips and salsa are ok but not worth the rude service. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants with better food and better service."}
{"text":"I've lived here all my life and used to go to the original Mattas. It's definitely not what it used to be, they have gone downhill. 
When I was placing my order, I told them I  wanted the kids chicken fingers with rice and beans. Another girl leans over and tells the cashier that the kids meals are only for kids. The cashier then proceeds to ask me if this was for me to which I pointed at my son who was standing right next to me. Customer service is lacking. 
I also ordered the 2 item meal, which consisted of tamale, cheese enchilada, rice, and beans and I also ordered a shredded beef taco. 
After we were seated it took them a while to bring out the chips and salsa. I got the hot salsa and it was mediocre, nothing special.
The taco shell was horrible, like something you buy in a box at the grocery store. The shredded beef was ok. The tamale, with red sauce, was very dry and very average. The enchilada was not too bad, however, there's room for improvement. I think Filibertos has better food then Mattas now.
My son's chicken fingers were overcooked and a little too crispy. 
I have to say the quality of the food has gone down considerably over the years, not to mention how expensive it is compared to other places. It's WAY overpriced for what you get. There are far better places with far better quality than Mattas. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Not only  did I notice that you changed your Salsa and it tastes  like a tin can,you have also changed  your chips! Instead of the light airy chips they are now thicker and taste stale. I am officially done with Mattas."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after a \"girls day\".  It was clean as well as delicious!  This was the first time any of us have been here (as we are all from Alaska) but it won't be the last!  We received our food really quick.  It was delicious!  We met the owners Mom too so that was very nice!"}
{"text":"I have been going to mattas multiple locations since childhood.  They never cease to have the best products or quality.   The staff is always incredibly helpful and fast.  It's always awesome coming to mattas."}
{"text":"Came in to Mattas this evening and the best I can say about this place is that the staff were super friendly and courteous. The food however left much to be desired. I had the chilaquiles which amounted to chips swimming in red enchilada style sauce smothered in melted yellow cheese and a few chopped onions with an egg on top. Basically inedible. My husband had a combination platter that was fair, nothing spectacular, more like fast food at twice the price. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, food is fresh and made right. My family has been going to Mattas for 50 years."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I have lived in Phoenix for 9 years and have never eaten here before!  My friend has been going here for years and said we need to go for lunch. When you walk in, you order at the counter and then they bring it out to your table. I have seen some complain about that but I'm not sure why. I had an enchilada with green sauce and a soft rolled taco, rice and beans. The beans taste like REAL beans and not canned. The rice was good and the green sauce...wow!!  I only wish I found this place years ago!"}
{"text":"So, after just two visits, I am mystified as to how and why this Matta's location is still attracting customers.  Granted the original was quite good and worthy of a stop to eat some tasty food; but that location is no more and Matta's has since opened four more locations.  And like anything that has been divided, the parts must become greater than the sum of the original in order to be recognized as at least as good as the original.  Matt's calls this location \"Not fast food, but good food fast.\"  

I am ok with the concept of quick serve or no table service, but here, it is an odd mixture of both that just does not work well.  Perhaps it once did, or it makes sense to the owners and management, but I find the entire dine-in experience cold, indifferent and not at all hospitable.  You walk in the door and are immediately in front of a small foyer that adjoins a counter with registers and a menu above and behind.  If you have not been here before, seeing the drive-thru outside and counter placement upon entry, one would assume that this portion of the restaurant is for take away.  It is also easy to think that someone would greet you at the door/counter area and take you to a table - but not so.  You must order and pay at the counter.  Once you do, you are given a number and empty beverage glass and are left to find your own table and fill your own drinks . . . easily done when they are not busy and there is an available clean and empty table.  There is a reason restaurants seat their guests . . . so the restaurant is not over capacity, staff is available to assist and serve guests and there are clean and cleared tables of which to dine.  But here you fend for your self to get a table (I guess this is the difference between dining and eating).  The staff delivering the food bring you chips and salsa, and when your food is delivered, if you're smart, you will ask for an additional bowl of chips and extra salsa because it is nearly impossible to get more once your food is delivered . . . I know, I know, I'm just eating here, if I want to dine I will get takeout and go home (but at these prices? I should at least able to get more salsa or chips or a take-home container on my own without asking staff).

I think because if you pay for your meal first and also self-serve your drinks, it creates an arena for not tipping.  Therefore, you are left with an \"I don't really care\" attitude by the staff and a bit of guilt that someone else has to buss and clean the tables.  Further, a casual quick serve restaurant mandates concise meal descriptions, an ingredient list and preparation methods on the menu.  And at the very least photographs of the signature dishes, if not all of the dishes.  Just leaving it up to the staff to describe a dish or how it is prepared is just silly.

A positive: the chips and salsa are tasty, the Robert's Taco is an admirable attempt, however, it is a bit greasy and lacking in flavor or quality, especially given the price.  The beans are passable and it is hard to mess up a cheese crisp, but beyond that, No Bueno.  The Guacamole is a very similar to store bought in consistency and taste - if it is homemade, why prepare it in such a way that your customers even ponder the source?  And as much as I have a love for potato tacos, I cannot, in good faith and conscience, return to try them.  The final straw was a recommendation by the staff: the chilie relleno.  The relleno was filled with ground beef that was severely lacking in flavor and an overall consistency that was off putting.  Sadly, it was left uneaten, which is very unusual that I ever leave food on a plate, let it go to waste or not take it home for later.  The biggest disappointment came from the $42 spent for two combo plates and a sampler platter - and only having water to drink.  $42 is sit-down, full table-service, ingredients oozing with quality, flavorfully spiced and seasoned food, prepared, presented and plated with care price territory . . . but with the number of customers that frequent here I cannot see anything changing for the better.

Spending money on food without pleasure is, well, like flushing money down the toilet; but I digress.  For me, I am just not going to do it again, there are so many other Mexican food places to eat, even ones with a drive-thru, that are better quality, better service, better layout, even better ambiance and certainly a lot less expensive.  Yes, as I have said before, Mexican cuisine is so very subjective and that is precisely why on the same occasion that I had the dismal chilie relleno, a neighboring table was raving at how good it was.  

All of this has left me with no reason to stop the car here . . . I will just keep going . . . and unless you have eaten here, and like the food, the service and the prices, I suggest you go elsewhere too.

{"text":"No flavor in anything that I order here. Tried it for a 3rd time...that'll be the last. Bland, OK service, decent ambiance. Food is just no bueno. Gosh. I want it to be good, but it's just not."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is expensive ($10.00 and up) and its not that good.  Chili rellanos is stuffed with an odd tasting hash, tacos and bean buritos are generic and the red sauce is nothing special.  Salsa is pretty good but the chips are hard,cold,and boardering on stale.

Place is clean and service is nice.  You order at the register when you come in & they bring the food fairly fast.  Good service aside, skip this place."}
{"text":"10 dollars for a green chili pork burrito. Really? It's alright but not all that. Such a rip off. Main ingredient is ground beef. Try jalapeño bucks or Nandos. Way better!!! I won't go back."}
{"text":"This is their second location . Located in what was formerly a Boston Market, I truly must say this is one of my favorite family Mexican restaurants. I have not had the opportunity to try out many items on the menu but by far it has my favorite Chile Relleno's in the Valley. Side items are generous if not a bit costly (though I love Chipolte and guacamole is $1.50 vs $2.50 here). Decor is a bit dated but otherwise I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions. We live in north Phoenix.  Can over for Dr's appointment.  Thought we were going to loletas that we found on yelp and it we saw the sign that Mexican food. Oh well was good food and reasonable priced. Chili rellenos were good (#15), tamale was good as was #5"}
{"text":"The staff is the kind of staff that wouldnt be hired at a 24 hour Dennys. The place is a dive, it needs a remodel. The happy hour prices are what brought us in. (Margarita's) but once you are in you are shoved to a cash register where you have to keep going up to buy your drinks. The staff gives dirty looks and its the kind of place you think, I wonder what goes on in the back. We didnt dare eat appetizers like we normally do and we watched closely as they made our drinks.

Bummer, its close to home and we were excited about it.
Its too bad....."}
{"text":"Well not impressed.  The only good thing was the chips and salsa and my Dr. Pepper which was self serve.  Had the carne-asada burrito.  It was dried up beef with guacamole that lacked flavor.  I ask for the pico on the side and they brought me another bowl of salsa (great).  Well the cheese crisp was good, but fell apart as we were eating it.  The wife like her Chicken Burrito with green sauce, but in my opinion it was the stewed chicken place in a tortilla and the smothered with sauce and cheese then put under the broiler... All this for $22, well, last and only time...  OH...  The service and employees were great..."}
{"text":"So many awesome Mexican restaurants in the area...that this one just doesn't even begin to stand out.  Taco Bell across the street is the only worse option within a couple miles. The food is good, not great, not bad, but good. Temperature in the restaurant is freezing cold! Horrible tap water out of the soda machine, so order a drink because the water is awful. Salsa is less than mediocre, in fact...it's bad. The prices are a solid 20% higher than expected for an \"order at the counter and fend for yourself from there\" layout. Get your own drinks, silverware, napkins etc but pay the price of a nice sit down waiter establishment. Honestly, go to Salsa Cabana down the street. Better everything."}
{"text":"Found this grill while waiting for appointment wanted Mexican food so gave it a try.  Expensive...over $13 for 2 item combo...Mexican pizza $8.99with green chili...the meat was to be pork but had different taste some thing was off...the green chilis on top and other items were ok.  Sis had special for day...chicken burro combo and her drink...total over $13...to pay those prices expect to be at a regular restaurant.  Chips and salsa good.  Won't be back...notice website does not list prices..."}
{"text":"This place is like Fillabertos with plates, except the food isn't as good.

In short the price is inflated, the services is bottom of the barrel, and the food is lacking in quality, quantity, and taste. I cant fathom why this place would be on anybodies top 10, let alone best Mexican on the east side (East Valley Tribune). Give Los Dos (dobson) or Blue Adobe (country club) a shot instead.

The ladies at the register are frumpy, slow, and act as they don't care to speak or deal with you. There was no greeting, or any pleasantry - just an expectation of an order, a frown for using a card, and shove you on your way.

The servers bring an average salsa and repeat their obligatory hot, mild or both greeting(?). Again they don't seem to really care or even pretend.

I ordered the shredded beef chimi with green sauce, super nachos, and a chicken chimi. The beef was dry and bland, it seemed to lack seasonings of any sort. The green sauce again was more decoration then flavor, actually it didn't even look good. The cheese on top was definitely \"sprinkled\", and could hardly be found. The nachos were served with the same flavorless, unsalted chips they served with the salsa except they were covered with beans and what Ill assume is ground beef. We ate a couple and left the rest - just awful. The chicken chimi was tolerable according to the wife but she didn't seem impressed either."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorite Mexican food restaurants.  A legend in Mesa for years and their sandys Special is my favorite with a close second with their cheese crisps."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. I really like the \"Roberts Taco\". The crispy cheese crisp is also very good. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"For a quick Mexican joint that still has that sit down feel, look no further than Matta's. You order from the menu at the front register and they bring you food along with chips and salsa. They have fountain machines for serve yourself refills and keep the place looking clean. It can be a little pricey, almost $15 after food and drink, for a 2-item combo. It's a much better deal to head to Nando's down the street for cheaper lunch specials and full service."}
{"text":"This place was gross. I wouldn't call this Mexican food at all, it's an insult to Mexican food. The chop meat on the Mexican pizza reminded me of dog food.  I could have had better food at Filiberto's. The lettuce was frozen in the taco salad, and the tamales were stale! Never again I hope all our winter visitors don't think this is real Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place we go for the perfectly average and uninspired \"Mexican\" food that was introduced to us by our parents.  For whatever reason this place is an institution to residents of Mesa.  Nevertheless it occasionally hits the spot when we are looking for Mexican comfort food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and some pretty tiled tables. Other than that, We left thoroughly disappointed!  The food was of school lunchroom quality. I got the chicken chimichanga and my partner got the chicken fajita burro. For $10.99, I got a flour tortilla filled with bland chicken (could have come from a can?) covered in what seemed like canned red enchilada sauce. No beans, no rice. Hands down, the worse excuse for Mexican food I've ever been served! My partner's food looked marginally better but was tasteless also.  We really hoped this restaurant would have good food because it's so close by but we will drive to Taco Bell across the street if we are running short on time in the future."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, it's been a family favorite for years but has really gone down hill. Had the carne asada burrito and the \"carne asada\" was shredded beef that tastes like it was from a can. Prices have gone up and quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Love this place. It has excellent food. We've been to plenty of Mexican restrnts and they really don't have good shredded beef. This place is best we've had around here. Shhh! I don't think the snowbirds know about this place yet and let's keep it that way! Love good food that I don't have to stand in line for an hour or two for. 
5 stars if they served coke instead of pepsi. Can't have it all I 'spose."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. The hot salsa is very good. It is quiet and not too busy at 6:30 on a weekday night. I got the carne asada burro but don't expect it to be like any other carne asada around town. It is more like a super seasoned and moist chunked/pulled beef of some sort. I mean I know that is kinda what carne asada is but it's just not the same as other Mexican restaurants around so I was caught off guard. Would much have rather gone with my first choose of a bean and cheese burro which happens to be the Monday night combo platter including rice and beans. Over all it was good I'd come back for the bean and cheese burro and the hot salsa and chips. Don't forget the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Mesa. The food is delicious, the chips just keep coining, the environment is great, and the prices are good!

I love their burritos and chimichangas. The salads are good, too!"}
{"text":"This place is for people who are looking for 'mexican food' with a white trash spin on it...it's good if you like that kind of thing. I'd way rather go to any old Roberto's. Their Chips and Salsa is the only thing they have going for them."}
{"text":"This review is for the new location at E Brown and Ellsworth -- as of today it is not yet listed on Yelp, so I picked the closest location to it. This occurred around 3:30pm on 10/18/2015.

I had a quick trip to the Basha's in the parking lot and decided to run in real quick and see about getting a few things to go so I could try them out. When I walked it, it was pretty empty inside, one family at a table and a few people at the bar. The waiters were hanging out in the kitchen area and the bartender didnt even acknowledge me coming in, he was far too busy with whatever conversation he was having at the other side of the bar to be bothered. After a good 2-3 minutes of sitting there, being completely ignored, I left. Very disappointing. I probably wont be back, there are far too many other good options where I am treated like a human being. 

I am sure the food would have been good had I actually been acknowledged by the staff in the restaurant. I was actually pretty excited about a seemingly reputable Mexican place moving in near where I live. That excitement has turn to resentment and disappointment. 

If you are thinking about stopping by the brown and ellsworth location, forget it, go to Nando's, their service is far better and the chicken burrito's are second to none."}
{"text":"What in the world happened to this place. We used to go to the original Matta's in Mesa all the time. It was always packed.  How did they go from one of the staples of Mexican dinning in Mesa to a horrible fast food, drive up window of grossness?  Who did this to them? So depressing.  The food is gross and nearly uneatable.  I had the chimi and although it was full of tender beef it was enveloped  in a gelatinous blob of green sauce with orange specs of cheese that even invaded the lettuce, making it look like Lettuce aspic.  (For you young folks that's gelatin). The whole mushy thing made me gag a bit. I just don't understand how a restaurant with such a following could go this wrong. I give them a year tops and they are gone. Maybe they should have closed and gone out respected instead of turning into a joke.   What a pity"}
{"text":"Love the salsa, fast service, and food! I've been going here for years... it's my go to Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant as a kid at their other location, so I was excited to try it tonight. I shared a sampler platter so we could try many different items. I liked the mini burros the most, but not a fan of the ground beef taco. My husband got a carne asada burrito and it was not his favorite. I really like their beans though!"}
{"text":"Their cheese crisps are good! And I love the location & seating area. But the menu is old, out dated & lacks any type of excitement. It's needs to be modernized or this place may not be around much longer :(
It's also way overpriced!"}
{"text":"I defy you to eat the following items and tell me this isn't really tasty Mexican food.
1.  Start with the hot and also the chunky salsa. Mix 50/50. 
Eat almost all of the salsa with a couple of bowls of chips. Save some to put on entree. 
2.  sandy's special with beans and rice. 
3.  1 Roberts taco on the side. Roberts tacos are better than the regular taco cuz they're made with shredded roast beef. 
Granted, I could be biased having grown up eating this practically my whole life. Still, if you don't love this, you may have a serious medical condition...might wanna see a doctor...
Did I mention I love the beans and rice?
Oh, and the chili relleno. 
Their flour tortillas are really good so include cheese crisps and burritos."}
{"text":"We used to go to Matta's years ago when they were done on Main in Mesa, we loved their salsa, this new place has the same great salsa and the same beans and Roberts tacos. I think it's an average Mexican restaurant, the table side chip service was nice and I have to say every employee was helpful and friendly. If you are a old Mesa fan, then this will be a great place for you. If you are looking for a great burrito, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice old ladies \"if your into that sort of thing \"


J/K!


My friends who have lived in mesa for  much longer have been going to Matt's for years. Well bummer when matta's closed and we patiently waited for the new one to open.

Looked at the reviews on here and others complained.. well not this yelper!


We walked in, the building is nice but really has a fresh paint look going on rather than an authentic or rustic look. The mission style is well done but it simply needs the walls a bit more filled up or some paint work to make it look more the part.

The service I thought was prompt, the salsa was fine and when the food came it was nice and hot. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was tasty.


The lady who sat us and the server were very warm and friendly, my friends mentioned they had seen one of them since a child.. either she really likes the place or she is in the family!

4 stars.. with some decor and not a strip mall feel it might get a fifth.

{"text":"Again I always rate a Mexican Restaurant on these few things.

1.)  Are their Refried Beans homemade and do they taste good?
2.)  Salsa taste?  Are their tortilla chips homemade and are they light, airy, and fluffy?
3.)  Chimichanga taste and how large is their food portions?
4.)  Large Portion size of amount of food given especially in comparable to their prices?
5.)  Chili Rellenos any good?

I have gown up around Matta's my whole life.  It first started down by the Mesa Temple before these fast food chains from their kids began.  So here it goes!

Their refried beans are passable.  They do taste homemade but flavor could use a punch!  Not the best I have tasted but surely not the worst.

Their Salsa tastes great!  Chunky type of salsa and good!  Chips are pretty fluffy.

Their Chimichanga with shredded beef or chicken is AMAZING!!  One thing you have to try is their special recipe of sour cream!  Get it as a side for the Chimi and you won't be disappointed!  

They definitely have large portion sizes!  Great for the Chimichanga!

Their Chili Rellenos used to be better.  At the family owned Mesa location they used to have, their Chili Rellenos were incredible.  Now flavor has suffered.  Somewhat bland and not as large in portion size. 

As far as their enchiladas, nothing special in taste or portion size.  Also their cheese crisp.  There is nothing crispy about it.  Doused in melted cheese may sound nice but it's not when all your eating a big glob of GOOP!  Disgusting!  Check the picture out!  Lots of cheese is nice but you still need that buttery taste and a little crunch.

So best things here are the Salsa, Chimichanga any way you want it, and their special sour cream (I could take this home in the bucket fulls!)"}
{"text":"Good solid Mexican food. Good service, okay prices and always tasty. I get the nachos or one of the combo plates. My buddy always gets the chicken burro w/ sauce on top. Awesome salsa."}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican food, this is what I want. I worked here previously for several years and I still love the food. The kitchen staff is in there every day making salsa, chips and preparing everything fresh. The kitchen is always very clean. You could make a meal out of their chips and salsa! Nothing beats warm chips and fresh salsa. Both hot and mild are delicious. I can't leave without taking extra chips and salsa home. The food is always fresh and delicious. Some of my favorite items are the Roberts tacos and either shredded beef or chicken burritos. Add some red enchilada sauce and beans and it's my favorite meal there. It is pricier than some other fast food Mexican places, but this isn't a fast food establishment. It's a place to get good Mexican food fast. I will always recommend this place to anyone looking for some good quality Mexican food. The have great options for everyone in the family to enjoy."}
{"text":"Basically another Filaberto's type with lower quality foods, smaller portions & a lot higher prices"}
{"text":"Good food! A bit pricey. I love their chips and salsa, chili rellenos, bean burritos, chimis, and steak salad. I've been eating here for years and they always have decent service and good food. This is their best location since they've closed their Main Street location (my fav)."}
{"text":"Matta's is our favorite Mexican style restaurant. The service is great and the food is so delicious."}
{"text":"Located in another unassuming strip mall in Mesa, there's Matta's. It's relatively easy to spot. When you walk in you order at the counter and you're then escorted by a hostess to a free table. You get your own drink and they bring you chips and salsa. 

I ordered the special shredded beef taco plate (forgot the name) but the shell is deep fried and very good. It was near perfection, the beef was fantastic and moist and the rice and beans were great. The place was packed on a Friday night. Fifteen minutes after we arrived there was a line of 10 people waiting for tables. It appears to get busy but they bring the food out so fast, you more than likely don't have to wait very long for a seat. The salsa is also great and just the right amount of spicy which is so important. 

My date got the ground beef tacos and while it was good it's no shredded beef. I wouldn't recommend it, that's something that can easily be made at home. Shredded beef is always where it's at."}
{"text":"Well, after being a loyal patron since moving to Mesa, AZ in 1991, it's sad that Matta's and me will be apartin' ways. I love their food! Their food is great but my last 2 visits (1 to the Riverview location and most recently the Higley location) left me extremely disappointed due to menu changes and inflexible customer service. 

A few months ago at Riverview, I requested to make a substitution in an item that came with a new meal offering of their's that I wanted to order. My server told me it was not possible. (I'd like to note the young man was not my regular server, an awesome lady from Crotia who's terrific at her job!) The item I wanted sold a la carte for the same price as the item included in my meal. I even offered to pay a buck or two upcharge in order to get what I wanted but the server refused. I asked to speak with a manager several times but one never came to my table. I ordered something else and continued my request to speak with a manager who never came despite my server's reassurance that he would. I haven't been back since. 

Today, I stopped at the Higley location, ordered a burro with a side of sour cream and a drink. I've ordered this burro by itself numerous times over the past several years (most recently last month) but today I was told it now comes with choice of beans or rice. They could not sell me just the burro. After much insistence that I did not want either, a lady working behind the counter told cashier and me that I didn't have to take the side but they couldn't adjust the price. I thought she might offer to comp my side of sour cream or my drink in exchange; but no such luck. So, $10.69 for a burro and a drink! I just find it difficult to spend hard-earned money and either not be able to get what I want or feel taken advantage of. 

Matta's, it's been a nice run with you but I won't be coming back."}
