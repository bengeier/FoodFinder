{"text":"You could give this place a pass. Food is really average and service not great either. The place pales in comparison to other great options available in the area. I had samosa and pakoda for starters, chicken curry and paneer makhni for main course. The naan was great but rest of the food was very average."}
{"text":"If you are reading this review I am begging Do not waste your money!!!. You can cook a better indian food than  what this place has to offer. Its a Shame!!!"}
{"text":"Home-cooked taste makes this menu stand out. The buffet offers a variety of flavors, textures, colors and temperatures - from salads and sides to entrees and desserts - and truly gives you your money's worth.  I've eaten Indian cuisine in Thailand, New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and one other place in NE Ohio. This fare isn't heavy or over-spiced like in some restaurants - it's the kind of food you can eat everyday without \"consequences\".  Inviting ambiance, properly authentic without being overdone, the place is clean and friendly. You don't leave smelling of your meal.  It's a good value for what it delivers, though it would be easier to frequent with a lunch option around $6-$7.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 1pm, for the lunch buffet special. There was no one managing the restaurant and there was very little food at the buffet. We called in the back for a waiter and went to grab the scraps left on the buffet. All of the food was incredibly dry and tasted very old, as if it had been sitting out for hours. After 20 or more minutes of waiting, no food had been added to the buffet. After numerous complaints over the next half hour, they finally brought out exactly 2 pieces of tandoori chicken, a small helping of butter masala and they didn't restock on anything else. I brought a family of 4, and paid $46 for our meal. I have never been to a buffet where there was nothing to eat."}
{"text":"We ordered chilli panner, paneer jalfrazi and chicken 65 ! They all literally taste the same. They used the same sauce for all three dishes. And chicken biryani wasnt tasting anything like biryani. One of the worst restaurants here in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Wow.  My hub and daughter and I stopped here on a whim after apple picking a few weeks ago.  Delicious!  The Butter Chicken was my fav and the naan was Amazing.  sooo good.  And Then I tried it with all the different sauces.  Magic.  Also magic, before and after eating, my daughter played at the train table the whole time, so Insta-date.    We went back to try the lunch buffet on Saturday hooooping it was just as good.  And it was.  Even more sauces to try on lots of delicious food.  I went back for more sauce, more of the chicken more of the bread (to die for) and more chickpeas and some kind of pumpkin curry yumminess.....  Oh, and the mango ice cream ahhhh  and a tiny thin crispy fried dough bowl that I put about 5 mixtures of peanuts and green onion? salad?  ( I need to look it up online)  Fresh salty crunchy savory sweet...Party in my mouth.  And I never get drinks, but I got the sweet lassi and ...it has cardamom.  Swoon.      I've spent big chucks of my life living in other countries, so when I crave international food, I will driiiiiive if need be...so I can't believe I can just go here instead of the 40 minute trek I've been making."}
{"text":"Found this place via Google search and stopped in for lunch. The restaurant was empty, which is typically a sign to me to leave. I am so glad I didn't!  My meal was FANTASTIC. .an explosion of flavors more vibrant than any meal I've had at Cafe Tandoor or Saffron Patch. I ordered the Chicken Mango...\"Spicy\" Level. It was perfect, as was the onions kulcha. The meal portion is big enough to share. The mixed pickle was delish..not mustard based, but red Chile based.  One reason it may be empty for lunch is the price...with tip and order of onions kulcha to go, my meal was over $30. It would be nice if they implemented smaller, less expensive lunch choices.   I can't wait to go back with a friend!"}
{"text":"Very good food, can be on the spicier side so make sure to take that into account. Price is on par with other Indian restaurants in the area. Located near the Summit mall."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet on a Saturday. The food was spicier than what I've had on other buffets, so I was pleasantly surprised. They didn't have a huge selection but the items they had were very good, except for the butter chicken which was dry. It is a bit pricey but I will return."}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 or 6 times, ordering off the menu (never tried the buffet).  The food is consistently very good.  The owner/chef is friendly and will prepare to your taste.  It;s a great carryout option - delicious and healthy."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place and then hugely disappointed. Walked in, the place was very hot and only 2 tables with people. Very empty for 7pm Friday but we still wanted to try. We ordered Gobi Manchurian and Eggplant Masala both spicy. The food was inedible. The amount of spice nobody can handle. No flavor just hot. Also the eggplant was just minced and cooked in Chana Masala gravy. We didn't want to waste the food so we took it to go. We could fix at home. I let the waitress know about the spice level. Instead of offering to adjust the heat level she looked at my Indian friend (who I took to the restaurant as she's visiting from Mumbai), and said \"Don't bring her here I guess.\" I am Not India but lived for years there and my husband is an Indian and an amazing chef. I can handle spice. Both of us were horrified at the whole experience..."}
{"text":"It was 1:30 pm on Friday , thank God no crowed , only 4 people in the Resturant  went for lunch  buffet , server was walking in a t-shirt , food has ABSOLUTELY NO TASTE !!!!  A very limited and cheap  variety, will not go back !! Burger King has better taste ! Save your money. Gross food and filthy environment. No dessert items were available either."}
{"text":"Went  for the second time, food is excellent and the menu is large. Had the medium level of spice and it was great, although some in our party of four felt it very spicy. Had the specialty dishes which are served with rice and can be shared with others in your party. As far as price, maybe a little high, but go to the website and get a half off second entr√©e coupon to print! Very clean, great parking and good service."}
{"text":"Food is very good, a little expensive but worth the price! Portion sizes were a little small compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. We ordered the tikki masala and biryani and were not disappointed! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good food! My go to here is the paneer tikka masala. The flavor is amazing, It features nuts with a hint of a taste of honey.   Only critique, very pricey in comparison to other Indian restaurants. Would frequent more often if not for the steep price point."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday at 1 pm. There were very items and the quantity was even lesser. I don't understand why they had some chaat, it was horrible and the presentation was bad. I usually start with chaat, so I was disappointed already. The main course lacked flavor and the butter masala was too sweet. Biryani was not the aortic authentic indian biryani. So main course, sucked. Then the desert, it was basically flavored ice. Nothing was indian except the cinnamon in it. Very bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Maybe the best Indian food around! The atmosphere is cozy and charming! We can't wait to bring friends and to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 8/30/2017: Looks like they moved to Fairlawn. I haven't tried the new location. No need to know, as the former Raj Mahal down the road re-opened as Everest and is now terrific!  _______________________________________ Original review of 11/22/2014:  Never heard of this place before, so assuming it's new to this location. Clean and decor isn't unpleasant, but it def had that strip-mall-place-striving-to-be-more feel to it.  Menu was pretty varied, and had lots of things you don't typically see on NEOH Indian restaurant menus, like goat curry and lots of chili-focused Indo-Chine items. But...you get one lonesome little half piece of papadum to munch on pre-meal. You can order more -- for a charge. Being my first visit, I kept it simple and ordered their lamb curry. Based on the waitress's advice, using the papadum condiments as a guide, I went with hot for the spice level, and added an order of garlic naan.  My food arrived in a reasonably short amount of time. I'd wondered how the portion sizes would be, given the entree prices, which were high for this place, as other reviewers have noted (ranged from $16 to $23). But they weren't any larger than what you get at other places, generally for $3-4 less. The curry was ok -- the lamb was well-cooked and tender, but the sauce was more of a tomato-ey gravy than a typical curry -- and the spice level didn't come close to MAC standards. The naan was a little dry and definitely weak on garlic. I'd say that everything was fresh, certainly far from awful...but it just lacked that balance of hearty and earthy that so characterizes good Indian cooking which beyond just serving as a decent meal, actually fulfills that deep, soul-craving that leads one to Indian food in the first place. Particularly for the price -- I've had way more satisfying Indian food for much less many times.  After all, that's what Indian food is all about. Indian food is more than eating. Good Indian food is edible excitement. It fills the belly, warms the soul and fulfills a desire for something beyond the ordinary.  So, for now, not wildly exciting. I kind of wonder if prices will drop once they secure their liquor license, which would be a good thing for this place if they hope for repeat customers. It's closer than Bombay Sitar in Canton, but not nearly as good as Jaipur Junction in Hudson. But try it for yourself if you're in the area -- not much else around here worth eating."}
{"text":"The best part of the restaurant was old Hindi songs and temperature of the water. I tried the buffet over here, it wasn't good at all. They didn't have many food items and even the taste of the food was below average. If anyone is trying Indian food for the first time, I won't recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was acceptable I didn't like their masala, it was just too sweet.  I like Cafe Tandoor better than this place.  They had a bunch of kids running around and our waiter was little out of it.  We ordered samosas with meat and got vegetarian instead...we didn't  make a big deal out of it but that to me is the kiss of death when you start screwing up orders...won't be back.  Don't recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place to go. The food is fabulous especially the butter chicken and the rice. My wife loved the Tikka Masala and the samosa,  even though the samosa was super spicy, which I don't mind but she does. All and all the food was great and we will order from this place again.   P.S : medium spicy is hot."}
{"text":"this place is amazing everytime!  everything is fresh and full of flavor.  today they had homemade mango ice cream, it was awesome."}
{"text":"Consistently great flavor.  Staff is really nice, just wish it were a few dollars cheaper.  Dinner for 2 with naan is usually almost 50$ with tip."}
{"text":"Favorite Indian place in Akron. Saffron Patch is closer to my house, but I will always drive a little further to go here instead."}
{"text":"Weird location but good food! I've never actually been to the restaurant, just sent hubby to pick it up to go but I know where it is and even my hubby said it was a weird spot. Only \"complaint\" is that their mild is still spicy!! I'll admit that I'm a baby when it comes to spicy but I enjoy the flavors/kick at other Indian restaurants at their level of mild. My mouth is on fire after a few bites from this restaurant. This hasn't stopped me from ordering again, just something to keep in mind when ordering."}
{"text":"We have missed them since they left Montrose area......the food was as good as we remembered!   Shrimp Tandoori was great.....lamb Rogan josh was too!  Great family run restaurant!"}

{"text":"I went for their lunch buffet and must say that I was disappointed... First of all, I love Indian food and really wanted to like this place... But alas, it was unfortunate....   First of all, the place was nicely located at the end of the plaza and easy enough to get to. Lots of parking lot is always a plus. The inside was nice and clean with a children play area near the restroom. My waiter was very nice, polite and helpful. And for what I can see, all the staff are very nice as well.   Let's talk about the food. Granted I came for the lunch buffet and was told that they were running a back to school, $7.99 special. Sweet deal right!!! Uhmm well let's see.... The buffet has limited selection, which I guess for the price ... It's okay. However, most of the food are lacking in spice (we are not even talking about heat here, just spice) and left me with something to be desired......   My selections were the pakora, which was okay. Then there's the runny eggplant masala, the under seasoned Bombay aloo, and the also runny with almost none left chicken curry (chickie pieces are almost gone) and perhaps the only decent selection of the bunch albeit also left something to be desired, chicken tandoori.  The meal comes with a quartered naan... Which again, was only okay. My favorite was the raita with plenty of veggies included.   I also ordered a chai tea ($3) which was definitely the savior of my meal, even though it was on the pricier side. The chai tea had just the right amount of spices and milk. It  also came unsweetened so one can add as much sugar as one wants. Definitely the highlight of my lunch.   All in all, I was hoping that I would like this place, but was disappointed at the food quality. Maybe if I had chosen from the regular menu, I will not be as disappointed? But as of right now I do not think that I will come back. Which was a bummer since this place was closer to my place than some of the other Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Six of us went back again for dinner Friday night. We all ordered something different and shared our plates: fish, lamb, chicken, shrimp with a variety of nan , sauces, cucumber salad up front.  An exotic treat for the taste buds - Boti Kabob (lamb) was my favorite.  It's BYOB, so pack a cooler.  Bring friends and do an Indian smorgasbord.   Very casual and accommodating.  Amazing chef cranking out an impressive variety of dishes. Waitress was very helpful with the menu. Take out available."}
{"text":"Their food is decent.  I've been to the buffet as well and the selection is pretty good and the price is about $10/person.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly. My only poor comment is that the appetizers were fairly expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Dude. Duude. DUUUUUUDE. So happy to see these guys up and running again. There can never be enough Indian restaurants around.   When the Fairlawn location closed it's doors, I was disappointed. The food was always good and the owner was always pleasant and welcoming.   While at an event at Emidio's Banquet Center, I happened to see the bright red \"BOMBAY GRILL\" letters shining in my rear view. I ditched the event as soon as I was able and found myself enjoying some pakora, Lamb Rogan Josh and an order of naan.   And it was wonderful. A warm, rich sauce on the Lamb with just a little kick (I was splitting it with my wife and she's not as find of the spice factor--wuss) was delicious. Something I could eat everyday.   The pakora was fresh and crunchy, everything I could want in an appetizer. We saved some to dip in the LRJ sauce. Fantastic. Then we shared a bowl of rice pudding. It was a nice exclamation point to the meal.   The place feels new--mostly because it is. It's a big, open space and the sound echoes which is my one complaint. Some heavy fabric or some booths would dampen the sound some. But that's a pretty minor complaint.   I finished my dinner about 25 minutes ago. I'm still stuffed but I'm already excited to go back."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. 5/5  Ordered my food spicy.  They made a pretty big deal about how hot their food was, seemed average to me.  4/5 Chicken Makhani was solid,  I'm used to a bit more cream / butter in mine to cut the acidness of the tomato, Maybe they mixed it up?  The basmati rice was super plain.  Again I'm accustomed to a bit of seasoning. 3/5. Garlic Naan was good, no issues. 5/5"}
{"text":"Love it. Very good Indian food! I truly hope it survives. Doing my part to make sure it doesn't."}
{"text":"Stopped at 11:45 on a Monday. Place was empty. The buffet wasn t set up yet. Waitress was friendly. I waited maybe 10 minutes. Food was ready. Really? There was very little to choose from. I love Indian Food and frequent different places. The food on the buffet was absolutely tasteless. I left hungry. For the price, I expect more variety , a better chef and better service. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  The prices are too high for the amount of food.  More expensive that saffron patch with about half as much food.  Everyone left hungry which has never happened at an Indian restaurant for us.  They also do not serve chips and chutney, it is an additional charge. Staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I am a bit of a newb when it comes to Indian cuisine, but this place has an explosion of flavor, recommend highly."}
{"text":"I am new to Cuyahoga Falls and have lived in a lot of different cities. I would say the Indian food here is by far in the top 10% of Indian restaurants I've been to. Bombay Grill offers a wide range of tasty dishes. The owners are very nice!!! I will definitely be going back. The naan was amazing and so was the paneer!!! Spread the word, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!! Lunch buffet is joke with no attention to food which is being served.  Taste of food is mediocre compared to what should be Indian food taste like.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"These guys moved from Cuyahoga Falls to Fairlawn, I thought, they improved their quality standard as it wasn't doing good previously. But its the same, I tried buffet on a Friday afternoon and it was bland, tasteless, not much variety, no naans left and a month old hard rock strawberry ice-cream for dessert. I am an Indian and I'm not a hard critic, I generally like most of the food but their's is the worst I have ever had. They are a shame on the face of Indian food !! Its very easy for them to make big bucks if they just increase food quality and variety because there are no Indian restaurants near by and most of the people love Indian food. To the Owner..Plzz increase your quality or it won't take time for you guys to go out of business again.."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Prices are too high for the small portion size. Below expectations. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"They seem like nice people. But the decor looks thrown together. The food was average. The naan flat and hard (on buffet). The other dishes just average. Maybe the cooks / owner is from another part of India, so the typical American choices in an Indian restaurant (masala, curry) aren't in their childhood past. Just not flavorful."}
{"text":"\"Would you like some naan to go with that proselytizing?\"  I have been in the Bombay Grill on several occasions and have always found the food and the experience to be pleasant, though not outstanding. Since it is closer to me than Saffron Patch, I found it to be a decent substitute. Today, I ordered the Aloo Gobi which I have ordered many times at both the Bombay Grill and other Indian restaurants. When it arrived, I found it to be very dry and except for the \"heat\", possessing little flavor.  However, as poor as it was, it is not the food about which I am writing, When I came in and sat down I immediately ordered, knowing in advance what dish I wanted. As I sat waiting for my food I was struck by the awful music playing over the speakers instead of the usual appropriate Indian music. I listened closer and soon realized that they were playing the local \"Jesus-rock\" station (\"The Fish\"). Unbelievable. I requested of the waitress that she put on something else and she told me the owner liked to listen to it while he was working.   I was just about ready to walk out when she brought me my food and fortunately she finally changed it to Indian music. But what could possibly dispose someone to think that pushing your religious views on the public is a good business practice? I don't go out to eat to be preached to and I found it highly offensive.   Needless to say, I won't be returning to this establishment. I'll drive the extra miles to Saffron Patch.....the food is better anyway!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I loved it! Stopped by to sample the buffet for lunch and got to try several things like the Butter Chicken. After trying it, I know why it's a popular favorite! They have vegetarian and vegan choices, too, that are delicious alternatives to those who don't eat meat. I'm so glad to have a great Indian restaurant close to home!"}
{"text":"This is my second time ordering. The first time wasnt that great either. Only gave them a second chance because they deliver. I ordered Lamb Curry and Keema naan. The curry was bland and watery along with watery rice. The naan was soggy (maybe because of delivery). I've definitely had better! Looking for good Indian make the trip to Canton and try Bombay Sitar. I wish I had instead of laying on my couch"}
{"text":"So we are working in the Akron area and have trying several restaurants.  Last week we ate at the Saffron Grill,  It was OK but the chicken in the chicken makani had no flavor.  This place was really good!  Probably the best Indian food in the Akron area.  The prices were very goodas well.  We will be returning here often for when we want Indian food."}
{"text":"The lunch box special Mon-Thurs for $6 is a great deal -- the food was freshly prepared and very good! I go back often now. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here for dinner around 6:30pm. The restaurant was clean and nice, but there were about 4-6 customers. I got seated right the way, and the waiter was really nice and friendly. There're also tables outside of you want to sit outside and enjoy the weather. I ordered a lamb curry dish which came with white rice, which costed $18.00. I also ordered some garlic naan bread on the side, which costed about $3.50. While waiting, I counted about 5 customers came in to pick up their food. So I guess they do well with take-out. When the waiter brought out my food, the portions looked small but they actually filled me up. I was really disappointed because there wasn't much lamb in my curry. In addition, the curry was watery and didn't have much flavor. It was pretty plain, and the more I ate it, the more it tasted like tomato soup instead of curry. The white rice was normal. The garlic naan bread had cilantro and some garlic on it. It was decent, not the best garlic naan bread I've had. In conclusion, I'm a big fan of Indian food, and I've had Indian food from many different restaurants, but this one prob was the worst. The price of the lamb curry was a little high for its quality. I would recommend you try other dishes instead of the lamb curry."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE FOOD!. Worst Indian food I ever had. Went there for buffet on Friday afternoon and the food was stale ,cold and smelling bad. This place does not deserve a place on this earth!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out Bombay Grill for lunch buffet and another time for dinner. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about Indian food. We actually got into conversation about street food in India and so on. Some items were decent and some items were at the borderline of being called sub-par. Chicken Makhani and vegetable dishes, Aloo Gobi, Kadai Lamb were good but tandoori and rice were dry. I've been there several times and the food is not very consistent. Overall it was a bit below average experience. On additional note, I'd like to see much more spices used on these dishes. Having been to other Indian restaurants, this place is pale in comparison in term of spicy hot and tangy flavor."}
{"text":"My wife and I were ready to go to Boston Market when we saw a sign outside this restaurant advertising their \"harvest time\" special lunch buffet for $7.95 and we succumbed to temptation.  We've always liked Indian food and it had been many months since we've had a meal there at Bombay Grill.  They had fresh naan bread, made in very small batches, and a few cold salads.  Their spicy cucumber salad was good and had a good kick.  Their tomato soup was also quite tasty and I had two cups of it.    Unfortunately, their rice was dry and not fit to be served (or on the buffet line).  Their tandoori chicken was edible but alas, also quite dry.  The curry chicken was watery and somewhat bland. Their other vegetarian dishes were also somewhat bland in my opinion.  The service was average, not spectacular nor bad.  It will probably be several more months before we return for another meal."}
{"text":"I know my Indian food, as I'm from India. The food here comes to as close as what I can get from home. Good wholesome food . love it. Lamb vindaloo and spinach pakoras rock. There's not much that I don't like here."}
{"text":"Horrible! Worst buffet ever!! Stale food ..barely anything to eat!! Please listen to an Indian and never go there!!!"}
{"text":"One star...for effort. If you want Indian food made by white people and songs licking Jesus' feet (and food that tastes the same) then this is the place for you. If you aren't a fan of hardcore missionary colonialism then just go to Saffron Patch in Merriman Valley. I guess Bombay could be nice for a church retreat."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian cuisine right in Fairlawn Ohio - convenient with easy parking, outside dining, great prices, lovely and knowledgeable wait staff - the food is high quality, HEALTHY, expertly prepared and tastes exquisite. We ordered a basket of naan breads, cucumber salad, shrimp with rice and chicken and vegetables with rice and lentil soup. Forget the fast food in this area and try something fabulous for a change. When we were there a family with a few small children were having dinner - the kids loved it! There is something for everyone on this menu.  Give it a try even if you have doubts about unknown spices - you will be very surprised. I feel its important to support this type of restaurant to keep it in Fairlawn - not enough good food in this area any longer."}
{"text":"Very impressed!!! They were willing to make items from scratch for me to accommodate difficult allergies to onions and carrots! It was all amazing! Will definitely eat here over and over again! Only complaint was slow service from waitress and lack of cheese naan :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The best Indian food I have ever experienced! Everything made from scratch! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bombay Grill is simply amazing, I have tried Indian food in several different countries and islands, and nothing has compared to George's kitchen at Bombay Grill. You have to try his tomato soup it's such a basic name in the soup world but it's the best tomato soup you can ever imagine!"}
{"text":"Went there for the lunch buffet.  The food and service were good, but the price felt pretty high.  That's the only reason I probably won't go back.  I'm not looking to spend over $15 on a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The only negatives you will ever hear on this place is that the lunch buffet leaves more to be desired...other than that this place is outstanding. I used to live in Chicago off Devon Street which is known to have some of the best Indian and Pakistani food in the U.S. Bombay Grill in Fairlawn holds its own. It is a wonderful family restaurant with outstanding customer service. The prices can be a little high, but you will have leftovers and when you have a craving for Indian food...who cares right? Support this fantastic establishment and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Well I just got back from my first visit to the new Mertz location of Bombay Grill and I was very pleased. Our server was great. The food was amazing. The naan was delicious. There was a bit of a wait for the food but it was made to order and it was worth the short wait. We ordered the vegetable pakora and it was a little more well done than expected but was very nice. The chutneys were delectable and one of them was nicely spicey-hot. I had the Chicken Saag and it was great.  It is rare that something comes out as hot as I like but this was. My colleague had the vegetarian dish with peas. I forget the name. It was tastey. I recommend this place. It's on a side street (Mertz) and a little hard to find but it is well worth it.   I just returned and it is better than before!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and been favorably impressed. Two times I ate the buffet which has a good selection of both vegetarian and meat entrees.   A friend and I both had the channa dal and loved it. I generally like Indian food hot, and I find even a medium to be plenty hot. Also, the pickle is excellent and included in the buffet.  The Decor it is rather spartan, and the chairs a bit hard. Pricing is alright not fantastic but also not unreasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday afternoon hoping for a variety of vegetarian dishes in the buffet, but was disappointed. So had to turn to the a la carte.  Ordered the malai kofta and a mango lassi, both of which were a delight to the palate... a subtle taste and good consistency. The only reason this falls short is because the price does not do justice to the quantity. Having spent as much, I was expecting a bit more.  Also, adding some Indian music and decor will surely add some heat to this grill!"}
{"text":"I love the Bombay Grill! The chicken tikka masala is the best I've had anywhere!! Their prices are fair, the service is friendly and fast, the restaurant is clean and the food is GOOD. Do yourself a favor and come visit!  4/13/17: they moved to 117 MERZ BLVD, FAIRLAWN"}
{"text":"Really Disappointed with the quality and quantity of this food. Not very good flavors and the Butter Chicken had the same sauce as the Tikka Masala.  Major issue with their flavors and makes me wonder where they got their recipes..."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed.  I haven't actually eaten in the restaurant (only take-out) but for what we paid I expected more.  Not more food, just better quality and taste.  It was fine, and they will probably do well since they're the only Indian place in Fairlawn.  I would rather drive the extra 15 minutes to go to the Saffron Patch though."}
{"text":"Disappointed on my return visit.  The butter chicken had a lot of sauce, but not much chicken. Overall spice level was bland; not at all what we asked for. Service was a bit slow. Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. We are fans of Bombay Sitar in N Canton and were very pleased to find this place closer to us. Looking forward to trying their buffet."}
{"text":"I normally go to Raj Mahal but was disappointed to see when I Googled their menu to place my order that they are permanently closed. First time at this place and was disappointed with the food.  I ordered take out and when I got there at 7 pm there was only 1 table with people at it. My garlic naan tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave - it had that tough texture bread takes on when it is microwaved. The eggplant masala was a liquidy mush.  The bhindi masala was ok.  I will be making the drive to Jaipur Junction next time."}
{"text":"So happy to have this place back up and making great food. The Butter Chicken is even better than I remember. Their new location is near the state rd/bath rd intersection. The staff is appreciative and attentive to every guest. Fresh naan is provided during the buffet, unlike other places that keep a bunch under a heat lamp. I am looking forward to trying their biriyani and vindaloo. I wish these guys nothing but the best. Thinking of this makes me want to go today. Do yourself a favor and give it a chance."}
