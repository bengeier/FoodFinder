{"text":"Picked this off of yelp reviews. My wife and I loved it! Laid back atmosphere. Will be back. Tom and Linda are great!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we loved It! Tom and Linda have created a harmonious atmosphere where you can enjoy good wine, light food, and the company of family and friends. The view is spectacular! Next time we hope to enjoy a sunset on the patio."}
{"text":"What a jewel....I so enjoyed my Sunday afternoon sipping my Arizona white blend wine along with a tasty cheese panini.  The views are spectacular!! Owners Tom and Linda, and chef David were so welcoming. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Raven's View and what a view! It's peaceful, beautiful, great service, tasty wine and beer, d'lish cheese board and most of all...it's dog friendly patio. We will be back! It's a drive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Good from afar but far from good. Place is beautiful but owner is very unfriendly and seemed to be overwhelmed. With so many dining options in Cave Creek and this place being REALLY out of the way they should make every guest feel welcome. I will not return.  To comment on your rant below. I was not part of the large party that you tore apart.  This is a perfect example of why any success with your business will be short lived. I support local business all the time but they actually appreciate it.   I also see that you revised your previous comment. So allow me to repost it so everyone can see how you treat your customers. Please see photos for the original comment."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and view with a comfortable and stylish atmosphere. Great wine and the 3 cheese panini was delicious. Plus, they have a small little store to grab a sixer and ice cream for a little something later. Highly recommend it to those that live nearby, or if you want to take a pleasant and cool drive to Bartlett Lake or Seven Springs, this is the place to stop for a bit."}
{"text":"UGH!!! After looking on both website and Yelp to make sure they were open this summer, we drove ALL the way up here to discover a sign on the door saying they're closed until August 3."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a locally-owned place for drinks and an appetizer and came across Raven's View!  Tom and Linda are gracious hosts and we had a wonderful time.  Best part:  no one under 21!  Great idea for those of us who want a quiet, relaxing atmosphere.  Thanks from Colorado!"}
{"text":"great place to  stop after a hard bike ride out to seven springs"}
{"text":"Tom and Linda are the best! Adorable location with a beautiful view.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and genuinely loved it all. Indoor in the winter is charming and cozy, outdoor in the warm weather is all beautiful views and a perfect shady patio. We were treated like family from the first visit. We are definitely wine snobs and the list keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Great views, wonderful wine and bottled beer selection, knowledgeable, serene and friendly service by Tom. Imaginative food thoughtfully presented (you will NOT find the ubiquitous pulled pork slider here!) Comfortable seating inside with an eclectic style to it. Bar seating inside and out, as well as several patio tables which have blankets in case of a  chill at the 3500ft altitude. I always seem to meet nice chatty folk here at this local gem."}
{"text":"Was excited to visit since this restaurant is very close to our home. Food was delicious and the kitchen gal was so pleasant. I wish she owned the place. She had a great personality and a huge smile on her face. The owner was not inviting at all. Not child friendly. I felt very uncomfortable as if I was an unwanted guest in their home. My lil guy is awesome and not a rough and ready child. We sat there and played provided table games for a few and I would have stayed longer but was stared at by Linda. What a shame bc I have so many people that I would have brought to this local gem."}
{"text":"In the most unlikely but beautiful spot, way out East on Cave Creek Road, is this new, cool wine bar.  Spectacular views & friendly owners.  Fun little snack menu.   The locals call it their \"Cheers\"!"}
{"text":"WOW!! First off the views are absolutely stunning at sunset. This is such a cute hidden gem in cave creek. The owners are super friendly and the food and drinks are great as well! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We just finished a hike at Seven Springs and were heading back into Scottsdale and we spied the Raven's View, an oasis in the desert.  We enjoyed a glass of wine and some delicious apps with a brilliant view.  Loved the isolated feel!  Looking forward to an evening visit to enjoy the dark skies and desert solitude."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, but too high priced for area. Wine and beer are very pricey. House wine was $8 and came from a twist cap wine bottle. Not aware of any happy hours...not when we were there. And, we asked. Go down the road to Harolds...great kind of wine at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I was so excited about Ravens View and enjoyed a couple of nights here with friends until the owners chose a family special occasion night to enforce a self imposed rule not to allow anyone under 21 to dine or drink there. My son (16) and I could not join the rest of the family.  The way we were treated left a bad taste.  I wish them all the best, but we'll never return."}
{"text":"For what Raven's View wants to be...a locals wine bar with some comfort food and a great view...they deliver 100%.  The owners Tom and Linda are gracious and doing what all world travelers who love wine dream about: opening a locals wine gastro pub!  We will be back...alot"}
{"text":"OK, this is a rave.  The decor is modern but comfy, the wine list is beautifully constructed from affordable to exquisite, and the food that we had was gourmet and delightfully light.  We went for early happy hour- a late snack.  We enjoyed a bottle of Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc that was perfect with our truffle popcorn (accented with sunflower seeds-- great!) and the margarita panini that has just the perfect amount of balsamic that set it apart as delicious.  Kim Westhoff bought the place this spring and has done wonders.  It is definitely worth the drive up.  Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Real great spot with awesome views, great food and cold beer! I've noticed this place on my bike rides...and, my wife and I finally made it there recently....super cool place...the owners, Linda and Tom are really friendly...real great vibe...the views are unreal....give it a try ....it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is our second time and thoroughly enjoy this little wine bar.   In the middle of literally no where, it's so calming and comfortable.  The Owners, friendly and welcoming.  I feel like they inviting us in their own private home.  A truly lovely spot."}
{"text":"Great place for cyclists to get refreshed. After climbing to the towers this place is perfect for a quick break, coffee good food and Gatorade. We will be back. Great service"}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant North of ... everything   Small, with limited hours and menu. We came during Saturday breakfast and everything ordered was freshly prepared; we liked it.  The views are gorgeous and decor a southwest/industrial mix.  Very easy going energy where we sat and enjoyed views with no rush.  Well worth the visit for a light breakfast/Lunch."}
{"text":"I love it!  We have a beautiful wine bar in the far north area, woohoo.  The location is pretty north, just a little bit more than the turn off to Bartlett Lake.  The outside patio is nice, it would be super enjoyable during the beautiful evenings in the fall, winter and spring.  The wine list is not very large, but they have enough to choose from.  I had a couple of glasses of the Malbec, it was very smooth.  My husband had the Pinot Gris.  We also ordered Linda's board, 3 cheeses and a couple of meats plus accompaniments.  After we decided to share a pressed Prosciutto and Fig sandwich, it was very tasty. I can't wait to come back with some friends who live in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with friends who were just buying a home in Desert Mountain so it was a great intro to the neighborhood. We had lots to talk about so the fact that service was a little slow because Linda was out sick didn't bother us. We were delighted that they had Rombauer Chardonnay but only one chilled so Tom had to quick chill the second bottle for us (now appears it is no longer on the list). The menu is a little limiting but we didn't starve however it would be nice to have a few more options. We split the deviled eggs (no longer on), the Linda Board (which now there are new names), a pretzel, and a panini."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident, on a scenic drive by. And boy are we happy we did! Not only is he place cool, relaxed, and full of good vibes, the owners are particularly friendly, approachable and attentive. We had the very unexpected opportunity to see many mule deer come by too!"}
{"text":"What a jewel in the desert. Great wine list, nice menu, attentive staff. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Wow - what a lovely, little hidden gem of a place about as far north as you can go in the Valley!  We stopped in yesterday for a glass of wine and a meat/cheese plate on the lovely patio overlooking the golf course with our dog.  Friendly staff, amazing views and a nice menu too...such a lovely escape from the city and even a little cooler too!"}
{"text":"Followed the sign \"Beer and Wine Pub 1 mile away\" after a Sunday drive to Bartlett Lake and so glad we did! Ravens View was beautiful and comfortable space with amazing views! We'll be back to enjoy another cold one soon!"}
{"text":"[My wife and I discovered this place on our way back down the mountain from the Sears-Kay-Ruin. What an awesome find. She had avocado toast and eggs. I had a waffle and sweet oatmeal. It's a pleasant and clean place with great veiws; I highly recommend it.]"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find. Tom and Linda are delightful hosts and you cannot beat the spectacular desert views. Had two of the sandwiches that were delicious and the wine selections were great. The atmosphere is comfortable and peaceful. This definitely is my new favorite place."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere with friendly service from owners. Beautiful views. Customers feel like friends & neighbors. Cubano sandwich and Premier platter was amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I happened to see that Raven's View was under new ownership--we were excited to check it out!!  We live nearby and were very disappointed in our first visit last year.   So! This evening we jumped at the chance to give the new owners a chance. We are thrilled to say the new owners get an A+!!!  Our waitress Tristen was so welcoming and sweet plus let us know about their happy hour!!  Happy hour $5 glass of wine plus some great food!! The meatballs are amazing add with the margarita flatbread. It was too much food for us but we were happy to take some home ;)  Looking forward to our next visit!! They are open 7 days a week and new hours!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worth your drive and time.  I am an avid cyclist and happened upon this amazing venue on a ride. I mentioned it to my husband and we ventured out on a lazy Friday on our first weekend of amazing weather in the Phoenix weather. Wow! 3000 ft equaled perfect temps!  The wine selection was absolutely out of this world and the view, gorgeous.  Tom and Linda,the owners, are down to earth and the reason you enjoy and support local business. If you are a wine drinker- this place will touch your heart. If you about weather and views, this place will steal your heart."}
{"text":"Today my friends and I decided to go and adventure through cave creek and hang out and get some work done on our laptops. My friend had recommended this place to us and he had been there with his parents before and said he enjoyed his time there, but I can confidently say that I did not enjoy it AT ALL!! As we walk through the door EVERYONE there immediately stared at us and gave us dirty looks, INCLUDING the Owner... the reason most likely being that we were young compared to everyone in there. There was an immediate awkward vibe as we entered the door. I also had bought some food that I was planning on eating there and enjoying due to the fact that I had not eaten and my food had been sitting for 45 minutes. Before I even got the chance to ask the owner if I could eat it he came up to me and pretty much told me I couldn't. I asked nicely if I could eat it outside and he said \"I prefer you eat it in your car\"... he wanted me to leave my friends and eat it in my friends car alone.. not even being able to eat it on the cold patio.. then he asked our age and because my friends sister was not 21 he kicked us out, which makes no sense because we weren't going to have any alcohol and she's old enough to serve alcohol.. I feel that because we were young we were mistreated! People say respect your elder but I say respect everyone! This senior that owned the place had absolutely no respect for me, for no apparent reason and I can honestly say I was very pissed off! He was very rude and I am for sure never going back again.. if you want truth this is the yelp review to look at."}
{"text":"Most amazing place on Cave Creek Rd just past Bartlett Lake turnoff! Go  and live! Views are incredible and Tom and Linda are awesome!! Just had best Beet Salad ever and the Prosciutto and Fig  Sandwich is to die for! Don't tell anyone, it's our secret place!!!"}
{"text":"This wine bar/restaurant is a wonderful combination of tasty food and an amazing, amazing view.  The terrace is a sweet place to relax and enjoy the peace of the surrounding mountains and sky.  Very friendly owners and a dog friendly patio.  We have enjoyed each of our visits.  The Cubano sandwich and the prosciutto and fig sandwiches are some of our favorites.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This little place just North of Bartlett Lake is a awesome place to stop to have a drink, a bite to eat and relax. You have a beautiful view of the mountains.  Tom and Linda are always very attentive and always offer great service.  Linda has thought of everything right down to throw blankets when it gets nippy out. I stumbled upon this place last year when I was taking my dad for a drive. I have been back several times with friends and I will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Tom and Linda are the most gracious hosts, and this is a spectacular location. Very cool atmosphere, and the best view! I highly recommend Raven's View for a glass of wine and tasty snacks!"}
{"text":"If you want delicious wine, tasty plates and a fabulous vista, then Raven's View is the place for you.  Love the fun decor and choices of seating - bar, comfy chairs, indoor and outdoor tables.  Tom is great and we look forward to meeting Linda when she is able to return.  We love driving up then returning as the sun is setting!  Spectacular"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a try.  We sat down and almost immediately were asked what we would like to drink.  So far so good, right?  We were undecided so asked for water to start.  A couple came in a few minutes after us and before we received our water they were provided water and a tasting of a wine they wanted to consider.  We waited a couple more minutes and finally had to ask for water again.     We ordered a meat and cheese board with a bottle of conundrum sparkling rose'.  The board was small for the price point.  Ingredients were fresh but the presentation was lacking. I realize the quality and taste is important but amount of items provided is also important.   We think it's important to give feedback so thoughts of others can be considered for future menu decisions. Especially from a customer perspective. The owner/chef was clearly unwelcoming of any comments or outside opinions.  That's fine, it's her wine bar, but we have also made our choice to not return."}
{"text":"Wonderful place and the owners are delightful. It's a perfect addition to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"A quirky cute little bar/restaurant. The building is awesome and obviously you go for the view. I wish the patio was a little bigger but the kitchen probably couldn't handle it! All of the employees were super nice even though they were very busy. Drink selection was good enough for me. The food was alright, very basic but they have a tiny kitchen so I didn't expect much more. A great place for the ambiance and drinks - typically an older crowd but we still loved it!"}
{"text":"Don't fly by the Raven's View, it's worth the stop. The Thai salad was delicious! The wine list and beer  selection were just right, few local beers to offer as a nice touch. Quick stop for lunch turned into a really enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"This is just a great place to relax , have a glass of wine and a small meal. Tom is a great guy behind the bar.  We meet such nice people there for a chat before heading home.  Off the beaten path of crowded Cave Creek."}
{"text":"You have to come up here and enjoy Linda and Tom's gracious hospitality, delicious food and outstanding selection of libations!   Tom and Linda will make you feel as if you are their dearest friend, welcoming you into their second  \"home\".  The peacefulness and mountain views create a magical atmosphere.  This place gets five stars!  It is a very special place.  It's my new favorite! Try the Cubano!  It was outstanding. #ravensview #tontohills"}
{"text":"Just made our first visit since the new ownership......it's wonderful! Beautiful drive out and same fabulous views but better hours and menu.  We had brunch......food was hot and delicious.....presentation and service top notch.    Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sitting high on a hill adjacent to Tonto National Forest, Raven's View has a spectacular view of the Four Peaks.  We brought our dog along, and sat on the patio. They serve wine and beer, as well as an array of appetizers, cheese boards, salads and sandwiches. My wife and I shared Linda's cheese board, consisting of three cheeses, prosciutto, salami, and walnuts with apricot jam and crackers. I had the Greek salad,and she had the beet and pomegranate salad. Everything was delicious.  A great find, just miles away from the hustle and bustle. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this beautiful place. Great location away from the maddening crowd.  Tom & Linda are delightful and wonderful hosts.  The food is great as well as the wine and beer.  This is our new favorite hangout.  Just hope we will be able to get in when season starts, as we know they will be very popular . Lovely patio seating and you can bring your dog! Perfect setting and friendly warm customers.  A good place to be. Don't miss this darling place!"}
{"text":"Told my fiancée I was going to stop and support this place--I always support small businesses--even though we had already bought sandwiches for our trip up Seven Springs Road. Jen was very courteous and brought to us a bowl of water for our dog, along with menus.  We were seated outside. She told me they couldn't make us sandwiches for some reason I don't remember.  I said no worries, just bring us a couple of drinks and some guacamole and chips, and that we would eat the sandwiches we had already purchased. About the time my fiancée returns from the truck with the sandwiches, and with Jen getting our food and drink, a man who I can only surmise was the owner rudely approaches and says the restaurant isn't a place where you bring your own food, and asks us to leave in a curt and disrespectful manner. (Apparently he's never been taught that in a service industry, you first seek to understand before being understood).  He wouldn't allow me to explain, he just told us to get out.  What a great first impression. There was ONE other table with people. All I was trying to do was support the place.  NOTICE to all my 4WD'ing friends--DO NOT SUPPORT a place run by a jerk."}
{"text":"Great spot with a spectacular view of the mountains and valley! Perfect pit stop or destination ride. Fantastic beer and wine selection as well as carefully prepared food selections. Indoor and outdoor seating with super service! Total Mom and pop spot with a cool eclectic vibe.   UPDATE: Ravens View has changed ownership.... and it's even better! Expanded menu, with fresh house made soups panini sandwiches, and salads. The previous owners were only open after 4 pm... The new owner is open 7 days for lunch and dinner. There is also a great brunch on the weekend. Super friendly service makes it a real home run!"}
