{"text":"On a good day, I give this place a 4. I really like the Cobb salad and their pastries. Service can be poor depending on who you get. When you're being attended to by a manager at the bar, it's great. But I've gone in several times and essentially been ignored for 10 minutes before getting a water or hello. 

I've also tried buying coffee beans here a couple of times and every time they've been out. 

Ok spot on the square if you're into light lunch fare. Don't expect to be blown away by service."}
{"text":"This place doesn't seem to know what it is and has taken on too many things, all of which are done poorly. The food is bland and tasteless and overpriced. $6 for a mediocre latte? The market carries a random assortment of useless iyems. Avoid. I hope it closes and a better restaurant takes the good location."}
{"text":"Although the menu is fairly minimalistic, each dish packs a unique punch of flavor and freshness. The menu provided smaller plates and larger ones. Some of the smaller plates, including the lamb Kebob and grilled salmon, are a little bigger than the other small plates. I would definitely recommend ordering a large plate if you are hungry or splitting an appetizer and a few small bowls between a group. Overall great lighting, food, and ambiance, but service was a little slow."}
{"text":"As I was sitting enjoying my dinner at a table by the window and people-watching, one thought scrolled by in my mind several times: \"Why are you passing by? After taking a few seconds to look at the menu on the door and then walk by, that is the worst possible mistake you are going to make tonight.\" Actually, there was a nice crowd of patrons dining, but still...

This place is great, it has:
- Smooth, contemporary decor, and an intimate atmosphere.
- Friendly and attentive staff, who made me feel very welcome and special. I love it when the chef delivers my meal and cares about my opinions. (All great btw)
- I wasn't expecting the portion sizes to be as substantial. Not 'Murica-big', but very reasonable for the price.
- Reasonable, non-pretentious prices.
- The WINE was AMAZING

My DELICIOUS meal, which I could not finish:
- Avocado toast/sweet peppers/charred ramps 
- Roasted potatoes/garlic aioli/ancho ketchup - The potatoes couldn't have been more perfect - crunchy on the skins and fluffy inside. They are smashed, and that must be the secret!

Too bad I live many hours away!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out this new restaurant and I left feeling mixed about the place. It is a beautiful space (albeit very noisy, even when not overly crowded) and the cocktails are amazing--with a shaken drink you even get a little cruet of the \"leftover\" to drink which I've never seen anywhere else in town. We tried the skirt steak, salmon and lamb and were surprised that the lamb was our favorite. Overall we felt like everything had been undercooked and could have used just a minute or two more on the grill. The skirt steak was so raw that it was impossible to cut or tear off a bite. The salmon was seared but cold in the middle. Portions seemed reasonable for the price, moreso than at other places in town. The biggest surprise was a visit to one of the messiest bathrooms I've seen at 7:00pm! The toilet paper was out as well--it was like no one had been in there to check it for the whole day. My husband said that the men's room was just as bad. Overall we left uncertain that we would rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Poor service and bland food. I had the pork and would rather eat a hot dog. I tried their burger which was pretty good. However, go to any other place on the square for a better burger. I also don't like being charged $1 for club soda in my cocktail."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant but not-memorable first dinner here. Ordered 5 plates and dessert to share:

Bread and butter were divine and ample portion - is that coffee in the pumpernickle?

Salmon small plate with broth and noodles - very mild, to the point of underwhelming. No textural contrast, the sear on the salmon was minor and did not contribute flavor. Could have used an element of freshness or acid and crunch. Too bland, flavored only of sesame oil on mushy fish. But beautifully bowled!

\"grilled peaches\" had 3 wedges of peach amidst a pile of nice and colorful heirloom tomatoes with a couple of creamy chunks of burrata and whole basil leaves. The plate held pesto and balsamic puddles. Again, no texture contrast, all mush. Not much peach which should be featured, not a very creative flavor combination. But a tasty version of caprese that I might throw together at home for guests.

the lamb kebob was a good dish! Very flavorful and tender meat, very nicely textured couscous, with some big chunks of raw radish and carrot, which might have served better diced fine for crunch in each bite. Missing some fresh herbs here!

The best dish of the night by far was a veggie - the carrots. Nuanced flavors, textures, great spice, a nice sauce on top and puree below. Visually the best-looking as well.

Cocktails were unremarkable but lovely in description and presentation.

Dessert was a mess! Chocolate \"cake\" arrived as a large caterpillar looking row of squirts of mousse - which was good but way too much - with a few crumbs of cake sprinkled about, a few cherries, and some smears below of a very tasty but hard to find cherry sauce, and a barely detectable white sour smear. Again, all mush, no texture. I get \"deconstructed\", but where's my cake?

Service was pleasant and congenial and attentive.

All in all it was good, but I would only recommend the carrots. Everything else was fine and unremarkable. I hope for more nuance in the future!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, love the cocktail menu. Dinner menu somewhat limited, but I was very happy with my selection (pork loin). They seemed to have a lot of flexibility for gluten-free options, which was a plus for my group (with 2 gluten allergies in the crew). My friend who got the burger said it was good but not great. One weird thing--we were there for a birthday, and when we informed our server of that, they brought out an empty plate with a candle on it. It was a bit awkward, I'd rather they just say \"actually we don't do anything for birthdays, but we hope you enjoy dinner\"."}
{"text":"More downtown Madison hype?  Can't comment on the food, but the wine list is so pretentious.  Apparently only European wines meet their standards for organic, sustainable and biodynamic?  Huh?  There are maybe 3 U.S. wines on their list and the explanation is that U.S. wineries add too much of some sort of additive to the wines (they couldn't explain what it was) and therefore don't meet their standards.  I call b-shit.  Pretense in the name of \"farm to table\" and \"artisinal\" doesn't have a great track record in downtown Madison.  I give this place 9 months unless they scale back the attempt at Euro-hip.  On a positive note, the decor is very enticing.  Makes you want to check it out---that's what drew us in."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to this restaurant two times. The second to give a benefit of a doubt. The first time we ordered hamburgers and was a disappoint. Very dry and the waitress said, they have no condiments..she said, it is, what it is. The second visit \"today\". Was another bad experience and $70 later. We both ordered the beef shank with goat ravioli. With out fail, we were disappointed once again. There was literally 4 quarter size ravioli's with a beef shank the size of a crouton. Needless to say.. highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great service, vibe, and eats. I went for brunch on a Saturday after the farmers market. The espresso bar was very impressive and delicious as well. Great cold brew & honey lattes"}
{"text":"I'm so happy this restaurant has come to Madison. Everything about it is wonderful from the vibe inside to the beautiful bar to the friendly staff and incredible food. You should definitely check this place out. The owner came over to talk to us when my friend and I ate here and she told us about how they sell natural wines. I'm looking forward to going back and drinking some of that wine!"}
{"text":"Nice new place to downtown Madison. Atmosphere is great. Menu is a bit small and higher priced. Food was very good, not great but we enjoyed our time."}
{"text":"Our visit started with a rather rude host.  We had a reservation, but out of the two tables clearly open, seated us at the one closest to door.  Felt the March breeze throughout the evening.  Salads were good,  Especially beet and horseradish.  We should of stopped there. We waited for service, begged for water.  We ordered the duck confit, white bean small plate, which was really not edible.  The waitress seemed to want to discourage us from ordering, as well she should of.  We let her know our displeasure.  No one talked to us or asked if they could bring anything else.  We waited a long time for our bill.  Let waitress know again salads were great but cassoulet bad.  No reduction in price or offer of \"we are really sorry\".  Waitress said they need to remove from menu.   Really?  

We would never return.  Host needs to find a new profession or take a Dale Carnegie course."}
{"text":"We were seriously disappointed with Field Table. Came for Sunday brunch and didn't have to wait for a table which made us think - hey, this will be quick and we will be on our way! T'was not the case... 

The long and short of it is this: Drinks were wrong, entrees were cold and missing items, and service was painfully slow. Our server seemed to legit be avoiding us and it took us an hour to get our food. Total bummer of a meal and experience.

I miss Sunprint."}
{"text":"It's as if they decided to encapsulate everything I enjoy into one establishment. Japanese whisky selection? Check. Biodynamic wine? Check. Third-wave coffee bar? Check. Farm to table plates with an emphasis on seasonality? Check.

Maybe I am just a stereotype, but I certainly feel Field Table does many things well, all wrapped up in a well designed space. Is it singularly the best coffee bar, restaurant, cocktail bar in Madison? No. But if you want to enjoy all three without hopping around it's definitely a place to consider."}
{"text":"I was intrigued with what looked like a great vegetable focus and vegetarian options for members of our party. We ate here with a group of four and our food was OK (some pretty good dishes, some bland dishes), but for the price in Madison, it should have been much better. The service was also a complete and utter joke. While our server was very nice and genuine, she appeared to have no experience serving in a nicer restaurant and the hostesses seemed like clueless coeds. If you want a lovely dinner for a similar price, go to Sardine, Heritage, Osteria Papavero, Muramoto, or many others nearby downtown. Pass this one by..."}
{"text":"Field Table strikes me as a restaurant that is just trying too hard on the wrong things. They clearly want to offer unique food choices, but they seem to have forgotten that unique isn't always a positive. The dinner  menu is small, which was necessary because deciphering each option required reading each one at least 5 or 6 times. I was with a large group and all around me were questions of 'what is that?' 'what do you think this is?' or 'what do you think word means?'. It's as though their goal is to humble the diner into believing their food vocabulary is so above-standard that it means it must taste amazing. If only that had actually been true...

It started out reasonably well. Their bread was delicious - overpriced, but delicious. And their specialty cocktails were all very good (though again, quite expensive). We then proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...and wait...our server actually apologized twice and assured us food was on its way. I got the sense our server was well versed in such apologies and just assumed they were a regular part of her job. We were not in a hurry and had plenty to talk about so it was fine, but definitely never go here in a rush. 

Perhaps the long wait time is designed to make us all more hungry and appreciative! When the food did start coming out, it took many more minutes before everyone had their dishes. Random servers would come out with two dishes at a time and walk around the table shouting dish names until someone raised their hand...not exactly great service for such a pricey place. We did have about a dozen people but we were not playing musical chairs in our long wait - it shouldn't have been that hard. 

Presentation was good - the food all looked very nice. It had been so long and the menu was so confusing that some of us had forgotten what we'd ordered by then! We had a variety of dishes - burgers were generally given thumbs up (though one was reportedly over-cooked), salads were also given thumbs up (though the dishes were about 3x the size they needed to be which made for a crowded table and made them look smaller than they were). The salmon received great accolades for its taste but after finishing it, that diner said simply 'I'm still really hungry - that was the tiniest dinner ever'. The chicken received an 'it's ok' response. And the risotto was a solid thumbs down. The food is generally pretentious - they try very hard to mix all sorts of flavors that perhaps are not normally mixed for good reason. 

Service continued to be slow through plate clearing, bill running, etc. though the server we had was polite and kind. Atmosphere was fine but nothing to write home about. All in all, I probably won't be going back - Madison has much better choices, particularly for such a high price range. I am a fan of the local food movement/farm to table type of place but this one misses the mark."}
{"text":"Beat cured salmon, delicious. Fantastic atmosphere. The bartenders were great. Centrally located while walking around downtown to the veteran's museaum. These people like everyone who walks in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely. I ordered the Avocado Toast....and hated it. Bitter avocado and an over-poached egg. Fine service, but I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"With so many fantastic restaurants in Madison Field Table needs to really step up their game if they are going to survive. My personal \"go to\" standard in the small plate/large plate arena in Madison is Pig in a Fur Coat. If it doesn't compare favorably to those folks I probably won't go back.

With that....here we go: My wife and I stopped by on the busy Art Fair Saturday this weekend to see if they had openings later that evening for 5 of us. They did and we all returned at 6:15 and were promptly seated. Up until that point everything was great but that's where the issues began cropping up. The lighting at our back table (as others have mentioned) was absolutely terrible. We resorted to cellphone lights to read the menu.

Drinks were up first and in walking by the bar there was certainly an impressive array of spirits. Unfortunately that didn't include Captain's rum or Southern Comfort for one in our party who wanted something quick and simple. I get that their spirit selection is \"high end\" and I appreciate a craft cocktail as much as the next person but what's it take to keep a bottom of Captain's around - especially in WI? My brandy old fashioned sour was average and barely sour. My wife's perfect Manhattan was also very average and not up to the quality we make at home.

We ordered some cheese and bread and on a positive note that all seemed to work out for everyone. It wasn't any better than the cheese selections at other downtown places but it was solid. The wait staff did a fine job and the food came out quickly. However several of the dishes were absolutely not hot enough and given how quickly they came out I can't quite square that....perhaps they were made up and held??

I had the skate cheeks with some small snails. The skate cheeks were good but hardly warm enough. The small snails were a complete joke. They included a small snail fork to get them out with which was MUCH too large...I ended up using one of my sticks from the \"steak on a stick\" small plate. In retrospect perhaps they were more there for seasoning. To that end I don't get how skate cheeks in WI fit in with the farm to table idea but oh well. The steak on a stick dish was (sorry to say again) very average. Steak not particularly flavorful or tender. Not sure on the thought behind this one.

The large plate steak dish was well liked....on the other hand the avocado toast was a complete miss. Absolutely no one liked it. It had a sharpness to it that just didn't work. Given the cost it was very hit or miss on the food. My wife had the forest bowl which she said was \"just OK\"...unfortunately later than night she was quite ill with nausea and vomiting. Two other in our party had minor nausea during the night soooooo.......not sure what to make of that. I should probably follow up directly with the restaurant but I'm not really interested in coming back."}
{"text":"Excited to learn they'd have doughnuts on the square.   BUT...$4+ for a doughnut????   this is not NYC.  I'll walk to Greenbush Batch or Madison Sourdough.  Also, Dough Baby Bakery is opening soon on State.  I'll still try Field Table for dinner."}
{"text":"I will give them one star for now.   Was excited to order a cocktail!   Check.  Tasty. Could I have a menu?   No?  You are not serving food?  Totally weird.  I can still look at a menu?   That seems like fun.   But I cannot eat anything?   Okay."}
{"text":"\"What do you want me to do about it\" - an actual statement we heard from the manager after someone at our table complained because it took an hour and a half just to get drinks. Then they were out of many of the wine and food choices on the menu. But didn't tell us until after we ordered. The food was pretty good once it came, this place could be awesome if it was managed properly... but I won't go back for quite a long time after that experience"}
{"text":"Interesting space and menu but the service was unexplainably slow.  They were not slammed.  We were told that there had been \"mix up on the tickets\" and \"the plates had gone to the wrong table\".  The dessert never arrived.  Hopefully they can solve these key issues."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Got to eat at the chefs table on a Fri night, bought a unique bottle of French wine. The fish was tender and not overcooked, not at all dry. My fiance had the steak and it was cooked perfectly. The vegetables change depending on the season but ours were brussle sprouts crispy and full of flavor. 
The atmosphere was romantic and the servers gave us plenty of attention despite how busy they were which was impressive."}
{"text":"First visit last night. Food was unique and fantastic ! We enjoyed fern fiddlehead salad, savory lamb skewers, and a roasted mushroom vegetable medley that defies simple description. Wine list is solid with reasonable prices. We opted for a carafe instead of a bottle and that ended up being slightly more than a glass each. The cocktail menu has some real gems and there must be 20 bourbons on the list. Bottom line, we had cocktails, split a salad, 2 entrees, wine, and split a dessert for about a hundred bucks with tip. And it was just a few minutes walk to the overture center for our concert. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We wanted to sit outside and have a beverage.  The hostess said we could sit inside and have a beverage   We could sit outside ONLY if we ordered food. We just were not hungry at that time but could have been later as we sat there. Over an hour later all but one table was empty.  The couple sitting at the table had NO food but a bottle of Mountain Dew that was probably bought from Walgreens.  Don't worry ms hostess we will never be back.  An empty table generates no $$$.  You missed out on revenue and return customers.  I completely understand your rules but they should apply to everyone."}
{"text":"Food is eh.  Service is kinda slow.  Unfortunately my first experience of service was receiving  bug in my draft of beer.  They fixed the issue.   
First course came out.  Decent,  had some fingerlings that were way big. Cauliflower soup was solid,  lacked lil salt and had something weird floating on top.  
Second course,  the chix and the strip.  Took about 40 minutes.  I can't say they were busy.  Had about 16 seats open next to me.  Anyways,  steak was cooked perfect med rare. Came with dried out Brussel sprout leaves,  kinda uninspiring. Also served with a potato pavé that was mashed potatoes that were ok and a weird, discolored, chunk of potato that was supposed to be the pavé sitting on top.  Not enough sauce for the steak.  Very disappointing. 
 Chix was juicy. Had a decent flavor and seasoned well.  The dish kinda looked like a big pile of food dumped on a plate.  Obviously plating isn't this restaurants strong suit.
  I think the steak had sat waiting on the chix cuz it was a lil cold,  but the server never checked on us to see how everything was prepared.  Fail.  Cashed out and paid her 18%.... 
Nothing to brag about.  Wouldn't return for a second experience."}
{"text":"I'm a big guy, and I've never in my life failed to finish a burger.  That  streak ended today at lunch.  Do you remember McDonald's in the 90s before they even pretended to care about the quality of their food?  I ate a lot of those burgers.  Those burgers scratched that burger itch and didn't make you feel nauseous.  Field table's burger failed to clear even that low bar.  You might like it though...  If you've ever found yourself at a pretentious restaurant (I'm not judging, I like them too) removing all the vegetables from your burger and mixing lots of extra sugar into the sauce, this place is for you.

The coffee, however, is very good.  I would add them to a very short list of places in Madison that don't over or under extract their espresso."}
{"text":"So stopped thought it looked like a cool place, it does and probably is but the 4oz 12.00 glass of wine kinda killed it"}
{"text":"The doughnuts. If you haven't been here in the morning for a doughnut or what I believe is their unique creation, the cretzel, you are missing out! The flavor options are unique and absolutely tantalize your taste buds! Last month I popped in and had a lemon curd filled/blackberry iced doughnut and this morning I had sweet black bean filled/black sesame iced- now that was a combo I've never had before and it was just awesome! 

Oh, and that cretzel? Such a great idea- I really hope it's been trademarked (if that's even possible) because it's going to become the next \"cronut\""}
{"text":"I never write reviews, so when I do it's either absolutely amazing or horrible. This place is absolutely amazing! Happy hour drinks are great-- not to mention the food! Our bartender was extremely attentive and so sweet! Totally made our night. Coming from out of town, it's always a trouble finding places you re comfortable at-- but Trish made sure this place feels like a second home by the way she and her staff treat you."}
{"text":"Eight of us ordered a wide variety of drinks, small and large plates and dessert and found most of it uninspired, bland and not worth it. The service was awful, they had almost no red wine selection, and they were out of fish which was one of only five main dishes to choose from. It seemed like a restaurant on the verge of closing permanently. Stay away, there are much better restaurants in Madison, many of which cost a lot less."}
{"text":"Visited Field Table for the first time last night, I do have one considerable regret - that it took me eight months to make my first visit.  I was there with a number of industry professionals from around the country and the feedback was unanimous and extremely positive. 

I love the entire concept, taking the farm to table much further than others with their market, full day cuisine, beverages not just food and a sincere emphasis on both local and quality. 

The space itself is exceptional as well. Open, clean, functional with great acoustics and is set up well for both dining and socializing.  The attention to both the overall look and feel as well as the most minute detail was obvious and it works. 

The staff gets an \"A\" as well. They were attentive, friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable; it was obvious these were professionals in their element and their camaraderie and positivity was clearly evident.   I sampled several of their specialty drinks and was again very impressed. Great help is hard to find, Field Table found it.  

The menu had a wonderful variety and a number of unique items. I can't wait to return and try more. 

I found this to be a standout operation in a city with a large number of exceptional options.  

Field Table has moved to the top of my \"must revisit\" list."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing time with my girlfriends. The wine list is amazing and not expensive for a fancy restaurant. Had a bottle and appetizers with my girlfriends at the chefs table in the back. 

So nice to see the staff work as a team, so clean and obviously proud of what they are serving. The steak tartare was insane and the pot pie we shared."}
{"text":"Tried  lunch on a Tuesday when they have cafe style pre-prepared sand which,  salads & healthy protein bowl. All the selections were tasty & unique. Can't  wait to return for dinner as the cafe lunch is a quantum step better than other restaurants made to order lunches.  My first meal here & I'm a huge fan . Friendly welcoming  staff with a relaxed and professional vibe. Field Table is a Madison dining treasure."}
{"text":"RUN, don't walk, to Field Table.  I mean it! Any spot that has its food/ambience/cocktails this on point within a week of opening can only get better- I'll bet Field Table remains on par with Merchant, Forequarter, and other veterans of the Madison bar and restaurant scene.  It was Saturday night. They were serving a limited menu (which we were informed would morph into their late-night menu after full dinner service gets going) and my table of four sampled about half of it. We were satisfied and happy after splitting a couple of appetizers and small plates, including the Grand Fromage (beautiful cheese board, 3 different varieties, nuts, jam, and baguette) the spicy nuts- a hit for sure, so fresh and the perfect balance of sweet and savory- the flank steak on a stick, which was perfectly tender and just the right portion for the price ($12 for two good sized pieces of steak, a heap of veggies and a lovely swirl of tahini)- the burger, which was deemed perfect by my discerning burger aficionado boyfriend- and the lamb kebab, also a great amount of food for the price and beautifully presented.  The avocado toast passed by our table several times and I practically drooled but everyone agreed we were too full to try it.  We were all quite impressed with the cocktails we tried as well.  The space itself is both perfectly appointed and a refreshingly subdued, intimate departure from so many cacophonous bars around the square.  Every detail has been thoroughly considered, and it shows from the placement of the tables and the delightful wide open windows looking out over the Capitol lawn to the details like monograms on the menus to the sides that are elevated from a standard swath of mixed greens.  It's a truly distinctive experience.  Looking forward to experiencing it again!"}
{"text":"The drink was great. Beautifully crafted and presented. But we were very disappointed with our meal. The burger had nothing special- just dry bun and dry meat, my friend had to order sauce. My sandwich was nothing better than a French baguette and lettuce. The cheese spread was so sparse we were questioning whether they forgot the cheese! They said \"no\" that was actually the cheese in the cheesemonger sandwich... Monger disappointment"}
{"text":"Just walking inside feels like Madison took its first breath of hipness in a long time"}
{"text":"Great meal, classy menu! Manager allowed my party to sit in back and watch the kitchen in action! Great wine and apps!"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for lunch on Saturday. My daughter and I ordered roasted pork sandwich.  It turned out that they filled the sandwich with a lot of very strange, some sort of paste that had nothing to with pork, and I managed to find 3-4 half-inch cubes of pork buried in the paste. I have to say that was one of the most tacky and semi gross tricks I've ever experienced... There was a couple sitting right next to us, and one of them was clearly eating the same sandwich.  We heard the person was asking a waitress, \"is this really a pork sandwich?\" We will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Well....

I went here once and I think I don't need to go again.

Field Table is another farm to table addition to the square. A unique aspect that I was impressed by was the chef's ability to take local ingredients and provide flavors that aren't classically found in a farm to table restaurant. For example the burger is Asian inspired, the lamb has a middle eastern quality, and one of the vegetables have an Indian flavor to it. While the flavors are pleasant they aren't overbearing for individuals who can't handle spicy foods.

My experience of Field Table is on one of the first few days of fall where the weather gets cold enough for a sweater and the complement of rain doesn't help the situation. We entered the restaurant  whose windows were open. In other words, the place was cold. Also, half of it was poorly lit. Not like low lights for a nice, romantic dinner, more like this seems unwelcoming.
In order to make up for the cold temperature we asked to be seated in the back. Interestingly it seemed like a lot of people asked to be seated in the back. You would think that this would be a good hint that patrons felt like it was cold outside and the windows should be closed.

We had oysters, lamb, burger, and strip loin. 

The oysters come predressed with house horseradish and an overly salted topping, maybe vinegar. It took away from the beauty of an East Coast oyster. No oyster forks and it was served in a bed of salt. When you pick them up, your hands get salty. When you slurp them down, you get extra salt from the bottom portion of the shell, which is in addition to the sea of vinegar salt.

The lamb was our favorite part. It was well cooked Again, great middle eastern flavor, and served on a bed of cous cous. The menu claimed for carrots to be apart of the dish but I didn't see or taste any. Also the meat was not at all tender.

The burger was okay. We asked for it to be medium well, it more came out medium, close to the point of medium rare.

The strip loin was actually undercooked. I asked for medium and parts of it actually seemed like it was nearly boston blue. I don't mind rare meat but even this had a texture in my mouth that didn't come close to rare. I didn't eat parts of it due to concern for my health. Again, the meat was not at all tender. Overall, the edible portions were enjoyable. 

For the price we paid and the expectations we had, we were left underwhelmed. I left thinking that if this was local, why wasn't the meat higher quality? Wisconsin is known for high quality meat. Also being served undercooked meat isn't okay. Overall, I think for the money spent,  there are places out there that would leave the diner better satisfied in terms of restaurant elegance, consideration of comfort, and quality of meal."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in Madison.

Caveats: It was game day so it was really busy, they also did apologize and comp our meal. Also, the food not mentioned below was delicious.

Had a reservation for 6, table wasn't ready when we arrived and they seated non-reservation parties larger than us before us. Eventually put us at a 4 seater, so we were crammed together. Drinks either never came or required follow up at least 4 times. There were a large number of dishes that were out. Ordered the cheese board and they didnt tell us what the cheeses were until we called them over. Two people ordered burgers and they were cold when they arrived and didnt have buns. Requested bread and catsup, didnt get either."}
{"text":"Got a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night and had a great experience. We sat outside but the inside decor was super cool/hip. Food was great. The baguette and butter were fantastic and the potatoes with aoli were also very good. The manager delivered our food and made sure everything was going okay. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" sums it right up. 

Cocktail experience: We started with the cocktails at the bar. First, we were not given the cocktail menu. We were given their dinner menu and a menu listing their spirits and beers. What's up with that? I ordered a martini; my husband asked the bartender to create a cocktail with ingredients he likes. My martini was the worse martini I've been served and how can you go wrong with a martini? Bland and tasteless, thank goodness for the olive. And it was served in a such a small glass, that visually it might have had some influence on my taste buds. My husband enjoyed his cocktail. One thumb up and one thumb down for the cocktail experience.

Food experience: We ordered oysters to start. They were prepared with a Field Table horseradish sauce, which is excellent. Whatever their sauce is made from, it enhanced the flavor of the oysters. The oysters were served on a bed of salt. We were not given oyster forks, so I slurped each oyster. Because of this, the salt on the shell became part of the tasting, which I didn't appreciate.  My husband ordered the white fish, and I ordered mussels.  He thought the white fish was excellent, incredibly flavorful, moist and flakey.  He ordered the beets and had high praise for this plate as well.  My mussels were mediocre.  They had a stronger fishy flavor than I have experience in any other restaurant preparation.  The tomato base sauce was delicious.  I asked for an appropriate fork to eat the mussels and was never presented one.  Their fork is an oversized dinner fork.  Clumsy to eat oysters and mussels with. 

Dining experience:  Our waitress was pleasant and attentive.  The person who served our meals, never came back to explain that the restaurant probably didn't have appropriate forks for mussels was annoying.  The food, in general, is good, but I am also sensitive to ambiance and aesthetics.  I resented the size of the cocktail glasses. I was negatively influenced by not having an appropriate fork for both the oysters and mussels.   Dining is more than just great food.  Great dining experiences include capturing the psychological connect as well, which is where Field Table fell short."}
{"text":"Tried both the Hake and Strip sirloin.  Both were good, not great. I felt the food was overpriced for overall quality of main dish or \"large plate\" as they are labeled. Drink menu was decent."}
{"text":"It's a new restaurant. It's obviously growing and going through learning curves. It's apparent with the new waitstaff too. But that should detract from its potential. Yes, it was expensive to try. Yes, I learned to be patient. But I somehow felt it was nice. The food was spot on. The server was friendly but albeit slow and somewhat forgetful (delivered the wrong dessert but more than made up for it by comping it and bringing the requested one). All in all, the food was flavorful and tasty, the atmosphere was rustic yet modern, and the waitstaff were trying. Give it a try but expect to not be wowed. Opening a restaurant takes time and patience. The least you can do is help them help you. Besides, if nothing else, my burger was juicy and delicious while my salad was refreshing. And hey, when I bumped into my waitress the next day and quizzed her on my tables order? She nailed it. How she remembered that? No one will know. Keep up the good work - I'll be back soon to be wowed!"}
{"text":"Don't let the wonderful style and decor fool you, this place is a cacophony of misleading advertising. Of the handful of items on the menu, they have good bread and cheese. The rest is simple, yet poorly executed. My wife's Amish chicken and mashed potatoes was instead cold, season-free chicken on baked and smashed potatoes (also without seasoning). My beef filet, priced by the ounce but only had one size available on Saturday night, wasn't even a filet but instead a cut of meat that looked like a sad sandwich steak (it was either skirt or hangar); it and its sides came cooked to the right temperature but devoid of salt. Did I mention that we waited 45 minutes for all this food to come? The waitress smartly did a drive-by question about how we liked it, never asking again after I asked for salt. She knew the answer, and only our hurrying to a show prevented me from sharing my full opinion."}
{"text":"I loved my breakfest sammy for lunch. It was delicious, i would highly recommend it. The breakfast cocktail and donut selection was also amazing. On a Sunday morning at 10:45am, the place was not very busy at all. That was pleasant for a normally crazy time for brunch in Madison. 

I would have given them a five, but the waitress left the egg i asked to be removed from my sandwich due to allergy on it. That's a biggie."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Salad was overdressed and underseasoned. The cauliflower soup was quite good, but also underseasoned. I'd probably give it one more shot!"}
{"text":"I haven't had such a troubled meal in Madison in a while. The service was painfully slow the entire evening. We were a sizable group, but we had a reservation, and the restaurant was only half full (on a Saturday night around 7:30pm).

It took about 1 hour and 45 minutes for any food but bread to arrive from the moment we sat down. We were told about 3 minutes prior to the food's eventual arrival that the head chef was out with an emergency that evening. Things happen, I suppose, but some warning at an earlier point on the meal, or some additional comped bread or ANYTHING might have helped us along. 

Also, that explanation doesn't really explain why it took 15 minutes for the wait staff to speak with us after we sat down, or why it took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive after we ordered them. It doesn't explain why, after our bill was placed on the table, our waitress disappeared for about 10 minutes, leaving us stranded. And believe me, we were plenty ready to leave. 

The food was underwhelming. The problems in the kitchen were obvious. My tablemate's burger arrived cold, and the accompanying ceasar salad was reported to be quite unpleasant. My pork dish, in terms of flavor, was fine, but the presentation was a nightmare, with a huge swipe of brown goo (fig preserves) around the edge of the dish, and everything else strewn about. The field bowls were small and flavorless, which was hard on my dinner companions who had waited almost two hours for them. I had ordered a \"small plate\" to split for the table (which seemed to genuinely confuse the waitress), and it arrived at the exact same time as everything else. Which is to say, very late."}
{"text":"Dinner with larger group on a Saturday night. Nearly 20 min passed before our drink orders were taken. Another 15 min before they arrived. Whole dinner experience took 2 hrs. There were a number of empty tables. Food was fine but nothing special. Price seemed very high for such small portions. Won't likely be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointing. Had to send my drink back two times to make it palatable. As an owner of two high-end restaurants in Los Angeles, I was horrified as what they were passing off as cioppino\" ...it tasted like Campbell's soup with some seafood in it. No seasoning. No linguine! 

My burger came in a Costco bun, and despite the waiter saying that she would check to make sure they had blue cheese, it came with cheddar. When I asked for it to be corrected, she brought me a plate of blue cheese. By then the burger was cold, and I had to put chunky blue cheese on there that was not melted. 

Additionally, I opted to go for the \"bartenders choice\" for my cocktail. This is something we do at my restaurant. I literally got a water downed Last Word. ....Had to send it back twice to try to resuscitate it. 

Absolutely do not recommend anyone eating here. Save your money and go to Culver's."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a delicious weekday dinner or a more upscale date night. Servers really know the menu and the kitchen can easily accommodate most dietary restrictions. Being gluten and dairy free I often find it difficult to eat out, but it's easy to do here...plus the food is delicious! Also, don't miss out on the craft cocktails, very unique and different from the typical Madison bar scene."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing visit to the Field Table.  Went for an anniversary dinner.  Started out weak and did not improve as the meal went on.  We started with wine ... my partner's glass, a Gamay/Grolleau, was so poor he returned it and asked for a different choice -- this is a very rare occurrence as he will usually drink what he is served, even if it is not very good.  He replaced it with a glass of merlot -- which was a bit better, but not much. I ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc -- I have definately had much better. It was drinkable and refreshing but extremely weak -- watery, even!
Sadly our food was even worse ... We started with a simple salad -- the lettuce and vegetables were good, but the buttermilk dressing was completely bland and tasteless.  We also order the spicy roasted carrots with dill yogurt and pistachios. The carrots were okay -- but not particularly spicy. We moved on to the \"grilled lamb kebob served with sumac,  buttermilk-­?fermented carrots, and Israeli couscous.\" The lamb was good -- but the carrots were very basic and again, the buttermilk topping did not add anything ... it also seeped into the couscous which did not improve the couscous whose flavorings were unpleasant. Finally we order charred salmon with soba noodles, maitake broth, and egg yolk.  I was very surprised that the salmon was served almost raw -- don't get me wrong, I like raw salmon and frequently order it for sushi.  To me, charred=cooked.  Seared salmon might have been a more appropriate title -- anyway the salmon was decent -- the sauce okay.  The best part was the soba noodles and there were not enough of them. The egg yolk -- just unnecessary!! Did not even eat it.  
The service was friendly but mediocre. 
All in all we spent about $70  -- we would have had a much better meal for this price at any number of other restaurants ... Save your money -- go to Graze, or Cento, or even the Icon instead. 
We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Trust what everyone on yelp is saying and save your money. I wish I had. 

The first time I came to Field Table was with a friend for lunch and we were shocked that they wanted $6 for a mediocre latter and $4 for a super greasy doughnut.  I'm sorry Field Table but where do you get off being so arrogant that you think you have such a posh name brand that you can charge people this amount for poor quality products? Sorry to tell you, but building such a name brand takes years of hard work with quality wares.

My second visit to Field Table was even more disappointing. After an hour wait for a table for four, we found out the kitchen was out of two of the entrées we wanted. What entrées we ended up ordering were only sub par and mediocre quality at best. I thought this place was supposed to be \"farm to table\" but I can see that is probably a lie they tell their customers. Their \"brioche\" bun on their burger was way too \"bready\" and uses not enough butter which completely overpowers the pitiful beef patty inside.  The most uncreative burger I have ever laid eyes on. 

My final complaint is that their wine list is not very well thought out. Coming from Northern California and living in New York for as long as I have, I definitely know an amateur's wine list when I see it. 

My friends and I hate to complain but we felt compelled to do to the amount of time it took for our drinks, the lack of entrées, and the general poor quality of the entrées we did end up ordering. I can only assume the owner was the lady I saw running frantically around seeming to be in everyone's way. She never once approached our table even after all our complaints. I would be hiding from your angry customers too if I were her.

For being a \"new restaurant\" I don't give Field Table much longer.  Pitiful experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  The owner is charming and her passion is evident in the food.  Local producers.  Cool vibe.  Will be back."}
{"text":"4 of us stopped in for dinner and were very pleased. From the small plates; farro risotto and salmon to the large plates; rainbow trout and simple burger and ribeye, everything was perfect. Best of all were the crafted drinks. The tender mixed up something with mystical tonic and gin, nothing was ordinary. Service was non intrusive and timed perfectly. I have to say the other reviews must have been an off night because this crew seems to truly care about details.  Expect neat drinks, funky vibe and warm atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I visited quite a few places while in town and I can't believe this place doesn't have more stars on Yelp. I had exceptional cocktails and dinners on both visits to this place. Highly recommend the thoughtful cocktail list. Had the chance to try several and they were all delicious. I'm a whiskey cocktail drinker, but my friend got one with carrot juice and rum that was absolutely delicious too. As to food, everything I had was great. Some notable dishes included fantastic pork belly with chestnut, spring pea and nettle soup with toasted almonds, grapefruit and orange salad with avocado and watercress - super simple, but really excellent, a fantastic roast chicken, and a lovely chocolate dessert that was not too sweet with a nice note of bitterness. Also a great atmosphere, hip, sexy, and relaxed. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Food and service was impeccable. Sat at the bar on a busy night. Everyone behind the bar was very attentive. Started with cauliflower soup and potatoes which were both delicious. Presentation of the soup in a mug was very fitting to the restaurant theme and the potatoes were smashed with a light fry and two amazing dipping sauces. We shared the salmon with soba noodles, pork belly, and chicken dish. Each was unique and full of flavor. We also had a seasonal squash dish that was unlike anything I've had - over a purée with goat cheese crumbles. Doesn't seem like you could go wrong here with ordering. Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Our drink order took a half hour. Prices were ridiculous for the portions. I'd never go back. There are better options with less pretensions in town."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a lunch meeting. I was told this is a new place. They opened about 6 months ago. I like the design of the place. It is bigger than it looks from the outside as it is deep inside. Situated next to rare steakhouse and easily missed. The entrance is inside so you have to go through a revolving door first. 

Staff were very nice. Food taste fresh and clean. I had the butcher's sandwich which means the meat is chef's choice. It was served on toasted bread and a decent portion for lunch. 

I like the design of the place. For a quick lunch you can sit by the window and watch people walk by. That also means they can watch you eat too. Lots of comfy seats just inside the door. There's a fridge just inside the door for quick grabs as well

Overall, a decent place and I will be back."}
{"text":"Food & drinks were solid. Maybe our waitress was new, but she wasn't very knowledgable about the menu.  Rest of the staff was friendly.  A nice addition to the Square."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was on the slow side and it wasn't busy at all. 5 stars if lunch didn't take 80 minutes."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch after visiting the museum,   I'm from Florida, it's snowing and i was afraid i would die.   
It's stout weather, and there were a few to chose from.  Bartender was excellent and knowledgeable, gave great suggestions.   
Lunch appetizer was a beet cured salmon.  I had never had this before, no one lives forever, so i went with it.   It was amazing.  Fresh flavors, great ingredients, and absolutely delicious.   
If you like whiskey or cocktails, they have a solid selection as well.  
I cannot wait to come here for dinner.   Hopefully my tauntaun will not freeze before i get here"}
{"text":"Food was great, coffee ok, service was horrible. Delayed, brought coffee with no sugar, food took 30mins for breakfast, had to remind the waitress of the sugar (anyways went and got it myself because only diet sugar was brought not even a stirrer) and lemons that was asked. 

Great location and overall look of the place."}
{"text":"Went for brunch last weekend.  Host was slow and disengaged.  Service was rather unfriendly.  Food was mediocre and portion was small making food to value ratio undesirable.  But worst of all was likely food related virus I got.  While I cannot say for certain, medical personnel informed that it was most likely viral and ingested very shortly before symptom.  20 minutes after eating, my body expelled everything in me.  Dizziness, clammy skin, nausea, for about 6 hours........."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Several samplings of the $2 donut and the $3 scones since the above experience have been very good....worthy of 4 stars. Since I have not tried another specialty donut since the Apple Carmel, it may be that the initial negative experience was not reflective of the general quality of Field Table's pastries."}
{"text":"Just tried their donuts.  Sad to say, disappointment.   Greasy and overpriced.  As a reference point, Voodoo doughnuts in Denver costs merely $1-$2.  Firecakes in Chicago are $2-$3.  Their donuts are all much tastier.  Not sure how this place thinks they can charge $4 for a greaseball."}
{"text":"Great location and attentive service Friday night, but both the salmon didn't taste fresh, even though it had a delicious glaze, and the lentil dish tasted days old like it sat around. Mentioned this to our server but no response from staff, kitchen or owner, so we would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"Cool spot that has just about everything! Best coffee (Ruby Roasters), unbelievable brunch (get the breakfast sandwich), and a full bar. Bottomless mimosas on weekends are a plus. Highly recommend hitting this place for weekend Bruch, Jacob is awesome. Also a good study spot morning or late night with free WiFi. Will be coming here often:"}
{"text":"Cafe: the coffee is great. Baristas are usually friendly. The donuts are art. 

Bar: I've also been here at night for wine and cocktails. Unfortunately it seems like the waitresses didn't know the cocktails very well. I asked for something not sweet with gin and she recommended the French 75 and it was awfully sweet. This has happened a couple times I went there for drinks which was sad for the prices. Otherwise, the ambiance is great for those who don't want to yell at each other at a buzzing bar and get quality late night bites. 

Dinner food: Dinner was amazing. A lot of foodie farm to table places restaurants around the capital are good but fall short something... I often get the 'good but not great, why did I pay this much for this' feeling. Field table had it all. 

We started with the breadboard. I was against it for $16 but once it arrived, I was so excited at its beauty and the flavors were amazing. It wasn't so much a breadboard as a meatless charcuterie with jalapeño jam, multiple cheeses, berries, and honey. 

For vegetarians and vegans, the forest bowl is amazing. The textures in it will leave you satisfied. 

The salmon was also wonderful! I was not eating fish at the time my friend ordered it but I wish I did. My boyfriend said it was incredible. It wasn't just grilled salmon like most places. It was slightly underdone served with soba noodles and an egg yolk. While most places attempt to add Asian flavors to non-Asian food by adding 'crunchy things' and sugary soy glazes, Field Table did the opposite and kept it extremely simple. The portion was smaller than what he would normally eat for any given meal but he said he felt satisfied, not grossly overstuffed. 

We also finished with the peach shortbread dessert. It came with ice cream. With creamy, fruity, and buttery flavors, it hit the spot. Every bite was heaven. 

Ambiance: We sat outside for dinner but the interior is beautiful. I love the opening windows and sitting at the window stool seats when I go for coffee as well. Service was great."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back, love the decor. The food is good but my service was terrible. Our waitress was to busy at the bar talking then helping our table. Had to ask other servers for drinks and the check."}
{"text":"I hope the manager or owner reads this review....
Let's first start with the food, about the only thing that was good. We had two salads and a waffle. Decent.
But. Your restaurant was dead (4-5 tables) and it took over 30min to get our food. We had to remind our waitress about our beer and ask for water refills. Used tables all around us were left un-bussed during our entire time there (and yes there was more than enough staff). Us and other patrons waited 10-15 minutes for an initial intro by waitresses and your bartender and we saw multiple tables leave because of the slow service. Your wait staff seemed totally uninterested in your customers. It's a shame since you have such a great location. Finally, it took close to 15min to get our check processed and back to us, of course without a pen to sign our CC receipt. Highly suggest better training, increase your kitchen staff and be mindful that service is what keeps your customers either returning or never coming back. I and my family are ones who will never return."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Saturday brunch during Art Fair on the Square. 

Menu is a but untraditional so come with an open mind. The flavor pairings are excellent. 

I thought the portions were quite small for the price. I had the smoked trout salad, which was excellent, but I left hungry. Even a few more greens would have made a difference.

Cocktail menu looked great. I had a lovely white wine the bartender recommended. 

We sat at the bar and were well cared for. I found it odd they had so many open tables throughout the time we were there yet would not seat us at any of them. Perhaps they were short staffed.

I didn't partake in the sweets, but there were some beautiful pastries and donuts in the case."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for a NYE dinner. The ambiance is great! I'd definitely suggest this place for a drink before you go to dinner someplace else.
My experience with the food was pretty bad. Ordered the porchetta \"large plate\". First off there wasn't enough food to consider it dinner. Second off, the porchetta was all fat. Like gristle and straight up fat. I understand that porchetta isn't lean but this was inedible. The server did end up taking it off the bill, which was appreciated.  Even though, I won't be coming back for dinner again. It was a group of 8 and nobody's food looked very good. Service was painfully slow, as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful space!
I've been here several times for meetings, the coffee is delicious and the space warm and comfy.  There's wifi and couches for people who \"laptop.\"
Grab and go salad that I ended up getting (turned out I was hungry) had pickled red onions, which made it amazing.  I also love wine and was pleasantly surprised to try some delicious natural wines during an unexpected afternoon tasting.
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie. The food here is good. I had the pork belly. It tasted so goooood. However, the portion is really small with that price. You're  better eat something before you get here to feel full when you pay your bill. 

The staffs are nice and friendly.  The service was good. The room is really dark. I had to use my phone flash light to see what was my food look like. I don't know why but it could not be louder. We have to shout to hear each other."}
{"text":"Excellent. That's all I can say. Smaller perfect portions. Quality combined with local farms produce. Fresh breath of air in restaurant crowd in Madison."}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks with friends. In town for a meeting  and this place was suggested by a friend. Burger was wonderful with a fresh crispy bun. My girlfriend had the pot pie which was incredible. It was cold, I agree with the previous posted. Where is my tauntaun."}
{"text":"Awesome clean/sustainable food. We had a great waitress Sadie that served us. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I've tried Field Table about four times. I don't like to judge a place after one experience. This one really irritates me. They have all the pieces to be a really great restaurant. Great drinks. Really, pretty nice food for the most part. But, the staff (bar in particular) is so freaking arrogant and impressed with themselves, to try and have any sort of engagement with them is painful. I've never seen a group so assured of their own brilliance and at the same time less interested in whether or not you like anything. I've observed that they're particularly dismissive of anyone unattractive. That's not to say that they engage good looking people that much more. They really only talk to their other co-workers and occasionally if there's someone at the bar that's their friend. Everyone else gets this very lazy \"I'm too good to be here\" attitude that certainly makes the food and drinks taste not nearly as good as they are."}
{"text":"We strictly went to Field Table to try their cocktails. My group of friends and I visit the capitol square craft cocktail venues on a weekly basis and were excited to expand our list of places we'd frequent.

Unfortunately I don't think we'll be back for a while. The cocktails we received weren't spectacular by any means, especially when considering the price and quantity. The prices per drink are consistent with most places on the square with about $11 - $12 per drink. The ridiculous part is not only the lack of creativeness/unique tastes in their recipes but the extremely small glasses they are served in. We all made jokes that we were drinking from a shot glass mounted on a stem. It felt silly. My glass held at most 2.5 ounces of liquid.

Our group passed around the drinks we received and none of them were very appealing to any of us. Mine felt like it could have been made several dozen different ways with a much cheaper vodka than was used while still tasting the same.

Several other new places started out weak and have grown into our favorite spots. Hopefully this place can to. Will revisit in several months and revise this review accordingly."}
{"text":"I've been here almost a dozen times since it opened and have had great food and great service every single time. I've been here during busy weekend nights and super slow weekday pre-lunch rushes, and service and food were always great. I love the forest bowl, protein bowl, roasted chicken. The smoked trout caesar salad I had for lunch today was SO good! Hubs and I usually get 2 things and share, but not today. He got the trout salad because it was way too good to share. It was accented with pickled red onions and I about lost my mind over them, they were THAT good! I'll probably go back and ask if they sell them by the jar. I know the owner pickles stuff like crazy.  ;)

We got a side of roast potatoes, and I think they were lightly battered and fried after being roasted but it was incredible taste and texture. I've never arrived early enough to get the doughnuts. Yeah they're a bit pricey, but I think I'd like the flavor combinations.

Ambience is great. Dark and rustic, yet clean & airy/industrial chic without trying too hard. Music is never so loud that I can't hear the conversation of who I'm dining with.

Bonus points for not automatically jamming a straw in my water, because #seaturtles. After seeing the video of the sea turtle with the straw up her nose, I become really irate at restaurants who shove them in your drink without asking if you really need one. Most people do not require a straw to drink from a glass.

My ONLY reason for not giving 5 stars is that there are 2 bathrooms that are designated Male/Female. I honestly don't care about the gender thing except that these are single toilet stalls, which leads to LONG lines of ladies who all have to pee. It seems really dumb to have all these ladies crossing their legs while blocking the staff's way into the kitchen. What about making customers wait 10 minutes to pee while their food gets cold because you only let them use ONE toilet at a time? It really, REALLY sucks, and could easily be fixed if the bathrooms were just bathrooms, instead of Male/Female. Something to think about!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and both times we were unimpressed with the service. The first time, the bartender was arrogant and disinterested in answering our questions. He also criticized the skills of his co-worker, who was a bartender-in-training, in front of us (and the co-worker). It was rude and unprofessional. The second time, this past Saturday night, the host gave us attitude for asking to sit outside, even though all of the outdoor tables were open. When we said we wanted drinks only, he seemed incredulous that we would have the nerve to sit outside AND only have drinks. Overall, we got the impression that we were inconveniencing him, so we left to go to Heritage where the drinks and service are always excellent. We're willing to give this place one more try because we want to like it and the drinks *have* been good. But the staff ruin our experience every time."}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP IS THIS PLACE PHENOMENAL.

I popped into Field Table today, on the same block at 100state, to grab some lunch. The owner talked to me twice, once on the way in, once to see what I thought. I realized I hadn't allowed myself enough time to eat, and somehow the waiter got me my food in five minutes ON THE FIRST DAY OF LUNCH SERVICE. That's got to be some kind of miracle. It's currently also really affordable (my bill was $10).

This place has lots of healthy options, and lots of veg / vegan options. I ate the butcher's sandwich, which was a vaguely Asian seasoned pulled pork sandwich on a proper crusty baguette, with a well/lightly dressed salad of greens and pea shoots on the side.

BUT WAIT IT ACTUALLY GETS BETTER. Outside of having a sit down area, they also have take away Swedish fika, coffee, a nice bar, and hipster groceries: everything you'd need to make a recipe out of a Nigel Slater cookbook / hipster supplies, PLUS MY FAVORITE OOLONG TEA. 

GUYS, SERIOUSLY."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is conveniently located on the \"square\" in Madison and offers a unique and diverse cocktail list and boasts a very hip vibe. With open windows (in the summer) and exposed brick, you feel like you're somewhere in midtown Manhattan. I'm excited to try out the menu, because I only went for drinks. They have a reasonably-priced late night menu as well. When we went, granted, they had just opened, the service was pretty terrible but everything else was wonderful. A friend ordered a pub burger off of the late night menu, which took about 40 minutes only after we had to remind the waitress about it. I'm sure it will improve with time and this spot will quickly rise to one of my Madison go-tos."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere. Trish, the owner, came out to say hello and ask about our experience.  Very friendly staff, good food, and good service. 

Highly recommend it as it is hard to see from the street. Great view of the Capitol."}
{"text":"Field Table is moving in the right direction. Better hours,  more inviting lighting and atmosphere and the addition of Tameka. My wife and I love her. A pleasant surprise to find her working her now.  Great bartender with wonderful persona"}
{"text":"We came here for their breakfast sandwich and found ourselves to be really disappointed, for the high price point and with such great food alternatives in the area we were hoping for something that reminded us more of their name \"Field Table\" instead it felt more like \"Grocery Store Table\".
Perhaps Brunch offers a bit more of the fresh ingredients that we had been hoping for."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out Field Table after I heard lots of hype, and it did not disappoint in the slightest.

The space itself it gorgeous and very open, with a beautiful exposed brick wall that gives the place a modern rustic feel. Pair that with big doors that open up to the sidewalk and you got yourself a winner, especially in the summer.

Cocktails expertly crafted, and each one I had was a generous pour. Some cocktails they serve a small extra glass of the leftover from the shaker, leaving you with almost 1.5 drinks.

Now for the food. A nice variety of small, medium and large plates on the menu to suit whatever you're in the mood for, whether that's a big entree or just a bunch of small plates for the table to share.  The winner for the night was the Charred Salmon with soba noodle and egg yolk. Holy crap. After living in madison 5 years, this may have been my favorite dish of all time. Also tried the scallop crudo which was fresh, crisp and delicious. The lamb kebabs were also a winner as they were well seasoned and cooked perfectly.

A fantastic experience at Field Table and for a great price. Dinner for two with two cocktails each was $120 after tip/tax.  A great deal for what you get. 

Oh yeah, service is excellent too. Trish the owner came up to our table and chatted to make sure everything was going well. A nice touch on top of an already wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Field Table:  I really want to like you. This spot has a lot of potential- an interesting variety of dishes on the menu, a warm, inviting ambiance and a very gracious host. 

Behind the scenes things are ripping apart at the seams. I witnessed on individual fighting with the head chef because they hadn't received their food for two hours. (Apparently two of the line cooks had quit on the spot). One large party walked out. Others were quietly complaining at their tables \"should we just take it to go?\" 

Outside of being painfully aware that both staff and patrons at this restaurant were unhappy, my experience was decent. The rainbow trout and potatoes were outstanding. The host took very good care of us, doing his best to not only act as host but to serve our table as well. He gave us our last dish for free as it arrived late and cold. 

I suspect that this restaurant may be suffering due to inexperienced, hands-off management and unhappy staff. If they make some changes it has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I have been curious to try this place, so I finally stopped in for brunch. 

The menu is somewhat limited, but has some solid options. I ended up opting for the burger for myself and the waffle and berries for the kid.

The waffle was good with a berry compote and plenty of cream. I'm not a fan of waffles, so for me they are kind of all the same.
The burger came out underdone the first time, but was quickly fixed and came back to the right temperature after a few minutes. It is relatively small, with a nice soft bun and the perfect amount of sauce and condiments. It comes with a side of salad, heavily dressed with a delicious if a bit garlicky creamy dressing. It is pretty much the perfect size for a not too heavy lunch or brunch.
The side fried potatoes were also really good. They don't come with the burger but another person in my party ordered the sausage sandwich and that came with the potatoes. They are whole small potatoes that appeared to be boiled first and then fried. They were deliciously soft with a nice crunch, but none of the heavy oiliness of French fries. Would definitely get them again.

So I'm thinking I'd like the place more (or at lest I'd have tried it sooner) if it had a longer menu, but I also appreciate concentrating on a small number of really well made dishes. So I'm conflicted about this.

Anyway, I'm thinking I'll go back."}
{"text":"I have had good private and large group dining experiences at Field Table, but was less than impressed on my last visit.

Overall, a terrible dining experience. Extremely poor service, (despite tables next to us being served), bland food, and our waitress missing half of our order. 

I went to dinner on a Thursday night because I am a huge fan of their Beef Tartare. When I walked in, the restaurant was filled, but not too busy, with a good intimate atmosphere. We were immediately seated and given menus. 

After waiting for at least 20 minutes for a server to come around with water and to take our order I finally flagged down a member of staff to let them know we had not been helped. After about 5 minutes, a server came to take our drink and food order. I tried to order the one thing on the menu I was looking forward to, the tartare, and was informed they were out. Instead, we opted for the risotto, salad, and a side of potatoes. 

The salad and risotto came out in a timely manner. The field bowl was fine, but the risotto was very bland and not seasoned at all. After giving the waitress the benefit of the doubt, after 10 minutes I let them know that our potatoes had not come out. The waitress made it seem like we had never ordered them in the first place and did not apologize for any errors and poor service over the course of the meal.

I'm extremely disappointed in what I previously considered to be a good dining experience and will not be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Thanks & gratitude to Chef Austin and his amazing team for a smashingly wonderful brunch!  The chicken and waffles was divine.  A very professional staff who gave us great service from start to finish.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Field Table. Our server, Mackenzie, was very friendly and attentive, and took time to answer all of our questions about the menu. She made suggestions that were spot on, including ordering the potato appetizer and the Poor Francois cocktail. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best food experiences of my life! Tenderloin, salmon, and chicken oh my!! Get there and be blown away!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, I have been a few times for both food and drink and I think they do a really good job.

I tend to ask bartenders to get more creative for me then just limiting themselves to their menu options, this is one of the few places around town where that approach pays off. They are very good with Gin here : ).

I have not hit up their cafe/coffee bar during the day so I will not review those aspects of this business.


I agree with most that the prices at this location are pretty high, but I think they do offer some unique faire and they do a good job on executing, so here I don't mind spending the money I just limit my visits.

The menu changes so my recommendation are probably inapplicable...... I would recommend any of their oysters/mussels/etc ; *"}
{"text":"I have given this place an honest chance since they opened through dinner and farmers market pastry/coffee and it is a consistent disappointment.  The disappointment falls squarely in the execution and its staff.  Today after waiting far too long for an over-priced pastry the gentleman behind the counter responded with a despondent 'meh' after I asked my sincere 'how are you?'  (No really, he did).  Yes, that is exactly how I feel about this place and apparently, so do you.  It's like FieldTable has an active disdain for its customers."}
{"text":"A new favorite of mine for sure!

Took a group of potential employees here for the first time, and absolutely loved it. The pork belly was impeccable, and was the perfect amount of food. We also ordered the bread & butter, which was good but a little awkward to share amongst 5 people (it was two small loaves).

The atmosphere is dark and cool, with beautiful exposed brick walls and a gorgeous bar. Service was really good, and we never had to wait long for anything.

Didn't get to try the cocktails, but I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner but never got to dinner.  The menu seemed reasonable but if you want a glass of wine you won't have money to eat. A glass of Malbec wine was $20? A spotted cow beer was $4.  The discrepancy in pricing will turn people off. No sense.
The  bar tenders were very knowledgeable on drinks but very arrogant, didn't feel like a welcoming place. Won't be back to this one.  The plus is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never mind the open entry wall, or beautiful decor, or wonderful bar...the food was amazing.  

We stopped in during taste of Madison, and it was better than anything we found on the square.  The bartenders are very quick to give good suggestions, and the owner Trisha stopped by to see how we were doing.  After an engaging 20 minute conversation with her about pickling, fermentation, recipes from Mom, where to buy local food...we were hooked. We exchanged instagram information (so 2016) and will be back again. We need more places like this in Madison. Quality food, personal touch.

They were out of a lot of special items, a testament to how popular the pastries can be. It was after 1 pm, so not a surprise."}
{"text":"\"20 minute wait\" took an hour. been waiting an hour and a half for our food. they ran out of half of the entrees listed on their menu. have yet to even get bread or RAW oysters. servers are rude and not helpful. will never be coming back"}
{"text":"Grab and go squash pad Thai was excellent. Thai wrap sauce was too salty and the wrap was hard to eat on the go. 
Too pricey!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, innovative, fresh, very impressed and would return in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Poor service (and the place was almost empty), food was whatever. Atmosphere is bland."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out. I came here for brunch with some ladies. We made reservations for 10:30am Saturday because we thought it would be super busy due to the Farmer's Market. Surprisingly, there were plenty of empty tables, and it seemed our reservations was not necessary. They seated us quickly. 

The pastries for brunch sounded amazing, so we shared a couple of the \"designer\" donuts. As far as I can tell, the only thing that makes them designer are the more interesting flavor combinations. One of the ones we had was a rhubarb citrus, but the flavor was mostly in the glaze as opposed to the donut itself. 

I also ordered the pozole, which was tasty. Service was spotty, but they do make up for it by being very accommodating when we brought the issues to their attention. For example, when you sit for brunch and order a pastry, the bakery up front brings it to the table. They forgot one of our pastry items and when we asked about it, they had ran out. So the waiter let us select a different item on the house."}
{"text":"First time coming to Field Table and we had a spectacularly poor experience. 
Our waitress was incompetent. In our first hour, she checked in on us twice, once to get us water and 20 minutes later to take our food and drink  order. This was especially problematic because she  failed to put in our food order. 
After an hour and 15 minutes without food, flagging down the manager to explain the situation resulted in extra bad news - they had sold out of the steaks which each of us had ordered. This was after them being out of another menu option and two drink options that we had tried to order and were not proactively told about. 
The manager did his best to make amends but we still waited another 15 minutes to get the replacement food after being promised it'd be out in five minutes and had to flag him down again to get that. 
The waitress never followed up and we were switched to a different server who did well given the circumstances. The food was good; I'd highly recommend the chicken and  the mussels  if you have to go, but I will never be back based on a poor front and back of the house experience."}
{"text":"Love the idea, love the food, love the ambience... this place is a pleaser for sure. They're all about wholesome foods in healthy serving sizes, and all of their dishes change frequently to match Wisconsin's produce seasonality. Basically, they're part of the capital-square-local-food-trend, which is one that'll stick because of how established the Dane County Farmers' Market is... right outside their door! I've been in a couple times for dinner and once for breakfast, and my experience has been pretty wonderful each time. The bread plate was delicious and came with a yummy salted butter, and was priced alright at $6 (I've seen $9 plates at similar restaurants in town- ridiculous). My absolutely favorite dish was the beet \"carpaccio,\" which honestly tasted exactly like a thin cut of beef or salmon just because of how tender the texture was. Perfect for meat-eaters who are trying to cut down! My family and I agreed that the roasted carrot dish was super strange, but delicious and healthy and satisfying at the same time. We loved the combo of the fennel and onion marmalade- genius. My mum got the roasted chicken and it was maybe the most juicy, flavorful roast I've had at a restaurant, and my brother and I shared the steak & frites. The steak was cooked to juicy, medium-rare perfection, and we loved the thick cut of the fries. I'm droolin' just thinking about it! We finished the meal with a rich, flourless chocolate cake in delicious cherry sauces and one of the most perfect cappuccinos I've ever tasted. The service was good, although our waitress wasn't as enthusiastic about the dishes as I would've been if I worked there! I think this place is on the right track for success, but has a few kinks to work out. For example, for breakfast I got a cardamom bun that was waaaay too sugary- all of the sugar must have melted down in the oven, creating a thick crunch at the bottom of my bite that was kinda cringe-worthy. At least I had a stellar cappuccino to wash it down! I also got to see their to-go section, which has a fab variety of salads, granola, fruit, and protein/forage bowls. I do have faith in this place and strongly recommend having a nice dinner here. Treat yoself to some quality local goodies, even if it means grabbing something to go during your work break."}
{"text":"Really great drinks, but no appetizers (other than bread and a board).  I know they are trying to be healthy, but an order of frites never hurt anyone.  I am really hoping they expand at least the happy hour appetizer menu.  Otherwise the place is 5 stars for just drinks and service."}
{"text":"Embarrassed it's taken me so long to try this place. Just had lunch, the macro-bowl was filling and flavorful, service was great. Stoked to go back for cocktails and dinner soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in for Brunch today with a friend.  I had the okonomiyaki (Japanese griddle cake) and added a poached egg.  The vegetables were crisp tender, and the flavor of the leeks was so fresh!  Would definitely order again.  We shared a Fried Potato Bowl, and there was enough to take some home, too.  The potatoes were more roasted than fried which I preferred (healthier) and the sauces were a nice accompaniment.  Holly, our server, took very good care of us.  Loved the upscale rustic decor. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When you go back to a place three times within a week you know it has to be good! Cocktails the first night, coffee and a maple bacon donut the next morning, and finally a full dinner later in the week. The ingredients are fresh, the drinks robust and seasonal, and the vibe is just right for a new spot on the square.

For dinner you must get the charred salmon; I promise you will not be disappointed. For cocktails, you really can't go wrong and if you can't make up your mind go for the chance or choice to have the bartender whip you up something special. And all of this are at super reasonable prices.

I seriously cannot wait to go back! My next time will be for their breakfast sandwich. I have a feeling it will compete for the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Sitting at my table for over an hour and a half and have not received any food. Drinks took a half hour. Charges us for bread and butter plate which was never received. This was a huge disappointment. Owner told me she was understaffed, not really an excuse for a new restaurant get hiring priorities in order before opening. Avoid this restaurant poor service extremely slow at all costs!!!!! You'll save yourself a headache from this dump. Owner is a total bully just asked me to take this review down. Owner then proceeded to be rude and threaten me for not taking down review. We waited for 2 hours for food and 1 hour for drinks as a party of 3. 0/5 stars avoid this place at all costs! Overpriced recommend merchant and graft or graze instead! Field table will be gone soon as their customer service and turnover is horrible the waitress admitted she was hired by owners 2 hours before her first dinner shift! Not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this dinner, especially after reading the ingredients of the Jobs Tears entree. Sadly, the dish was quite boring and lacked flavor. Now, the curried Cauliflower was amazeballs good. Way better than the entree. Being a vegan, you can't take my review too seriously. The menu is truly aimed at carnivores (my friends enjoyed their meals). The atmosphere was really pleasing despite my meal."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  We were two couples out, sharing plates.  Unfortunately the slow and poor service made the experience not worth the effort.   

We were seated almost immediately.  It then took 30 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive. Our appetizers actually arrived a couple of minutes before the drinks.  We had to continually flag down our server for water, plates to eat with, etc.  Our server rarely stopped back to see if we wanted more food - most of the time we had to ask someone to get him. 

We kept looking around the room and saw that half the tables were empty.  There were multiple bartenders but they too didn't look like they were overwhelmed.  We kept having to waive anyone we could find over to help us with what we needed. 

At one point the bartender stopped over to apologize for the delay.  He let us know they had a big group in back and offered a complimentary half round of port.  We took him up on the offer.  When it arrived, 2 of the 4 glasses had lipstick on them and one was completely sticky - like it hadn't even been washed. It also was weird that he brought it in the middle of the meal.  

By this point, we were more than frustrated.  We asked one of the staff for the manager.  She arrived - she might have been the owner - to talk with us.  She made several excuses for the poor service and asked us begrudgingly what we wanted to improve our night.  

She suggested a comp of our next round, we countered with comping the first round which she agreed to.  We then ran out of water again and had to get someone to get our waiter. 

At the end we ordered dessert which arrived promptly.  Unfortunately we needed to ask for plates to eat it with.  And as it turned out, it was the one part of the meal that didn't live up to the quality of the other food.  We ordered two dishes.  The chocolate cake was extremely dry and lacking in flavor. The other chocolate dish was also uninspired.  The four of us didn't even finish the two desserts.   Don't bother with dessert.   

We never saw the manager again.  She didn't come back to check on us.   We didn't feel like she really cared about our experience or our dissatisfaction and was just going through the motions.   

When the bill came, we asked the server to comp 25% of it because of all the issues we had.   He took it to the manager who declined to do it.  I guess I don't blame her - she knew we wouldn't be coming back.  

The food really was great (except the dessert) but with so many good restaurant choices in Madison, there's no need to endure the slow and poor service we had.  There was a definite lack of effort and understanding around the dining experience.   We'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place! Came here after a work training with new friends. Folks had drinks and I had coffee -- all yummy! The best part, though, was the service: very attentive and accommodating staff for our large group that showed up without a reservation. Thanks for a fun and cozy night!"}
{"text":"I usually come to Field Table if I'm looking for something healthy and fresh. The food is solid, but it is a bit overpriced for the amount of food you get. One of my favorites is the Aburi style salmon which is light yet still full of flavor. The salmon is smoked on a bed of soba noodles with some mushroom broth. It's a great snack, but you'll probably be hungry afterward."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour. Drinks were amazing 1920's craft style. Had some steak tartare which tasted light and full of flavor. The atmosphere was great even in the winter. Warm and inviting with nice bartenders. Finished the night with Laphroaig; what could be better!"}
{"text":"Like many others, I too very much wanted to like Field Table. Their Instagram game is on point and it seemed like a haven for foodies. Unfortunately, the experience was pretty lackluster from start to finish. 

Both my friend and I ordered the farro bowl which sounded wonderful and came with \"market vegetables\". The vegetables, however, turned out to just be watercress on top of a huge mound of pretty flavorless farro that was as unappealing to the eyes as it was to the taste. Does watercress seriously count as vegetables? I wish I would have taken a picture because my description doesn't do it justice. It was bad. When our food finally arrived after a significant wait, especially for it being a non-peak time, it was lukewarm. 

The service was some of the most painfully awkward I've ever encountered. Our server disappeared for way too long after every encounter. About 25 minutes into the meal (we were both just picking at our food by then), he came back over and asked if everything was okay. We said yes, but he retorted with \"just tell me if you don't like it - I can bring you something else.\" We were totally caught off guard, and it had already been WAY too long - I might have taken him up on it if he had come back after the first couple bites, but we had already been there an hour and honestly I just wanted to be done so we could leave. 

I REALLY like the concept of this place, but you can't be all talk and no game. In my opinion priority should be 1) food, 2) service, 3) brand, but right now they've got it in reverse, and 1 and 2 are far from being accomplished. I seriously hope they shake things up and can succeed, but priorities have to change."}
{"text":"I just went to Field Table for the first time last night and I am already looking forward to going there again! The drinks where awesome, and the food was SO GOOD! i love that the portion sizes are prefect, and easy to share. The flake steak was seasoned well, the charred salmon was wonderful, and even the forest plate so great! The waitstaff was super nice as a huge plus for me."}
{"text":"I've been to Field Table a couple of times for drinks and lunch and have overall enjoyed my experience. My first stop was for a happy hour meeting and I had a delicious creamy drink that was served in a milk bottle with a straw. So cute. I more recently went for lunch and had the BLT. 

The bread had an excellent chewy texture (though was sadly burned on the top crust), the bacon nice and meaty and cooked until crisp, and the sandwich had the perfect flavor from the combo of the charred tomatoes and super garlicky aioli. The sandwich comes with a side salad that was lightly dressed. The greens were all on the soft side; I think a crunchier lettuce in the mix would be a great addition. The dressing was super tasty, though. Field Table has started doing takeout for lunch so I'll definitely be back for this dish. 

The look of FT is beautiful and is split between a coffee shop & market and then a dining room & bar. The building front has huge windows that can be opened to let in the fresh air during the warmer months - often lovely, but on a recent 90-degree day I wished they would have been running some AC. 

Service has been decent. No major complaints, but not quite the level that you'd expect for the high-end feel they're pushing. I will give props to the staff for always being friendly and quick to greet me whenever I've walked through the door."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a lot more here. The wait staff was a bit in outer space-- we had a large group of about 12, and they insisted on splitting us into 6 and 6. We made it very clear that we wanted to order and be served at the same time, and they basically nodded their heads and completely ignored us, with ordering, food, etc being done completely independently by two waiters who might as well have spoken different languages.
Lunch: the food was okay. Nothing mind blowing. Appetizers? Nope. Dessert? Nope. \"I'll have a diet coke.\" And they bring out an 8 OUNCE bottle of diet coke. I mean are you kidding me. Thats not cute, thats annoying. And at least warn me next time before you serve a half-serving of a fountain drink without refills.
Also we very clearly ordered a burger to go which was completely forgotten and left us waiting around for another 15 minutes. 
Underwhelmed. Get it together guys."}
{"text":"First, the food was good. No issues there. The service however, was uneven. 

I say uneven because although our server was absolutely the worst, the table next to us got great service. 

We stopped by for lunch about 1:00 pm on a Saturday, and the bunch menu looked great. Our server, Marika, took our orders, and I noticed that she didn't write anything down. That could be a sign of a real professional, but in this case it wasn't. A few minutes later she came back and told my wife that she had forgotten what she'd ordered. 

Although most of us were just drinking water, my wife had ordered a bloody mary, which turned out to be delicious. However, it seemed to take forever, and my son, who sat facing the bar, said he had seen the bartender make a bloody mary, but it had been sitting on the bar for about 15 minutes before the server brought the 10 feet to our table. After tasting my wife's drink I would have ordered one, but she never came back to see if anyone wanted refills. 

After finishing a very good meal -- highly recommend the PBLT --  we waited about 30 minutes for the check until I finally went to the bar to ask for it. Our server said something about sending someone over with it, and then apparently realized that we were her table. Yes, she actually forgot that she was serving us."}
{"text":"I had brunch at Field Table and it was delicious.  I had the avocado toast and some potatoes on the side.  I really enjoyed the fresh, seasonal ingredients.  The service was good, Holly was very sweet.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner."}
{"text":"I've had cocktails and coffee at Field Table in the past, but this was my first meal there and it was lovely. My husband and I enjoyed a later afternoon brunch while sitting at the bar. We split a house-made fig donut, which was absolutely divine, and he tried the breakfast sandwich and I tried the farmers market salad. The components of everything were so flavorful and fresh - really enjoyable dining experience on a beautiful Madison Sunday!"}
{"text":"Great food. We enjoyed the salmon, lamb and pork belly. Some of the best pork belly I have had in town."}
{"text":"I had their avocado toast, which were very tasty, but the bread was too thick for my taste which overtook the flavor of the avocado and veggies. The atmosphere and service were great though. And my friends dishes were incredible!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. The doughnuts don't taste fresh nor look as nice as they do in photos. They're overcooked, making them greasy and tough. We ordered 2 beers and there was no mention that one of them would come in a can. 
The profit margins are set so high that their business model is crafted around 1 time customers paying a ton for so little. No need to come in again."}
{"text":"FINALLY- a \"farm to table\" restaurant that focuses on showcasing VEGETABLES! There's way too many places in this town that put meat and cheese and gluten in and on everything- it's about time the localvore and vegan fused together. They have amazing vegan AND gluten-free options, including the most epic of all- the forest bowl! Along with delicious roasted carrots, a winter squash dish and some seriously bomb potatoes. It's so nice to be able and enjoy a multi-course, locally-sourced vegan meal in Madtown. Not to mention the owner is truly a gem- she stopped by to chat with how our experience was, which is a rare occurrence these days. I can't wait to become a regular vegan at Field Table, thank you for promoting the veg folk. BLESS YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Great unique cocktails. Food is light and fresh. Get the pot pie. Amazing!! Good for a quick pop in or sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing donuts! Tastes homemade.  I've tried 4 different ones in the past week and all were very very good.  A little more pricey, but worth it. My favorite place for donuts!"}
{"text":"A hard pass

I ordered a poinsetta (champ and cran) they only had grapefruit or orange juice, they were out of tonic as well... so I took my lukewarm champagne with grapefruit juice and placed my order. That's how brunch started, with warm champagne... and yet she persisted. We ordered the PBLT and Berry's and Cream waffle. 35 minutes later our PBLT and Waffle come out room temperature. Nothing close to warm. Far from hot. Eons from fresh off the stove. The PBLT was dry served on plane white toast. Yep... seared pork belly on white toast. The berries and cream waffle, that we ordered was ok. It had a dollop of sweet butter (i guess the cream) and sprinkled with powdered sugar. When I realized cream was actually butter (mind you the waffle was so cold the butter didn't melt so there was no spreading) I asked for syrup. There was no syrup in the house. None. After waiting 35 minutes for meh food, no one wanted to tell us when we ordered that there wasn't any syrup for the waffle? Yikes. It is a great open space, great location, nice interior but unless I just want a place to rest my feet then I won't be stopping back here anytime soon. I know we shouldn't say never but, here's to breaking all the rules. NEVER again."}
{"text":"Pretty good, they made my steak rare. Thier steak is perfectly rare and made my trip. The service was fine and very polite. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We ate there on March 3rd and they food and drinks were excellent! Service was pretty good. The only disappointing part was the fact they were out of one of the items on the menu. Two of us wanted the pot pie and they were out of it:( We thought it strange since we ate at 6:00! Not a good thing to be out of a limited menu item so early in the evening!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I love the idea behind it. I enjoy their coffee service in the morning but beyond that I am just not impressed. The breakfast sandwich was okay, the doughnuts are okay, dinner service was also okay. With so many good restaurants with the same price point in the area we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was bland (our group had the filet, chicken, and burger and found they all were not seasoned whatsoever). Chicken tasted like plain, boiled chicken. Bread and butter as an appetizer was actually the best part of the experience, but it came to our table almost 45 minutes after we ordered it. Service took almost 2 hours from start to finish, which was not surprising because it looked like there were only two servers in the entire restaurant. Would not return unless there were drastic changes to service and menu."}
{"text":"I was in for a Caffeine Crawl event, so I did not eat/drink here. I did venture around the place and love the vibe! It's a little pricey, but the plates looked really good and their drink menu had some great options. They offer Rishi tea, so their rep was there to do some R&D with us. Rishi is working on some new items and they have a non caffeinated blueberry tea that is amazing. Also, they gave us samples of their recently debuted craft brew teas.The organic sparkling tap tea comes in two flavors: Runner's High and Sparkling Turmeric. Both are unique blends with different purposes. We sampled the Runner's High that contains green tea and yerba mate, as well as hibiscus flowers and schizandra berry. This blend doesn't use added sugar. Both of the offerings were winners for me. I'm glad that this event brought me into a new place. I'm planning on coming back to try more of their drink and food offerings."}
{"text":"This was the best vegetarian food I've had in Madison this week! So good. I had the forest bowl and the apple dessert. The wine is very expensive but fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was seated immediately. Unfortunately, that was the quickest part of the meal. We waited for a server, waited for our drink, waited to order the meal, and waited even longer for a bowl of yogurt (rebranded as muesli) and a breakfast sandwich to come. The sandwich was good enough, but not worth the 1 hour and 40 minutes of waiting. Keep walking as the rest of the square is booming with good service and great food."}
{"text":"Let's say I'm a fan, but won't be back for a long time.
Ambiance:  it's gorgeous, all the rage right now, exposed brick, cool light fixtures.  Pretty much like anywhere that's updating their interior.

Bar:  the craft cocktails are great, the tequila based Wandering was amazing, bartender knowledgeable

Dinner:  The problem I had here was it was hard to make a decision on the entree, none of the choices really popped out at me.  Maybe we are going at a weird time, April, but everything was still very winter vegetable based (squash, carrots, etc).  I wanted something more fresh.  I decided on the forest bowl which was amazing, the flavors and sauces really hit point, however it was $15 and there was no protein.  So this place is quite pricey!  My boyfriend had the trout, he commented \"it has a very earthy flavor\" which I exclaimed, of course it does, that's the whole point of this place!  Case in point, this place is what is proclaims to be:  an earthy feel, farm to table, restaurant.  Portions are not too shabby, prices are a tad high and ambiance was great!

If they change over to a summer menu, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came today and didn't look at reviews until I checked in. They almost made me leave, but we stayed. The place was empty when we arrived so we hoped for the best. 

We placed our orders at noon and the food came out at 12:11 pm. I got the breakfast sandwich with homemade English muffin and smashed red potatoes. Very tasty! My family enjoyed their meals as well. Great service and nice atmosphere. Excellent brunch!"}
{"text":"Happy that Madison is adopting healthier dining options and I was really looking forward to trying out Field Table. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by the Forest Bowl that I ordered. Everything tasted bland and although it was aesthetically pleasing and the restaurant itself was beautiful and classy inside, I couldn't justify paying $14 for a bowl of tasteless mushrooms and vegetables. My coffee was also very strong and quite bitter - one of the only times I have ever left without finishing a drink. Maybe I didn't order the right things that day, but my experience dining at Field Table was subpar. Would be willing to try it out again for a meal or to check out the cocktail bar at night - it looks beautiful and lovely to stop for a fancy night out!"}
{"text":"Had a party at the bar, brought a ton of friends. First time for us to meet here and it was a great experience! I had the Cesar salad which was incredible with the chicken. The wine selection was diverse and affordable. Overall, it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Best creative restaurant. A party in my mouth! 
Great service great food. Great ambience. We will be back"}
{"text":"I did not eat food here. I did not have drinks here. I only came in and bought some overpriced donuts. This is where the story starts. Pretentious hipster overpriced donuts joint. 

We are walking through the Capitol around the farmers market and Field Table pops up and we look and think, those donuts sure look good! 

Well they aren't. 

These in fact are some of the worst donuts I've ever had. 

Not only are they just that bad but they are ferociously overpriced. At $3.50 a pop it's like being violated over and over again. Now that I've come to see the reviews I will make sure to steer clear of this place in the future. They already took enough of my hard earned funds as is. 

Beware those damn donuts just plain suck!"}
{"text":"Food and cocktails were excellent. Service for brunch was inattentive and slow."}
{"text":"I mainly go to Field Table for the coffee and donuts. The espresso drinks are among the best in Madison and the donuts are unique and always rotating. Nothing beats a good coffee & donut duo. The staff is kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"A chic, rustic-modern (if there's such a thing) grab-n-go and sit down cafe and restaurant--perfect for patrons of Concerts on the Square needing a chilled rose or baguette, also equally well-suited for professionals wanting lunch fare that isn't deep fried or made with cheese. 

Their grab-n-go selection is premo, reminiscent of what you can find at Mario Battali's Eataly in Chicago or NYC, including hummus wraps, soba noodles, squash pad thai, vegan chocolate parfait, coconut chai pudding and a great array of unique and niche milk, juices, water and wine (red, white, sparking, chilled).

I enjoyed katsu pork shoulder baguette sandwich that was pre-made. You can order a fresh one if you're not pressed for time. The sandwich was refined, flavorful and only $6... it's not meant for someone who wants a HungryMan double-decker meat party on a bun.

I hope to come back and enjoy the sit-down service in the intimate, dark, modern space that didn't seem to attract a big lunch crowd so it might become a nice quiet alternative on the square."}
{"text":"Who actually eats here & writes a good review. 
Service: Horrible
Food: I would take a burger from CoCo's or Farmer Boys any day over this place.
Ambiance: Way to noisy 

How does this place justify their menu prices. I would never recommend this place to a friend, or my worse enemy!! Do yourself a favor & just order a pizza, or eat some dog food. The food here is comparable."}
{"text":"I've given field table a couple of chances and just am not impressed. Over everything, the thing that bothers me is how over priced it is. Our bill is always so high and I always leave feeling underwhelmed. We started with the cheese board - pretty decent cheese but way too expensive for how much you get. The waitress did offer to bring more bread out, but we didn't have much left to put on it... This time around I ordered the citrus salad. Obviously there would be some bitterness to citrus, but that's what the entire salad was. There was nothing to compliment or offset that taste. The atmosphere is very nice and you're able to make a reservation on open table but I feel that they need to rethink pricing and menu options to have people come back."}
{"text":"I had a lunch here during the Art Fair on the Square.  I enjoyed the air conditioning and comfortable booth with two other guests.

I had the Trout Caeser Salad.  It is not a traditional Caeser but the flavors are good.  I really enjoyed the smoked trout.  It was a nice size and price.  We each enjoyed a French Rosè.

I felt the service was superb.  From being seated, to the owner coming over and talking to us about wine and the menu.  To the wait staff and all the folks trying to help my companion's challenging opinions.  

I look forward to trying this spot again.  Or comimg for a drink."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice staff, couldn't substitute the waffle fried egg dish for two fried eggs because the chef didn't know how to price it. I offered to pay the same price or more, but was denied again. With no other egg dish on the brunch, this was very strange."}
{"text":"Delicious food, incredible cocktails, and overall a very nice vibe. I would recommend for date night or any dinner out. Well worth the prices once you know the care and sourcing that goes into every dish and drink."}
{"text":"This is the kind of restaurant that should have been in Madison for years, and now we finally have it. Creative, locally sourced food, an everchanging seasonal menu, and at prices that mean you can go more than once in your life. Plus, obviously, great alcohol, because this is Wisconsin.

I went on opening night and there wasn't a single hitch in their service.

I got a drink with bourbon and coffee-cardamom syrup to start, and it was delicious. For apps,  we got a watercress soup with marcona almonds and a citrus avocado salad. They were so good, especially the salad. My mom got the forest bowl for her entree (only like $14). It was vegan and even though she's not, she totally loved it. My fiance got the pork belly with flowering bok choy, which was lovely, and also midrange price (I think $16). He raved about it also.

And I got the charred salmon with egg yolk, soba noodles, mushrooms, and delicious broth. I literally have never had better salmon. It was cooked rare, and the char gave it a smoky, salty flavor almost like lox. The mushrooms were grilled and one of the highlights of the dish. If I could eat it every day, I probably would. It was also a really decent portion of salmon and cost either $14 or $16. 

AND all of it was locally sourced. AND the waitress was charming and helpful. I definitely think we will be coming back here, frequently."}
{"text":"Such a lovely experience.  The butcher's sandwich of the day was flank steak with tomato chili sauce on baguette.  Flank steak was tender and the robust tomato sauce with a hint of spiciness. We also had the forest bowl, which features an assortment of mushrooms, lentils, greens, and pureed squash.  You can enjoy the different flavors together without muddling them all together.  This is where Wisconsin produce shines!  The garage door style window offer great people watching.  Service was unobtrusive yet attentive. I look forward to returning, especially for the forthcoming cheese bar!"}
{"text":"The Smoked Trout omelet salad was surprisingly delicious despite being a bit small. The omelet salad was seasoned well despite being a bit salty. The atmosphere itself was cozy and relaxing, and not too busy during the rush lunch hour. 

The service was relatively timely and the waitress was fairly nice and accommodating. For about $10-$15 per dish for lunch is fairly comparable for good quality table service food around the capitol square. I'm surprised I haven't checked this place sooner but glad to have gotten lunch here!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for lunch a few times and it's failed every time.  It's set up to be a cool lunch spot - nice decor, right on capitol square, large open seating.  But the food and service are not good.  Overpriced and bland.  I recently got a entree Cobb salad which is the size of a side salad and not good, plus it was $15... I also ordered gazpacho - a tiny cup for $5.  Flavor was way too much tomato and onion - and the tomato flavor was bland - like Roma tomatoes.  No essence of other flavors that should be in gazpacho.  Tasted like cold red spaghetti sauce from a can.. Similar experiences prior visits.  I guess I should learn my lesson.  Obviously other people know that lunch is and because the place was completely dead the entire time I was there from noon-1pm on a weekday.

Two stars because I've been for dinner with a group of people and it was decent.  Small plates to share.

Also no spicy.  Hard pass."}
{"text":"Dreadful and soooooo pretentious! The menu and ambiance suggest simple elegantly prepared food. What you get is barely washed food slapped on a plate, slathered and drowned in store bought tasting, flavorless salad dressing. Truth be told your average toddler could do better with frozen peas and a bottle of kraft. \"Spicy carrots\" were not spicy and in fact, were flavorless, and also swimming in another unispiring white sauce. The drinks...sigh...tiny and uninspiring. At first you think it's a reasonable price at 7-8 bucks for a martini - then it shows up in a thimble. What a waste of a nicely designed space in a primo location!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot in Madison! It has great ambience and service and the food is the most delicious of anywhere we've been in town. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"WOW DRINKS! Ask the bartender to make any drink and they will. If you can't decide give them a flavor and they will nail it. The drink menu will give you some reading material. The staff are friendly and nice. The ambience is quiet and they always have great music on. Food is great as far as appetizers I haven't had dinner here. The front of the building opens up to the air in the summer. and it looks out onto the Capitol Building. They have outdoor seating which is nice. They have a huge horseshoe shaped bar. and small deli for lunch. They have a wine menu, which I find lacking. A lot of middle of the road wines for such a nice place as far as I'm concerned. The bathroom is nice, and very clean."}
{"text":"I would not have stumbled upon Field Table had I remembered on Saturday that the Farmer's Market does not allow dogs! We had to walk along the outer edge of the square, and saw Field Table.

They were serving breakfast outside. Coffee was $2, which is an amazing price, not to mention it was also delicious! We also got a Breakfast \"Shuco\" ($8), a breakfast sandwich in a brioche with a fried egg, bacon, and guacamole. There was another sauce in there that reminded me of tartar sauce, but not quite tartar sauce. Either way, it was a huge sandwich. The egg was runny, just how I like it. 

I'm curious to see what their menu for the rest of the day is like. I like the concept of the place - food, drinks, and a market."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rainbow Trout and it's the best fish dish I've ever had."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for drinks and dinner and enjoy it every time. The chicken is probably one of my favorite dishes I've had at a restaurant and the vibe is really cool and comfortable. I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch today at Field Table! Highlight of our meal was this gorgeous cheeseboard served with honey, house made pickles and toast.  The combination of flavors with the cheese was incredible.  Everything was as delicious as it was beautiful!"}
{"text":"I was walking around the Capital square this afternoon with a good friend and we were looking for a new place to grab lunch. We were very disappointed with our choice. Field Table looks like a wonderful upscale lunch and dinner restaurant, and the menu looks sophisticated and fun as well. However we were highly disappointed with our food, and the lack of attention and service our server provided. The restaurant is gorgeous in the front, but if you are seated in the back of the restaurant you might as well be sitting in a dungeon. It is very dark and depressing. We both ordered their hamburger from the lunch menu. My friends hamburger was missing the cheese she ordered, and the pairing of the Anaheim pepper that is deep friend and placed on the plate was odd to say the least. Not sure of its purpose. My burger was done as requested however it was not anything to write home about. Overall not a great experience and I do not plan on returning anytime soon. I was really hoping for wonderful lunch and was disappointed this restaurant did not live up to my expectations.  My parting words to my friend was we should have just gone to the Plaza and had a plaza burger and fries."}
