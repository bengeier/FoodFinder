{"text":"Take out order. Batter soggy when it got home. Never pack two orders of fish in the same box. Counter person couldn't tell me the difference between halibut and haddock. You are running a restaurant. It is your job to know all about it and the food you serve. \"Halibut is a big fish\", yeah that helps :( Fish over cooked. Fries nothing to write home about it. Sorry, but I don't see the attraction here. I'll go back to Duckworth's in a heart beat for their Sole, but I will try British F&C first."}
{"text":"Reviewed Dish: 1 piece fish and chips  Restaurant Makeover did a good job at modernizing the restaurant. It's probably  the best looking Fish & Chips I have ever went to. Unfortunately the food was not that memorable, not sure if it was because I went after the normal lunch crowd at 2pm. Normally I do not rate the service, but one of the owners were cooking that day, and he was kind of grumpy the entire time......or maybe it's an off day at Reliable.  Reviewed during: weekday 2pm Service Speed: N/A Service : 2 / 5 Cooking speed: 3.5 / 5 Food Quality: 3.5 / 5 Food Quantity: 3.5 / 5 Price: 3.5 / 5  Cleanness: 5 / 5  Repeat: Maybe"}
{"text":"I had the 2 piece haddock and chips. The batter was  light and crispy which was nice but the fish was slightly over done  just a little dry.  The chips were cut a good thickness and cooked well, no complaints there .  Owner and staff were friendly and attentive.  Good overall experience but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Like the name says...  Nice small place that never seems to be too busy when I go.   Batter is light and flaky. Great variety of fish and drinks on hand. The chips are crispy and delicious.  Haven't had takeaway... so my fish and chips are never soggy."}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips.  Got the Basa Fish And Chips.  Price is reasonable, paid $8.50 for a large piece of fish, fries, and a drink.  Quaint little place, overall enjoyed it!  Would go back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Reliable Fish and Chips lives up to their name.  The place has been around a long time and has recently been renewed thanks to a TV restaurant makeover show.  The fish is fresh and the fries are nice and crispy. Portions are ample and cooked to perfection.  If you can manage to \"eat in\" you'll be rewarded with crispy goodness.  My only complaint is that they tend to close a little on the early side.  There have been a few times I've had a craving but unable to satisfy it since I was a little too late and they had already closed."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The batter has a light flavour and isn't oily, and the fries are delicious.  You don't need to order more than one piece of fish with your meal btw, the portions are quite hefty.  Service has always been fast so far. Good for takeout if you work in the area and are on lunch."}
{"text":"It's okay, nothing more. The owners are very nice welcoming people.   The chips are always overcooked, not by accident - its because that's how long they think they should be cooked for . Due to the oil, oil temperature ,and potato type they are always greasy.   Fish is always fresh but the batter is too thick, and overcooked but it is usually crunchy."}
{"text":"I go here for the poutine. One day I'll be adventurous and actually have some fish and chips instead! I used to visit really frequently, so they always knew what I wanted before I even walked in the door. I went in again recently, and even though it had been over a year since my last visit, she still remembered what I ordered. :) I love this place, and wish I still worked close by. Best poutine. Seriously!"}
{"text":"Great English style Fish & Chips cooked to order. Been around since 1930 and now I know why. Eating here brought back very pleasant memories of my youth, living in a Welsh Mining town as an evacuee from war-torn London during WWII. Every Friday night I was sent down to the local fish & chip shop to get three sets of fish and three-penneth of chips wrapped up in the local newspaper to keep the portions wonderfully warm until I arrived home. What a treat....."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to begin this review..  First off, the BEST fish & chips I have ever had, hands down! I don't even really enjoy fish to be honest. But they make it so darn good it's my new favourite.  Secondly, it's totally worth splurging the extra money for the halibut. It's cooked perfectly, the batter is light and doesn't take anything away from the taste of the fish. I've had fish & chips from Jack Astor's before (it cost more and wasn't halibut if I may add) and the batter was so much thicker than the fish itself and all I could taste was grease!   The owner served us to go, he was wonderful and made sure we had all our sauces/cutlery before we left. The atmosphere was super friendly and welcoming. Will be back for more, and will recommend to others :)"}
{"text":"This one is going to be sweet and short.   Love their fish and chips!  Small, tidy place with just few places to dine in, as this place is mostly take-away place.  Nice crisp and flaky texture both on fish and chips. Under  $10 lunch of one piece basa fish and fries comes with a drink. Malt vinegar is on the table.  Check out my photo to see how great the food looks ;)  P.s. Just one thing for vegetarians (I mean those who do eat fish and nothing beside it) that I think they are frying meat in the same oil as fish...at least that is what one of saw...needs investigation."}
{"text":"The batter is quite flaky and more batter than fish meat. It tasted great, but I wish there was more fish. This place manages to acquire their clientele from their specials and deals which makes their quality somewhat unnoticeable."}
{"text":"Hands down the best halibut & chips on the planet! Nice, thick, fresh fillets. Get the halibut it's worth it. I took a cab from across town and Reliable met every expectation. Definitely a destination for a meal when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Basically a good no-frills place for fish and chips, \"reliable\" indeed. This place has very good fish, Halibut is good, Haddock is good, Cod is all right but I really prefer the Haddock and Halibut, though Halibut is more expensive due to over-fishing and popularity, so I would recommend the Haddock which holds together a bit better than the Cod in your fork. Their batter is very nice and crispy, and their tartar sauce is great, nothing to say. They have a very good choice of cane sugar sodas, all they need is an actual cane sugar cola and it would be great with the birch beer, root beer, ginger ale, and cream soda they already sell. I don't recommend other sea food items than the fish, I think they are more focused on their fish because I really didn't feel the same quality and pleasure in eating their other items, I don't know how popular those items are but I think that's maybe why it's called \"Reliable\" \"Fish and Chips\", not \"Seafood and Chips\". They're not bad, but for me, I just definitely prefer going there for the fish."}
{"text":"Way too greasy for this gut. Recommended by a Torontonian I know as well. Not my thing...there are places in Kingston ON that are much better. The neighborhood is really cool tho...sort of Brooklyn before the trust fund brats moved in."}
{"text":"Small place, but damn good fish & chips. Best I've tried. Their fish is deep fried in vegetable oil rather than the usual animal fat that most places use for deep frying, so the smell of grease doesn't stick to everything you wear. Their batter is light and flakey and they serve some fishes that are not what you'd usually expect, such as salmon.  The owner's super nice if you go when it's not too busy he's great to chat with. If you're dining in they use spray bottles for the vinegar so you get a nice even coating on everything and never over do it. The price is good and the portions are great. My favourite fish & chips joint in town.  They also serve Boylan's Sugar Cane Cola, fantastic."}
{"text":"I continue to come here and it continues to be very \"reliable\". You won't find an owner that tries harder and cares more. While fish and chips are available just about everywhere, very few places are consistent with quality, service and customer care. Lightly battered so as to not to take away from the taste of the fish. French fries cut from real potato's cut on site, not from frozen and a limited menu selection which enables quality.  I like that they don't use plastic bags or Styrofoam containers. Paper bags and cardboard contains.  This is good for the environment and good for health. Hot food and plastic should never be mixed.  I wish they would switch to wood forks for the take out, this one change would make them perfect. In the mean time, they are a good example of doing things right."}
{"text":"I came here six years ago and remembered a more reliable halibut."}
{"text":"Was strolling through Riverdale to pick up some baguette and I ended up at Reliable Fish & Chips with a case of the munchies.  I quite enjoyed the cute decor of the joint.  It almost felt very East-Coast-y as if you were inside a fishing boat of some sort with all the wooded walls, and sea-related decor.    I got an order of halibut and chips to share with my DC.  The girl behind the counter told us to have a seat while she prepared our order.  When it was ready, she brought it over to our table with proper cutlery (better for the environment too not to be using disposable!) and hooked us up with some ketchup.  I haven't had a lot of Fish 'n Chips experiences in Toronto other than the High Liner stuff out of a box in the frozen foods aisle, a fish 'n chips shop in Georgian Bay, and the chain restaurants such as Jack Astor's.  I will say however, that their batter is one of the best I've experienced thus far.  It was a thin coat, which was not too heavy and didn't overpower the natural flavour of the halibut.  The halibut was solid without being overly dry.  The house tartar sauce was tasty, but how could mayonnaise ever taste bad?    Th fries were okay, but lacked any hint of potato flavour and could've used some more salt.    All in all, a great place to stop by for some good ol' Fish 'n Chips."}
{"text":"Reliable's has some of the best fish and chips that I've ever had - the batter is dynamite! We came with a group and shared the cod, poutine, fish tacos, and chicken sandwich. Everything we had was fresh, cooked perfectly, and delicious. I was not expecting the chicken sandwich to be as good as it was at a place known for fish and chips, but it tasted amazing. You cannot go wrong with any of those items and I highly recommend all of them."}
{"text":"I love LOVE love the fish tacos!   I've tried all the different kinds of fish and chips and pretty much loved it all too! But the fish tacos are one of the best hands down! Way better than la carnita in my opinion. I love the nan bread they use to wrap the fried fish in.. it has a sweetness to it. The fried onions sprinkled on top is super flavourful! I love the homemade sauce... you can get one for like 5.65 and 2 tacos for like 11 bucks. Sooo worth it. One usually satisfy my cravings and two sometimes is too filling for me.. but I get two anyways because I'm greedy and because it's soooo delish!   I want to try other stuff on the menu too because I heard it was good.. but every time I walk by and attempt to order something different... I end up choosing the fish tacos again. I swear.. when they were in renovation for a few months I literally almost cried my eyeballs out. I needed my weekly dosage of fried fish tacos!!  Sooooo happy u guys R back open for business!!! I love the owners.. so sweet and friendly..   See u soon!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a lunch date and it was really nice. The fish was succulent and the batter crispy and golden. Loved my chips with extra salt and a whole lot of ketchup. The customer service was great and very helpful"}
{"text":"Excellent Fish Biryani Burrito at Reliable. Well spiced and perfect on a sunny fall afternoon. Enjoying the sunshine and people watching on Queen Street."}
{"text":"Get yourself down here to Reliable Fish &Chips for some of the best poutine in the city! The fries are freshly cut and the gravy is deeply delicious. I was so entranced and focused on my prize that i started to leave and the owner dashed around the counter to ensure i had a fork and napkin :  ).  The fish and chips is equally good. The batter was light with just the right amount of crunch.  I always find street parking close to this small gem and I always take out preferring to eat and stroll in the newly hip and fun Leslieville.  Truly is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips I've had in this city, you can even ask for your dinner in a poke.  The prices are way below the rest in competition with them.  The batter is great and they offer a great variety of fish, including my favourite Haddock, it's what I grew up with and what I love the most.  They also do a lovely fish chowder."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars   Reliable? I think not. After reading the reviews of the previous Yelpers I had some degree of expectation for some decent fish and chips at this city landmark fish & chip corner. Alas, t'was not to be. Me and my meat-loving sista, Shari M. decided to go the pescatarian route last night and afterwards I think underneath we were thinking damn, we shoulda gone BQM!   Gotta give Reliable a big thumbs up for their cheerful and friendly service. This tiny little hub is manned by staff that are very pleasant. I saw one of them put on a coat and run up the street to a fellow retailer to deliver an order. Our waiter let us know that they had potato salad in the house which of course being the spud carbo freaks we are we immediately ordered a side of that. We went with the Halibut & Chips with some cole slaw.   The fish, while fresh and very meaty wasn't right. The batter was flat and somewhat soggy. The fries, while plentifully piled and obviously made from fresh potatoes, were also soggy, oily and somewhat limp.  Shari nailed it on the head when she said to me \"these are tasteless\". Thank goodness for spray bottles of vinegar. Be mindful of their salt shakers ....whoa....they spew like Niagara Falls....a river of white stuff.  As for the sides, don't bother with the potato salad.  Ugh.  Tasteless.  Really hard little chunks of potatoes.  One of the worst potato salads I've had in ages.  Cole slaw was basically shredded cabbage with your bottled cole slaw dressing.     Maybe it was an off day at Reliable. Maybe the oil wasn't hot enough. Maybe the oil was in need of changing. Whatever it was Reliable wasn't reliable.   Saving grace of the night....when I suggested to Shari we go east and visit Tim at the Pie Shack for our night cap of coffee and pie. Her eyes lit up like a pinball machine. Amazing how Brumbleberry Pie can lift your spirits! Coincidentally we bumped into our sister Yelper, the oh so delightful Farheen at the Shack!"}
{"text":"Reliable is in the name and it is indeed reliable for a good fish and chips. I usually stop by when I have a hankering and it's never disappoints.  I don't eat in. The fish is always nice and crispy and if you love classic greasy fries (in a good way), it really is delicious. Great for old school fish and chips."}
{"text":"I finally came here a few days ago.  We ordered the basa fish and chips and the cod fish and chips.  We figured it would be a taste test of sorts.  The good news: I liked one better than the other.  The bad news:  I have no idea which one it was.  Taste Test fail.  Both fish had a nice light batter that was not overwhelming.  The chips were ok, and could have been a bit crispier.  I did have it to go, so it's possible that eating there would have improved the experience.  There are a few stools and a countertop there to eat at.  The hours are somewhat limited.  Overall, it was pretty good.  I'll go back and try my taste test again."}
{"text":"this is the oldest fish and chip place in the city.   its been around since the early thirties i think.  (might have to correct this in the future). but its damn old and thats the point.  they have pictures in there of the grandfather of the vet that works across the street in that gargantuan beautiful old brown building.  the guy who owned reliable, was running this place back then.  so i suppose they have damn well earned the moniker RELIABLE.  its nice that that history is preserved both within and without that building.  within, you see these photos, news clippings and history lining the walls; in fact i believe the wallpaper might be a mock up of old newspaper clippings.  without the building is the green and gold sign.  the font speaks of a different time.  and also from without you always see folks eating fish and chips atop the bar stools that face the street behind the windows.  its not hard to picture the same scenario, though in all black and white, with the men capped with bowlers and fish being slid under their thick handlebar moustaches.  perhaps it was a business decision to keep the history afloat when owners changed hands (as im pretty sure they did. the owners are asian now and werent originally.), but it sure is awful sweet.  now, as for the classic dish,  i quite enjoy it because the fish is lightly battered - im not having some fish with my batter.  the fries are nice and crispy.  the gravy is tangy and rich.  i also had clam strips, which is essentially the same deal as the fish, perhaps with a different batter.  think popcorn shrimp and you pretty much have the idea.  i did find those a little more greasy than the fish, but it didnt keep my equally greezy paws off of them."}
{"text":"Love this place! A bit pricey, but overall great food and service here. Probably some of the best fish and chips I've had in TO. You can \"rely\" on this place to deliver a good meal ;) Har har!"}
{"text":"My favourite fish and chips in Toronto. Light batter, quality fish and good fries. I tried all fishes they serve -cod, halibut, haddock and salmon - and I'll stick with the good old cold. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"a good place for fish and chips, I came here before going to a concert at the opera house and I have to say I am impressed. I ordered the haddock and chips with a boyens (fancy independent company) cola and the bill was exactly $10, I have had cheaper but I would say that $10 was the perfect price for this meal.   The fries were nice and warm, not too greasy but not too solid either and the fish was near perfectly battered. Not the best fish and chips I have ever had but I would certainly go back if I am in the neighborhood, which I frequently am. Not much else to say other than if you like fish and chips, this is a good place.  The guy who (I assume owns the place) is pretty funny"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered the special - basa, fries and a drink for $10 (tax included).The fish was pretty pedestrian compared to other fish and chip places. The fries looked burnt and were not crispy.   Service was quick and fish cooked to order.   Not sure if I will be back, probably not. They weren't bad, but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"One of our few regular stops when we're on the east end of town. Reliable Fish and & Chips offers some of the best in the city.  There are usually four fish (halibut, cod, salmon and haddock), and a few other 'specials' on the menu. Our standard order is two pieces of fish and fries. The fish comes in a pretty light batter, which is great, because you get mostly fish (whereas many fnc places try to use more batter than fish). It's quite tasty. Fries look like they're hand cut, and they're usually of a thicker variety. They could give the patron's a few more fries, considering they're mostly filler on the plate, but the quality is good.  Eating in has improved dramatically since the makeover, and it's a pleasant, clean atmosphere. The owner and cook is friendly and really does seem to enjoy his work. Easily accessible via the 501 streetcar, they do close a bit early for my taste and are not open on Sundays.  Overall, one of our favorite spots in the city. It boggles my mind how people prefer Chippy's soggy, tasteless batter and absurdly greasy fries to a place like this. They've really made great strides in the last few years in making the place inviting, but the fish, as always, has been great."}
{"text":"The 100 year old restaurant just refurbished its interior and its menu... I'm not a big deep fried cuisine consumer, so I am pleased with the expanded menu... currently trying the jerk chicken burrito and loving it!"}
{"text":"We got the $8.95 lunch special at 4:30 pm... one piece of haddock with fries. Let me say, that one piece is a really big fillet and I was STUFFFED afterwards. The fish was lightly battered and crisp which I like. It's a really thin fillet though, which I'm not used to. All the other fish n chip places I've tried always had a chubbier fillet. But their fish here tastes fresher.  And it was really really bland. You have to load on the salt pepper vinegar and tarter sauce. The fries were super greasy and a bit soggy from the excessive oil on the plate. I only had a few before I started feeling gross. It's definitely too heavy for me but when crazing something greasy, this works. It's a huge plate so share with a friend :)  Service was super fast and friendly. I guess because we went in the late afternoon which is really past lunch but before dinner. Only a few tables (about 5?) but even at that off time there were customers inside."}
{"text":"Some people really take their reviews of fish and chip joints pretty darn seriously.  I don't know, when I go into a fish and chip joint, I only care that it tastes good.  People here are measuring grease, amount of batter, etc... really?  This matters to people?  Anyway, Reliable Fish & Chips' appeal to me is when I eat there, I feel at home.  The people are nice, the food smells and tastes great.  They play my kind of music, they have neat sodas in the fridge and when all is said and done, we head down the block to Ed's for a scoop of some wicked ice cream.  If you like Fish and Chips, go there.  Is it the best in the city?  How can anyone tell that?  It's good, it's yummy, it's fish and chips.  I prefer the halibut (I'm bad, I know) and I upgrade the fries to poutine which they do well.  I also take a coleslaw and their old fashioned cream soda.  It's pricey, over $20 but hey, that'll learn me for ordering halibut."}
{"text":"I live in close proximity to Reliable... and the smell always suckers me in. Although I love to try new places to eat, this is one that I keep going back to.  I have always done take-out, so I cannot comment on the eating environment.   Friendly service, quality food... great place to grab some F&C."}
{"text":"I haven't really eaten fish or other sea food as an adult.  I've shared the occasional bite of someone's entree when they rave over melt in your mouth fresh tuna, and have occasionally (like once a year) ordered a salmon steak but as a general rule, I will take the chicken or steak.  Enter Reliable Fish and Chips.  The best: - They have malt vinegar in spray bottles for an even misting of malty-acidic heaven  The good: - The guy who works here came over to our table and said 'Girls, have you ever seen a potato THIS BIG??' then showed us the biggest potato I have ever seen - I love these fish and chips - I had the single  piece of whatever they recommended - The fries are stellar; hand peeled and cut - The fish was lightly battered; it was airy, crispy and light in taste and texture - I've only had fish and chips 3 times and this was the best, by a hige margin  The bad: - limited seating  Would I go here again: I will go here again, probably this week.  And I'm eagerly looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I stumbled upon this hidden gem by watching an episode of Restaurant Make-Over. After seeing the episode I just had to stop in and try the fish! This place has the best fish and chips by far. The batter was light and had just the right amount of crispiness to it. I'm not a fan of fish by any means but after stopping in I can say that I am now a fan of halibut! I am also not a big french fry girl but after sinking my teeth into Reliable's chips I was in love, well done! When you're looking for a great fish and chips place this is it you've gotta try it you will not be disappointed. Great food and friendly service make this a go to place for a quick dinner..."}
{"text":"I don't know if there's anything better on a rainy day than fish and chips in Leslieville. Oh, I know: fish and chips courtesy Sarah L because I didn't have cash on me. Although the restaurant is tiny (barely room for ten) our trio (Hi Denise!) managed to grab a four-top. Our orders were unanimous --Halibut and Chips-- and all three were served in mere minutes. The fish was flaky and delicious and the thin batter was perfectly crisp. The fries were thick and soft (which is how I like 'em) and I got to mist them silly with a spray bottle of malt vinegar. Clever idea! Washed down everything with a Boylan's root beer. What a marvellous afternoon.  Obligatory Title Pun: You know who's RELIABLE? Sarah L.  Menu Readability: White sans-serif letters pressed into a grooved black letter board?? (Faint.)  Need to mention: They don't take credit or debit. Bring Sarah L.  What this place teaches me about myself: I need to visit an ATM."}
{"text":"I stopped here to grab a quick bite on my way to the Toronto Yelp event at Ed's Real Scoop, thinking that the ice cream would be the highlight of my evening. As of this writing... it's a tie (I'm not home yet).  Selection of fish was good - Halibut, Cod, Salmon, even Snapper, plus shrimp and other assorted bits of seafood. I went with the Cod and chips - delicious, and fried up while I waited, so it was still crisp and hot. The portions are very generous too - big fish, lots of chips. Perhaps the best surprise, though, was the price - $9 for the meal with a pop, including tax.  As a guy from the suburbs, I think perhaps the biggest praise I can offer a place - especially in Toronto - is whether or not I'd make a trip in to eat there. Reliable isn't quite at the level where I'd come to the city to eat there... but I'll definitely venture out that way from the downtown core next time I'm in town.  I do, after all, have like 4 other kinds of fish to try. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"The fish here is exceptional, and I say that as a F&C-loving Brit. Worth the extra $ for the Halibut. Definitely give this place a try, top drawer!"}
