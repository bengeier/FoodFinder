{"text":"We have visited many many times over the years.  I love the salsa.  The food is excellent and fresh.  I wish they would give out a larger bowl for the salsa since the small cups available are not easy to dip a chip in, however this is a small complaint.  The only other negative is the \"ambience,\" which is lacking. Not the most comfortable chairs.  Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The staff is friendly.  Love it!  We will continue to be regulars."}
{"text":"Stuck in the world between fast food and restaurant it's good for what it is. The food is solid but the prices a little high. I also find it very cheap to charge for drink refills."}
{"text":"I made a mental note to check Caramba's out during a visit to the Stir Fry Palace next door.  The place was packed, and I figured it must good.
I took my daughter there to dine on a couple of enchilada plates.
I think based on the great reviews here and the crowd that maybe my expectations were too high.  I thought the enchiladas were okay.  They weren't terrible.  They were just okay.  The beans and rice were fine.  I'll definitely give this place another try.  I believe in wisdom of the crowds, and Caramba's seems to be always crowded.  Those people must know something.  Maybe I got them on an off day, or maybe I was just off!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is the best place to get a burrito in Arizona by far.  Got their Carne Asada burrito with rice and sour cream inside.  One of THE BEST burritos here.  The tortilla was just perfect.  
Tried their Chorizo burrito, and it was pretty tasty.  They really don't skimp on the meat here.  The chorizo was quite oily though.  I was halfway done with it and it was soaked with oil.  
The chips and salsa are really good too.  Low prices, great food.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"The shredded beef tacos are why I was brought onto this earth. I've been eating here for a while now, maybe 6 years. Haven't been disappointed with a single meal I've gotten."}
{"text":"Nice little place, pretty good food, really nice people.

A friend and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon.  For $9, I got two chicken soft tacos with rice & beans, a drink and a bowl of chips.  

The food was o.k....but alot better with the addition of salsa from their salsa bar.  They had 4-5 different types of salsa that you could add - for no additional charge.  (The chips were free too).

The restaurant itself is nice.  We were there for a couple of hours and so were a few other groups of people. 

The owners have also done a nice job of keeping the place clean - bathrooms and all.

Would I recommend Caramba's?  Sure.  Probably won't be a regular, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm a very health conscious person, and this place was suprisingly great for me! I had a chicken burrito with veggies and pico, and they have a way to make simple and healthy very yummy! I enjoyed the availability of wheat tortillas, but was shocked that they don't have black beans; they only offer refried. Nor do they have brown rice. Nevertheless, the flavor was amazing, and the ingredients they didn't have did not cross my mind once  I took a bite! I would love to have one in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the longest time. Just had their giant burrito and it was perfect to share with jess. This thing is big and delicious, just make sure you know that it comes with sauce on top of the burrito. So I ask for it to have no sauce on top. Delicious is all I can say. The policeman are always here to eat lunch, so you know it's good :) #giantcaramba #comfortmexicanfood #reallygoodmargaritas"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years. The food is consistent,  though I like some of the entrees with different specs.  The red chile burro is delicious! Margaritas are great as well."}
{"text":"Food is great! Margaritas are awesome/ strong. If you like Mexican food check this one out!"}
{"text":"Love this place have been patronizing Carambas for 17 years, love the Union Hills location love the staff, however the patio needs shade! Umbrellas have been removed and shade is so needed! Great inexpensive fresh food...killer margaritas best for the price!"}
{"text":"Food's not that great. The staff was extremely friendly & service was fast. I had the Caramba chicken nachos. The chicken had an odd taste to it, like it had been boiled too long & didn't even have any seasoning. The chips tasted stale. Nacho cheese sauce from a can....very bland. Unfortunately we wont be repeat customers."}
{"text":"We were one of their first ten customers when they opened the downtown Glendale location. I was so excited to see them in North Glendale . It's not fancy, but you get great food at reasonable prices. Their red tamales with sauce are to die for. My favorite chorizo is still Carolina's , but they run a close second here.
The carne asada rocks!!"}
{"text":"I tried eating here saturday june 28th around 10am for breakfast. I called to place my order. I ordered a giant caramba burrito and a steak and egg burrito w/ chips and salsa. When I arrived for my food i was given a giant steak and egg caramba burrito which i didnt even see as an option. When I tried ordering correct food I could not because the manager wouldnt stop argueing with me. Every time I said \"I want a giant caramba burrito with steak AND\"... I would immediatly be interupted by the angry employee that would say \" but you told me this!?!\" Or \" but you told me that\". After trying to reorder three times I finnaly just gave the incorrect food back, and became so angry I began to leave completely forgeting my change. Ive never been so frustrated since i can remember. The funny part is if my order taker spoke better english this never would have happened. I refuse to learn spanish just to get my order correct so i guess me and carambas are going to have to go our seperate ways."}
{"text":"Good food and very reasonable prices.  I know and like good Mexican food and recommend this place.  They serve good Margaritas also.  The food was taste and well seasoned.  Forget the atmosphere, go for the food."}
{"text":"First time here... May be my last. When I asked the lady for a substitution she responded like I was an idiot and to top it off the food I ordered didn't come out the way I asked. All in all the food is bland and not worth the price!"}
{"text":"Love this place, cheap & tasty. Nothing fancy, just good authentic Mexican food. My favorite is the green chili burro & fajitas. Margaritas are good and strong!"}
{"text":"Great casual food.  We bring every out-of-town guest here for some Mexican food.  Granted, I'm from NY so I'm not an expert on \"authentic\" Mexican food, but this place has food that I like.  My wife is very picky about her food, and they go out of the way to accommodate her requests.  

Her favorite is the Beef Machaca quesadilla, with whole wheat tortilla and half the amount of cheese- healthier option that they always get right.  We also tweak the Mexican Pizza to leave off the fatty sour cream and guac and add lettuce instead (gotta get those veggies in!).  Also very good are the Giant Carumba's Stuffed Burrito, Chicken Salad, and plain old tacos.  Also a must- the cinnamon crisps for dessert.  We've been treated several times to free desserts- for my birthday, just for coming in, etc.  For under $2, you can get a HEAPING platter of fried flour tortilla strips covered in cinnamon and sugar and honey.  DELICIOUS! 

The margaritas are very strong but taste like you're downing cheap tequila (which you probably are).  One is enough, but on Mondays and Tuesdays they're BOGO, which, at $3.75, is an awesome deal to get drunk fast!

Overall, a great place for a cheap (for the 2 of us it's usually less than $20 including drinks), quick meal."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE PLACE!! HORRIBLE FOOD!!! Bell Rd & 23rd ave. They got our take out order wrong, then we found a nasty hair in the food. We called the manager to let him know and he was in complete denial and said he could not do anything about that on a take order. This place is not clean inside and is a complete rip off! Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Dirty interior, indifferent service, blah food.  Not worth spending more time than that on a review."}
{"text":"First time here, I got the machaca burro enchilada style with onions and cheese. First, I was wowed when it cost over $9, it was big and good but too much. It made two meals. I will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Decided to give a chance since it was close by. Decided on the Pollo Fundido based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. Very large portion and very tasty. I would not hesitate to order this again. Chips are OK, and there are multiple salsas to choose from. Refried beans are good. Based on one meal, I would give it a try."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food..the cashiers are  always a little cold and not very friendly..today was the  worst..Jessica M. Did not even greet me, she simply stared at me waiting for my order, Omg, wake up guys this is your front line staff, the face of your restaraunt!  I probably won't be back after eating at caramba at various locations for 15+years..it would be nice to feel like a customer.."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Hawaii and OMG this is the best we've had in 10 years  (time we were in Hawaii ).
Service was great and the food was to die for. 
The portions are huge. 
Next time we'll share. 
The Margarita 's  are a steal for the price. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Cashier got order wrong then had to argue with her to change it from regular burrito to giant caramba. She should've just fixed her mistake. Then she charged me 50 cents to get my horchata without ice. It was bad enough that want a quarter for a soda refill. I'm being nickled and dimed and I don't like it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very reliable, cheap Mexican food. I've wanted to try this place for awhile, but it's too casual for my girlfriends, that want something a little nicer for our dinners out. I had the fundido burrito with shredded beef. Very basic beef burro deep fried then slathered with a sweet queso. I thought it was great! R had the carnitas. The pork was grilled and was tasty, but I prefer carnitas that are a little fattier. The beans were bland and so was the rice. However the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I have been going to multiple Caramba locations for years, always good food and margaritas that hit you hard. This is our favorite location we come often and love it! Mexican Pizza and Caramba stuffed Quesadilla are our favs."}
{"text":"Love this place always fresh and fast. Order a lot of different things. The loaded burrito is huge. Never dissapoints. Always something different to pick. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Over rated... Sloppy Mexican food with plastic forks.."}
{"text":"Do your intestines need a workout?
Do you miss your toilet and would like to spend some quality time with it?
Well.......come to Carambas!

Yes, for a limited time only we can pummel your digestive system with 2 pounds of slop that we like to call the wet burrito!

Thats not all folks! Throw in a plastic bowl of stale chips and day old salsa and you're in for a real treat!"}
{"text":"Do your intestines need a workout?
Do you miss your toilet and would like to spend some quality time with it?
Well.......come to Carambas!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this spot since we moved out to Surprise and every visit has been great. Food is always fresh and taste great. Salsa bar is always stocked and fresh. Staff is friendly and helpful. Always clean. The Cashier Lot is always on point with his service. Great Job"}
{"text":"Good stuff here, I can get a protein packed lunch at a good price. Also enjoy getting to pick my salsas out and trying new ones. The workers here were really nice and looks like they had a decent lunch crowd which is good to see. I will be back."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Can't go wrong with the Giant Carmaba Burrito, the Mexican Pizza, or the shredded beef tacos.  Great margaritas as well.  This visit the rolled tacos were meh, so I knocked a star off."}
{"text":"Super friendly and delicious. Reasonable price, this has become our new family eat out spot. We usually just order it and take it home because we live right around the corner."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh.  Juan alway threats you as a long time friend.  Margarita are great."}
{"text":"I had been craving a bean & cheese burrito all weekend, so on Monday come lunch time I searched my Yelp app for a Mexican food place on the way home (I was meeting up w/my hubs). Caramba was the 1st place to pop up so I decided to check it out. After looking over the menu I ordered the following for us to try: bean & cheese burrito, chicken pollo fundido, beef fajita combo plate & a cheese quesadilla w/a side of sour cream. Since I was taking it to go I forgot to grab some salsa from the salsa bar, next time!

I had half of the bean & cheese burro & about a third of the pollo fundido for my lunch, I can't decide which was better as they were both so good! My hubby split the bean & cheese burro w/me & ate the cheese quesadilla w/sour cream, he also loved the burro & said the quesadilla was good too, not greasy like most places. That night for dinner I finished my pollo fundido & my hubby had his fajita plate, he said everything was very tasty! Total for all that food was about $25, not bad. 

Next visit I'd like to dine in & order their famous stuffed quesadilla & the cinnamon crisps dessert. They also have beer & margaritas & serve breakfast burritos all day. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I had a yearning for a Carne Asada Burrito and didnt want to drive all the way down to Central Phoenix.  I found Caramba's on Yelp and tried it out.  The portions on the combo with rice and beans were small, and the taste was not very memorable.  I would not go back or recommend."}
{"text":"The homemade flour tortillas were awesome, the margaritas were FANTASTIC and very cheap. Everything tasted authentic, good salsa bar too. Best surprise in Surprise!"}
{"text":"I have consistently given my business to these folks. Starting at their original location on Glendale Ave, in Glendale. 

I ordered the #2 Beef Tacos. Meat is cold in a deep fried shell. Couldn't be more disappointed. If you're not going to do it right, don't do it al all."}
{"text":"Great Place. The Giant Burrito is fantastic. Lots of meat and cheese. It fills the aluminum container. Enough for 2-3 meals. Just wish they would give chips when you order a meal to go. Otherwise, I would recomend the burrito, the Mexican Pizza and the cheese crisp ."}
{"text":"For easy takeout and casual dining, this is the place. Nothing fancy but good affordable food.  Being Spanish, I know and appreciate good Spanish food.  They are very accommodating for people who have special dietary needs."}
{"text":"The food is good but they have the best margaritas in town. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite, go to, fast, cheap and good mexican restaurant.  I say used to be, because the last 4-5 times we have gone it wasn't the same.  Messed up orders, WAY over salted shrimp and beef so bad you couldn't eat it.  Margaritas have changed as well, tastes like they have gone to a mix.  
Because we have been regulars for so long we will probably give it 1 or 2 more chances, but they are on a short leash.  Seems to me maybe management has changed and they are cutting corners.  Too bad."}
{"text":"My favorate mexican food restaurant opens its 3 location in Glendale and this one is a hit and with in walking distance from our home. Now we don't have to stop at just two of their award winning Margaritas, simply the best and don't be fooled these margaritas have a kick . I have been eating at the 67th Ave & Bell rd location at least once a week since they opened. I spoke to the owner yesterday and this location is breaking sales records and they have only been open a week. I recently became a vegetarian and I though I was going to have to stop eating Caramba's, but as I looked at the menu I notice that they a vegetarian burro and several other options on the menu. Thank god, I don't know if I could make it with out my weekly fix. If you like menudo that have the best. One of the best things about eating at Caramba's is the friendly people that work there preparing the best and healthiest mexican food in the valley (NO LARD or M.S.G.). When I say fresh, they mean fresh NEVER FROZEN. The salsa bar is stocked with a variety of made fresh daily salsas. I have lived in the valley all my life and I can honestly tell you that you to will love Caramba Fresh Mexican Food."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since it opened and we are treated like family each and every time. To have a restaurant that has had the same employees over all of these years tells me something for John the owner. Now for the food they have a large menu and there are several favorites that I keep coming back for. The menudo is a family favorite and I think it is some of the best in the valley and I have been eating menudo for over 40 years. The margaritas are special treat, inexpensive and they taste great. The flavors in the Salpicon salad are craved at least twice a week and is delicious with any of the 3 options: chicken, beef, or shrimp!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Carumba's for the past 18 years. Both of our children used to munch on tortilla chips while perched atop the table while seated in their carrier seat.
Juan is truly a master of customer service. Always ready to get to know the clientele with a friendly smile and warm personality. The staff are friendly and never fail to make us feel as if we are part of the family. 
Their margaritas (primo is best) are second to none. For the price you just can't beat them. The food is authentic Sonoran style Mexican."}
{"text":"It's a simple order at the window, pay, take a seat, wait for your number to be called, and eat system. Portions are big, food taste Mexican- American, and good prices. I would consider this an upscale Taco Bell. The cashier was very informative and helpful. He had some good recommendations.  They have a great selection for the free salsa bar. Free nachos are always good. I got the carne Asada tacos which were good. I also went for the tamales which were pretty authentic. Save room for dessert bc the fried ice cream is pretty legit. I was overall satisfied. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing negative hence only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a good price. Bar is great. Both Jake and George are excellent bartenders. One of the best bloody Mary's in town."}
{"text":"Caramba  is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Surprise. The food is fast, fresh and delicious. We enjoy their burritos, tacos, enchiladas, rice, beans, salsas, tamales, and chorizo dishes as well as their friendly service.

The only down side to Caramba is they don't open early enough. Their breakfast menu is robust, but who wants to wait until 10am for one of their mouthwatering burritos or egg dishes?"}
{"text":"The only Mexican restaurant for us in Surprise. We are thrilled with the quality of the freshly prepared food. It is open until 10 and we have taken advantage of this late hours.
The food comes up quickly and that is impressive considering we are a party of 6. We have never waited more than ten minutes. Modifications are never a problem.
We are there often enough that they automatically poured a horchata for my teen when we walked in. It's that invested, personal touch that makes this restaurant so much more than the competition."}
{"text":"Ok short and sweet this is very good take out. We have been here to pick up dinner several times and have tried a number of menu items: the chicken burro, the mex pizza, the enchiladas, and the chimi. Even the bean burros were some of the better ones I've had. And price is pretty reasonable, go hit this joint!"}
{"text":"I made a catering order for a project my son was doing at school. I ordered 40 mini chicken burritos which cost me a whopping $140. The burritos were literally bland shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla with nothing else inside besides the chicken. They did put tomatoes, lettuce, and scallions in a container on the side but I've never in my life had a burrito that had nothing in it besides meat. No rice, no beans or anything. No salsa or anything on the side for the dry burritos. The burritos were disgusting and a total embarrassment. I could have made them myself for about $25 with a filling that had something other than bland chicken. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed. Arrived to pick up my order to go and the place was packed, always a great sign. Wait staff very friendly and kitchen looks very clean. Brought the order back to work where everyone gave their food two thumbs up. Plus our complicated order was packed to perfection.  We were very satisfied and will be getting take out again!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time to carambas. It is an easy stop at any of the locations. This one at 67 and bell is clean and the staff is friendly. I usually order the giant caramba it's the most bang for the buck. It is the same every time I order it and I appreciate consistency. I came with a friend who ordered some other burrito that pales in comparison to the giant caramba and it was only 50 cents less. Needless to say he left hungry while I dined on the kings feast. It's now 5 hours later and I'm still full. I'll bet next time he will go big or just go home."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Good chips and salsa.  My husband likes the fundido.  I like the tamales, but the beef salpicon is marvelous!"}
{"text":"Love this place. If you like salads they have a taco chicken salad that has the best cilantro dressing. I have had almost everything on the menu and the salad is my favorite dish. The owner was cool too, we came for lunch to celebrate a co workers birthday and the owner hooked us up with the cinnamon and sugar chips. I would highly recommend frequenting this place."}
{"text":"OBSESSED!!! My friend and I are beyond obsessed with the food especially the salsa! There are some times when the order gets messed up but they fix it for you pretty quick. One of the men who works there knows us and our usual order which is nice and shows how much we eat there!"}
{"text":"My Giant Caramba Burro was a giant disappointment. I'll usually finish a subpar meal because I hate being wasteful, but this went straight in the garbage after a few bites. 

They didn't skimp on the meat, there was a LOT of bland watery beef. The tortillas were doughy and the red \"chile\" sauce didn't seem to contribute anything but more sogginess. 

We also ordered a chicken burrito that could have been pork, but it was way too pink to be fully cooked whichever animal it came from. 

I think the next time I have dog food dressed up as Mexican food I'll save a few bucks and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Terrible food that's not Mexican thats dog food!! Id give a quarter of a star they dont deserve a full start Cashier briana b was an asshole to my wife for asking whats comes on a salad thought we would try since its close to home never again I'd rather drive the extra few miles for filaburtos then have this slop"}
{"text":"I come here regularly and Love the food and margaritas here and I would give five stars, But the girl with the pink hair has the worst attitude I have ever seen. I asked her how she was doing and she proceeded to complain about her day at work to me like I was her best friend. Huge turn off. Anyone in the service industry knows you say you're having a great day and move forward. And she never can seem to get the order right. Also, why do you always look closed? Turn the neons on in the front of the restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I am convinced that everyone giving this place good reviews must be confusing this with somewhere else, or its the same people that keep terrible places like Macayo's in business.  I ate here a while ago, and I thought I would give it a second chance last week. It was still bad. If a Mexican food place can't make refried beans well, I'm not sure what they can make. They taste like they are straight from the can. For a place that touts all of the other fresh items they serve, some effort on their beans would be nice.  The rice had little flavor. Tortilla was ok at best. The prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality. Also, not a huge deal but you need to pay 25 cents for a soda refill, this just bothers me.

If you want great Mexican food in Surprise, go to Rito's on Reems and Greenway. Nothing in Surprise comes close, especially this place."}
{"text":"Chimichangas with fundito sauce are bomb. Cheese crisp is just like mama used to make. House made salsas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but seemingly worthy o 4 or 5 stars.  The portions are large and the salsa are pretty good, but beans are out of a can...  if you want a step up from cafeteria food with a mexamerican flare, this is a good choice. They do server beer and wine, but no tequilla so those margs are either beergarita's or winegarita's."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go have Mexican Food.  Love the food but be careful of the margaritas.  They will sneak up on you if you aren't careful. I recommend stopping at 2 :)

Juan and the crew are awesome and they have a great patio!!!"}
{"text":"Caramba's used to be so good!!  So amazing, but unfortunately they have really gone down hill.  The last few times the quality has gotten bad.  To go orders are always wrong.  They get chintzy with sour cream, etc.  When I called today to report an issue with my order, he totally blew me offf & even laughed about it....  I will not be going back because it has gotten so bad!!  I've been eating here since the early 90's but there are much better places to go now."}
{"text":"I'm so excited this just opened here!  Locally owned and been in the valley for ~20+ years, been going to their other locations forever! Food is authentic tasting.  I love their green Chile! Their chips are thin, fresh, and crispy, they have a delicious fresh salsa bar, cute interior decorations, HUGE patio, and nice bar. Their Margaritas are delish!!"}
{"text":"Ate at this place a few days back. The chicken in the fajitas was undercooked, the cook had thrown on a few partly cooked onions, green peppers and completely forgot the tomatos. My order # had not been called so when i went to see what was happening, the cook had missed the order. Trying to hurry the food he had slapped a lid over the chicken to speed up the cooking, this resulted in a tasteless steamed mess that he passed off as fajitas. This is one of the few fast food places that charge you for a soft drink refill. Needless to say, it is a cut above Taco Bell and Del Taco but then it is much more expensive, no 99c tacos or burritos here. My tab for fajitas and a soda was just under $9.  Does not compare to Carolinas especially for the tortillas, these are tasteless at Carambas.  Will NOT be going back  !!!!!"}
{"text":"have to say i have been a mexican food fanatic for over 30 years, have eaten in all kind of mexican restaurants, tablecloths to hole in the walls.  BUT this is a first!!!! i have never had quacamole made with the tops of green onions. if you dont have avocados dont sell something as guacamole. one taste and i threw the whole thing in the garbage. also noticed that carambas charges for refills!!! what a joint. never again, i will go to filibertos before this place. one of my party ordered a bowl of chile and got a bowl (styrofoam) of steamed beef !!!!"}
{"text":"The grilled fish tacos were FAB! Nicely seasoned with fresh crisp cabbage. Great patio! Our new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"A new location to one of my favorite places!!! Fast amazing Mexican food with amazing margaritas and service!! Met the owner and he is a doll!!!"}
{"text":"Fast great food. You order then they call your number when it's ready. Recommend the stuffed quesadilla or Mexican pizza, both great. Never disappointed in their food."}
{"text":"Had 2, 2 tacos combos and 1coke, $18.94!!!! What are these people thinking? Are they joking? It's unreal how these restaurants keep ripping people off, 4 tacos for almost $20 dollars, unreal, this shouldn't be over $12 dollars, if you are unable to provide food at a reasonable price, close and do something else, bc the end will be the same"}
{"text":"Great Margs, grilled fish tacos and salsa. Favorite place to eat fresh mex!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS ASS.... Literally they cook with roaches crawling up the sides of the walls. I've seen the chefs not wash their hands multiple times"}
{"text":"I ordered carryout on a Thursday for lunch and it was ready quite quickly (15 minutes) The meat was cooked through and flavorful. The guacamole was fresh. The salsa tasted a bit watered down but I've never had much of a taste for salsa anyway. They charged me .89¢ for a 2 oz side of guacamole which I thought was a little high but I diddn't consider it a huge ordeal. The dining room is spacious and would be a fun place for a casual dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"This will always be my go to Mexican restaurant! A few of the workers even know me and my coworkers order by heart because we stop in for lunch once and a while. Everything they have tastes very authentic and the prices are great too. Best of all is their salsa!"}
{"text":"BEST Margaritas in AZ! I go here with my crew every weekend Food is always delicious and customer service is awesome"}
{"text":"OOPS! I did it again. I had dinner here again.  Just because the ingredients are fresh doesn't mean the food will taste good. It just doesn't, period. I ordered a different plate. Still untaste worthy.  And I was charged extra for the refill on the drink I washed it all down with. I should have known better!"}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my first time to Caramba! Everyone was extremely friendly here and the food was served so quickly!! Let me add that we were apart of a party size of almost 20 people! That is amazing for a restaurant that has just opened. I ordered a quesadilla and the amount of food you get is so much! I will definitely be back to Caramba before leaving the Phoenix area! Great people, great food! I recommend that if you live or just visiting the Scottsdale area you give Caramba a try for good authentic Hispanic food."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food spot hands down since I was 10 years old.  Pollo Asado burrito is the best and nobody has ever been able to match the flavor and freshness.  All restaurants are great, not just the one on Bell Rd."}
{"text":"First this place is not Cheep. A plate of two small enchaladas and rice is $9.35 with no salsa chips and without a drink. Food wasn't good and way!!! Over Priced!!!! Stay away."}
{"text":"I pass by this place weekly, but it was only my second visit.  I just wanted to pick up a burrito for later.  I'm all about a simple dish, so I got the bean burrito with cheese.  Granted, my family is filled with great cooks, but the beans were so good!  Just a yum dish, I cant wait to try other items.  Just wish place was bigger!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat my portion since there was a huge thick black hair.... ordered the #5 combo.


The carne asada (on the fries) didn't have a lot of flavor. \"Fuego\" hot sauce failed to leave any traces of spicy. Beans were actually tasty. 

Ordered #5 with carne asada, carne asada fries and shrimp ceviche. Hubs didn't care for his fries, said it was so-so. 

Friendly customer service but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? The food was below average and overpriced and there were flies buzzing around the salsa bar.  You have got to go to Carolina's on Cactus Rd. and Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place and the staff. Especially Edgar and Juan ...the new guys and gals are great too  All the staff are always so happy and ready to help with a smile. The cooks always get my food just right. My fave is the mini chimis and the shrimp enchiladas. Been coming here for more than a few years. I love how at the end of the night all the staff help each other to close."}
{"text":"My favorite quick Mexican lunch. The giant carambola is the best value ever. I eat here twice a week for lunch with people from work.

They are quick and the food is great. The only annoying thing is they are kind of skimpy with the salsa. I hate those little jars that you can put 1 chips worth in.

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered the Caramba Nachos, the flavor was good and the it was well served. I usually get the Giant Caramba Burrito and thats definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We have been going since like 1998... kid friendly.  Good food and great price-point.  Excellent margaritas.  Totally recommend going to eat here!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this restaurant!  Great food, great price-point, kid friendly and great margaritas!  It is a must try restaurant.  It isn't fancy, but a great experience.  Friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  We have been going for years... kid friendly, great food, great prices and excellent margaritas.  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is one of my husband's and my favorite places to eat when I'm too tired to cook. If we ever want Mexican food, without hesitation we know we're going to Carambas.

The new staff are great.  Even the old ones were superb.  We always eat at the bar top.  The buy one get one margaritas will put you on your ass!! Served in small plastic Solo cups, these are the perfect end to a Monday. 

I always bring friends and family here.  The manager even made us dessert on the house (tortilla chips with honey sugar and cinnamon--simple and delicious).  

Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Had some great cheese enchiladas last night. We were having family, one who is a vegetarian, over for swim and dinner last night. I wanted something everyone could eat, but I didn't have to turn on my oven, or be in the kitchen while others were swimming. Caramba's was the answer!  I ordered, just a few hours before I wanted to pickup, a tray of 24 cheese enchiladas, thawed out some homemade refried beans, opened a bag of chips, and dinner was on the table!  Will definitely be ordering more tray as summer wears on and I am less inspired to use my oven or heat up my house!  Would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it but I keep having bad experiences here. I used to love Caramba's and have been going to the Bell location since highschool. I got a \"Giant Caramba\" with Machaca yesterday because it was on special. My wife got a machaca burrito and added beans and guac (which is her standard, she's been gonig here off and on forever also).

My burrito was huge, covered with melty cheese and really good red sauce. Sounds good right!?

Unfortunatly, no. My huge burro was 75% tortilla with just a little bit of meat. Seriously. I actually counted 7, YES SEVEN, layers of tortilla on the bottom of my burro. I'm shaking my head in disappointment while writing this.Where's the beef?!

My wife's burro was just as dissappointing. Just a very small portion of meat. When you get a beef burrito, and add beans, they are not supposed to take away beef. It should be the same damn amount of beef with beans ADDED. Again, where's the beef!?!?

I would much rather be at Cafe Rumba on 59th and Union, or, better yet, Caminero on 83rd and Deer Valley, both of which have excellent food at the same (or better) price point. 

I waited a while before deciding to leave a bad review, something I don't like doing. This was my 4th time at this \"new\" location, my 4th time hoping for something to change, and my 4th time dissapointed. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"First visit and was pleasantly surprised. We had a Mexican pizza that was crispy tasty and extremely affordable for 2 people for lunch. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just went in last night again and the whole place reeked of sewage, aargh!!! This issue has been getting progressively worse since we started coming here.  First there was a faint whiff near the restroom doors, and yesterday, I actually smelled it by the front door of the restaurant.  Sorry guys, I won't be back to this location---this isn't a healthy atmosphere to eat in."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here, so I don't think I will be returning to a Caramba restaurant again.

When I went my food was alright. It wasn't very good, but I didn't think it was too bad either. What really turned me off was that one of my friends that went along with me found a bee in her meal. When she took it to the worker he told her it wasn't a bee, but an olive. He finally gave her a new one after trying to unsuccessfully convince her that it was an olive. It was definitely an insect. It bugged me that he didn't even take responsibility for it. After that I didn't really finish my meal, because all I could think about was the bee in my friend's dinner."}
{"text":"I can't believe people like this palce.  In the early 90's my parents use to take me to a different location.  I hated the food and had not been back since 1995.  Recently I was told that this location was much better and the quality was great.  So I decided to give them a try.  Once again the food was horrible.  First off, cheese sauce wtf?? You have signs all over the place about how you make everything fresh.  Why not put real cheese on the nachos?  The beans are probably the worst beans I have ever had! I am from California and Arizona's attempt at mexican food is just sad.  Why waste time and money here.  If you want fake bad mexican food just go to taco bell."}
{"text":"Delicious! Glad to have a new taco place near the Shea 14 theaters. Service at the bar was fast and friendly. Tacos were delish. Cheese crisp was first class. Even tried a margarita....yum. My husband  and I will definitely be back! Menu was extensive with potato tacos and other unique offerings. Plus brunch on the weekends. Oh and the salsa bar with six fresh choices was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Meh!  Shared the carambas nachos.  What a soggy mess!!  Wet shredded beef ruined the chips...then that's topped with more wet nacho cheese.  Flavor was ok but...seems to lack salt in their guac and salsa.  Not my bag baby!

After a little reflection...I bumped them up to 3 stars.  The patio area and bar are nice.  Makes up for the lackluster food."}
{"text":"How could you not love Caramba's?  The food is always fresh and delicious, the staff are always friendly, and the drinks are always strong :)  I can't pick a favorite, it's either the giant beef caramba or chicken salpicon.  Oh or the chicken fundido or beef tacos.  Actually, I've never had anything I didn't like at Carambas.  I'm happy they're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best Margarita for your $! Tacos are amazing. My hubs likes the Giant Caramba. 
We visit here a couple times a month for lunches, as you're in and out in no time."}
{"text":"I have only ventured to this restaurant on two occasions...the first was on suggestion from Pastor Paul Wilson and then tonight when Kristi and I were checking out places to eat.

Caramba's menu is very simple, but offers a wide selection.  I chose a combination with a taco, tostado and tamale. When the food came out, it covered two plates. Needless to say, even with my heavy appetite, I struggled to everything.

Kristi ordered a beef chimi...nothing special, but very filling as well. The big compliment came at the temperature of the food that came out. Everything was hot, and definitely was prepared fresh.

This is a great place to stop in for a quick bite or bring in the family for a meal.

Kristi and I spent like $20 and left full.

The one thing that was a little weird...the charge for drink refills."}
{"text":"Great little joint in N Phoenix by I17 and Bell. Very reasonable prices and great food! Try the different salsa and sit on the patio !!!"}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly, I was disappointed with the shredded beef burrito, not a lot of flavor but the fresh salsa was very good. My wife had the chicken rolled tacos, which with the salsa is very addictive. We've gone twice in the last two weeks just for those alone."}
{"text":"The service and food prep was quick and it was really good.  It was the first time I had eaten here and I loved it!  From the salsa and chips to the fundido I had.  I like this place better than most if not all the Mexican food places I have eaten.  I will definitely be back.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Caramba's a couple of times hoping the experience would be different at different locations. I have to say, the food is awful. Everything seems to be smothered in a red sauce which does nothing for the food. Caramba is the epitome of disgusting, bland Mexican food"}
{"text":"Tacos are yummy! The people are always friendly! I go for lunch and I get my food in plenty of time to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Fast, friendly service. I plan to go back"}
{"text":"When I think of authentic, amazing Mexican food I think of Caramba (and then drool a little). I moved to the east coast 5 years ago but still dream about this place. Everytime I fly back to Phoenix to visit my parents I make a stop at this place. I don't even go home to drop off my bags. There's just no time.

I've been going to the Bell road location for years and have always been a loyal customer. I was very happy to find out they had opened a nicer location even closer to my parent's house.

Everything on the menu is delicious, but I always end up ordering the beef taco combo. The shredded beef, cripsy taco shell, topped with the cheese/ lettuce/ tomato combo is the most heavenly thing I have ever tasted. 

If anything this restaurant has jaded me forever. No mexican food on the east coast will ever measure up! I miss you every day Carambas."}
{"text":"Never got a bad meal here. It's very fresh and tasty.  Margaritas are delicious and strong.  You won't get a lot of ambiance here,  but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I have to agree, I love the salsa bar. They actually got me hooked on chipotle sauces. Everything I've ordered from the menu has been fabulous. The kitchen area is open so you can actually watch them make everything fresh - no heat lamps here! I would really highly recommend at least one visit - then you'll have to keep going back!"}
{"text":"If you want fast fresh no thrills very affordable fast Mexican food this is a great place. I love the breakfast burritos served all day. The Mexican pizzas are delicious as well. They have a great salsa bar with many options. We have eaten in and gotten take out. Even on a Friday night they had our order ready for pick up within 15 minutes. The margaritas are very reasonable and very delicious."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in AZ. Good price and great taste."}
{"text":"Eaten here at least 20 times and ive never left feeling any type of regret.  The food is hot and fresh and its easy to tell that everyone working there are content and have a good attitude.  A pet peeve of mine is that i dont enjoy going to a place where I know that the people behind the counter hate life and could care less about what kind of experience the customer has.  This is not that place.  Ive had random conversations with the manager and he is friendly, capable and intelligent.  The food is great too.  Anytime im in the area this is the go to spot."}
{"text":"I had the huevos rancheros with egg whites and man did they taste great! I love the flavor in the food the only thing I would suggest is to make the salsas a bit thicker. Most of the ones I tried were a bit watery but still flavored well! I will be back soon for more"}
{"text":"I really can't say anything bad about this place. Visit  any evening, it is a packed local favorite. Food is good, consistent at all locations I've visited (5 of 6). If you feel lost by the menu, here are a few items to try the following- pollo fundido, chicken is delicious, sauce has a nice bite/ can't do wrong with flautas or taquitos/ green chile/ caramba chicken salad/ cheese crisp/ tacos. Their desserts will satisfy your sweet tooth well. Don't miss the salsa bar! Nice patio if the weather is agreeable but adjacent to the Walmart parking lot and Union Hills."}
{"text":"Caramabas has always been a place I wanted to enjoy, but they always come up short. I came in for lunch and was looking at the menu. I was greeted a minute later by someone asking what I wanted. I asked for just a minute as I was looking at the menu and the cashier was annoyed. I quickly ordered a #14 2 tamales with enchilada sauce. When my order came out I got 1 tamale and 1 enchilada. What I ordered was 2 beef tamales, but instead I got a cheese enchilada and a terrible attempt at a tamale that lacked any meat. To top it off refills at the self serve machine are $.25. No thank you. Keep it, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My family usually enjoys eating here. However, the young lady with the color dyed hair, always has an attitude. Last night we watched as she was more interested in talking to her friends at the bar, than helping paying customers. She was talking over the customers to her friends. She was very rude. Unfortunately this is not the first time seeing her lol this. I will only go there now if the gentleman is working. Otherwise, if she is there I won't go back."}
{"text":"I am so so happy that they opened a Carambas by my house! I grew up going to the Phoenix location. They have amazing food- super fast, very filling, and great customer service. The green chili burritos and crunchy tacos were delicious. Cute atmosphere and very nice, large patio with plenty of seating! Can't say enough good things about this quick, easy, delicious restaurant if it's Mexican food you're craving!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for some food. It isn't going to come out looking like some sort of award winning meal, but it will be good. Definitely chose this place over Filbertos or Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Simple fast and good food.  Order, pay, eat and leave.  It's really kind of refreshing and then you get guality food in addition. It's kind of a no brainer. Affordable and good portion sizes as well.  The service is actually pretty nice too."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!!!! We had a strawberry margarita (I would have ordered another one if it wasn't noon), the street tacos were delicious and the enchiladas were phenomenal! The service here is helpful and upbeat! Nothing beats drinking margaritas outside with great Mexican food! HIGLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"ain't nothing to write home about, although I have heard that the margaritas are great.. maybe I should have had 3 or 4 before eating.. don't get me wrong, this wasn't horrible, but it didnt leave me with an underwhelming desire to return, either.."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant! My family tried a few different menu items including the chimichanga, shrimp burrito, fish taco, fajitas, and Mexican flan. They were all so good and so reasonable! I'm not sure how they manage to make such high quality food for such inexpensive prices. 

The owner and staff were so helpful and gave me free chips because of the wait (it was a super busy Friday night but the wait wasn't actually too bad). I would definitely recommend this place! Good quality seafood and meats, delicious salsa, and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"It is funny the best places always have the lowest number of Yelp reviews...  And those places with hundreds of reviews usually suck.

Look the Caramba isn't 5 bucks anymore, last time I went it is 6 and change now, but still not 7 bucks.  But I still eat here.   This place is so good I take people here from California when they come out to visit us.    This place is so good I swear everytime I eat here all of Glendale Fire Dept is eating here.  EVERY DAMN TIME. hahahahaha  Trust those guys.  They know what is good.

This is Tex Mex food as good as it gets and they serve you big.    I never was still hungry after eating here."}
{"text":"This last time we got the \"big caramba,\" which is a beef burro, served enchilada style. It certainly was big. I'll give them that. I swear the tortillas they used were 2 feet across, and they used two of them for each burro. 

But it was so bland and goopy. This was actually confirmation of what I've experienced the last few visits. It seems their food has gotten more flavorless and sloppy."}
{"text":"Breakfast pizza with bacon and red menudo got the morning off to a delicious start. Had to keep close to the house so I got the food to go. When we do not have time to do a fancy brunch this place fits the bill for quick breakfast that is not too heavy."}
{"text":"had a business casual lunch planned at the stir fry which was next door to Carambas (was as the stir fry is now closed)  We decided to go to Carambas and it was disgusting. I had two carne asada tacos and a side of rice. The meat tasted spoiled and the rice was sick.  If this was not bad enough there was a fly that kept buzzing both of us- most likely could not resist the bad meat that sat on my plate. Stay away from this place and save your money."}
{"text":"I grew up in the East Valley, but my best friend and her family are from Peoria. For years, I heard about the food and margaritas at Carambas, so when my husband and I came to visit over New Year's, we had to go. 

I loved it. The atmosphere is laid-back and unassuming, and perfect for the price point offered. The $3.25 margarita is better than many served at the larger restaurants for upwards of $7, and the salsa bar is fresh and tasty.  Although other reviewers take issue with the $.25 refill policy, I was more than happy to dole out a couple of quarters. In this economy, I am grateful for the large portions and cheap prices at Caramba's. Perhaps Phoenicians are spoiled with the \"free refill\" policy at so many places, but after years of living elsewhere, I have an appreciation for a smaller business that is keeping its doors open and prices down as well as respect for a small $.25 instead of the higher $.50 and $.75 found in other major cities. 

I ordered the enchilada, chicken taco combo with rice and beans, and I couldn't believe the price for the amount of food, let alone the great quality. My husband, who is a life long vegetarian, enjoyed how many options he had, and on our second trip to Caramba's he even attempted the Giant Caramba done vegetarian style!

After 5 years in Seattle, my mind had built up a shrine to good Mexican food, and Caramba's delivered. If I travel back to Phoenix, even if I'm staying on the other side of town, I will definitely be making the trip out to Glendale. My only regret is that I didn't get to try the cheese crisps...Next time!!"}
{"text":"This place was so busy , well no wonder it was delicious . The staff was friendly but the food was outstanding . Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had"}
{"text":"Just average. Tortillas were hard. Carne asada on the chewy side. Food on the dry side. Burrito was good. Bee issue if you are sitting outside."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast & ordered the breakfast enchiladas. They were VERY awesome! I thought it was also interesting that even though we went in for breakfast that we still got free chips & salsa from the salsa bar. Also, another 5 star worthy attribute is the fact that they serve breakfast all day long.

I enjoyed my breakfast with a refreshing large horchata. I could tell it was from a mix, but it was still very good."}
{"text":"Had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo; the taco, rice and enchilada were good, would go back for those. The chips were cold and had no salt, or any FLAVOR. Hot sauce was good. Cashier was civil enough, but failed to say thank you when I paid, which is especially grating because I included a 15% tip. Next time I won't bother. We wait on ourselves anyways in this type of place. Might go back. Master Taco is good too, and closer to my home."}
{"text":"When I first came to the Valley a few years ago I had my first Caramba. I ordered the  shredded beef caramba burrito, It was amazing and so until I moved here every time would visit I would want to stop by.  For a while it was the best deal in town, but they kept slowly increasing their prices, from the best deal in town (5 bucks!!) to not so much and on top of that they have gotten stingier with meat leaving me with a burrito with more tortilla than beef.  I also don't like that they charge 25 cents to refill your soda. So that's why I knocked them two stars good place to eat if your in the area but not worth the drive anymore for me"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for good food. It has a full bar and food is yummy. I look for cleanliness, friendliness and good food. Caramba has it all!"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here.

I found hair in my food.  Went I went to bring it to the attention of management a 20 something year old \"mgr\" was at the front register.  All I got from his was a bad attitude and him saying \"did you ever stop to consider that the hair is yours?\"  That would be hard seeing that the hair I found was black.  I do not have black hair.  The numerous cooks and people that they have working behind the counter have black hair.  

Needless to say I will never patronize this establishment ever again.  The \"mgr\" completely ruined any chance of recovery and his attitude was absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"The chicken and shrimp tacos are really good. They also have a good variety of fresh salsas that had great flavor. I've been coming to Carambas for years and have never been let down."}
{"text":"I rate Mexican restaurants by their refried beans; these were not good, the taste and texture reminded me of canned.  But, the beef taco and the carnitas burrito were good.  The cheese enchilada, not so good.  And the \"nachos with cheese\" are chips with \"nacho sauce\" that tastes canned, YUCK!"}
{"text":"Thought I would check out a new restaurant (to me) while I waited for the movie to start!  Delicious food!  Excellent, friendly service!  Clean and spacious interior with a great patio!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i thought this place blew. big chunks. However, my wife, being the native Arizonan LOOOVES it. Thus, i would have to endure many unsatisfying dinners here while she delighted in mini chimis and bean and cheese burrito. I tried in vain to find ANYTHING on the menu i could tolerate. Any combination of food, be it chicken (always dry), steak (horrible, the kind of steak that is grade D, but edible) was awful and the ground beef? You know where i am going here. 

.25 for refills? What kind of communist/socialist refill-depriving monsters run this place? 

And then, like moses parting the sea, the Taco Al Pastor arrived. Served traditionally, with cilantro, chopped onion and a lime wedge, tender adobo marinated pork and proper non cold tortillas. My advice? scrap the whole menu, and just serve Al Pastor. Get a spit outside on your patio and make them 100% authentic. Until then, i now can actually eat something on their menu, and its magical. Perhaps, this is what my wife feels with the mini chimis she so loves...naturally, i think they are dry, unimaginative and bland.

Stick with the Al Pastors. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Prices were very reasonable. Food however was not all that great. Mediocre-at-best. And I'm not sure why the salsas are touted as being really good. They seemed kind of bland overall. We went there because the reviews were so great. Not sure if they were having an off night or if the reviewers just don't really know good food. Feeling disappointed but full."}
{"text":"I recently came back to Carambas for lunch.  We ordered a carne asada quesadilla, Caramba Nachos, green chile burrito, bean and cheese kids meal with rice and beans, and horchatas.

The bill came out to 44 bucks with a tip.  Not bad for the amount of food we were given.  Unfortunately, the kids meal didn't come with a drink which is a bit of a rip off but what are you going to do let your child die of thirst in the desert?

Hit up the salsa bar while waiting for our order.  They have about 6 or 8 salsas you can try out for free.  They were all decent but lacking heat and spices in my book. 

Food came out and it was pretty good.  The carne asada quesadilla was probably the best.  So huge it came on a pizza pie tray.  Would have been nice to have some sour cream and guac with it.  

The nachos were probably the low point of all the food.  Shredded meat and nacho cheese sauce drowned any prayer of biting into a crunchy tortilla chip.  

The green chile burrito had a good flavor but would have been better if the shredded beef was cubed and cooked down to a nice tender green chile like chunk the the rest of the green chile world would recognize.  The shredded beef was tough and needed to absorb more chile flavor.

All and all this place deserves a 3 as it is okay.  While I wouldn't strongly recommend it to others it is far better than a one star review."}
{"text":"It's really not a bad place for a chain . I have ordered the chimis and street tacos and they have all been good. Usually the place isn't busy and you can get right in and out. Large menu, and for people on special diets, they have menu items created for them. Nice staff quick service."}
{"text":"The pork and pineapple tacos are the bomb! Avoid the ceviche as it's bland and the shrimp are fishy. Bar tender is the only one n who speaks English and is overwhelmed so be nice too her."}
{"text":"I LOVE Caramba! I usually come here a few Friday's a month with my family. Excellent margs; but only drink two! They're STRONG! Great selection of salsas."}
{"text":"Tastes like microwave Mexican food, not so good. Sucks I had to pay $15 to find that out.  Hopefully next time I visit the food will taste alot  fresher than what they claim to sell"}
{"text":"I like coming to this place. It's bright inside with good amount of seats. Has a couple TVs and Bar. I've only orders the Carna Asada burrito. They give you chips for free which is nice and they have a good salsa bar. The salsas are good I just wished it was a little bit more tasty and different. The music just kills me I know it's a Mexican place so they put Spanish songs or whatever but I just don't like it while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. They can put some Instrumental music or something like that from the Spanish country. Also the workers are very bad with customer service. Not one time do they ask you anything which is very bad. That's why it's a 4 star."}
{"text":"Their slogan \"where you dont peso much\" is a joke.  7 bucks for  a carne asada burrito is definitely over pe'ing.  Especially when the tortilla tastes worse than a store bought one and is only filled half way with meat and the rest is just the bad tasting tortilla.

Reluctantly had a to go order this weekend and don't plan on going back.  I have read their food is all fresh and everything is homemade but I have never been a fan of their food or prices and this last trip certainly didn't win me over."}
{"text":"For fast food it was very good.  Workers were very pleasant. Sat outside and had a nice relaxing meal.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Caramba Super Nachos-  Before my nachos were even ready, I was really digging on their chips.  They are thin, crispy and pretty darn delicious.  I soon realized that these were HORRIBLE chips for nachos though.  They were too thin and broke apart way too easily.  These nachos were topped with the usual toppings like cheese, beans, pico, sour cream, guacamole etc.  They came with 2 types of cheese....shredded and nacho.  I'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos.  I prefer just shredded cheese.  The nacho cheese tasted ok though so it wasn't nasty.  The chips were really a killer though.  I probably only had about 5-10 chips that I could actually scoop stuff up with.  The rest of the chips were too flimsy, broke in half, or were covered with toppings.  I gave up pretty quick and grabbed my fork, mixed everything together and ate it like it was a nacho salad.  The chicken they use is a little funky too.  I'm pretty sure its boiled.  It didn't have much flavor and was too \"wet\".  I picked around most of it.

Overall, not the least bit impressed.  I doubt I am coming back to try out any of their other offerings.  It wasn't gross/disgusting food, and I did eat most of the nachos,  but for the price and taste, I will be heading elsewhere in the future.

It was my hubby's first visit here. He had a Caramba's chicken burrito. Smothered in enchilada sauce. He added rice and beans. He said the rice and beans were the best part and announced that we would never be coming here again."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible service. Terrible watery chicken in their quesadilla. $7.75 for water logged chicken and cheese. GROSS!

Wait staff does not seem to appreciate their patrons. At all. 

Tried to give them another chance. They blew that too. The cashier ignored my presence when I tried to simply order a bean burrito to replace the disgusting chicken. 

Do NOT waste your hard earned $ here."}
{"text":"This is a great add to the neighborhood.  Self serve (incl beverages) or service from the bartender.  The patio is wonderful.  Really friendly staff.   Salsa bar and comp chips.  Since it can be self service we just hang out after dinner.  There are TVs inside and out so catching a game works nicely.  The food is good and simple just like home made."}
{"text":"I usually like to give a specific recommendation on what to try at places but that's just impossible because everything is so darn good at Carambas"}
{"text":"Caramba's is one of my favorite local chains. Grew up going to the 67th and Bell location and now go to the 23rd and Bell location. My personal favorite is the Pollo Fundido. The rice and beans are excellent as well. I also recommend the Mexican Pizza."}
{"text":"Cafeteria line ordering but fabric napkin and tablecloth food.  This chain is budget and family-friendly but serves up consistently great food.  As a newcomer to Arizona 20 years ago, a friend introduced us to Caramba in Old Town Glendale and I've been a fan ever since.  Their Mexican Pizza, Fundido and tacos are standouts."}
{"text":"The bad news (I guess) is I have to keep coming back on the chance I might run into that hawt (tm) blonde again...  I let her get away. (Sad face).  She told me about the fried ice cream..."}
{"text":"This place was recommended, and we have been going back ever since the first time. My husband likes the the beef fajitas and I like the the mini chicken chimichangas."}
{"text":"Better than most fast Mexican food, with a huge serving. Had beef burrito enchilada style.  (I know, not my usual attempt at healthy eating.) I am reminded why I don't eat this way anymore.   Bland and not a good feeling afterwards.  It was a moment of weakness.  One and done."}
{"text":"I liked nothing about this place. The cheese enchiladas were not good, the tacos were soggy, and I'm pretty sure the chips and salsa were from the Walmart across the parking lot. The woman who took our order was pretty rude, and many of the tables were dirty. The only reason I'm giving a second star is because the service was fast."}
{"text":"Just ordered 15 different lunch combos and burritos for a company meeting everyone's food was correct and good.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"All of the Caramba restaurants are great, but this one is our favorite.  Fresh ingredients, great inexpensive \"high test\" Margaritas, friendly staff, and a nice full service bar.  Favorite dish is \"death by flavor\" . . . ask Jake the bartender about his special creation.  Other favorites are Tacos de Pastor, chicken stuffed quesadilla, chicken fundido burrito, machca beef and avocado on a flour tortilla, and a cheese crisp covered in machca beef.  Lots of big screen TVs to watch Diamondbacks, Cardinals, Coyotes, and Suns games; plus an outdoor patio that has a high pressure misting system to keep you cool."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast, and nice people! Easy ordering experience, sat outside, and enjoyed delicious food plus the fun flavors of complimentary salsa at the salsa bar. No frills - old school looking menu/price signs, basic furnishings inside and on patio, and located in strip mall so not much ambiance. For what we were looking for, perfect! 2 kids, 2 adults, and grandma were all happy for lunch here."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food.  Nothing overly special, but edible.  Good lunch prices."}
{"text":"Very casual with great food, service and prices. Sports bar venue as well and very fun."}
{"text":"Way to expensive.  Paid 22.00 for 7 small tocos and one drink.   I mean small street tacos.   OH AND THE OWNER TAKES THE TIPS FOR HIMSELF.    So please dont tip on your credit cards or put money in the jar cause the owner is only getting richer.  Please tip the employees directly thanking them for the service."}
{"text":"They give you generous portions and have healthy options. I ordered the cheese enchiladas combo, which came with rice and beans. It tasted good, but it was too greasy. The horchata was way too sweet. My husband loves this place so next time I'll get something healthier."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and friendly. The food was really good. Fast service! The chips are delicious they have several salsa options."}
{"text":"This service was really good here.  Super nice. The food was really good and fresh tasting. I love the sauces and everything about this place. Pepsi products instead of coke is the only downside. Not a big deal, since I'm going to order the margaritas anyway! The margaritas are cheap and solid. Nothing to write home about, but not terrible with all kinds of sour mix ruining the flavor. I will be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Love the rolled taquitos and giant caramba. Defiantly affordable, service is spotty sometimes but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Good food and great drink selections! We sat at the open bar next to the patio. Perfect place to sit  on a beautiful day! Great customer service! Lawson at the bar was awesome!"}
{"text":"We visit Caramba's almost every Saturday night after church. We love the food there! Super fresh and great prices! We almost always get the Mexican pizza with shredded beef, taquitos, and have had the Giant Caramba many times. All are really good. The free chips with your order and fresh salsa bar are also a great plus. 

My only complaint with the restaurant is that the tables and chairs are really uncomfortable, hard to move to accommodate larger parties, and just plain ugly. If the seating were better I would give them 5 stars.

But obviously, since we visit almost weekly, the food is better than the decor!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and great service! The atmosphere is relaxing and fun! incredible food with eye popping flavor"}
{"text":"Food is not too bad.  We had the Fish Tacos Baja Style & Chicken Tacos. I wish the Fish was more crispy."}
{"text":"For a quick fix for mexican food I love Caramba.
I aways get the Pollo Fundido and cheese crisp. This time I added the the Caramba special  - a ginormous burrito to eat the next day.
As usual, it was good.
The restaurant is always clean. Generic sterile looking interior. Staff is always friendly too."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place...it's awesome! The staff is incredibly friendly and we absolutely love the margaritas and sangria. They have a great little patio area and the food NEVER disappoints. Also, I love their salsa bar, everything is so fresh! We come here all the time for the margaritas and friendly smiles, thanks!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and solid food options.  It's counter service primarily and the seating is open air. They play great music at a comfortable volume. The bar area is a fun hangout and the entire staff is very friendly 

I had the shrimp burrito which was very good. My wife ordered the Calamba Special Tostada. The chicken on it was OK, but everything else was very good.

We shared 2 margaritas.  I'd definitely recommend getting them from the bar instead of ordering at the front. Our 2nd one was much tastier and the bartenders are experts after all!

The value for the food is first rate.  This is a definite dine again!"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic and consistent Mexican food. Love it. Never disappoints!!  Try their cheese enchiladas with fried eggs on top. As good as it gets for this Texas transplant."}
{"text":"My husband and I just love their food and the people there. We have never had anything that we disliked. We especially love their tortillas. So amazing. I also love their fresh salsa bar#"}
{"text":"So good I actually have their number programmed in my phone.

No more taco hell... I go to Caramba's!

This is fast food mexican that doesn't even taste like fast food... and it's not the \"____berto's\" chain.

Home grown here in Glendale, AZ, the taste in their burritos, pollo fundido, tacos and even rice and beans is flipping AWESOME.  Chips and salsa your thing? They have a whole salsa bar that is fresh made.

You walk in to a clean restaurant filled with mexican decor touched with a dash of beer signs.

You can eat in or take out... again, it is a fast food place so you do have to deal with the kids and crap, but the restaurant can't help that.

Love the slogan... where you don't \"peso\" much.

 Great for when you just get off work, dying of hunger, call them up, order your favorite tacos, walk in, pay, grab and go home."}
{"text":"***No bueno.

The spinach enchiladas I didnt 'peso' much for, came out looking like Enchiladas  Benedict. I dont know what was on top, but it appeared to be poached eggs. 

My friend paid for the meal and I was trying to be courtesy and eat some of it. 
Little did I know I would be vomiting chunky spinach 3 hours later. 

I ate corn nuts, carmel corn and even pasta with Alfredo sauce AFTER I ate at Caramba but none of that came out when I spewed. How does that occur?

Only the spinach and cheese from yummy Caramba was left floating in the porcelain bowl."}
{"text":"Honest review? 




One of the best Mexican food places I've been to. It is not number one - but it comes in second. And that says a lot. To find quality tacos are rare but I have never been disappointed with this place. 

I've been coming here since I was a little girl and my favorite thing to get since being a teenager is two beef tacos, rice and beans. The best plate of food I can ever eat. I love it so much and the quickness it takes to make it on top of the quality freshness in the physical food is beyond delicious!

I come here often because the food is incredible, the people are so nice, and the interior is organized! It's never not filled with people and I know why!"}
{"text":"Taco salad...on le iceberg letters three pieces of chicken for $6.95? We are not coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love it when a place is fast food and doesn't taste like it. 

Carambas is my go to when I need a quick Mexican food fix without killing my wallet. 

Pollo Fundido is great, the salsas are awesome and put together from scratch. 

What's even cooler is that they have a little mini bar at this location.  The other locations don't have that from what I've seen.

Love it that they are home grown too."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with unfriendly service. Restaurant was dirty. Tables were left unbussed and one of the workers decided that fixing the door in the middle of the lunch rush with a drill for 30 minutes was a good idea.  First time...and last time."}
{"text":"Good Mexican joint. It's fried-up quick service grub, but a real step above the 'bertos and 'betos. Somehow, the food is fresher and tastier. 

Get whatever combo or quesadilla suits your fancy, and dig in at the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Menudo was perfect not greasy at all and tasted wonderful.  All of other food was perfect and good.  Great place for your money."}
{"text":"I know 5 stars RIGHT?  Well that is just how good their #2 combo dinner with chicken really tastes.  The dinner comes with a bowl of chips, two beef or chicken tacos, mexican rice and refried beans.  The tacos are so good that now I order one extra chicken taco when I go to eat.  The prices seem very fair, the wait staff is very friendly and courteous and they keep their tables nice and clean.  When we go out for mexican food 9 out of 10 times we go here.  THANK YOU CARAMBA'S for another great dinner."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  This was just okay.  I was craving mexican food so I sent my hubby here, I told him to get me the mini chimichangas with the queso sauce on the side.  Well, they DID put the queso sauce on the side but it was ice cold. Blech. I tried a bit & it tasted like a mayonnaise sauce. DEF not my cup of tea.  Luckily I ordered a side (errr, extremely tiny) of guacamole which helped save the chimis.  They were pretty flavorful but so unbelievably greasy.  The bottom of the carton was just covered in grease. I started to feel sick to my stomach after the fist mini chimi due to the amount of grease.  The beans & rice were very tasty & I loved the guacamole.  We will come back but next time I won't be getting anything fried."}
{"text":"This is a great place for grilled fish tacos! I have cravings for them once in a while and they are always the best in town! Staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"They made a very good chili relleno in egg batter that was delicious and different.  The tripe menudo was a toned down version for white folks  as it lacked flavor.  The free chips and salsa  were both good.  Good for families."}
{"text":"In town for one night. Came across this little hole in the wall restaurant. Clean. Food was decent. Not a lot of flavor but the portions were large. I really had been craving a good tamale. I got a so-so tamale. 
The salsa bar was incredible!!! Very good."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is pretty good and it's a good value. But how come no napkins in the dining room? I also might encourage management to wash and/or replace the plastic bowls they use for chips."}
{"text":"Service was good and the establishment was clean and in order. Outside seating was nice today due to the breeze and sunset with 78 degree weather. Food was not that great. Rice was ok and the beans taste like the refried beans from the can. It's really hard to find authentic food and almost every Mexican restaurant is labeled as authentic. Me and my family was not a big fan of it, but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurant .you know when your order a taco its going to be a taco not some chef's idea of a taco. My favorites are the shredded beef. Fresh grated cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and savory beef, and yes the taco shell is freshly fried not one of the package kind. The prices are fair and don't break the bank account. It's a great family restaurant"}
{"text":"Great fresh food.always consistant. Family and wallet friendly. Surprises me when people comment on the food being cold. You have  two chefs literally making it ,putting it on a plate and calling your number. If it's  cold,the client must not have gone up and gotten their food when called."}
{"text":"I had 2 Carne Asada tacos and 1 margarita.  Amazing food and drink.  I wanted to have a second margarita but was afraid I might have to call a cab, that's how good they are!"}
{"text":"I love their stuffed chicken quesadillas!! That's what I get every time! They have really strong margaritas too for less than $5! They added the bar seating area so it's more restaurant feel rather than fast food place. My friends have ordered things like burritos, fajitas, enchiladas and tacos and they always say how good their food was. I love their chips too as its thin and crispy but not salty."}
{"text":"Best Margs EVER!!! Seriously. Cheap beer, great fresh food. Always here, always margaritas :-P"}
{"text":"Carambas has been a favorite go-to for years for our family.  We eat here often, and it's always quick, tasty, and clean. We used to go to 67th and Bell location, but love having them closer at 83rd and Union Hills.  The mini chimis with fondido sauce is amazing! My husband loves the giant caramba. We often will go just to get breakfast burritos as well, they are served all day!"}
{"text":"I get cravings for mexican food. Like a pregnant woman who needs pickles and ice cream, I need my enchiladas with green sauce or else I get cranky. 

I've been everywhere around this area and Carambas is the best. It's quick, inexpensive, and delicious. Try it."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 18 years! This is one of our favorite go-to places to eat. The food is always fantastic and I've never had anything I don't like, and to be honest I've tried almost everything on the menu. It's quick, the employees are great, and my food is always good. And the margaritas are very good! I will always come back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. Food is always great. I recommend the super nachos with extra beef. So much food you can barely eat it all. Wife always gets the cheese crisp with machaca beef. It's wonderful. Also the service is perfect."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier to report that for those of us who eat a low-carb high-fat diet (Keto, in our case - maybe Adkins or Paleo for others), there are now 'Naked Burritos' in the menu.
The contents of a burrito on a plate with sour cream and guacamole on the side. I ordered a Machaca Naked Burrito with added Fundido sauce and while I didn't calculate the calories or macros it felt perfect for a Friday night dinner."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for this place. Not only is it bomb mexican food, but they are fast, and efficient. Been here 100 times (im here twice a week, how havent i reviewed before?) they've only messed up my order once-which they fixed in 30 seconds. The margaritas are strong, one will definitely get you buzzed so be careful. They have a salsa bar that has some great salsa and hot sauce. I have nothing bad to say about carambas. The location on bell has a full bar, but this one just has a small bar seating area that only offers beer, wine, and margaritas. Skip the beer and wine, order a marg. Thank me later. I usually spend about 15 bucks here, and that's including a marg that gets the job done."}
{"text":"Best in the West!! What can I say I am from California and this Mexican food is the best Arizona has to offer. Authentic and hand made genuine Mexican delights. The margaritas are awesome too. I could eat here every day.  Support small local small business owners in AZ!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! This is my favorite Mexican place in the valley. The best salsa ever. Convenient locations. Super fast. Every thing I've ever ordered is great :)"}

{"text":"We love Caramba's. I'm vegan and there are several things I can eat with minor modifications. The roasted salsa is so good I've dreamt about it. Service is fast, friendly, and the restrooms are always clean. Oh! And the prices are great! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and a drink on a whim. We were looking for a place to sit to eat and have a good margarita. All of the other Mexican joints seemed to be a walk up order fast food type (which this place is as well) but if you sit at the bar you can order food and get your drinks, best of both worlds. After a hard days work sometimes you just want to be served... it was one of those days! The food was great, and the drinks hit the spot. I ordered the chicken taco & enchilada combination plate, and my husband ordered the guacamole to start along with the chicken burrito. My husband ordered a jalapeño margarita and a Cadillac margarita, both very strong, they don't skimp on the booze. I ordered a spicy mango margarita with all lime juice instead of sweetened mix, it was yummy!!! Our bartender Adam was patient as we arrived close to their closing time. He was friendly and conversational and didn't make us feel rushed. To top it off our bill for 3 drinks, an app, and 2 entrees was under $40!! We'll be back next time we're in the area for sure!!"}
{"text":"First time here, pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food is, and at reasonable prices. \"Where you don't peso much\" gave us a chuckle.  Ordered at the counter, ready rather quickly.  We were also happy to see menu suggestions for low carb diets- naked burritos. I ate the chicken fajita naked burrito. Excellent. It was rather chilly inside, temperature wise. As I was leaving I noticed that the thermometer was 62 degrees.  That doesn't work for most of us.  Still would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"BEST margaritas, relaxing atmosphere that makes me feel like I'm on a beach vacation, fun & friendly bartenders, & decent food. My favorite place to go have a few drinks at."}
{"text":"I used to love coming there to get my burrito fix as their food is way better and fresher than of the \"Bertos\" but lately it's gone down hill in way of service and food. Last time the food was way over salted but I let it slide. Today my burrito was just sloppily rolled with air pockets all throughout and I couldn't even see any chicken till I almost finished it. I only ever order the pollo asado burrito so I can't speak for other dishes on the menu. Whoever runs this place needs to be fired and have all new people come in. It's also not as clean as it used to be. I don't care if service isn't that friendly, I just want my food and my food done right but if you're somebody who cares about great service then this is not the place for you!"}
{"text":"Caramba Fresh Mexican Food would ordinarily get four stars from me but their recent increase in prices have really turned me away.

My family and I have been eating here off and on since the late 90's.  We love their cheese crisp and the bean and cheese burrito smothered with enchilada cheese sauce.  Their complimentary chips and salsa are great as well.

Their margaritas are the bomb and rest assure you will leave with a buzz !

Great place to grab a bite to eat.  Not the best mexican food.  This is more a fast food type place not a sit down restaurant enjoy a nice meal kinda of place.

Great place to hang out.  Have a great meal.  Drink margaritas !

Customer service is the best !"}
{"text":"Food is okay, but when you order five meals to go you expect that salsa would be considered complementary,  however it's not and when you ask for it they give you this tiny little container that holds a teaspoon or two, and if you ask for a bigger container they say no you need to purchase it.  Sometimes it's the small stuff that sets you apart from the rest and in this case the food is not much different than the rest and the service is all together less than good..."}
{"text":"Great meal on Cinco de Mayo, outside on side patio, where it was much quieter than either inside or on main patio where musician was entertaining.  We appreciate having a place where we can converse during our meal!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to their shredded beef tacos! Their machaca beef melts in your mouth, everything I've eaten here is delicious. They are one of the very few restaurants in the area that consistently get perfect scores from the health board. Check it out on maricopa.gov, it's made me think twice about eating out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The fish taco was fantastic and my boyfriend had the fundido burrito and he loved it. Ask for extra cream sauce. The cheese crisps are GREAT, and customer service is on point.  Also if you plan on having more than half a margarita plan on taking a cab!"}
{"text":"Best cheap margarita in town!! I love the Strawberry Mango blended. 

The food here is always fresh and full of flavor. I love the salsa bar where I can try a different flavors. 

If your hungary this is the place to go. From quesadillas served on pizza trays to the Giant Caramba burrito smothered in red sauce. It doesn't get much better then this. This is the first place I have had fundido sauce served cold, but it works well with the hot chimi's."}
{"text":"Great little fast food place. They don't use any lard in any of their food or animal products in the rice. I ordered a veggie taco with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato. Each order comes with chips and they have numerous salsas to choose from on their salsa bar. I ordered a single taco which came wrapped in two corn tortillas. It was so full I was actually able to make two tacos! They offer wheat, corn, and flour tortillas to suit dietary needs and preferences. Thanks for being VEGAN friendly!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars. DO NOT EAT HERE!! I got HORRIBLE food poisoning from here. I didn't know of Yelp a year ago when I got it to write a review. It had to have been from the tomatoes in the salsa bar, because my coworker got the same thing as me but different salsa."}
{"text":"If you want fried ice cream come to Caramaba because it was the best fried ice cream I have ever had in Arizona!! Perfect for a sweet tooth! I highly recommend Caramba Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"The service is always good and the food is good to. Great for a quick meal when out and about, but maybe not a destination when craving authentic mexican cuisine. Would be nice if the kept the salsa bar cleaner or maybe served it as a side because the area has been a real mess a few times and is not at all an appetizing sight."}
{"text":"OY CARAMBA!

The last time I ate at one of these Caramba's someone there highly recommended getting the Salpicon Salad saying that it was delicious and tasty and he thought it was the best dish they make. It's listed as a salad so I was expecting a salad.

I did ask them to leave off the cheese and sour cream to lighten it up a little for me. But all this salad appeared to be a fried flour tortilla smeared with beans topped with a small amount of lettuce with a very small amount of fresh made plastic tub like chunks of chicken and topped with a big glob of guacamole. To me it looked like a tostada. It was a $6.25 tostada. I read on a sign that the chicken and a bunch of other stuff is made fresh every day and is never from frozen. I also didn't eat the fried tortilla the food seemed fresh but it was a small amount of food.

 TWO STARS for the Chicken Salpicon Salad 

I also had a Margarita and it was so strong I thought I tasted AntiFreeze in it and I also thought it might make me grow hair on my chest.

My husband liked the Carnitas Plate. He said it was nicely seasoned and the meat was moist. It came with rice and beans and a giant flour tortilla that could hold a small body.

I'll leave them at three stars because my husband liked the carnitas here.

We were going to have a donut next door at Lamar's but it was after 12 and they were almost out so you might want to check out Lamar's before lunch.

All the Caramba locations are open everyday for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Caramba isn't the Best or most Authentic Mexican Food but it is a Budget Family Friendly Place that happens to serve some seriously VERY strong $3.75 Margaritas. (I think they were $3.75)  It's casual as you order at the counter, seat yourself and wait for your number to be called. 

They also serve breakfast items all day and all your Mexi Favorites.

Caramba is a better alternative to Taco Bell or Chipolte and offers a large patio and is one of the better fast casual Mexican Restaurants in the immediate area.

Many Caramba locations are in the area."}
{"text":"Went for the first time today. I was pleasantly surprised. You get a good value for what you pay. The food is well prepared and seasoned properly. It was actually a bit surprising to walk in the place and see so many people eating. 

The salsa bar was pretty average, the place is a bit run-down, and you have to pay for soda refills. But their chicken quesadilla and chicken burrito were great. I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"It's good and it's fast, but I don't think I would take anyone here to show them authentic Mexican food or as an example of excellent Phoenix food.  If you are looking for good, quick Mexican food that's priced very well, this is the place to go.  Locations are convient."}
{"text":"Aye Caramba. 

My mom knows my love of Mexican food-and especially good Mexican food. Sadly, I am the only one in my immediate Phoenix family that is a fan. Growing up, the Grandparent's would begrudgingly go to one place called La Pinata (see my review from 2011) because that was close to both our synagogue (yes, this was back in the day) and my Great Aunt and Uncle's house. They would only have cheese crisps (only those from AZ, my Toni (through my Dad) and Ivy understand and share the love of a good one) or a chimichanga. My mom likes chips and refried beans and cheese crisps. She also likes guacamole but for some reason, can't pronounce it right. 

Anyway, during my recent week in Phoenix, it was not a vacation or resting type of trip. It was a little visiting and a lot of business type trip. Mom and I ended up here for dinner because she said that people she knows really like this place, so we went as it was close to an errand we were running. 

This is an order at the counter, they call your number type of place. There is a bar to one side the ordering area and the pick up area. They have Pepsi products, a salsa bar but you have to pay for chips. Mom wanted a cheese crisp and I ordered my standard new place order 2 crispy tacos one chicken, one shredded beef with refried beans and rice. I also ordered a small container of correctly pronounced guacamole. The cashier was friendly though not particularly warm.  

We found a table, and our number was called shortly thereafter.  The tacos were in home made formed and fried corn tortilla shells. I loved this. Sadly, that was about all I loved. The chicken taco was pretty dried out and they had large shredded Americanized tasting cheddar over the tacos. The beef taco was better, but the spicy carrots helped and the guacamole was nothing to write home about. What really got me though was the weird tinny flavor from the refried beans (pretty inedible) and as one Bay Area friend of mine would say-the rice was all wrong. Not only did it have peas AND carrots, it had some small corn kernels. Mom ate about half her cheese crisp and the fact that I didn't even try it speaks volumes. She apologized as we were leaving saying she thought it would be better, and she apologized even more adamantly when she told me she had been up a lot during the night because of the cheese crisp. Yep-I knew something wasn't right with the cheese.

Not a place I would recommend or ever come back to especially after an old friend from high school introduced me to Carolina's."}
{"text":"Restaurant quality Mexican food for half the price of going to a Mexican restaurant and super fast service...better tacos and tostadas than the majority of high end Mexican restaurants. Cheapest and strongest margaritas in town! Every time I go I have to have one...their Mexican pizza is on  another level, a must try! I love this spot!"}
{"text":"We have come here many many times over the years. I love their food! Love the salsa bar. My favorite is the Pollo asado burrito. Yum! Always friendly and fast. I took one star away because I wish they had larger bowls for salsa since the little cups they offer are so small. It's hard to dip the chip in. I also wish they offered free refills on drinks."}
{"text":"Caramba's is a great spot to get some tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price. I love that they make everything fresh and use all white meat chicken. I think the food here is better than most Mexican restaurants in town. My only complaint is that the free chips always taste stale but I always eat them anyways!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and nice salsa bar.

Walking in my first impression of the brightly lit place with hard chairs was definitely fast food.  That is what this place is.  I ordered the chicken Tostada for $3.99 and a medium soda, total $6.27.  Noticed a big selection of salsa and my order quickly came.

The tostada seemed expensive but when I started digging in it was packed with chicken.  Well worth it. Their salsa bar was great to add flavors and heat.
I'm a fan and will be back"}
{"text":"Caramba's is our go-to Mexican restaurant. It's quick, reasonably priced, and delicious. I recommend you invest in a collectors cup and get discounted drinks and refills for years to come. I've never eaten anything here that I didn't like. When you dine in you'll receive some chips to enjoy while you wait, but you don't when you order to-go. Be forewarned- Friday nights are a ZOO! There IS patio sitting you can enjoy when the weather is nice and I believe they even have misters to help keep it cool. We enjoy their honey and cinnamon crisps for dessert. Their primo margaritas are AMAZING!! I only need to enjoy one... And I'm feeling it. 

Enjoy your meal!!"}
{"text":"Place has been closed, and we have been waiting for this place to re open. Well we could have waited longer, food had no taste."}
{"text":"It is hard not to like this Caramba: the staff is very polite and they prepare your food quickly, even when the restaraunt is a little more crowded.  The dining room is set up well to be open and comfortable, with two large TVs that are usually tuned into sports.  There is also a small dining area outside that is smartly tucked away from the very large parking lot of this shopping center, so things don't get to noisy. 

Caramba has a fairly good menu for \"fast food\" Mexican with fresh ingrediants that at least seem authentic.   It leaps and bounds better than other similar fast food places like Del Taco and Taco Bell and even better than some of the local sit-down Mexican restaraunts.   The prices are noticably more expensive however.   Still, the meals are quite filling and even if it seems like you aren't getting much food for your money, you will walk away full.   

On more than one occassion, I've made the mistake of ordering extra tacos on the side because I was super hungry and ended up eating way to much."}
{"text":"Food is average, but prices are way too high for a Mexican restaurant
 where you order and have to pick up your food at the counter. Tacos are $3.20, to much for an average taco. Everything has gone way up in price. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This place has great salsa and very reasonable prices, it took us awhile to walk in there because the outside looks very Americanized but I was surprised by the food very good!"}
{"text":"Authentic, quick and super delicious.  I had enchiladas and chips and salsa.  You can't go wrong with that.  Last time I got a chicken burrito \"wet style\" and that was so tasty as well.  Great little spot for good eats and casual dining."}
{"text":"First time here, but not the last. I placed a to-go order, and it was ready in less than 5 minutes.  You cannot beat the food prices.  I ordered the Giant Caramba Burrito, and this thing is massive!  And tasty!  You can either order at the counter and pick up your food from the other end of the counter (as I did), or you can sit down at the bar for full service.  They open at 10 a.m., which is a plus for lunch.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband just picked our food up there. It took forever and he said they were a busy and the employees were just screwing around and the service was terrible. The food is not that great. I ordered the #7 combo. The enchilada is so tiny, I didn't see it at first. The refried beans and rice are disgusting and have a strange taste... Overall, we were not impressed."}
{"text":"Four words: I love this place. But if its not one of their cheese crisps, its almost not worth it....

The other day was my second  visit to this place and I was hoping to impress my friend with their fresh delicious Mexican dishes. 

It was looking good when we first arrived because the very friendly employee really did a good job displaying his knowledge of their rather impressive menu. He gave recommendations to their enchiladas and burritos. I really wanted to get one of their impressive cheese crisps like I got last time, hoping to impress my friend, however I was feeling bold and decided to get the shrimp burrito. 

First wrong thing that immediately stood out was that they charge 25 cents for refills. That sort of cheap tactic really spells out a lot about an establishment. Also since their drinks are 2 bucks, I really didn't feel like buying refills. Oh and did I mention that I'm a standard debit card wielding American? No quarters in my pocket. But no big deal. 

So they took some time for our dishes to be completed which was not a surprise since last time they did the same thing. However last time once they finished, I was able to enjoy a most delicious cheese crisp. This time though, I was presented with a shrimp burrito with a side of lettuce? What do I do with the lettuce? Hmmm

The burrito itself was too hot. (Not spicy). I felt that I was unable to grasp the true flavor of the shrimp because of this problem. So naturally I was much slower in my eating. I gave the shrimp an opportunity to savor in my mouth so I can get the full flavor. I was wrong. Each piece of shrimp was doused in a sauce similar to a light soy sauce. Through the hot temperature, I was able to conclude that each of the pieces were quite bland. It was disappointing per bite because I expected a flavor burst each time, but never got it. 

The burrito was full of sauce. So full in fact that eventually, the bottom of the burrito collapsed and the sauce and shrimp spilled onto my plate.  ]= Still hot. So I continued my meal without the tortilla and simply forked the rest of my shrimp. 

Overall I actually like this place. (because of cheese crisps)
When I came the first time, there was sports on the tv and very  good food being served."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this restaurant.  Since we're eating Mexican food tomorrow I didn't want to get a full meal so I ordered some guacamole as a good indicator of how the food is.

I was disappointed.  The guacamole ($2 for 4 oz) was really peppery.  Not spicy with jalapeno peppers but black peppery.  

Based on the guacamole I probably won't go back for a full meal.  Too bad because the food really did smell good when I walked through the restaurant.  The employees were also very nice."}
{"text":"One word describes this place  \"FRESH\" ..... originally started going to the one on Glendale back in the day...... JJ"}
{"text":"I am updating this review for only one reason. It seems that I have spent years over looking Caramba's dessert menu. They offer a choice called \"Cinnamon Crisps\" which are warm cinnamon baked chips drizzled with warm honey.  The huge portion they provide is only $1.99.

You need this in your mouth. Now."}
{"text":"Only reason they don't get 5 stars is their salsa bar. It always disappoints and even sometimes disgusts me. Their salsas tend to taste like they've been sitting way too long, not fresh at all. Also some have a sour taste like it's spoiled. However, that being said, their menu is delish! I love their Salpicon salad, it's amazing. It is a mixture of chopped radishes, cucumber, green leaf lettuce, cojita, guacamole, sour cream, and meat on top of a tostada shell with beans on it. I could eat this every day, it's just that good. It tastes so light and fresh. I also enjoy their beans, tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. They make a huge quesadilla with cheese, meat, and guacamole thats crispy and savory."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to eat Mexican food. We order out regularly from here. It's cheap and always good. Their new carnitas tacos are by far my favorite thing. The meat is so juicy and has a great flavor. My boyfriend almost always orders the red beef enchiladas and I can't blame him because they're that good. For a good cheap meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"Ate here today and about a month ago. Both times yummy. Customer service is a 2-3 stars. But, whatever. I lovvvvvvvvvvvvve their fresh toppings here. They have just the right mixture of lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Last time I got a bean tostada and chicken taco plate. Delish. Today, I had the chicken salad in a bowl (normally comes in a tortilla shell). It was so good! It was lots of lettuce with grilled cubed chicken, topped with refried beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, and green onions. It was really refreshing and fresh. Again, the customer service could be A LOT better, but so far the food has made me want to come back anyway."}
{"text":"As Kelly M. mentioned \"They don't use any lard in any of their food or animal products in the rice.\" -  great for those of us who are vegan.

Last time I was there I ordered up a big plate of loaded nachos with beans, jalapenos, tomato, onions, black olives & guac. It was delish!"}
{"text":"Food was good enough to go back plus you get chips with access to the salsa bar! I was encourage to try the red sauce because I wanted my carne asada burrito enchilada style but I should have went with green. Red sauce had very little flavor. Wish they had salsa bowls instead of the small salsa to go cups. I had to fill about 8 of them just to finish my chips!"}
{"text":"I got their shredded beef burrito special and I have to say I was extremely disappointed, it just wasn't good.  However my wife got their green chili tamales and they were pretty darn good."}
{"text":"The white sangrias are the bomb.  Made with fresh fruits.  They taste great.  Some of the best Sangria in the city and they are pretty strong too.

I had the grilled shrimp and fish tacos.  They are very good for the price.  I've been going here for 5 years.  Sangria is 5-stars.  The food is 4-stars.  Some of the items are a hit while others are a miss."}
{"text":"Really good stuffed quesadillas!! Got the chicken, it was huge! Literally huge!!! Will come back, everyone was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"The lady at the counter was very short and rude.  Almost like my questions were bothering her.  The sign in the lobby says \"save some pesos\", that shouldn't be the slogan because they charged me $5 for chips and salsa after I paid $36 for a take out order.  On top of that, refills on fountain drinks cost 25 cents.  Next thing you know it will cost $2 to use the restroom there.  I would recommend Rubio's as a way better alternative.  One and done with this place!!!  Never again!"}
{"text":"AWE.......the original Caramba's, feels like home. This location does not have a bar area like some of the other locations, but I have been eating here for 8 years and it is my favorite location. The staff is always super nice and the food is always out nice and quick. In the few minutes you have to wait before your food is ready you can take advantage of the salsa bar. They give you the chips, you pick your salsa, or pico.

The beef chimi comes with sour cream and guacamole and until I have one here I don't like, I will keep ordering it. I have had there tacos several times as well and they are also very good. 

I don't like the 25 cent refills but other then that I can not say enough good stuff about Caramba's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Caramba's! It is kind of a cross between fast food and a real sit down type of restaurant.  Their beef chimi is my favorite, and it actually comes with sour cream and guacamole. Their tacos are also worth giving a try too. 

I have been to 3 different Caramba's locations in the valley and this is probably the nicest one I have been to. I also really like the one in central Glendale, because it is the original. The food is honestly about the same no matter which one you go to, but each one is set up a little different.

The cool thing about this location is they have a larger, nicer, and more up to date bar area. Plus the food here is way better then other similar restaurants  in the area."}
{"text":"I had a  Carne asada burrito and my wife had a chicken enchilada.  Both delicious, virtually no wait time,  Price was $11.  We are really happy we found this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only given this place one shot,so far my girlfriend and I are not impressed. The food just seemed low quality,nothing like blue Burrito.Maybe it's a new place and they're working out the kinks.I might give them another chance and update my review"}
{"text":"Disappointed! I was craving a chicken salad so I tried their Carambas sal picon chicken salad. All the ingredients were chopped up into small bits, including the lettuce. I had a hard time finding the chicken. They slapped on a huge spoon full of sour cream and guacamole on top. Don't get me wrong! I love guacamole, but not a ton of it. The salad didn't have much flavor so I returned it and got the Chile Relleno combo instead. So now I'm having a hard time finding the chili. They drowned it in their sauce, the beans had a slight burnt taste to them, and the rice was cold. I think the only thing they did right was the chips and salsa. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for \"Real Mexican Food\"."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cheap prices, huge portions, great food, extremely fast order completion. Oh and the house margarita was one of the best I've ever had. Need I say more???"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!!  I've been going here for years and now they've opened a full bar on one side I love it more.  Jake, George and Juan have our drinks ready for when we walk in the door with a smile."}
{"text":"My first visit, good and not so good.
Pros:
Refried beans were very good.
Cheese enchilada was also very good
Fast service and reasonable prices.
Nice outdoor patio 
Cons:
Salsas didn't have much flavor and very watery.
Carne asada had a weird taste."}
{"text":"To know upfront: I have been coming here for 9 years!! I really want to not like this place since it is a chain, not owned by anyone with a Mexican descent and it is also not super authentic. Okay with all that said...though I don't live in Glendale anymore whenever I visit I always come here. The food is cheap, high quality and delicious. Sure it is not super authentic. Who cares?! Most of the places in Phoenix are not authentic. I just want good tasting, no growth hormone adding Mexican-ish food. I have had most everything on the menu and I personally love their tacos, machaca quesadillas and when I want to eat until I fall over I get their nachos. Also note, their margaritas are cheap and strong without being overly strong. 1 gets me buzzed and 2 makes me order more tacos. My hubby likes their sangria. We always sit outside since kids are annoying and bountiful since they are so well priced. If you want authentic look to Via Delosantos in Sunnyslope. You may get shot but food is very authentic. If you want cheap, fast and super delicious go to Caramba's."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Heard the owners keep 80% of the tips for them selfs and give the employees the rest at the end of the year. Heard this from a former employee. Sounds like a tax problem more than a moral problem. Keep up the good work guys in the stores. Shame on the owners!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the food but the atmosphere could be better but I wouldn't judge it on that because the food makes it worth it! Definitely not fancy but I love the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"The hubby & I go there very frequently now...addicted to the margaritas!  We've tried more of the menu and it's ALL been great.  We like to share the giant burrito (yep, it's huge) that's loaded with only with a really tasty shredded beef (I hate rice and beans in a burrito) and covered with a delicious red sauce. We always sit outside since the inside is so blah, but it's so hot right now, we'll have to wait til it cools off a bit.  We'd get it to go, but we HAVE to have their margys!  The guys behind the counter are awesome and very friendly."}
{"text":"I guess I have never reviewed CFMF. 

We have been long time fans of all the locations. You know you can get a good Breakfast lunch or dinner here. 

Today we had 2 kids meals, I am trying to eat less for dinner. 

One was bean and cheese burrito and one was chicken taco. Both were excellent. Child 2 said it was better then Filberto's, Roberto's etc. WOW She is a bean connoisseur. 

The taco meal was good, It came with Rice and beans as a side. Perfect amount of food with out stuffing yourself. 

Best part it was less then $10 for 2 meals. Holla"}
{"text":"We went to Caramba's Fresh Mexican Food this weekend after hearing about it from some friends.  We have been looking for authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and not having to drive to Tucson to find it.  Don't take this wrong, there are some really good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, but Tucson has great Mexican food! 

Caramba's is more of a dive-ish / dinner style restaurant that offers quick and friendly service and really good (almost to greatness) food.  They were voted \"Best of Phoenix\" and Best Mexican Restaurant\" by Hispanic Newspapers.  They are extremely low cost and offer HUGE serving sizes. What I like the most about Caramba's is they do not use lard nor MSG!  You can tell their food is extremely fresh and they offer several LOW CARB options for the healthy conscious. 

My Chipotle loving friend left this place vowing never to eat at Chipotle again after eating their Machaca Beef Burito. Their Machaca Beef Buro is HUMUNGUS and very tasty!  Their chicken and shrimp Quesadilla's were also delicious and HUGE. They were served on a pizza pan for goodness sake!  Their carne asada and and pollo asado are also very good. They give you a bowl of warm, homemade chips and have a salsa bar.  The two things that are keeping my experince from being 5 stars:

1)  Yes they have a salsa bar and their salsa is very good but they give you these little salad dressing size cups to put it in.  They are so small you can't fit a chip in them...

2)  They charge you for soft drink and ice tea refills.  I appreciate the fact they serve a good variety of domestic and foreign beer but sometimes you just want ice tea, especially during lunch. No one charges for tea refills!

Despite these two very small quirks,  I recommend you try the Caramba's Fresh Mexican Food on Bell and I17.  They are better than or as good as any Mexican food available in Phoenix.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!  I'm planning to try their Chile Relleno and Tamales!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always delicious never disappointed. Drinks are great, food is outstanding, and service is awesome! Would always recommend!"}
{"text":"We just ate some of the most tasty Mexican food (and 'Ritas)...  thanks to all my other Yelpers and their recommendations!

Informal setting but outstanding food at extremely reasonable prices.

Staff was extremely nice and helpful.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. The short blue hair lady was so rude. I walked up to the counter waiting for her to say something like a \"hello\" or \"welcome in what Can I get for you\" but no i just start placing my order without her saying anything. After i asked for one item she told me my total will be $7 something. First of all i didn't even say I was done ordering. I told her i wanted something else and she just rolled her eyes at me. Then when i was done ordering i asked her if there was anyway that i could get some chips and salsa to-go she said my total was $20 something so i thought maybe she didn't hear me so i was like okay whatever then. After that i sat down and looked at my receipt and she charged me $3.90 for some chips and salsa!!!! I was assuming it would be free since they give chips and salsa to the people that dine in. She could of told me that they charged for chips and salsa for to-go. If i knew that i wouldn't have ordered that. But I wasn't going to complain bc I'm not that kind of person that complains. She was soooo rude"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I was a kid. Was so excited for them to open a location in Scottsdale! Amazing food, great prices and a beautifully done interior. Not to mention the patio is HUGE!! Will definitely be back for a 4$ Bloody Mary and breakfast on the weekend. If you've never had Carambas you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"I love the Carambas in surprise and this one did not miss the mark. Super clean inside (no dust!) and really nice employees. Food was great as usual!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for several years.  The food is always consistent and quality.  The salsa is fresh and they have several choices.  Their beans are great even though they don't use any lard, the same for the tortillas.  They offer wheat tortillas as a healthier option which actually are good.

I have had several dishes off their menu and have never had anything I didn't like.  I would definitely recommend the mexican pizza.  Its a lot of food and can be split between two adults.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the salpicon salad is awesome.   I prefer it with shredded beef. It comes served over a tostada shell smeared with beans, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, crumbled cheese, sour cream and guacamole.

I give this place 4 stars because the bathrooms at this location are small and a little janky.  They have outdoor seating, which is nice.  A couple of the guys that have worked here for years recognize me and my family and greet us every time we go here. 

A great, healthier alternative to the common \"bertos.\""}
{"text":"Ahh it was so so... We had bean burritos and a carne Asada burrito. The beans are ok and the carne Asada was just ok too. There are better places out there. The only plus side is the the price was cheap, but that could be the down side too.. :)"}
{"text":"This has become our favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is priced great and it's delicious. Great atmosphere and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The previous time I ate here was like 13-14 years ago.  I think this was the only location at that time.  I had a spinach enchilada and a fish taco.  I had already been introduced to 'bertos around the valley.  Because they use 8\" instead of 10\" tortillas for their enchiladas I thought I didn't get enough for my money and they used cilantro, which I do not care for, in their fish taco. I removed this place from my list of lunch spots near work.

The other evening eating at Stir Fry Paradise I noticed quite a few customers at the Caramba next door.  So I looked up the reviews for all the locations and didn't see any red flags.  And Korina A doesn't care for cilantro either and she made no mention of it in her review.  So I tried it out again for lunch.  This time eating in instead of sending someone for take out. 

I got the combination #4 (see picture), shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada, rice, beans ($6.65) and a small horchata.  Total with tax: $8.54.It is still about a dollar more than a 'bertos and the enchiladas are still smaller.  But it gets better.  The meal comes with a bowl of fresh chips.  There is a salsa bar with fresh made salsas instead of inedible hot sauce.  They use the next grade up of cheddar cheese.  The enchilada sauce is better.  The beans and rice are a little better.  And I can no longer eat all of a 'bertos combo any more anyway :-)  I just barely finished this one.

It was a perfect day for the patio.  Being on the North side of the building I can see it getting hot at midday even with the umbrellas during  the summer.

It is still a fast food Mexican place but one that is worth a little more.  It is now back on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"A coworker who lives far far away recommended this spot. I tried it out about 2 weeks ago and it lived up to her hype. I ordered up a loaded quesadilla, and wow it was amazing. Really generous portion too. It came out on a medium pizza tray! I also had some baja style fish tacos, so I ended up taking some home. I saw a trio of police eating there, and saw that they didn't contribute to the 25 cent refill container as they got sodas after being there a while, eating. Perhaps they ponied up a bit earlier than when I got there, perhaps its a perk for wearing an all-black uniform in the Phoenician oven of summer. Who knows. I didnt have any change so I felt guilty about getting a refill. Anyways, good grub... a step above a \"x-berto\" style 24 hour place. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting here from Los Angeles and took a few kids along with me. The casual atmosphere makes it nice for a quick bite. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. I had a chicken burrito and it came with all the fixings inside. The chips were good and there's plenty of salsa at the salsa bar. Service was fast and our order came up within 5 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Trifecta! Excellent food, service is great and prices are fantastic! Bonus: margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to Carambas a few times...and at several locations.  I want to share why I am giving 5 stars for this particular visit.  It was close to closing time on a slow weeknight and my friend was visiting from out of town.  He and my husband both wanted Mexican food and I am on a very strict diet and dreaded going to be tempted by my favorite type of cuisine.  I just want to say that even though it was late in the evening, and my food restrictions, we were met with smiles and friendly employees who made me the best chicken salad I could have imagined.  The chicken was hot and fresh and well seasoned and the lettuce was chopped into very small bites and that with a little salsa, made my meal just perfect.  The boys were very happy with their dishes as well.  I just appreciated the accommodations and will be back for another salad very soon."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I ever had. Taco Bell is better. Worst tortillas I ever put in my mouth, the kids wouldn't even eat them, just the filling. $28 for 4 tacos, a burrito, 2 bottled sodas and a fountain sofa. Never getting my money again. Anyone of the bertos are better. Salsa bar was good but that's all!"}
{"text":"You had me at \"Salsa Bar.\"  Oh Caramba... all you needed was a salsa bar to get me to come back again and again.  So many salsas to choose from makes this salsa freak so happy!  I love the variety and freshness of all the salsas, as well as the freshness and low prices of the food. 

When our order number was called, I had to ask the guy behind the counter if all that food was for my order because there were two trays full!  We spent less than $20 for all that food.  My hubby and I left fat and oh so happy after eating at Caramba's."}
{"text":"Good, fairly friendly. Food is the best of all locations around the valley in my opinion. I like that they have a tequila bar, even though I don't like tequila it ads atmosphere. They are friendly as well."}
{"text":"The patio is always crowded, even when it's 115 degrees outside. It's crowded because every seat inside the restaurant is taken. They have misters out there, but they don't really work too well. 

What is it then, that convinces throngs of West siders to endure the blasting heat and sun beating down on them?

A $3.25 margarita that tastes great and will knock you on your ass."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while visiting family in Phoenix. 

Food was really good..it was like Robertos but with a step up in quality and freshness. I had the tamales and enchiladas and it was pretty good. Usual slew of salsas that were mostly pretty good.

Best thing about the visit other than the service? Definately the Margaritas....goddamn great and wouldnt exepct em to serve those let alone be that good and cheap too...think they were 3.75!

Will definately come back here any time I am passin thru as its super close to the highway."}
{"text":"Completely dissapointed. Was on a budget and my daughter and I wanted some Mexican food. Well more like she wanted mini chimichangas with guacamole. So Carambas it was.  I opted for the taquitos. Chicken AND beef. I wanted to try them both...I was so dissapointed. I couldn't even tell which was which. There was so little meat, all I could taste was the corn tortilla. My daughter got the combo with rice and beans. Beans had a weird after taste. The only thing good was the customer service, salsa's and guacamole. Definitely won't be going to this location again."}
{"text":"Yep, 5 stars for a neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  The food is fantastic.  Really, really good.  

Carne Asada  and Pollo Asada burritos are my favorite. Just tried the chicken fajita burrito for the first time, and it was amazing!

The people working are great too.  Anyway, try it, you'll like it. Maybe even love it!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. I ordered carnitas tacos. Totally not what I'm use to being from California but tried it anyway. The meat didn't have much flavor, so I tried adding salsa. No luck. The salsa or salsa's lacked flavor as well. I wanted some heat so I tried what was the \"hottest\" one and that didn't deliver either. It's pretty pricey for what you get. My husband ordered a burrito and it wasn't very filling at all. He also stated the meat lacked flavor. Sodas/tea, they charge for refills. Staff wasn't very helpful when I told them it was our first visit, normally restaurants like to suggest or tell you about the restaurant. Didn't happen."}
{"text":"Taquitos special is amazing & great price! I also love the tacos, chips & salsa, & pork cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Came here with family who lives down the street from the place. They like it so we went along. It was about an hour before they closed. We sat at the bar, the waiter was really cool. The beer was cold. Lots of salsa choices and we really liked them ( which is usually not the case - kinda picky about good hot salsa ). I had a Carne Asada Burro and a Bean Tostada. Wolfed that down, 10 minutes before they closed, I ordered yet another burrito and wolfed that down too. We really liked the food and would go back to see if it repeats the next time in town."}
{"text":"Love Caramba. Food is always good, prices are great. I highly recommend salcipita salad, quesadillas and anything with shredded beef or pork."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new branch of Caramba's.  The menu is similar to their other places.  The place is clean and huge.  Great for large parties of people.  There is a large separate bar unlike the others I have been to.  Staff were nice and we checked various meals for their onion content.  Several dishes had onions which is a no no for my hubby.  We ordered the chicken tostada and chorizo w/potato burrito.  We got our comp basket of chips.  The salsa bar offers hot and medium salsas including pico de Gallo, and tomatillo salsa.  The food was served quickly and customers must pick up their orders.  The food was fresh and well priced.  Large parking lot with several other eateries."}
{"text":"I was craving a fish taco so my hubby and BIL drove to Glendale.  We discovered this place some years ago simply by accident and loved it.  The broiled fish taco did not disappoint.  If was fresh, hot and yummy.  Their pollo asado taco is also tasty.  They have a small salsa bar and give you chips with your order.  Service is quick and the price is excellent."}
{"text":"It was OK. Here are my problems. Fuego sauce....said it was extra hot, however, extra hot? Nope. Fires out fellas. Pace picante hot was HOTTER by far. The medium salsa was mild.....enuff said.

The pork tamales were without pork. I think the cashier meant to say that the pork was in the green chile sauce but the sauce itself didn't have any pork in it as well. 

My quesadilla had sour cream and guacamole on the inside when it was toasted. Nothing like warm sour cream to soften the taste buds. Chicken on the inside was flavorless...flavorless the green Chile that was supposed to be inside the quesadilla was thin to say the least. Tortilla was good however and the service was friendly. Overall, we will not be back."}
{"text":"This one of our favorite Mexican food stops. The Tacos are the bomb no matter if they are soft, regular,  or fishy. The salsa bar has a good variety nothing to spicy. Great atmosphere on Friday night's."}
{"text":"This is our favorite for Tacos. Surf and Turf Burrito is a solid choice to satisfy the craving. Friday nights can be very busy because of the Margaritas."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today; the special Caramba Burrito (covered in green or red enchilada sauce; I got green) was outstanding....the chips are fresh and most of the salsas are great (the extreme hot Fuego salsa has a great heat bite, but lacks flavor compared to the other ones IMO). Extremely decent prices and huge servings (like the motto says, \"Where you don't peso much!\") Will return very soon."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is always good and so is the service. I even love the smell of the place. It smells like you're walking into someone's kitchen that has been cooking all day. Their crunchy shredded beef tacos are amazing and so are their quesadillas! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We go here regularly and always get great food and great service. For a quick bite of mexican food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Yum! If you like Mexican food you will love Caramba's! Always a casual atmosphere, stand in line to order, pick out your own table, grab your food at the counter when it's ready. Our food only took about 8 minutes to come out! Chips and salsa are free! The chips are really thin and crunchy! Could definitely use more salt, though. Their pico de gallo is amazingly fresh! I got like 4 little cups full and put it on my chips and my meal! I ordered the #2--cheese enchiladas wth shrimp, beans and rice. So good!! The shrimps were MASSIVE! Also, the tiki bar inside looked super cool with the Hawaiian grass over it! Must try the margaritas next time."}
{"text":"Wanted to update my review:  Mr C & I went in on a Friday for a quick, inexpensive dinner out. I decided to try the margarita since it seemed that everyone else there was drinking them too.. So, I tried it, and oh my... me likey. Not bad.. for $3.75 a drink, it was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This place is usually, crowded, loud and fun. The food is plentiful and delicious. Outdoor seating also."}
{"text":"Cheap and pretty quick. Food was average, margaritas alright."}
{"text":"I've only ordered off their catering menu, never actually eaten in the restaurant. So that being said up front, here are my thoughts:

Called to order 1 week prior to my work meeting.  the manager basically allowed us to customize our order to get what we wanted for the number of people.  Their catering menu is very affordable and many of the deals include rice, beans, chips and salsa...can't beat that!  And they even throw in the plates, napkins, and plastic silverware...other places you have to pay for this.  All we needed were serving utensils. 

Our food was hot, fresh and exactly what we ordered.  it was ready on time too.  I'd love to go back and order off their full menu.  Their service and food were great. I'd recommend them for catering."}
{"text":"Loved this new Caramba in Scottsdale!  The interior is so nice and the patio is huge and looks so festive for a group gathering.  The atmosphere here is really relaxing and fun. My all time favorite is their shrimp enchilada. The sauce is unique and delicious. You can't get that anywhere else. If you haven't had it, try it. Wish I took a photo of it but I was so hungry I ate it all. lol...  Now they have street tacos and that is delicious too."}
{"text":"Ah, the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school. Future doctors of America, right here, baby! The menu offers standard Americanized Mexican food fare, but there's just enough variety to have something for everyone. On the days I thought it inappropriate to return to class smelling of beer, I would turn to the horchata -- fresh and delicious, every time. Like fricking clockwork. The food is fresh and, magically, not heavy. The salsa bar lets you dump on as much diarrheaogenic hot sauce as your asshole can tolerate, and the chips must be made fresh because nothing that good comes out of a bag.

Regretfully, I am virtually never in the northwest valley anymore, and have enjoyed the Caramba experience maybe once since graduation. This is tragic. Why can't Caramba force Mi Patio out and set up shop there?"}
{"text":"Good food.  Busy. But that could be a good sign.  Love it.  5 stars only if I am wowed."}
{"text":"The margaritas will make any persopn feel like a sailor half way through their small cup. their ratio for the mix is 50/50, it tastes very strong but well worth your dollar
i love the fish taco, I usually get a la cart and substitute things in, I can be a picky eater and the service is always helpful and comforting to know that its ok that I want certain things the way I like.
Chimichangas are very good I always get shreeded beef chimis, with green sauce on top(let in soak in with the heat). its GOOOOOD
Tables and eating area is a bit more open then I had anticipated at first but then again half way into my margarita im not thinking about seating anymore,

one con: they dont olay anything in the background no music or anything so if no one is in the restaurant with you it can be a bit erie and creepy with how quiet it can be"}
{"text":"Sooo delicious and prices aren't bad at all...I will definitely be going back there soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get quick Mexican food!

Located on Bell Road and the I-17. Because of it's location and how easy it is to find/get to it, it's a very popular spot for lunch. They do have inside and outside seating, but with this heat most people choose to eat indoors, which can at times make it impossible to find seating indoors. I however always come close to opening, so I usually never have any trouble finding a seat. 

They have an extensive menu with all the typical Mexican food items from burritos, tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas, tostadas, salads, Mexican pizza, nachos, carne asada fries, breakfast food, combo plates and much more. They have something for everyone on their menu. My favorite items here are their Carne Asada burrito and the grilled shrimp tacos. I'm such a fan of Carne Asada and they just do such a good job at cooking it well without over cooking it and the flavor is always on point. The shrimp tacos are so good. They grill the shrimp to perfection where it's still tender and juicy. 

Their portions here are also large for me. I always end up taking home food and having it for another meal or giving the rest of mine to someone else to finish. Everything comes out to order and is fresh. I've never experienced anything negative as far as freshness and flavor is concerned. 

They have a good size salsa bar as well, which is always kept stocked. Drink machine is usually kept full. They ask for 25 cents for refills, but I'm pretty sure most people don't pay it. 

Tables are kept clean, floors swept, trash emptied when it's getting full, trays and chip bowls are regularly picked up and taken to the kitchen. 

5 stars for food (freshness, amount given, cost)
5 stars for cleanliness of the restaurant 
4 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Caramba is my happy place & has been for the past 13ish years. There are a handful of
locations in the west valley and each are great. Personal faves are I17 and Bell and 67th Ave and Bell.

Their margaritas are the reason so many of their regulars return multiple times per week. They're cheap and strong and have great flavor. My personal fave is the Brittnee, yes it's a thing but only if Juan is your cashier. It's a rocks marg with a teeensy splash of strawberry sauce. Takes the edge off the strong tequila. YUM. 

The food does leave some to be desired but there are gems on the menu for sure. Try the grilled fish tacos, stuffed quesadilla or carnitas. I create my own dessert by adding chocolate sauce to (what I call) their churro chips (fried tortilla doused in honey, sugar and cinnamon.)

Everything is fresh, inexpensive and the staff is friendly. Thank you, Paul, for providing my friends and family over a decade of tasty memories at your restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place for good cheap Mexican food! Machaca burrito is amazing."}
{"text":"My meal is always on point here. Love the fresh variety of salsas and chips that comes with your meal. Great for large groups. We fed 9 people for under $100!! I recommend the Mexican pizza with beef."}
{"text":"I grew up going to Caramba for a quick lunch and basically all of my high school functions were catered by them. 

The nachos with chicken are amazing!  Totally loaded up, hard to find chip that is not covered in gooey goodness.

The catering is also very reasonable and great tasting. I grabbed some beans and rice to go along with our homemade enchiladas last night for an event and they did not disappoint.
Just wish they would branch out of the NW valley a bit and add a spot in downtown phx!"}
{"text":"I love coming here when I am in Glendale. The staff are wonderful and welcoming. If you are a vegan or vegetarian. This place has options! They don't cook their food in lard which is a plus! For the people who can not have gluten in their diets they have gluten free alternatives."}
{"text":"Ahhmazing! Cheap and the best Mexican food around! New bar is awesome! Jake is the best bartender ever"}
{"text":"Caramba's is find in the Sun City Grand area.  My wife and I really enjoy going to Caramba's because it's just down home good, inexpensive Mexican food.  We go at least twice month if we are in the area.  The food is always fresh and plentiful.  Love the salsa bar.  We can load up on our favorites and they are great on the food.  I like the Chorizo and eggs platter.  Breakfast is great but I have to admit I wish that they would open earlier for breakfast. Check it out this local restaurant that out does all those overdone place in the area."}
{"text":"I'd never been here because and I guess I got in the wrong line. The ordering and pickup line end at the same place, but the guy behind the counter refused to help me because I wasn't in the right line. I'll cop to my mistake, but seriously? With the awful way I was treated I'm never going back. 'Bertos is probably better anyways."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, a little more than I would like to pay but not unreasonable. I enjoy coming here for lunch"}
{"text":"I don't know how this TAKE OUT so-called restaurant got so many high marks!  The food reminded me of a carry out - fast food place.  They serve everything off paper plated and drinks out of plastic cups. As for the food serving size being HUGE, I did NOT see that either. I had called ahead to see if the had a happy hour, after being placed on hold for nearly 15 mins they finally picked up the line and told me the wrong time. My whole experience with this place was horrid!

Final Thought: Don't do it! Unless there are no other opts, there are far too many other really good Mexican place in the area."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town !!! Whether it's carnitas, fajitas or a taco salad, you cannot go wrong. Everything is so delicious!!  And the staff is always so friendly. Always a win-win when we come here."}
{"text":"Food has good flavor but not that authentic for mexican its decent though just not 100 like carolinas"}
{"text":"You know, for Phoenix, it's not too bad for Mexican food. 

While our car was broken down, we walked over here and decided on the quesadilla. WOW! It's gigantic. And I didn't think of taking a pic. And not too bad! Nice and cheesy with chicken and sour cream/guac. It had other stuff in it too I just can't remember. 

They have a great outdoor seating area and prices are pretty decent. But, it was just missing that Cali flavor that only Cali knows. I just can't give it better than a 3."}
{"text":"I always find time to eat at Caramba when I am visiting Phoenix, AZ. One of my favorite places for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great fresh food and friendly service. The flour chicken flautas and chicken enchiladas were amazing! The Prima Margarita was soooo good and nice and strong! Great price!"}
{"text":"Northeast of Scottsdale and Shea.

Very big patio, bar, and a lot of seating.

Same great taste and quality like other locations.

Giant caramba beed burrito non-enchilada style with their famous Margaritas. Delicious.

Attractive bartender and very very friendly service."}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican food. It's a-ok when sometimes you just want that type of cuisine. Prices are all very reasonable and portions are good sized. There's a huge outdoor patio area and a \"cantina\" area that had more of a bar feel. There's also interior seating in a no frills fast food environment."}
{"text":"Just now left this place and what a horrible costumer service!!! I have never seen someone so rude to a costumer like the cashier there tonight. Not only was she rude, but when I signed the receipt and handed to her she yanked it out of my hand! I was in shock!!! No hello, thank you, your welcome and while she was doing all of this there was an employee watching her without hesitating to apologize to the costumers! We all have bad days but I would never talk to someone the way she talked to me! Really wish I knew her name so that I could bring it to someone's attention!!!! Definitely never coming back !"}
{"text":"This is by far the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in this area of town. I try and get different dishes each time I visit and have yet to be disappointed. 

If you're looking for an amazing location/view/atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you. If you're looking for amazing food, then you've come to the right place. 

The prices are great for what you get. The quesadillas are served on a pizza tray so bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"We went last night and it was just ok. I've been to the other 3 locations and I think while this is the nicest one, it was not my favorite. The food was ok-good, our order was correct. I don't know if they're more expensive than the other locations or have raised their prices but our bill was more than I was expecting. Still not terribly expensive though. The Caramba Burrito came in a tin Togo container that ripped as the burrito was being cut into, the rest of our food was on plates so that seemed weird. Overall not a bad experience but nothing wow about it either"}
{"text":"I have been going to this same Caramba for 20 years.  The past few visits I have noticed the service go lower, but last night I ordered their green chili and chicken folded quesadilla with white cheese.  While the food was OK, I could have gone swimming in the grease.  I must have used 5 or 6 napkins to remove grease from my hands.  I finally cut up the rest ate some and threw the rest away.  I think the brothers need to start overseeing the operation again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant.  There were a lot of menu options; however, I decided on a carne asado burrito.  They added guacamole on the burrito which made the burrito even more enjoyable.  I was impressed that it was ready even before I filled up my soda.  I loved the burrito and thrilled that it did not have a lot of rice or beans added, just the carne asado.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Did not expect it to be a fast food restaurant but it is.  Their fish tacos are spicy and pretty good.  Their regular tacos are good and made with homemade tortillas.  The salsa bar has a good verity and a lot of didn't spice.  The quesadillas are enough to feed you entire family!  It comes in a freaking pizza box.  lol"}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation from the host from our Airbnb.  First, the primo margaritas are the bomb!  It's reasonably priced and it was well prepared. Beware, you will get tipsy very quickly.  We tried the street tacos which were okay but it lacked more of the cilantro and onion.  After that we ordered the carnita plate as one of the recommendations from the bartender.  Unfortunately it had more onions than meat and I had to send it back because they never added the tomatoes nor green peppers.  The bartender immediately addressed it . For a Friday it wasn't busy so that was a plus for us."}
{"text":"I had the enchilada meal and there was too much oil and sauce on the top. Not to mention I got food poisoning. I'm scarred from this place now :("}
{"text":"shame on you Arrowhead ..worse possible mexican food in our area. Went today because I wanted to give it one last shot..Swing and a Miss..!! asked one of the guys behind the counter for chips..He wanted me to go back to the end of the line when the chip baskets were 8 steps away..and that GIANT burro they advertise only weighs that much because its 6 tortillas dosed in enchilada sauce..you need a search warrant to find any meat..SERVICE is bad..food is worse..."}
{"text":"I have been going there for at least 7n or 8 years .My son and I went to there new one on 83rd and union hills and .My son wanted to put salsa in a cup so he could pour it onto his cheesecrisp instead of dipping it.When he went to go get the salsa one of the workers grabed his arm and got nasty with my son no warning or nothing.When we complained they said that it was there policy not to let people use cups for salsa .They could have gave my son a warning instead of touching him."}
{"text":"They have a decent menu and really good prices.  You do get a decent amount of food for the price that you pay.  The Fried Ice Cream is the best that I have had in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to like this place but stay away from the tamales....they are all masa and no meat.  I love their tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and the margaritas will get you drunk very quickly.  I like the atmosphere its very casual and clean.  The salsa bar has about 6 different salsas and the chips are great too."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and big portions. Not the friendliest. But if the foods good IDC. Pepsi products yuck."}
{"text":"Great place!  The food is excellent and consistent and quite reasonably priced.  I had the shrimp quesadilla and it was amazing.  Yummy salsa bar and nice staff!  
I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years -- always have a great meal! Favorite Mexican food restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the shrimp burrito. There weren't many shrimp (maybe 6) and the burrito was comprised mostly of onions and peppers. No rice, cheese, guacamole, or other good stuff included. I would not order it again. If I go back, I will definitely choose something else."}
{"text":"had a carne asada quesadilla with a white sangria. What a fantastic choice Caramba's never lets me down."}
{"text":"Oh no.. I've been waiting for my order for more than 15 minutes. I understand it was busy but they've been calling numbers 29, 30 & 31 those people who are eating in the restaurant (my number was 26 and it's to go) They should prioritize orders that are to go. I ordered carnitas and it was not what i expected. I paid $8 something and I didn't even finish it. I should have just ordered crispy tacos on the safe side."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first time at Caramba! Stopped in at 5pm on a Friday and moved through the line really quickly. The lady taking my order was very nice and our food came out within six minutes.

The chips were pretty good but could have used a little salt. I ordered the beef taco combo which was really good but the tortilla shells were a little stale. The beans and rice were really good as well. I also liked the variety of sauces and salsa.

The restaurant was very clean and nice. There is also a tiki bar which is a really fun touch to a fun restaurant. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Fundido sauce is the best!  It is sort of like Mexican fast food but the food is good for a quick meal and the price is right.  I would come back because I love the fundido sauce and the quesadilla was very good as well.  The best thing I ate here was the mini chimis.  They were fantastic, better than many high end Mexican restaurants I have been to."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, staff was awesome, manager was accommodating. He told me the Margarita would put hair on my chest and he was right! I wish we lived around here!!"}
{"text":"The best fast Mexican food ever!  Love the Mexican Pizza with chicken.  This restaurant is always very clean & the employees are awesome."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to eat.  Plus they have this little mini bar area too, but I do mean mini.  

My favorite,  or at least one of them is the super nachos minus the nacho cheese sauce and replaced with real cheddar cheese.  AWESOMMMMME. The chicken or shredded beef are both tasty. 

It's always quiet,  no lines or long wait for your food.  They have a TV that is usually playing sports recaps or something so that's nice too.

The staff will do anything to make your food the way you asked for it and don't mind changing something small to accommodate."}
{"text":"Been a fan for a long time.  It's inexpensive, quick, and delicious not a combo you always get.  

I particularly enjoy the Giant Caramba's Burro, granted we generally spit it between three of us, and I also love the Giant Stuffed Quesadilla, again usually shared.  Also they have great grilled fish tacos. 

A great family friendly laid back place to grab food and a margarita."}
{"text":"My dad has been taking me to Carambas since I was in a car seat 20 years ago. It is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant. The food is 10/10 authentic and absolutely delicious. I have tried other places in AZ and CA and NOTHING measures up."}
{"text":"This place. Love it. They don't use lard in there food so I can eat my heart out here. And it really does taste good. Very fresh ingredients used. Salsa bar is on point. I like there bean tostadas because I'm a simple girl living a complicated life!"}
{"text":"This place is atrocious, there prices are higher than all their sister stores and don't include rice and beans in their combo's. While I was eating there the staff apparently thinks that no one knows Spanish and was swearing like there was no tomorrow....Including someone who appeared to be a Manager. I will never step foot in here again, rather going to the much better quality sister store in Peoria off of Union"}
{"text":"Best Margarita ever!! Friendly service, great tacos, burritos and chimichangas.  My kids love getting the cheese crisp since it's the size of a pizza!"}
{"text":"I was there for lunch. thought the food was marginal. The chips and salsa were not good at all and they have Pepsi products which is a deal breaker for a coke drinker. The pricing is very reasonable so it that regard it might be good enough for a return visit. Thy seem to a large bar so for happy hour it might be a hit."}
{"text":"This place is so great we ended up eating here twice when we were in town for Spring Training.  It's reasonably priced and kid friendly and the food is delicious.  It's got a nice ambiance especially for a fast casual \"order at the counter\" type place.  And while I was skeptical as to whether a margarita served out of a dispenser a-la-Orange Bang style soda would be tasty, I was very pleasantly surprised...especially for $4.95.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We always get their pico de gallo salsa here as it is simply the best and always tastes super fresh.  We like it so much we always get extra salsa and request extra chips.  Our go to dish is usually chicken enchilidas with red sauce (a la carte).  This is our comfort food especially after we paid too much to eat somewhere else where their food wasn't nearly as good.

The parking lot can be busy at times because it's shared with other businesses so be careful when pulling out.  The vegetarian burrito is also great tasting.  Staff is friendly too and the food isn't too expensive."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love their salsa bar.  We always dine in and request an extra bowl of tortilla chips and load up on the pico de gallo.  No contest against the other salsa it is hands down the best option there.  We always order two orders of chicken enchiladas with red chile sauce on top (not NM red chile, but it still tastes good).  We don't bother with their green sauce which doesn't taste like green chile.  This is plenty of food for both of us.  After loading up on the salsa, my wife usually ends up with some leftovers while I have none.  We share a fountain drink or bring in our own bottle of water sometimes.  There is never a wait and the food is consistently good.  If we need a box, we usually help ourselves to one slightly behind the counter if they are super busy or ask for one ourselves.  Mexican food can make my wife sleepy so we can only go here when she doesn't have to study/do homework/work on a college project.  When her mom visited from India (who is a vegetarian), she ordered the vegetarian burrito and that was also good.  So now that is a backup for us when we don't feel like having chicken.  I grew up in New Mexico eating the best green chile new mexican food in the world.  It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to mexican food.  Most places here in the valley are either more expensive for ambiance (but the food isn't much better or is not as good) or don't measure up.  Or too far of a drive for us for a very small step up.  I keep holding out hope someone will open a new mexican restaurant in the valley with green chile that will make your eyes water and forehead sweat (as an option, not the default for others who can't take it).

We make excuses to come to this location when we're shopping at Walmart or just for the heck of it.  It's only one exit away since we're in North Glendale."}
{"text":"Very good food here and good atmosphere. The tables are stone and comfortable chairs. I had the chicken Caramba burrito with green salsa and it was great."}
{"text":"Went to Caramba's for dinner.  This was our first time and we went on the recommendation of friends.

First impressions.  When we walked in, about a 1/2 dozen tables were occupied.  The restaurant was VERY clean.  Lots of tables, no kitsch decor, and an order/pick up at the counter type set up.   

The lady at the counter was friendly and took our order w/ no problems.  We asked about ordering chips (they are listed on the on-line menu), and the lady said they were included, and gave us a couple of bowls of chips along w/ our drink cups.

They have a salsa bar with several different salsas available.  Medium smooth (hot sauce), medium chunky, hot, fire roasted, and pico de gallo.

The fire roasted salsa and the medium smooth were good, but nothing special.  The chips however, were well past their prime (stale).

We ordered a #2 combo plate (2 hard beef tacos), #6 combo plate (red chile burrito), and a bean and cheese burrito.

The food came fast and hot.  That's about the only good things I can say.  The red chile burro had a lot of meat and grease, but no flavor.  The red chile it self was very thin and watery.  The rice was bland.  The beans had the flavor of being fresh out of a can.  The tacos were also packed w/ meat, once again without flavor.  The same bland rice and beans accompanied the tacos.

My son ate about 1/2 of the bean and cheese burrito, and didn't want to take the rest home, and I didn't blame him.  He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a bean and cheese burritos, and he didn't like the beans either.

Maybe if we would have had one of their margaritas or cheap beer that many people rave about we would have liked it more.

I would rate almost any of \"berto\" places above Caramba when it comes the the flavor of the food.  I would rather have traveled down Bell Road to Mixteca.

My advice, if you want fresh, tasty, fast Mexican food.  Go to the nearest Carolinas.

I'm giving 2 stars, the restaurant was spotless, and the iced tea was fresh and very good."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Surprise! The food is authentic Mexican. The staff is friendly and service is exceptional. Sign said \"worlds best margaritas\" and they were. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!
I love traveling to the southwest US, so i can dine on authentic food like this!
Service was fast, and portions were MASSIVE."}
{"text":"Ordered a #15 carnitas combo. There was barely any pork. Not authentic. 1 oz of guacamole given on the side. Not worth the money spent ! Will not go back. They are very stingy with portion size."}
{"text":"Great food here. I work right around the corner so I'm here a lot. Very friendly staff that keeps the place clean including the kitchen. Been here literally hundreds of times and will be back hundreds of more."}
{"text":"Overpriced \"fast\" Mexican food. Chicken was very watery and flavorless. It's miserably hot and humid inside the building. 2 stars for fast service and they have a good salsa selection."}
{"text":"Actually ended up visiting a Caramba's location by pure chance while having my car repaired. We were looking for something within walking distance in the 90+ degree heat that day and this place fit the bill. 

Originally we planned to just get some sodas, but the menu and the interesting atmosphere lured me in, so I just had to try something. I ended up going with the pollo asado tacos and was not disappointed. They were excellent, well made and absolutely delicious. I'm not normally a guacamole fan, but this worked for me!  

I've since been back a number of times and tried the pollo asado burrito, also excellent, as well as brought my family there to try a few different dishes. In all cases, everyone was thoroughly satisfied and really, really loved the food. You can't beat it for the price, the speed or the quality. Besides that, it is truly an authentic place, from the food to the atmosphere, it's the real deal.

My only gripe on this place, which is a small one, is the noise level. Definitely don't go during prime-dining-time if you value the ability to have a conversation with your guest[s]. If the place is half empty, no problem. Early lunch or late dinner, no problem. If you go during peak times for lunch or dinner, there is always a large party or two that just can't control their volume (after too many margaritas) and the whole restaurant goes up in volume to the point where you can't hear yourself think. 

Again, a minor gripe and something to expect given the type of place you are in (it's not a normal restaurant, after all) but I deducted one star for that since it has annoyed my family members before on more than one occasion. 

All in all a great place and I would highly recommend it, but just be cognizant of the noise level and you should be fine."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends after a long day moving furniture. The quality and cleanliness of the place was pretty good, it definitely had lots of rooms for a good fun night along with a gated outside area where you can smoke and drink. The staff here was friendly and no offense but the person who took my order spoke really great and formal English which caught me off guard. I ordered a Caramba Nachos with beef and I have to say it was alright. I have had better, I believe the reason why it wasn't so good was the cheese that was put in, which was super watery and kind of ruins the whole dish. I do like however that they do give you a bowl of chips to enjoy and have a bar of salsa you can pick from."}
{"text":"I tried the giant carumba and it is a huge b3ef burrito enchilada style. The beef is watery and lacks flavor but sure looks good. On previous visits they usually gibve a smsll bowl of chips for the wait but maybe they have cut back. The service was not friendly but fairly quick. Hope it was just a bsd day for them and not a new trend. Bring back some flavor and ease up on the salt"}
{"text":"Probably have to say this is one of my favorite places to come to get Mexican food. The inside of the restaurant is open with plenty of tables. Even during the busy time of the day, they have more than enough tables for the crowds. They also have outside seating, which I'm looking forward to using once the weather allows for it. 

My go-to items here are the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style, cheese quesadilla, cheese enchiladas and Carna Asada fries. Their food is well cooked and seasoned and you get large portions. Many times I'm not able to finish what I ordered and have to take food home. Prices here are also good for what you get, however, I think prices may have gone up on some items since the last time I ordered from here. They have a nice salsa bar with several salsas to choose from. Note: if you get a drink, they ask for $.25 for any refills. 

The staff here are friendly but don't do much talking. They just do their job and that's all. The most conversation I've gotten out of someone was from the person taking my order."}
{"text":"The food is prepared quicky and was delicious. The service was friendly and helpful. The margaritas are the best we've had. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of this place! We come here a minimum of once a month but usually more like once or twice a week. Paul, the owner is such a sweet man who always greets us with a smile. The staff is very nice. The food is outstanding.
Love it. Love it. Love it."}
{"text":"Caramba's has great, fresh Mexican food.  Their menu is huge and so are their portions.  The quality of the food is always superb.  Overall a very nice Mexican place to eat."}
{"text":"The cheese crisp was great.But cold. Chips come in plastic bowl, salsa was in a cart for you to help yourself. I was looking for a sit down restaurant where this is a help yourself. High end Taco Bell . 
Sorry I was impressed with the outside but this just isn't what I wanted."}
{"text":"In the working class areas of Phoenix, one can spy a small Mexican eatery every hundred yards. A tortillera here, a taqueria there...blindfold me and send me to Maryvale, my stomach will lead my feet to menudo in mere minutes. 

But here on 67th & Bell, they don't seem too keen on ubiquitous Latin fare. This is middle class, soccer mom territory, and for the most part the locals seem satisfied sustaining themselves on Chipotle. But what if they dare venture to another part of town? Certainly, their curiosity must make them hungry for something slightly more authentic.

Well with Caramba's in town, they must not feel like they have to. This place is a parody of every obscure \"bertos\" I've stumbled into on an empty stomach. The music is all in Spanish, and there's some good ol' futbol on TV. The cashier was eager to explain away any menu item, as if the usual clientele couldn't tell their chilaquiles from an enchilada. Jajaja.  

Anyways, I ordered the fundido, because I figured their specialty was more...Tex Mex. It wasn't too appealing, essentially a fried burrito topped with generous amounts of an interesting cream cheese sauce. I washed it down with a fountain drink, but then I spied a sign...they charge a quarter for refills. That's not much at all, but not even Taco Bell does that--why should they? 

Out of defiance, I tossed my cup and just ordered a margarita. $3.25 seemed like a steal, I was excited to have one with my breakfast. I didn't mind it coming out of a fountain, but it was incredibly strong! Stronger than any margarita I've had in a restaurant. But, it was still worth it.

Apparently, their specialty is the cheese crisp, the more complex of them branded \"Mexican pizza\". I saw some being ordered, and I wasn't the slightest bit impressed, especially with tortillas that tasted like they came from the Fry's next door.

Personally, I don't think Carambas deserves the popularity it has. The food is middle-of-the-road, and their prices the same amount as a dozen places you could eat breakfast across the value. Nothing special about their salsas or tortillas, which is alarming enough. However, it was very clean, the staff was swift and polite, and they have adult beverages. It's okay for a nice, quiet breakfast."}
{"text":"If I could give this a 0 I would. Had 1 of their salads with chicken. The chicken was rubbery and tasted awful. Did not sit well in my stomach well at all. Soon after I got extremely sick... I will NEVER go back nor would I ever recommend this place. I am sure what I got was food poisoning."}
{"text":"Step 1: Acquire tandem bike with main squeeze to ride to local bars and eateries.

Step 2: Ditch class

Step 3: Ride said tandem bike to Carambas, where I don't peso much

Step 4: Order groin-grabbingly good margaritas, cheese enchiladas, and fish tacos.

Step 5: ?????

Step 6: Profit.

After two margaritas, two sangrias and a beer, each, we are feeling pretty hunky-dory. The cheese enchiladas are so fresh and so cheesy it's a damn good thing I am in public or else I'd make a fool out of myself pretending I'm Kobayashi.

 I can't say anything too different than what's already been said except add groin-grabbingly to good to emphasize my love of this place.

Oh, but this one time I almost died here. I was so hungry from whatever activity I was partaking in and I was woofin' down some of those chips and one of those  delicious bastards went in sideways. After what seemed like a minute and a half of no oxygen, I was just happy to keep eating some more of their groin-grabbingly great edibles."}
{"text":"Unfriendly forgetful New staff! Wasn't greeted and I felt like I was \"bothering\" the cashier. Then, Half of my ToGo order was missing, and I live in Goodyear so it's a good thing I checked my order before I walked to my car. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food goid service........................................................................"}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. I ordered the enchiladas and the corn tortillas were hard and no flavor. Everything was cold.. I will never come back.."}
{"text":"Shrimp cocktails and margaritas!!!! Hands down! The best in this side of town and the guys working here have the best customer service!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food. Fast food
 Absolutely love their famous quesidilla. Beware their margs are strong! One and done haha and if you dont like tequila with a hint of sweet and sour go for the super sweet dessert like pina calada. I wish they had more seating though every location i go to is packed on nights and weekends so get there before 6 to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Love. Tacos are amazing. Fast service. Not too pricey either. I've been coming here since I was a teen, I love the horchata drink as well."}
{"text":"Being an AZ native, I'm very picky about Mexican food.  Caramba's is the best fast food joint around.  Made fresh daily.  One of the few places that know how to make a crispy cheese crisp.  Few places make good menudo, but this one one of them.  I like both white and red, but prefer the red.  Lots of carne, very flavorful,  not greasy.  Great beef tacos.  Multiple salsa flavors on a salsa bar.  Red and green chili are good too.   You won't be disappointed with the food or prices.  Caramba's........where you don't peso much!"}
{"text":"Fast food style Mexican food chain. It was just ok. Nothing I would come back for, especially with all of the Mexican food choices in the Valley.

The staff were friendly and food was quick. The portion was small for the price. Tacos were small and cold. Salsa was bland."}
{"text":"Ok the food is way better than any of the Bertos. And I like the Bertos. So I got the caramba nachos, very good. Mexican pizza is always a hit with us. And the caramba quesadilla is good too. Now i have read several reviews that comment on bad service. It is a dive people, come on?!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The first time I got that salad thing with the radishes and cold shredded beef.  Salpicon or something like that.  I just told the guy I was looking for a salad, and he recommended it.  It was very fresh with generous sour cream and guacamole.  The guac was actually made out of avocados.  None of that fake \"avocado spread\" nonsense.  Plenty of meat on that thing.  Was happy with the food and price.

The second time, my BF got takeout for us.  He got the spinach enchiladas, and I got the shrimp burrito.  Once again, we were very happy with the food and price.  My burrito had lots of shrimp and fresh, crunchy veggies inside with a great sauce.  I remember that the burrito was $8, and the enchiladas were $5."}
{"text":"Our favorite place!  Quick and great mexican food. Service is amazing. Whole staff remembers the regulars. Treat you like kings and queens.  We go at least once a week and have multiple favorite dishes.  Shredded carnitas platter, pollo asado tacos, shrimp tacos, and margaritas to die for!"}
{"text":"Have been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant for a while and I have to say it delivers to the fullest! The food is fast and delicious, with fantastic portion sizes and a great price tag. I had the chimichanga and it was the best I've had in a long while! The chips are thin, crunchy, and warm plus there is a great range of different salsas. The staff is friendly and welcoming; and you can see them grilling. Will definitely be visiting again and again!"}
{"text":"For a fast food Mexican joint, you can't go wrong. I found out about Carambas from a wholeseller that broughtfood to my Office. He probably saved me from a heart attack in my 30's, it's really great food and everything is made to order. I've been here about 30 times in the last three months, as I'm a person that goes on food cycles, it's almost time to switch again."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  The bartender Molly is so fucking awesome. She made us amazing drinks, there was amazing food. Only if Molly was single I would marry her and buy her an island that she could stay on."}
{"text":"Amazing bartender Jake will take of you with yummy food and great drinks.  The mojito is the best!"}
{"text":"Carambas is my go to for quick and fast Mexican food. Price is good and food is great.  I regularly visit the locations at 67th and Bell and Union Hills and 101.   Both locations are equally as great.   If you're craving Mexican food, go to Carambas.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be good, gone rather down hill lately.  A bit pricey for what you actually get for when the food is good.  The Nachos used to be a really good item to get, but now...aside from the overpriced but good tasting chicken, it is just a sad pile of movie theater quality nachos complete with liquid squirt on cheese."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.     This place is terrific for what it offers.  Pretty straightforward, no frills menu, food is cooked fresh, tastes fresh, is served quickly, prices are pretty cheap and I've yet to have a bad meal here.    Tortillas are awesome and their breakfast menu, which is available all day, is also very appetizing.   The service is always friendly, its a family-owned business and the other locations around the Valley uphold the same sorts of standards for quality and customer service.   Worth a shot if you're looking for a good lunch or dinner that will leave you satisfied but not feeling overstuffed!      They offer catering services and have some great drinks as well, killer margarita's!"}
{"text":"This establishment is just ok. I ordered beef tamale in red sauce, side of rice and a margarita. The masa was so grainy and bland. No spice or seasoning in the red sauce. And other than Chinese rice, I have never had peas and carrots in Mexican rice! The free chips were old and stale. The margarita was very strong and was only $4.75, though I am sure it has to have been made with really cheap well tequila. I was not impressed and definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch during work. 

There is no table service, order at one counter, pay, then enjoy some chips and you choice of salsa from the salsa bar until your order is called. 

I ordered the fajita burrito..was pleased to see it came with guac inside, disappointed I had to pay $1.25 for a side of sour cream however. 

A decent size burrito , very filling and flavorful 

The tortilla was amazingly good...they either make them or have a great supplier. 

Rounded it off with a bottle of water and lunch hit me for $10.50 before tip. 
Their slogan is right \"where you don't peso much\""}
{"text":"This is a fantastic, inexpensive casual place to have delicious mexican food. It is almost a \"hole-in-the-wall\" kind of joint except the food is exceptionally good. I was a student in Glendale and Carambas was the only place where I not only got great tasting food but also could manage on a tight student's budget.

This is place is always crowded so you might have to wait for a table to become available. They have a GRRREAT salsa bar and awesome vegetarin options on their menu like the spinach enchiladas etc. Chains like Baja Fresh are based on small family owned restaurants like these. The charm at Carambas was it did not have a \"chain\" like feeling to it at all. It felt festive and fun and the team there were always friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Great food and service. My order was also fast. Service was prompt and easy. I ordered the carne asada burrito and a horchata."}
{"text":"Food was good! The front counter lady was friendly. She didn't go above and beyond, but I've learned that is not the way it goes here. She got our order right and was patient while we figured out how to order what we want. Took about 10 min for us to get our food after we had sat down. They charge for refills which is something you rarely see nowadays. There was a lady out in the dining area sweeping the floors and wiping tables, so needless to say the front area was clean. We were one of three families in the restaurant on a Saturday at lunch time so this leads me to believe that it's not an extremely popular restaurant. We were handed chips to snack on, they were warm, but as soon as they cooled down, they weren't anything special. Anyway, we got our food. The portions are pretty good, especially the quesadilla (which comes on a pizza tray). The nachos were made with actual queso, which I prefer to shredded cheese. The guacamole was really good. Hubby liked his burrito, slathered it with green chile sauce.  I'm not a huge Mexican food fan, so anything positive coming from me is extra good. :)"}
{"text":"Probably still working out the kinks since the location is new. The food is good, on par with all the other locations. The portions are large and it's cheap! There was a line and only one person working, it also took about 35 minutes to get our cheese quesadilla and burrito. The patio was packed and the inside was literally empty. They give you a generous side of free chips (there were two of us and we got two bowls) and they have a salsa bar. The guy at the register was very nice, had a good attitude and smiled a lot. The guac was good also cheap! A 2oz is 0.99 and a 4oz is like 2.25? Lol so we got two 2oz so I didn't have to share and the germ freak in me didn't have to worry about double dipping. The soda fountain had no carbonation on any of the sodas so that was a bummer so I stuck with water. They serve alcohol and the margaritas looked popular! 

Bottom line, $7 for a two pound burrito, how could you go wrong?"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best menudo in town. They serve it all week but I suspect they make it fresh on the weekends.  Can't beat the price, $5.25 for a good size bowl, satisfies every time!"}
{"text":"Why 1 Star? Poor customer service; person taking order's never smiled; those behind the counter look like they are being forced to work there; it was dirty and in the end they refused to give us a refund when asked.

Basically, we have been going to Caramba's since they opened and have never had this problem. Been a while since we have been there and thought we would stop in. FAIL

Whether you agree with their prices and my story or not, the fact is, you should always be able to get a refund unless the business has it posted otherwise so people can decide if they want to shop/eat there or not.

I ordered a bowl of red chili for $6.50. This cost as much as a burrito, but I just wanted the red chili. When they went to make it, they got out a small 16 ounce bowl, a spoon full of shredded beef that was in it's own juice that they promptly squeezed out of it, filled the small bowl with shredded beef and then poured a little red sauce over the top. I wanted red chili... as in it has been marinated in red chili sauce, not having the sauce poured on the top and have a lid slapped on. This taste no different then buying roast beef and a can of red chili at the store and pouring over it. If you have never had red chili that has been marinated in red chili sauce, you need to find a place that does it because it's great. This place does not do this.

I simply preferred to get my money back, it wasn't worth $6.50. I could of had a whole burro for about that. When I asked the cashier, he never responded at first but just looked around. He argued about the bowl and simply said that's what the size has always been. Maybe so, but it's still not worth it. I watched them make a red chili burro (for basically the same price) and it had a large 16\" tortilla, more beef and a LOT more sauce. I simply said I would just like my money back. He looked disgusted, went off into a small office and was gone for a while. When he returned he opened the drawer, looked down the line at my food still being put together, sighed and then says how did you pay for this. Really?? I had just paid him and no one else walked up there. I told him I used a VISA Debit card. He then stood there and fondled some money in the drawer then said our system has been down all morning, I have no way to give you your money back. How is it down because you used that same system to take my debit card to pay for it! He said he would give me store credit. I paid with a debit card... that means Caramba's ALREADY HAS MY MONEY. Just give me cash back. NOPE. We just took the crappy amount of food and left. When I got home, there wasn't enough red sauce to even cover the beef.

NO BUENO! We have been going here since they opened. I noticed a change in the staff and they have gotten more and more un-friendly. This is the last time we ever go there. To many other fast mexican food restaurants with same or better prices and food. There are 4 to 5 within a block! We will go else where.

It's still owned by the same brothers. Things have really changed. To bad, used to be a good place and good value. That's long gone. It is very un-usual to ever need to ask for a refund at a restaurant, but you need to b e aware that it's not going to happen here. Beware before you go."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.

Their carne asada burrito is the best I've had in the valley! I love it that you don't have to pay extra for the guacamole on the burrito!! And they have fantastic pico de gallo as well!

Great for a quick lunch or dinner...and I just realized they serve breakfast too! Breakfast served ALL DAY, at that! My friends even had their wedding rehearsal dinner here 2 years ago! Excellent and efficient service, no long line, happy man at the register...makes for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Disgusting and expensive. I got a combination plate enchilada (one shrimp and one chicken). The enchilada was a soggy mess! The beans were so old looking and dark brown. The taste was even worse. I had one bite and wanted to throw up. I didn't eat anymore of it and tossed it soon after."}
{"text":"Place is open at 8am for breakfast. Cashier was very nice and they have a great variety of salsas at the free salsa bar. Dining room is pretty big and there's outside seating, too. They have a bar for those who just want to come to drink and they use no lard. We ordered the green chili burrito (beef) and the chilaquiles with two eggs sunny side up. The chilaquiles were very bland. Would be so much better if the salsa had flavor. The burrito was ok but other places are better."}
{"text":"Can't go 5 starts cause I only ate there once..  Today I had the pleasure of trying their Pollo Fundido..  Mmmmmmmmmmm..  I am a big fan of Some Burros in Tempe.  This was easily as good or better.  Loaded with sauce, and the burro was fried just the perfect amount.  Next time, I am going to try their fajita burro and maybe eat in with one of the many beers they sell."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Been a long customer to this location. Welcome everytime we stop here."}
{"text":"The margaritas at this location are amazing!  I have limited myself to just 2 per visit because of how strong, yet delicious they are!  The dining area has a variety of salsas, the only qualm is that you have to get salsa yourself, which I don't mind doing, but the cups are pretty small. The  bartender is always attentive and personable, busy chatting with guests and refilling ice cold adult beverages.  This place fills up quickly with a lively crowd during happy hour."}
{"text":"Quantity over quality. I ordered the #10 Combo and it arrived not on one, but two large plates. More lettuce than one knows what to do with. The hard shell taco was chewy not crispy. I think the medium drink was three bucks, so fourteen total with tax."}
{"text":"I have visited this location three times in the last few months. My boyfriend and I sometimes stop by to sit at the bar top, order margaritas, and also some food. While we have always sat at the bar to be served there is an option to walk up to the front counter and order. The margaritas are strong so take it easy champ. We tried a few different type of tacos and the food is bland and easy to forget. They always give us free chips before our food is ready and there is a salsa bar where you serve yourself which hot sauces you want. I will return for the drinks but not the food."}
{"text":"Love this place, always good food, and fresh.  It's never slammed when we go there, so we get to sit and have an actual conversation without having to talk over people."}
{"text":"Yuck. Had a \"carnitas\" burrito. More like stewed, watery pork in a less-than-passable tortilla. My friend had the chicken and steak tacos. All I can say is BLECH. Made with something like American shredded cheese and then possibly deep fried; Jack In The Box makes better tacos. 
On another note, all the trash bins were overflowing. Nice touch (sarcastically said) to a less than spectacular burrito and taco experience."}
{"text":"If your looking for quick, cheap, good food, this be it.  Not much for atmosphere, but you get dependable food and good taste for your money.  Salsa bar is superb.  Why pay high dollar for your food when you can come here."}
{"text":"We have a lot of family get togethers at carambas! I love the staff and food! I think some things are high priced like the stuffed quesidilla and Mexican pizza but, what can you do. Best Mexican food around me."}
{"text":"This location just opened up 1/17/18.  It's right next door to LA Fitness.  Service was good and of course the place was clean.  I like the free chips and great selection of self serve salsa.  I tried a stuffed quesadilla 1/2 steak and 1/2 chicken - it was tasty and filling - I would recommend it.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Fast food that isn't cheap fast food quality. 

You order at the counter and take a number. You are given a bowl of thin, crispy white [always fresh] corn chips while you wait and help yourself to the salsa bar as your food is made fresh to order. The food is consistently very good, made with fresh quality ingredients that come together better than a lot of higher end Mexican restaurants. 

I have been eating here since this Caramba location opened and have always been happy with the fast friendly service and the delicious, generous portions. Even the margaritas are surprisingly good, but watch out, they are very generous with tequila. The atmosphere, prices and wait times are that of a typical fast food restaurant but here you get quality food - and besides margaritas, you also have the option to order a beer or sangria with your meal. I haven't tried their sangria yet, but I have noticed that some days it's red and others it's white. 

This restaurant is always squeaky clean: clean kitchen, restrooms, dining area, and patio.

Caramba's may not be the ideal place to bring a first date - maybe wait until date #3, this way you can impress them with your great taste AND your practical side all at once."}
{"text":"I really really like this place! It's in between that taco stand you go to after 10pm for your fix and a sit down full-service restaurant. And the food is awesome!

You enter the restaurant and order at the counter, where you pay and receive a number they call when your food is ready, then you go up and grab it. The guy worked the counter was super nice and efficient. You also get a little bowl of chips when you order. They have a large salsa bar by the door too, several options!

The interior is a nice open space, there's a bar by the windows and plenty of hi-top and lower tables. The corner is surrounded by a spacious patio, which is super nice and has a great vibe! The overall decor of the place is clean, modern and trendy. I wouldn't mind hanging out in here for a bit, not so much a place to quickly eat and leave as soon as you're done. 

I ordered the super nachos with chicken, which were amazing and totally worth the around 8 dollar price point. My girlfriend got chicken enchiladas which she enjoyed and also an order of the cinnamon chips which were $2.50.. expecting a little bowl of them, she got an entire large plate full!! Definitely enough for an entire family of people to indulge in a sweet treat. 

There was a trash can near the back door which I used, but I noticed they had someone clearing off tables quickly once a party left. Great service!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite mexican joints in arizona.  Chicken tacos and enchilladas are bomb."}
{"text":"We get super simple food here but it's always consistent and fresh. The margaritas are awesome and STRONG!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars (somewhere between A-OK and Yay!)

Caramba is the authentic Mexican version of a Baja Fresh or a Rubio's type of restaurant. It's a clean restaurant in a strip mall with a fairly extensive menu and a friendly staff. While I wouldn't qualify it as super healthy, it's definitely healthier than most Mexican food places (they don't douse everything in cheese and nothing seemed super-greasy). 

I got the machaca burrito - the meat was tender, not fatty, and had good flavor. It was wrapped in an authentic tortilla (no Mission/Taco Bell style tortillas for this girl). I loaded up on salsas at their salsa bar (pico, roasted tomato, medium, extra hot, chile verde, and more). I had the horchata to offset the spicier of the salsas (none were overly-intense). My burrito didn't come with any sides so I ordered some black beans... nothing special about them. I'd probably order something else next time. Overall, I really liked my meal!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is their cheap, super-strong margaritas and it's close enough for us to ride our bikes to. 

Otherwise it's the same menu as all the 'Berto's restaurants and Mixteca. I'm sure they all use the same food distributor too. I don't get why it's consistently busy."}
{"text":"I will start by saying, the food was decent , but the experience was why I gave this a 1 star. Not all 
 \"white\" people are \"white\". The skin might be but the ethnicity could surely be mixed with Mexican/Spanish. The cooks , and guys working there were disgusting , and forget that they may not be the only ones who speak Spanish. Making nasty comments about a woman in the restaurant made my food taste like shit. An sending guys out from the back to have a look was a bit tasteless also. Mind you this woman was a mother of children. I would rather take my wife and kids to Taco Bell after tonight. Very disappointing , considering that the \"token boy\" -manager had no problem with any of this. It's no wonder 3  people came in to eat in the 45 minutes we were there. I think these men forgot that they weren't in the Tijuana strip club there used to. Not the \"donkey show\" Jotos, relax a little."}
{"text":"Soooo glad there;s a newer location here with carambas in it and this building now now has a lucrative business in it.  (prior business have changed frequently)
GREAT they are a mom & pop!
You cant get any better Mexican pizza, Tacos, or their GIANT Caramba Burrito and for the prices they are affordable and fill you up!!
Their pico de gallo is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Im not gonna lie, I freakin love this place. Lolz Their chip and salsas is amazing, andddd rhey have different kind of salsas for you to choose as well.

My vegetarian chimhunga was perfect. The texture to it was heaven in my mouth. But they slapped on wayyyy too much sour cream.  Orher than that, I like this place."}
{"text":"This is always a must stop when I visit Phoenix. My favorite thing to order is the Mexican Pizza. It's a cheese crisp with machaca beef, olives, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole and green onions!  It is THE BEST!!  Definitely huge, so two can share.  They have a salsa bar with a bunch of different kinds of salsas, as well as jalepeños.  My favorite of their salsas is the fire roasted, it has such a delicious smoky flavor.  My husband always gets the Super Caramba Burrito.  It's huge!!!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I was on a nacho kick.  I came here for lunch one day and decided to try out some nachos.  I ordered the Caramba Super Nachos with Chicken.  I had a water to drink.  Total was right around $8.00.  They give you a little bowl of chips with your order.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, my nachos were up.  Here is how they were............

Caramba Super Nachos-  Before my nachos were even ready, I was really digging on their chips.  They are thin, crispy and pretty darn delicious.  I soon realized that these were HORRIBLE chips for nachos though.  They were too thin and broke apart way too easily.  These nachos were topped with the usual toppings like cheese, beans, pico, sour cream, guacamole etc.  They came with 2 types of cheese....shredded and nacho.  I'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos.  I prefer just shredded cheese.  The nacho cheese tasted ok though so it wasn't nasty.  The chips were really a killer though.  I probably only had about 5-10 chips that I could actually scoop stuff up with.  The rest of the chips were too flimsy, broke in half, or were covered with toppings.  I gave up pretty quick and grabbed my fork, mixed everything together and ate it like it was a nacho salad.  The chicken they use is a little funky too.  I'm pretty sure its boiled.  It didn't have much flavor and was too \"wet\".  I picked around most of it.

Overall, not the least bit impressed.  I doubt I am coming back to try out any of their other offerings.  It wasn't gross/disgusting food, and I did eat most of the nachos,  but for the price and taste, I will be heading elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Getting the wife to agree on anything food wise, is tough.  She likes what she likes, and isn't down to \"broaden her horizons\" most of the time.  We wanted to get something for lunch today, and Mexican food came up.  I had been to a Caramba's by work once before, and I didn't like it (I got nachos, and their nachos just aren't that good!) and had never gone back.  Well, today was the day.  The wife wanted some shredded beef tacos, so I drove down here to grab them.

I walked up to the counter and placed my order for 2 beef tacos, a carne asada burrito, and an order of chips.  Total was around $16.50.  About that......they use a point of sale system which has you insert your card up top (didn't know where to swipe/insert card...cashier had to tell me), then the screen prompts you immediately if you want to add a tip.  I HATE THAT SHIT.  It's so uncomfortable and awkward standing there trying to find the \"no tip\" option on screen.  Smart for the business (probably make way more tips of guilt, rather than tips off of good service), but lame for the customer.  Anyways.....finally got my order in and took a seat to wait for my food.  Filled up some salsa cups, my number was called, and I was on my way.  Here is how the food was...................

Carne Asada Burrito- San Diego quality?  Nope.  Good for Arizona?  Eh, decent at least.  The carne asada tasted fine, and it had a decent amount of guacamole throughout.  A little \"hot\" and \"soupy\" near the bottom, and it did blow out during the last 1/4 due to a sub par tortilla.  I ate the whole thing, and it would be considered an average AZ burrito.  I have had better burritos (no such thing, really, but....AZ burritos don't have shit on CA burritos) in AZ, but this thing wasn't nasty at least.  Not worth the $7.00 price tag, but it was still ok.

Chips-  These were great!  They were incredibly thin and crispy and reminded me of My Nana's chips you can buy in the grocery stores here in Phoenix. (If you have never had My Nana's chips, and you live in the Phoenix area, you are missing out!  My Nana's are the best damn tortilla chips you can buy at the store.  They are delicious!).  I grabbed a bunch of salsas, and went to town!  Great, great chips!  

My wife thought her beef tacos were good.  A tad pricey coming in at $3.20 per taco, but it satisfied her craving and they looked good.

Lunch was ok.  Wasn't great, wasn't bad.  Average.  A-OK.  Will I be back?  Maybe?"}
{"text":"Carambas has the best red chile in my opinion!  The food is excellent and prepared quick enough.  It is fresh, tasty, and a fantastic value.
I highly recommend getting flour chips plain and using that to dip in salsa and beans, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Ok, not the great fajitas lots of onions no meat. Tostadas are not that great ship Tostadas I guess I was hungry. Did not like this place I'm still hungry!"}
{"text":"I actually crave this place all the time when I think of quick mexican food. Love the shredded beef enchiladas. Thier refried beans are perfectly seasoned. Lettuce and tomatoes always fresh,. Been here several times and Ill definetly keep coming back. They have a sign out front about original owners being back although I never noticed a difference in the food. Its always good. They have salsa bar thats open thats nice. Have a little bar inside (full bar) with tv for sports.. when I say little I mean it seats about 6 people. lol.. They make the strongest margaritas Ive ever had. YUM! One of my fave places to go."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. The staff is friendly, but that's all they got going. I ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada. I got a shrimp cocktail on a tostada with 3 shrimps. You can't put shrimp cocktail on a tostada and call it ceviche. My husband's BRC burrito had so much beans and hardly any rice or cheese. We were really looking forward to some good food after a long drive."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place for cheap, fast, great Mexican. Shredded beef tacos are the best I've had. Cheese crisps are always cooked perfectly, and free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Amazing food at incredible prices. My wife and I stumbled across Caramba Mexican Food on our way to Pita Jungle and we were so glad we tried it out. We've been fans of Arriba and Popo's in the past, but value for money this restaurant can't be beat!!! We had chicken tacos, a tamale, and the green chile beef. All were delicious and our bill was only $20!! The staff are incredibly friendly and our wait for food was only 5 minutes. Would highly recommend coming here, and we look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Their carne asada burros are just plain awesome, and love their rolled tacos, too. I have tried almost their entire menu, and have always had a good meal.  They are clean and fast, too.  The Glendale Ave location is just as good."}
{"text":"What can I say... The Giant Caramba Burrito is ridiculous, great tacos, fajitas and green chili. It's a step up from a 'bertos' type place but not quite a great sit down restaurant. 

They have a pretty good Mexican beer selection. My wife got the sangria tonight very tasty and only $3.50. Just like the other reviews watch out if you order more than one margarita!

Lastly the fried ice cream is dang good!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a quick meal. 5 stars cause it's not super greasy and they serve margaritas. Plenty of seating here and has a convenient location."}
{"text":"use to go to the one in glendale, but this one is closer to my work so i decided to grab some food. i always get the stuffed quesadilla with carne asada. omg its so good! so filling can share it among 2 people. its like 9 bucks and some change but so worth it. must try."}
{"text":"We LOVE Carambas.  We come here often.  They're always so friendly and the food and service is excellent.  This place reminds me of a restaurant in Yuma where I grew up , feels like comfort food to me!  Definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for fresh mex made to order. Salpicon salad is a favorite. Breakfast burros best in town. Not measuring them against unrealistic expectations; they are fast , fresh, friendly, and consistent. We eat here 2/3 times a month for 20+ years, and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a long day of shopping and moving with a few friends. The overall cleanliness of the establishment was good. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a Red Chili burro plate - came with rice and side of beans - Lets just say I was very disappointed . The Rice was dry and bland - the Red Chili burro had no flavor at all, to top it off they wanted to charge you 25 cent for a refills! It's bad enough the fountain drinks were two or more dollars! tisk tisk."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and got a cheese enchilada & taco combo plate. The food was decent. You walk up and order from the counter and take a seat and wait for your number to be called. There are several fresh salsas to self- serve yourself and a big patio if you prefer to sit outside. Don't come here if your looking for full service or to just sit and drink. They do have a bar but no bartender & the bar sits pretty empty. This is definitely a quick lunch place rather than a full service Mexican restaurant. You also bus your own table."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a little kid and this place never disappoints. This is not a restaurant where the waiter brings your food to your table so if that's what your looking for I don't suggest you come here. But if you want to grab a bite to eat or get your food to go, this is the spot. There's a salsa bar and there all really good. I always get either a shredded beef chimi or a Mexican pizza."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great people. It's our go to spot when we want good Mexican food and don't want to break the bank."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person to grade on a curve  or give reviews for places like Denny's. It's either pretty good, or a pretty bad experience...

Caramba's has been a quick, consistent stop for years to get a good fix of moderately priced Mexican food. Well things have been slowly sliding downhill for the last couple years.
It's getting a little run down. And, the owners are not very attentive anymore.
The consistency is now completely out the window. The portion size is hit or miss.
About 40% of the time I am very disappointed. Some part of the order is either wrong or not made properly. As long as I stick with things like taco's, cheese crisp, or salads where I can see everything I ordered when I pick it up. Things are somewhat ok..
I just ordered a fajita burrito and counted 7 layers of tortilla over the whole top of the wrap. all of the way across and 3 layers on the bottom. I kept hoping somewhere in there I was going to find some meat. Well there was very, very little. And at over $10 wet with guacamole. (which comes with it if you don't order enchilada sauce) it wasn't cheap. The way things are now with consistency. The quirky things like charging for soda refills, having to ask for napkins, and the bland salsa bar are annoying. Remembering how things were years ago, I keep wanting to give them another chance. But, it will be a long time before that happens again.."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran style Mexican food I've found and I go to a lot of Mexican food restaurants.  Pollo Fundido is covered in spicy cream cheese sauce.  Chimichangas are big and crispy.  Cheese Crisp is edge to edge with cheese, best eaten fresh out of the oven while the cheese is still melted.  Margaritas are the BEST!  Yes they come out of a juice dispenser into a plastic glass, but if tangy lime and a proper amount of tequila are your guides, there is none better.  Order \"easy ice\" and one is plenty.

Taste, quantity, price - checks all the boxes.  You can pay more and get less but you won't find better.

My beef with other Mexican restaurants; tiny cheese crips, soggy chimichangas, watered down drinks and high prices.

Why go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a sunset dinner. I had the beef tacos and my wife had a bean burro. The service was very good and fast. The food was delicious and recommendable. Their salsa bar has several choices and they are not labeled. Therefore, you have to try one of each until you find the one you like."}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed Caramba's?!?!? I've been eating at this place for at least the past 13 years. It's a family favorite and you might say it's been a little bit more than a staple of my diet for nearly as long.

My two most favorite meals from Caramba's are the bean and cheese burrito (fresh tortillas and the perfect mix of cheese to beans) and the chicken quesadilla. Oh, how I miss my chicken quesadillas since I went vegetarian. Delicious grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, sour cream, and then add some of their amazing mild salsa, and you'll seriously be in heaven.  My dad is a huge fan of their machaca burrito, and he's pretty picky when it comes to machaca. So I'd have to trust him and believe that it's pretty darn good.

They also have a decent beer selection (Mexican beer of course), with margaritas available too. Free bowl of warm chips and freshly made salsa with every meal, lunch or dinner for under $10 and at least two locations (Bell Rd. and Glendale Rd.)."}
{"text":"I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga combo. Not a fan of the carrots and peas (which is most likely frozen - which they advertise they don't serve \"frozen\" food) they put in the spanish rice (gross) or the brown sludge they call \"beans.\" The chimichanga was alright. Other than the fact that they probably keep the shredded beef sitting in water or beef juice of some sort, when they put it in the tortila, wrap it up, and fry the tortilla, the beef is still kinda watery so when u cut open the chimichanga, theres a pool of water at the bottom, which makes the chimichanga soggy. AHHHHH

Salsa bar is a joke, especially if you order something to go, because they do not supply lids for the salsa containers. Also, none of the salsa is labeled!! So you have no idea which is hot, or mild, or chipotle flavored, or whatever. You have to pretty much take a wild guess as to which one is the one you want, and hope for the best.

Its not the worse place, I have definitely had worse, I did enjoyed about half my dish. Honestly would rather go to FIlaberto's around the corner and get a chimichanga for a couple bucks less and tastes better.

Next time if I ever end up back here, I will most likely try something different."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Mexican food (and I hesitate to use the word Mexican because it insults good Mexican food) I have EVER had. If this is \"The best Phoenix has to offer\" as the sign reads, eat in Tucson."}
{"text":"Overall, I really like this place. Food is just as good as a full service rest. Margaritas are strong & tasty. The only recommendation that i could make is to pay a little more attention to the details. For example, the beans are just semi-warm making it feel like cafeteria food. The cheese on top of each item is ice-box cold & just literally clumped on top of my tostada. I am really happy with the salsa varieties, esp the medium salsa. Its wonderfully spicy, yum."}
{"text":"just moved into the area and was looking for my new \"go to\" place and Carambas definitely is it. Heather and Molly are awesome and the vibe is great."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite mexican food restaurants. My family has been eating at the original location about once a week since 1997 of 1998.  We now go to all the locations, just depends on where we are in the valley. There has not been a thing on the menu that I have tried that I did not love. If you are looking for fresh, fast mexican food this is definitely worth the stop. My favorite is a bean and cheese burro and a beef taco."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to Caramba for years and have always had good experiences. We have always left good reviews also. Today was not the best experience unfortunately. My daughter ordered a bean and cheese burrito and got a beef burrito instead. It was an easy fix, they remade it right away for her. I ordered a chicken burrito and my chicken was called as well as the enchilada sauce. So I wasn't really happy with this experience.

Additionally, something that really made me a bit nauseous, I saw employee wiping out chip bowls with a towel rather than washing/sanitizing them. The same employee took the chip bowls and emptied them out over the garbage, sometimes hitting it on the garbage can to get everything out. Pretty sure that is against health code."}
{"text":"Great food. Great variety on menu choices.

Now, can someone clarify the soda refill policy?  One sign says \"25 cents please\", and another just says \"25 cent refills\".  Why bother pinching pennies to try to charge for refills when the sodas are the standard high price that should come with refills included?  

This is the only restaurant I know of that charges for refills on fountain drinks. So odd.

Chips are good. Salsas are delicious."}
{"text":"This location has a little bar. Seating about the same as another location. Menu prices appear same. Bell road location seems more open and spacious."}
{"text":"'Where you don't peso much\" is the self-professed theme on the logo, but it couldn't be further from the truth.  Burritos and entrees are $5-9 and this is a casual, pretty much fast food place.  side of nachos?  extra side taco?  you're easily pushing $12-15.

Every burrito I've tried, whether bean and cheese or breafkast burrito, is always somehow dry as a bone.  Tortillas are dry and have a cotton like dry chewy texture.

Talk radio and/or music is always in Spanish and quite loud.  This is good for drowning out the loud baby crying three tables over, but it can get annoying after awhile (especially when it is Spanish talk radio).  

Tables were dirty.  They charge you for soft drink refills.  They hoard the napkins behind the counter.  There's limited seating during prime dining hours."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere. Nice employees. Maybe a slight language barrier, both times I've ordered something was wrong, but they happily fixed. 
Delicious breakfast burrito, awesome hot sauce/salsa bar. Love their chimichangas & fried tacos! One of our favorite Mexican food restaurants!"}
{"text":"Old owners are back so I thought I would try it again. Same lousy food. I picked up the food to go and it was already cold. The tacos had so much grease dripping from them I collected it to change my car oil. SO needles to say I am done with them!"}
{"text":"Great food for a good price!!! Been going to this place for years,  I would recommend the carne aside burrito."}
{"text":"The fish tacos rock

GREAT margaritas!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican food place in Phoenix! I have come here several times now and every single time my food has been perfectly made and delicious. My favorite menu item are the tacos, so simple and so delicious. They are always filled with meat and stacked with lettuce, cheese, and tomato. I feel like I have a taco salad left on my plate to eat when I finish my tacos! Their guacamole is some of the best in town. All of the ingredients look and taste very fresh as well. There is a salsa bar that has a wide variety of fresh made salsas to use. You can pick as many as you want and refill as needed. Keep in mine the fountain drinks do not have free refills but only cost 25 cents to refill! If you want to share a soda with someone or take some for the road, bring in some change."}
{"text":"Well, soo far, I really love this place! As for the taste, I think this is best Mexican restaurant I've ever tried so far! hubby and I have not been here, we just passed by this place..didn't consider trying, until a friend recommended this place to us..and it's actually great! Very impressive! 
The ambience is cool, I mean I like the \"fiesta\" theme with all the \"banderitas\" hanging! Love it! ^_^ 
Keep uit guys! We are going to be regulars here for sure"}
{"text":"The only two items that hit the mark on our order was the guacamole and margaritas, the rest of our food not so good. My shredded beef taco was luke warm in the center of the beef, sign of a bad pre-made taco not fully cooked. My fish taco had a bland fish stick for the fish, very sad with horrible corn tortillas that just fell apart and disintegrated when trying to eat. My wife's food equally had issues but will leave it there. 

Sat at the bar after we ordered from the ordering cashier, no service from the two employees working the bar at all. Big miss on their part as my wife and I would have ordered more cocktails. Strange and bizarre set up with a separate bar and food ordering cashier area, who knows if the bar offers food service at all. Drinks also ordered at food counter, strange concept. Bar looks great and like a staffed full service bar, but no interaction from bar tenders. Why staff it if they are not going to sell drinks to customers sitting and eating at it. 

It's a new location but an established brand who has been around, not their first rodeo. Maybe just working the bugs out or just bad management. Not worth the money nor time to eat here. We were disappointed with our food and experience, and could not understand the order counter and separate no service staffed bar concept."}
{"text":"The service is fast which gives this place its first star. I ordered a prickly pear margarita lacking in flavor and had too much ice. I also ordered the supreme nachos ..... the top of the nachos had real cheese yay.... the bottom well.... looks like they pulled out the nice old spray cheese for that... grossssssss! The second star goes to the salsa bar!! Yummm!!! The last star goes to the patio, lots of room for people and the lighting is nice!"}
{"text":"The Giant Carumba Burrito for $5.95 are you kidding me, this is 3 meals for me. Burrito takes up the entire aluminum tin with lettuce tomatoes and sauce. Even though it is huge still has good taste, I get the beef and it is served wet in the enchilada sauce. 

Also comes with chips and has a small good salsa bar.

You order at the counter and they call your number to pick up the food. 

If you are looking for a fast inexpensive good quality clean Mexican restaurant, this is it, They do live up to their motto \"Where you don't PESO much!\"

For the money you spend and the food you get it is a 5 star, but 5 star is an over the top restaurant for me.

Use to go to the one in Glendale, but with work have been coming for lunch to the one on Bell Road. Same good service and food"}

{"text":"very similar to all the other chain Mexican restaurants...nothing else to say"}
{"text":"I like their salsa spread and love the tamales. The only issue that I have with Carmba's is that the food if you ask me is a little pricey for a fast casual Mexican restaurant. The price is very similar to a full service restaurant so am a little disappointed. Otherwise the food is great and most of the folks that work here are very friendly."}
