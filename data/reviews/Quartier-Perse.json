{"text":"Located right outside Villa-Maria metro station, Quartier-Perse is a persian restaurant with many available seating. I was there on a Saturday night with ten friends celebrating. I was told by the organizer that she could not get a reservation because no one had answered the phone. Thus, she had to get there early so that we got a big table. When I first looked at the menu, I noticed that we only had two major selections: kebabs and stews. I ordered the lamb shank stew myself. We were first served sliced up pita bread with butter. Next, our lentil soup came. It was chunky with lentils, beans, barley, and spices. Even with this many ingredients, the soup itself was bland, but a bit of salt and pepper fixed it. Next, my lamb shank came.  I was first surprised as they served me the shank whole still on the bone separate from my rice. The lamb itself was fall off the bone tasty. The rice was cooked perfectly. The sauce, however, was again, slightly bland. I think the stew would have been improved by adding some vegetables to enhance the flavour, but perhasp that would no longer be an authentic persian dish. According to my friends, the kebabs were alright. To finish off the meal, they served us tea.
Overall, portion size were large, and many of my friends did not finish their meal. However, I thought it was slightly pricey. If the food was just slightly better, maybe it would have warranted the price. Service overall was friendly, and we were so comfortable around them."}
{"text":"Best Persian restaurant in Montreal. The menu has a variety of selection, from kabobs to delicious stews. 

The basmati rice is cooked perfectly and the meet is so juicy. They also have great appetizers. Very affordable prices, great ambiance, a nice cozy place great for a romantic dinner or a family event. 

Last but not least, amazing tea and desserts to finish your meal. Basically this restaurant is a sure bet. Try this restaurant you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best kabob in Montreal!!! Family owned and operated great ambiance and excellent food."}
{"text":"Bad service ..chatty waitress more invested in remembering your name than bringing what you ask for. Bland food lacklustre presentation and music so loud barely possible to talk to table mates. Not very good dining experience."}
{"text":"Very good food, amazing lamb, huge portions! Definite must."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Quartier-Perse after it was recommended to me by an Iranian acquaintance....unfortunately I was disappointed by the food and treatment of the owners...we were a party of 5, we had a reservation and we arrived at 5:30, the restaurant was empty except for one very loud party of people celebrating a birthday....we were seated at the table right next to them that happened to be by the entrance...immediately we asked our waiter to seat us somewhere else away from them as the restaurant was empty...but we were told that the WHOLE restaurant was reserved, and there was no available table except the one given to us...it was hard to believe her as she said the restaurant was reserved 2 weeks ago...anyway we didn't argue with her and resigned to the table that was given to us. As soon as we settled in our seats, the birthday people started singing happy birthday super loud...I don't mind people having a bit of fun, but after the initial birthday song is over It would be expected that things will calm down so other people can enjoy their dinner....but one extremely annoying guy kept singing happy birthday over and over in a loud ugly voice...and there was no attempt to stop him...he ruined our dinner!
As for the food it was just ok, I've had much better Persian food somewhere else. I ordered filet mignon and chicken, the chicken was good but filet mignon very chewy and definitely not tender.
Would I go back here or recommend this restaurant to anyone...sadly no I wouldn't...it was an evening wasted where I could have spent it somewhere else much better and definitely been better treated"}
{"text":"Good persian food.
Large portion. Tender chicken-kebab and lamb. 
Go there for the food, not the service. 
Service either abrupt and not attentive, forgetful too. 
Ice-cream Rosewater Saffron delicious."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER GO AGAIN! Keep whatever you find in your food as a proof, no matter how disgusting it is; otherwise they'll deny it! Went to this place twice, found something in the food each time, once a stone and hair next time. When we reported the problem to the manager we were told it is impossible and they behaved as if we were lying!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice
In both of which I enjoyed the food and the friendly Persian girls who serve the customers
Make sure you try Barg and Koobide. They offer almost the best in the city.
You can also bring your own wine and they serve it at the table. This many save u few bucks ;)
The ambiance is not as I expect. However it is well lit, average noisy and friendly seated.
The bill ends up higher than other kebab serving restaurants in Montreal but all in all it is worth it !"}
{"text":"Quartier Perse is a well established and deservedly popular restaurant that does amazing things to rice and kabobs.
This will come as a shock to some, but Persian rice is the penultimate way of preparing rice. It's fluffy and chewy and delicious in a way that no other culture has managed to surpass. 

To start, we chose a few bowls of Zeytoon Parvardeh, an olive dish with pomegranate paste, walnuts, garlic and herbs. These were eye-crossingly yummy.

As a meat aficionado, you should probably order the Soltani #2 combo - a beautiful plate upon which there is a mountain of buttered rice and two kabobs. One, the \"Barg\", is a beef filet marinated to perfection and cooked to your preference. The other, the \"Koubideh\" is a minced beef that also is mouth-wateringly delicious. You can shake a little of the powdered Sumac spice on your meat and rice for an added touch of authenticity.

Being the Designated Driver I treated myself to a glass of Doogh - a drink that my Iranian friend assured me went well with the cuisine. He was right. Doogh is a savory yogurt based drink that was minty and salty and went perfectly with the meal. He said that Doogh is an acquired taste but really, it took me only two sips to appreciate the beverage and to welcome it into my inventory of \"Exotic Things That I Tried That I Thought I Might Not Like But Liked Anyway\". My table-mates had the wine that we brought with us. (Quartier Perse is also BYOB in addition to having a Wine and Beer license)

What I couldn't eat was loaded into a Styrofoam container and the inevitable discussion with the Missus was had. \"Shall we feed the leftovers to the kittens or not?\" I voted for my stomach, not theirs and happily savoured my leftover Koubideh and rice the next day."}
{"text":"I love this Persian restaurant. Aside from the delicious and authentic Persian cuisines, the staffs are so friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is seeking for great food."}
{"text":"The good: It's really close to the metro (Villa Maria).
The food: It was  OK. Really not better than other Persian restaurants in Montreal. We did enjoy it (and the company) so it wasn't a wasted evening, but it's nothing to come back for. 
The service: Almost non-existent. Really one of the worst. 
They made  a mess of the reservation and stressed out the birthday boy (who picked the place and booked for a group of 20). When we came in it was 7 pm and 45 minutes later, we still didn't get menus. Finally we asked for them but then they didn't come to get an order for 20 minutes (that's right - until we asked for it!). I shared the Table d'h√¥te for two with a friend. She had a salad (meh) and I enjoyed the soup. There was also some pita bread with butter (meh). The main course had not arrived until 9:15 pm (yes - that's more than two hours after we arrived). We had almost got up to pay and leave, but they kept saying it's coming in just a few minutes (it didn't...). When they served the main course, we had to wait 5 minutes for the rice, and the food got a little cold by the time we started eating (but not totally cold - because the restaurant is not air conditioned - it was freaking hot!). The food was tasty but nothing wow (as my friend put it - \"Ce correcte\" ). After that came tea and baklava sweets. By the time we got out of there it was 22:45. Almost four hours - that's a bit much for dinner.  After all that they tried to impose a mandatory 15% tip! Super rude!
The toilets were not very clean. They only have one stall for men and one for women (and it's a big place).
The acoustics are really bad - it got very loud and it wasn't easy to talk to the people sitting across from you.
It's a bad place for vegetarians - They might enjoy some of the starters, but the only main dish for them is grilled veggies with rice - not very attractive."}
{"text":"The food is not as good as I'd heard about it. There are much better options with higher qualities! But, what made me really disappointed was the impolite behaviour of the owner/manager! I ordered a Soltani # 2 which includes a Barg and a Koobide Kabab. I had tried a little bit of the food that I noticed I am chewing a piece of long hair! I took that out, and then found two more pieces!!! When we reported the problem to the servers, manager came to us asking for the proof!!! Then he took whatever I had spat out to find the hair!!! It was so disgusting!!! He then sent a message that he could not find anything! That's so rude!
I do not recommend this place to anyone at all!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the overall food quality, it was Okay i guess but definitely not great, The Lamb Shank I had was flavourless and lacking any taste of spices as it should be. The soup lacked flavour as well, I had to add a lot of salt to give it any semblance of taste. 

The staff were aggressive towards the group as we had kids with us, whom were sharing meals and 2 people in a group of 14 just wanted desserts, then the owner came over and explained that we were taking up the places of other potential customers and that she pays rent and giving us excuses why we should be ordering main courses. She was that close to having 14 people walk out and none of us ordering. 

I am not condoning the behavior of the people in our group, but honestly the staff and owners response was rude and unnecessary.  

This restaurant has it customers from the community, I am sure they are happy with the amount of traffic they get now and would not care for more paying customers. The owner did try to be nice when we were paying our bills, but honestly my advice to them; is to try to get repeat customers not look at the now of it or the quick buck.

I for one found the overall experience too much and will not be returning there as just down the road there is  a similar restaurant that has more space, better food quality, same quantity, cheaper and nicer staff."}
{"text":"A treasure in Montreal culinary landscape. Owned and operated by kind, energetic, and warm ladies, Le quartier perse offers authentic, delicious Persian/Iranian cuisine. The food is simply amazing, as though it has come out of a talented kitchen in Iran. The ambaince is cozy, the service is superb,  and if you bring your own wine, you will have a memorable time. Finish off your experience with a Persian, saffron and rose water based ice cream."}
{"text":"It's a bring your own wine Persian restaurant.
Everything was good but only good.
There are better options for the same price range"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5. Hilarious friendly staff, and we had the terrasse to ourselves to slowly make our way through the wine we had brought and the tasty dipping sauces and the piles of perfectly roasted meat. 

Located right next to Villa Maria's beautiful green grounds and conveniently next to the metro as well this is a great spot for local families. Plates are all around the $25 range and are easily shareable since portion sizes are quite huge. I shared the table d'hote with a friend which meant we got to try the filet mignon, chicken, and ground beef options plus a pile of grilled veg on lovely soft rice. Everyone agreed that everything was cooked perfectly, and the flavouring was nice but we could have all used a homemade hot sauce option rather than the Frank's (??!?!) we were offered when we asked. Really nice night though and a decent option for families and friends looking for BYO in NDG."}
{"text":"One of the best (or even the best) Persian Kebab houses in town. I haven't tried many of their dishes, but the grills are definitely worth trying. You can also bring your own wine, which is a good idea, since there is no socially accepted way of matching Persian dishes with good wine, and it is very much a matter of taste. Wine can definitely go with Persian grills. I suggest a rather tannin and spicy red to accompany your Barg, Soltani or Koobideh. It is less fun to have wine with Tagine-like Khoresh dishes, although I don't deny that some combinations may work.

Back to Quartier Perse, it is absolutely not the place you want to go on a date. The environment is super noisy, and there are, in many cases, families with shouting and crying kids. Go there when you are really hungry and ready to taste authentic-tasting Persian food. The portions are generous, so the being really hungry part is a requirement. The waiters (and from the look of them I guess this is a family business) are not the kindest or the most patient you have ever seen. I would have removed a star because of the careless service if this was not my main source of Kebab!"}
{"text":"Not so great. I have been to many Persian restaurants and this one is below par.  Rice was not fresh and served semi warm (pad of butter did not melt when placed on rice).
Chicken was less than juicy.
Sat on the patio - not so inviting.  Flower pots were vacant of flowers.  Sorry, won't return any time soon.
The two stars go towards the waitress - friendly, warm and talkative."}
{"text":"I found these kebabs a little bit too seasoned. They were \"just ok\". It wouldnt be my first choice in Montreal. 

The waitress was very rude also."}
{"text":"Wooooooow, I mean woooooweeee wow wow. I never tasted such delicious juicy kababs like this before. Quatier perse is a Persian cuisine restaurant that deserves a five star review. The menu is vast and well explained, the portion are big and you will probably leave with leftovers. The food is delicious, the rice has a wonderful fragrance to it and it's light and fluffy. The pieces of filet mignon melt in your mouth. The chicken brochette is juicy and full of taste. The ambiance is nice, at times noisy but not disturbing. The staff is very friendly and want to make you feel at home. Best part is you can bring your own wine. This restaurant has gone into my all time favourites and I suggest everyone should at least go there once, it will be love at fist bite."}
{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday party and it was a nice experience with pros and cons.

Pros

- Contrary to prior reviews, service was nice. Parvan√® (sp?) was our waitress and beyond the unexpected seating change mentioned below she was great all night.

- The meats and rice were delicious! The kebabs were juicy and tender and I ate... SO MUCH. Loved the Barg. 

- It's a BYOW, which is always a nice thing.

- Big terrace

- Location is beside highway and metro. Parking can be a pain but was lucky.

Cons

- We were moved about 15 minutes after we sat down, instead of the comfy couch seats we were placed in the corner with a little less elbow room to work with. This has happened rarely in my life and I thought it was poor form even with some verbal apologies given.

- Extremely loud! About halfway into the evening I was falling asleep as I zoned out from all the noise. The patrons here LOVE to scream conversation to eachother. I don't know Farsi but I felt part of a few conversations for sure.

- Doough drink was a little smaller than I'd like. How am I going to wash down this massive plate of rice with this small glass? I'm unsure if this is the standard with Persians but in other similar cuisines, the Doough glass was twice as big.

I liked my experience here. Price-tag was about average."}
{"text":"Very accessible (next to Villa-Maria metro). Friendly service, but difficult to get their attention (had to remind them a few times to bring water/other drinks). Average tasty food, but VERY expensive for Persian food. Better alternatives out there for Persian food."}
{"text":"This was my first ever Persian/Iranian restaurant. Was lucky to have an Iranian friend take me there and she knew her way around the menu. Most everyone in the restaurant are locals and most of them speak Farsi so the restaurant has a wonderful authentic vibe. Its a family owned place and its clear they know many of the patrons by first name. We had Saffron rice, Kababs and Pork with pomegranate sauce. The flat bread/pita was tasty. They have a interesting wine policy as they don't serve any but your welcome to bring a bottle of your own and they will supply the glasses. A great little find in Mantreal...thank you PN and R for the great dinner!!"}
{"text":"Tres tendre viande, bon service, apportez votre vin, bcp de places, pain servi chaud ce qui me reconforte."}
