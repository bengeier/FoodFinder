{"text":"We are so happy such a great place has opened up here.  An actual real pub!  The food is great, better than you would expect from a neighbourhood pub.  The owners have been there every time we have been in and they really seem to care.

We will become regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a pint and burger. The bad thing is that about 3-4 months ago they decided that kids were no longer allowed...  this used to be an amazing place to go with my daughter and wife for dinner.  They tried to surprise me for Father's Day today too, but the quote rude waitress told us that kids were never allowed because it's a bar and rolled her eyes at us."}
{"text":"Good service but the food was very disappointing. I paid $19 for a meal and then they charged me for a takeout container on food that was very slimy and dry."}
{"text":"My family and I went last weekend on their Grand Opening the food and drinks were good minus the loud annoying bag pipes,  hence the Grand Opening.
Hubby and I came back today n had a drink n an appy.  The basket of deep fried mushrooms were really good.  As is their fish n chips.  Next time,  the shepherds pie. 
I have seen at least 6 establishments in this location over the last 6 years,  hopefully these guys can make a good go of it n stay."}
{"text":"Always a good place for a pleasant meal or  conversational draft without blaring canned music or sports TV. You can watch the sports if you wish but the place is aimed at conversations among friends. I've taken friends and family (even groups of my wife's friends for lunch) and haven't heard one complaint about the ambiance, food or experience. For those living in Cedarbrae and Braeside it is a treat to have neighbourhood pub where you can relax and enjoy a night out. I specially like the fact that you  can go out with friends for a beak at th end of an afternoon fternoon of husbandly chores around the house and decrease your stress levels by a considerable factor,"}
{"text":"Service was great, fish & chips were outstanding! A very close second to their neighbors Joeys Urban."}
{"text":"This is a new neighborhood Pub. One of the great things they have on the menu is there Clubhouse ($16 with fries) and as someone who is gluten-free this is something that I absolutely crave for and will go out of my way to go and get. I'm not sure where they got their gluten-free buns but they are amazing, most places charge $1-$2 for gluten free substitute and they are a little on the steep side with a $3 extra charge making the meal $19...But the buns are soft and taste homemade, also, the fries are homemade and not battered. They are GF, but fried in the same oil as the battered mushrooms. That being said..... I keep going back for more. :)"}
{"text":"For once an actual trendy, modern pub in the area. All authentic Irish dishes with great prices and even better serving sizes! The owners were very friendly and very appreciative having us stop in for the first time. I ordered the big Ben burger...it was amazing! We will definitely be returning over and over again."}
{"text":"Great place to go for food and drinks, friendly people and nice and local for those living in Braeside!"}
