{"text":"The handful of low scores here is a travesty. This place is ha-MAZING.  My wife an i crave kathi rolls on a regular basis.  We always get the butter chicken roll.  i've strayed from the path twice before (once with a butter chicken curry, and once with their Mexican roll) and have been disappointed, because that butter chicken roll is so darned good.  The rolls are on the pricy side, and do not include any sides or veggies, but they are extremely filling, and dangerously delicious.  The owners are pleasantly nervous, and you can tell they're really eager to please.  They'll give you a loyalty stamp card if you ask.  The decor is awesome - a total India street food served-out-of-a-truck crossed with Bollywood vibe. They have a cozy back patio.  Whenever a friend visits me, i always take him or her to TKRE, and we always leave happy and full. Go there!"}
{"text":"The decor is amazing, I feel like I'm back in the subcontinent when I enter through the door here. It also helps that they have glass bottles of Limca & RC Cola.  For some reason, I had confused the Bengali word kathi with the Hindi word chaat, so I was immensely surprised on the actual food choices. Didn't seem really healthy at all, after reading the menu.  Note: they misheard my order, and gave me a free pop out of it, but I did find the food really tasty. I've heard other people say that the Jumbo is too small, but given that I'm on a diet and I knew I was cheating on the diet by eating here, I felt the Jumbo roll was a reasonable-sized meal.  Overall, great taste, great decor, really wishing the vegetarian options were healthy. This might become a once-in-a-month treat."}
{"text":"Having had Kathi rolls in NYC I was very excited to see this in Toronto.  I placed my order and opted to dine in.  Well we waited and waited and waited for our food.  Take out orders were being completed much quicker even if there orders were in well after ours.  Other dine in orders were completed before ours.  They are disorganized and don't seem to value the time of people that eat in vs take out.  When we finally got the food it was no longer hot.  Apparently part of our was being completed and as a result the rest of it got cold.    \"Stuff\" hits the fan when they get a few too many orders which speaks to they lack of organization.  When I mentioned this they did comp us part of our meal which made up for some of the frustration.  Aside from slow service the quality/flavour was average.  Does not come close to NYC quality.  Serving size also smaller then you will expect.    I may give them one more chance but will not be dining in unless I am willing to wait 1.5hrs."}
{"text":"The decor and food presentation are very nice, and the food is alright - but for the portions they serve, the prices are downright criminal. I walked in off the street and asked for the most popular item - it was an $11.29 Butter Chicken Kathi Roll. While the roll was decent (chicken was pretty dry but flavours were good), the size of the thing was comparable to a McDonalds Breakfast Burrito. I'd call it a snack rather than a meal. It's too bad the place doesn't sell these rolls for $5 - there would be lineups out the door!!"}
{"text":"For those who want a quick summary:  Service: Friendly staff, pushy waitress and SLOW service Ambience: Welcoming and cozy, but incomplete patio Food: VERY SALTY and not much other flavours  When I went to this place, I had Indian food cravings and I was with my dog. I didn't see a patio by its entrance on Yonge St, so I was going to pass. When the staff saw me looking in through their glass wall, I was very pleasantly surprised to receive warm greetings and was informed that they indeed had a back patio and my dog was welcome.   On my way to the patio, I glimpsed the inside - there were a couple tables occupied, one person ordering a take-out, but definitely not busy. The patio was completely empty, which I didn't mind. Which I didn't appreciate was that the patio was just bare minimun (only tables and chairs) with unfinished paint job, surrounded by condominium construction, and only one or two construction lighting present. Trying to keep an open mind, I was waiting for the server to come by. It took her almost 10 mins to finally show. My friend ordered an Indian beer 'King Fisher' ($4 beer special) and I simply just asked for a glass of water. She was polite and friendly but she insistingly doubted my drink choice (this continued throughout the meal till the moment we paid). I assured her that's what I wanted, although I knew she was disappointed she couldn't make another drink sale. In fact, her continued sales pitch was so frustrating and annoying.  About 4 mins later, the beer came, but my very lukewarm tap water in a styrofoam disposable cup came nearly after 10 mins.   Between the two of us, we ordered,   1. Korean Street Style BBQ Chicken Roll (Single size - $5.99) It was yummy with good flavour profile BUT definitely NOT KOREAN. I couldn't make any connection between the flavour and the reference to Korean food ( FYI, I am Korean).  2. Shrimp Masala Thai Style Roll (Double size - $10.99) First, we wanted to order just a single size and this time we gave into the server's sales push. She, again, insisted on upsizing because the single size has only 4 shrimp but the bigger one has 8-10. When we got our food, the double size only had 4 shrimp. I took a bite, and I hate to use such a strong word, but 'NASTY' is the only word that came to mind to describe the taste in my mouth accurately. The astounding amount of salt overpowered any other spices that might have been in there. The only reason I continued eating this is because I was so hungry from waiting so long to get the food - I regretted this decision very much since I had to constantly drink water all night to counter the amount of salt I put in in my body.  3. Aloo Chaat (Potato Salad) Again, the salty theme carried through. But this time, also a lot of black pepper.   Simple: I will not return."}
{"text":"How does this joint stay in business?!?!  I've never actually eaten there because of the incredibly rude and seemingly incompetent staff. My second attempt was today. After order a roll and waiting twenty minutes to be served, I approached counter to let the server know that I would not be waiting any longer (I took a second to look at the grill - there was zero sign of my roll being prepared). The server was on the phone - when I told him that I was leaving after he paused his conversation for a second - he said \"Yeah yeah yeah\" dismissingly.   Please do not waste your time, energy or money on this establishment. They do not deserve it."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The decor is inviting and gives it a much different feel than most Indian places I've visited - kind of a more modern, \"street\" style to it. They have tables at the back which you can wait at for your food, or eat in and grab a drink (yes, they're licensed). Good portion sizes, although a little pricey, it's made fresh, and the service is good. Yes, it takes a few minutes for your food to be made, but isn't that a good thing?"}
{"text":"I've had the papri chaat on multiple occasions. What frustrates me is the inconsistency in serving size. Sometimes they heap your plate up and others they barely give you a few bites.   The butter chicken roll is tasty however they don't cook the chicken in the tandoor as authentic butter chicken is supposed to be done.. This left me missing that lovely char flavour/taste."}
{"text":"Great service, amazingly delicious wraps, the butter chicken and naan were full of flavor and very delicious/fresh, fair prices, clean bathroom, very friendly staff.   Definitely will be coming back to this restaurant!  The reviews are quite all over the place on Yelp, but if you're looking for tasty Indian street food.. This is the place!"}
{"text":"The place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price. The food is not fresh. For e.g. they have their chicken cooked and a \"bucket\" of butter chicken/paneer sauce sitting on the counter which they add on the chicken/paneer when you order. Shouldn't they be cooking the chicken in the sauce? No wonder the flavour is not there. The food is loaded with cayenne/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day. The owner is not friendly. And the worst part, there were only 2 tables occupied in the restaurant and still they took 25 minutes to bring us our food. (we ordered 3 rolls in total) I don't understand why they take that long when they don't even cook the food fresh. Much better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE. They're just across the street.  ******************************************************************************** EDIT - The owner (presumably) sent me a personal message the same day I posted this review. Please read :)  Love how he comments on my appetite and guts. Lol.  ********************************************************************************  Dear Mr Vin,  Sorry to know that your experience at Kathi Roll was average.  You dont have a picture so I dont when did you come to our store.However I was keen to reply to your review :  The place screams average. Portions are small and don't match the price.   We have priced our portions very competitively,though we cant contest an appetite.  The food is not fresh. The Food is 100% fresh,and that contradicts your review  it took us 25 minutes to bring your food.Why would we have to sit on your food for 25 minutes.  The food is loaded with cayenne/red chili powder, gave me heart burn the rest of the day.  Butter Chicken doesnt have Cayenne Pepper,as we know the spices that we use.  The owner is not friendly.  Would like to understand ,why do you feel so.  Much better options in the area. I'd choose Kothur any day over TKRE.  You are more than welcome to choose any other option over us as you have formed an opinion.  We welcome reviews ,criticism and suggestions.Because of our customers ,their suggestions ,understanding their needs and providing them service,we have been able to reach this far today with over 100 k rolls sold withover 60 k customers in our store.  However we cannot appreciate the customer who doesn't have the guts to come and talk to restaurant staff directly,to let them know about their service & their product,and give them an opportunity to rectify their mistake if any.You may be perfect,we are not ,we try to do our best and try to succeed most of the times.  Thanks,  Kathi Roll Express"}
{"text":"The Kathi Roll Express as known as T.K.R.E is a fresh and much needed change on the Yonge Street food scene. It stands apart from the regular Indian street food which is normally available at any Indian Restaurant. Lot of People relate Indian street food with samosas, pakoras, chaat, tikkis etc. Kathi Roll is something which a lot of people are unfamiliar with and kudos to T.K.R.E for taking this bold step and introducing an Indian street food which is not found at any other place in Toronto yet. I am not gonna go into detail as  about the origin and kathi roll and what is it exactly as you can read in the reviews written below by my fellow foodies or at http://www.thekathirollexpress.com/.   Now lets come to the main topic which is how it tastes.  Kathi ROLL Express has a wide variety of menu which will please both vegetarian and non vegetarian lovers. Be it their reshmi chicken(Silken chicken) roll,Mutton Roll Achari paneer roll or fusion rolls like Kung Pao Chicken roll. All of them stand apart and hits the right notes. the rolls are filled with egg(You can request one without an egg) Onions and green chutney. thats it, this is not a shawarma so dont expect lettuce, tomatoes etc and onions are the only toppings which goes in a kathi roll.   The other thing which I really like about T.K.R.E is the open kitchen concept. Usually kitchens in restaurants are hidden in back alley and you cant see how the food is getting prepared. At T.K.R.E the kitchen is right in front of your eyes. You can see the full process as to how your meal is being prepared. It takes them around 5-8 min(depending on the meat) to prepare one kathi roll as the chef put the skewer on the grill once you order which means it is as fresh as it gets and that makes a huge difference when you start digging in and the soft and tender meat or paneer takes you to the streets of India with the amazing flavours and decor. The lemon soda, Mango Lassi or the Delhi style cold coffee pairs really well with the rolls and these drinks are as real as it can get.  Dropped in last week and found out that they have got their Liquor License and they have started serving alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place. While I really enjoyed the tikka roll, I can't say the butterchicken was what I was expecting. Too much masala and spicy despite asking for mild rolls. Perhaps this level of spicy is mild and I'm not used to Indian hotness anymore. Hotness aside, the flavour was not so enjoyable, probably due to the different expectation (i.e creamier). In any case, I was not impressed with the butter chicken roll. Though I've only tried the chicken rolls this time, I will return to try the beef and lamb rolls. This place does boast a nice decor with bollywood posters and random desi paraphernalia strewn around the restaurant. The service was good with the person serving us being very attentive. The foreign drinks are a tad pricy so be aware ($2.99/can)  but it's expected since it's not local. Overall, I will say I wanted to like the food more, but I may need to try more to get to that point."}
{"text":"Ordered this from uber-eats, chicken biryani, the chicken is quite flavourful! I like their food, rice is curry infused, a bit spicy, but large portion. Not indian so I don't know how authentic but it's quite delicious."}
{"text":"I finally decided to check this place out for lunch with a co-worker and we ordered Butter Chicken Roll and Vegetarian Roll. We got back to the office and opened it up and there was barely anything in it, butter chicken with egg rolled up - nothing else inside.   For the price you pay 12 bucks a pop for each roll, I was expecting a little more. I think I'll stick with Salad Days next time."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant recently and I was very impressed to find this hidden gem on Yonge street. Great food with unique flavours and excellent service all at very fair prices.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, freshly cooked and unique food here, using quality ingredients.  Since most of the previous reviews all seemed positive on the food, I wanted to give the place a shot. My wife and I split two rolls: the butter chicken and the silken chicken. With butter chicken being the mainstay on any Indian restaurant in the city, we had a pretty good reference point for comparison, and it fared extremely well. The defining characteristic of all the food we tried is that it is extremely flavourful without being overly rich, and cheating with copious amounts of butter or cream. The silken chicken was unlike anything I've tried and absolutely delicious. For both, the chicken was all quality white meat, tender and moist. Rolls also come with a cilantro dipping sauce. While you're there, make sure to order a lassi.  Nice atmosphere with Bollywood movies playing in the back, and the owner was friendly. Looking forward to coming back to try some new rolls!"}
{"text":"I like the way the place is laid out and the decor gives a very street food kindda feeling. This type of indian fast food place was much needed in Toronto. I have tried their paneer rolls and they are pretty delicious and could easily be nice meal for an average person. If one thing I could suggest them would be to make their rolls other more stuffing (they only have paratha, paneer, peppers and onions) which I think is too less. I love the fact that they have tried to make it look like an old roadside restaurant all rustic feel. Me and my friends tried their rolls which we all think were great. We tried the vodka pani puri shot which is a bit of something really different and creative I think, just that the shot is too overwhelming with the pani puri lol! I tried their tava pulav but being used to the taste of Mumbai tava pulav I thought that it tasted more like rice mixed it with various spices to just make it look like the pulav. Have already been there more than a few times and would definitely visit again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time here. Dropped in with my family and we were treated  with warm, friendly and accommodating service.  Mutton Tikka Roll and mango lassi for my husband. I had Veggie Toastie The Mumbai Chutney and Cold Coffee Delhi Style from Connaught. 3 year old was offered rice and parantha served with yogurt sauce. Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"TKRE is a good a good concept since Toronto does not have many Kathi roll places. However, the execution is not good. I initially planned to dine in but as I got there, the place was super stuffy and smelled funky. I ordered the chicken tikka roll and some chaat to go. The food tasted good but was way overpriced for the amount of food I got. Definitely not worth the money and I'm not quite sure if I will be going back. I wish Downtown Yonge had better Indian restaurants!"}
{"text":"How much!!! $28 bucks for two rolls and pani puri! I could get a full on indian buffet for this much. The food was ok nothing to write home about but the price was a shocker. If only I wasn't that hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I checked out TKRE last week while looking for a quick meal with my boyfriend.  The owner was working up front and was really friendly.  He guided us through his menu and made quite a few recommendations as well as good small talk.    The space inside is pretty cool, and a lot better than I was expecting.    As for the food.  I had a lamb wrap (not sure the actual name), but it was pretty good and unique.  My only concern was that it didn't come with a sauce.  I got home and it was slightly dry.  Apparently there is a yoghurt based sauce for 50 cents, though I think this should be included for free (or at least told about it).   He did a good job with the interior, it's very clean and new yet gives the vibe of vintage hip-India.   I'll go back and give him another shot."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Had the mixed veggie and achari paneer. Both were super flavourful.  I would recommend to anyone who likes good lunches!"}
{"text":"Delicious rolls! I always get the butter chicken tikka. Big, juicy chunks of chicken breast. Its a pleasure to finally award a five star, bravo."}
{"text":"The owner is really friendly. The service is  slow, like you really gotta wait a while to get your order. The food is quite good, in terms of portion sizes but I feel like its a bit too pricey  The interiors are freaking awesome as heck though! :D"}
{"text":"TLDR: Bland food. Slow service.  I came with a friend to sit down and eat about a few weeks ago. The tables were dirty and sticky. The decor and theme is interesting, I mean I sat down at a table with He-man on it, which impressed me. But the music was so loud that everyone was screaming at each other and still can't hear each other talk.   The food is bland. Had the silken chicken roll and the street special rice platter. The chicken said it's marinated in almond and cashew, but it tasted nothing of those nuts. The chicken was juicy and moist, but bland. To sum up the rice platter: dry and bland. The only tasty items were the chutney and the cucumber raita. Also it had the slowest service ever. It took an hour to get anything out and there were only 2 other couples in the sit in area. And one of them were just getting a pitcher to share.   The waitress said the owner love feed back, so we tried to get his attention, but he ends up talking to someone poor couple who weren't interested in his concept of this restaurant. We waited for 11 mins, and in the end we left without letting him know our suggestions, but the waitress said she'll let him know what we told her. People go for the food, the concept comes after. Stop exerting so much on the talks and keep better quality control on the food."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but it is soooo expensive for what you get. Way overpriced and you're left hungry."}
{"text":"The veg thali is my favourite. The food can take a while, but it's made fresh to order. My husband and I come here often and it's a great option in the downtown core. This is our go-to place when we have a hankering for Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"One of the best finds for great Indian food - extremely friendly staff that make you feel warm and welcome, original eclectic street style decor (Bollywood posters, vintage ads, retro bicycle). The food is also incredible! I have yet to find a comparable restaurant. I'm already planning my next visit! A hidden gem amidst the Yonge street jungle."}
{"text":"From the outside the restaurant us so much ads making u want to go and gets your attention. When you go in the decor is nice and the order and service was fast as well. The food however wasn't the best. The butter chicken Roti had too much rice and was way to dry for my liking. I would probably come here again but I would try something else. Expect to pay about 6$-12$ for a meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this going in - butter chicken wrapped in a Nan - what's not to like, right? Unfortunately, myself and the wife found it to be rather oily and heavy, despite being fairly tasty. The meal took some time to prepare, but the service was good, if a little needy. I was surprised that two kathi rolls and two mango lassi's came to $27 dollars. I would say the business should try to be a bit more honest with what this should be - street food done well. That means preparing food quickly and being priced more competitively. Making the food less stodgy would also make this more appealing overall. Please improve!"}
{"text":"While reading some of the other reviews for this restaurant, I am left wondering if I even attended the same place. However, the experience I had was absolutely awful.   First, upon walking in, my boyfriend and I were told to grab menus and seat ourselves, and the waiter(?) suggested the patio out back. As the restaurant was stuffy, we decided to try out the patio. The patio is just out the back door of the restaurant, and looks as though it might be nice, given some TLC. The major downfall, however, is the fact that there is a large dumpster/garbage dumping area right next door, so half of the tables get to sit right in garbage fumes. The garbage doesn't stop there, though. Most of the patio (abandoned when we walked out) seemed to be garbage or storage space. A few feet from the tables were two large garbage/recycling bins, and there were piles of dirt and litter on the ground. This should have been a sign to us, but we were hungry, and didn't want to subject ourselves to the heat inside, so we stayed.   There we would sit, waiting, for another 10 minutes. When we had walked in, there was only one other customer in the store, so we knew they weren't too busy. We walked in to order our food at the front, as we assumed we had been forgotten. We were greeted by an extremely outgoing man, who explained some of the dishes to my boyfriend in great detail. My boyfriend ordered a beef kathi roll, but we were told they were out, so chose chicken instead. He also asked for chick peas as well, but was told it would taste \"absolutely awful\". I ordered a butter chicken burrito.   Not too much later, my boyfriend's food arrives, and I am told mine will be another few minutes. A few minutes later, instead of my food arriving, I am told that they aren't actually able to make my burrito at all, and that they have instead changed my order to a butter chicken kathi roll. At this point, my boyfriend has started eating, and I'm still hungry, so I shrug and agree. 15 minutes later, when my boyfriend's food (which was not chicken) has been long finished, mine finally arrives. Halfway through eating, we are approached again by the talkative waiter/manager/owner(?). He asks how the meal is, and we tell him our complaints. He agrees not to charge us for my meal, but won't stop asking us how we enjoyed it. (We didn't.) At the cash, we were charged $25, and actually had to argue that we had spoken to someone about it already, so that it would be brought down to $15. (The kathi rolls are $7.99)  Overall, I would NOT recommend this place to anyone, unless they were a health inspector."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tikka roll and the rooh-afza lassi. The chicken tikka itself was juicy and soft but I would rather have them use a little less mint chutney in the roll"}
{"text":"Had a nice shami roll {lamb} and chicken roll today along with authentic Limca and Thums-Up. Top notch lamb i can say. The flavor of the chicken roll was also quite great. The atmos inside is really cool and makes you feel like you're really sitting inside a roadside dhaba in India. Although the service was a bit slow, I loved the food."}
{"text":"Creative menu - ordered a lamb roll Food was on the salty side - slightly disappointed.  I'm willing to go back, but it wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Loved it! Walked in off the street - very helpful young lady at the front referred my sister and I to the owner for suggestions - as we had yet to have tried that style of food. My sister is a vegetarian and I - well not - the owner offered us a small sample which immediately had us hooked. LOVED IT! My sister chose a street roll with bbq Indian cottage cheese - soooo good! And I had some amazing selections offered but decided to go with the minced lamb which was described as to \"melt in my mouth\". Have already told 10 people :)"}
{"text":"TKRE has a nice decor, I like how it is decorated Pricing seems a little whack, and the food is soso.  The owner seems nice and wants this venture to workout but I don't think the food has that kick to it."}
{"text":"Great service for a take-out/ fast food place. The owner was nice enough to go over the entire menu with me. They serve street style Indian food. I got the Shami Kabab (lamb) roll this consist of minced lamb, chickpea, lentil and  bound with egg. This roll came with a mint basil sauce. The roll was great. I also found the Indian music videos playing in the tv very entertaining."}
{"text":"Toronto is known for its street meat, South Korea for its spicy rice cake and Thailand for its pad thai but what's street food in India? Kathi Rolls! The owner of The Kathi Roll Express wanted to bring Indian street food to Toronto.  A Kathi roll is essentially a roti with a layer of egg wrapped around a filling of your choice.  Mango Lassi - another classic from India. It's basically a mango yogurt drink that has the same consistency as a milkshake. It tasted very fresh like the mangoes had just been  been picked from a tree and made into a drink. It had a bit of a sour taste which offset the sweetness.  Kung Pao Chicken Kathi roll - It tasted like what you could have ordered an Asian restaurant and it was refreshing to try a mix of two cuisines. It was a little bit spicy.  Chickpea Masala and Shrimp Masala Thai Style Roll - It's always great to go to a restaurant that serves an abundant variety of vegetarian food to make sure it caters to everyone's need.   The shrimp masala thai style roll - definitely our favourite. It wasn't too spicy (bonus) and it had just the right amount of seasoning. Whatever the \"magical sauce\"  Korean Street Style BBQ chicken roll -The seasoning on this kathi roll was a bit too salty for us and it tasted a bit like bulgogi. It was definitely interesting to eat it wrapped in a roll because you would never have anything like that at a Korean restaurant!    If you've never tried a kathi roll before, stop by The Kathi Roll Express and pick one up for a snack or a meal."}
{"text":"Restaurant: The Kathi Roll Express Cuisine: Indian Location: Downtown Address: 692 Yonge St Price Range: $5~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 3.5  Extra information:  * Vegan Friendly * Late Night * Vegetarian option Avail  So what is Kathi Roll? I wasn't sure before I visited TKRE, aka The Kathi Roll Express that newly opened couple months ago near Yonge and Bloor area. Kathi Rolls are Indian Parantha (Whole Wheat flatbread) grilled with freshly beaten eggs and then filled with choice of meats or veggies. TKRE is open early till late night and even delivers in the area.  With the name of the restaurant, I was surprised to walk into the place and see lots of tables inside TKRE. I thought it would be more of a 'Take to Go' type of place but there are def lots of tables for you to enjoy Kathi Rolls inside the restaurant.  They def paid attention to interior of the restaurant with beautifully painted tables and graffiti on the walls.  Mango Lassi for $2.99, it was one of the thickest lassi I've ever had. It was very rich and bursting with mango flavor  Chicken Tikka Roll * Mumbo (Single Filling) for $5.99 or Jumbo (Double Filling) for $7.99 * BBQ'd Chicken marinated in yogurt and spices   Lamb Seekh Kabab Roll * Mumbo (Single Filling) for $7.99 or Jumbo (Double Filling) for $9.99 * Minced lamb and spices bound with egg  Chicken Kung Pao Szechwan Style Roll * Mumbo (Single Filling) for $5.99 or Jumbo (Double Filling) for $7.99 * Spicy stir fried chicken, peanuts, veggies and chilies  BBQ'd Peri Peri Quarter Chicken * Grilled Portuguese style chicken with Peri Peri Sauce for $9.99  The Greatest Street Food Platter * Any Kababs or Tikka assortment with rice and yogurt for $12.99  Summary: If you are in the area and need a quick bite to go, def check out The Kathi Roll Express. It is something different and healthy that you can grab and go. They offer vegetarian options and is open late night."}
{"text":"I went there 4 times in the first week I discovered TKRE. The rolls are delicious, but it's the curries that really won me over. Get the deluxe thali if you're hungry. Finally, some great Indian food in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Just got the Butter Chicken burrito via Uber Eats- was nice and hot when it arrived- which is more of an endorsement of Uber Eats- but the Chicken was well done, nicely spiced, Rice still had nice bite and overall I would say that I would order this again.  Good choice for me today."}
{"text":"All aboard the Kathi Roll Express!  TKRE has brought a bit of Calcutta street food to Yonge and Bloor! This eatery is a small space with functional and colorful clutter for decor. I thought the crates were fun and I liked the movie posters.  When it came time to order, they had a lot of items to choose from including rolls, sandwiches, and rice platters.    There are two sizes of kathi rolls -  Jumbo ($3.99 - $7.99) and Mambo (+$2 to Jumbo).  I asked which roll was the most popular and the owner suggested the Chicken Tikka Roll ($6.99).  For what you get, I thought the price for the \"jumbo\" was fair, but only if you translate \"jumbo\" into snack-sized.    It hit the spot though and I really liked all the flavours and textures. The chicken chunks were moist and spicy and there's an egg for additional protein.  However, I wished that there were more veggies and I found that the parantha was slightly soggy greasy -- but still tasty.   The mango lassi ($2.99) was pre-made and pulled from the fridge.  The thickness was good but it could have been a bit creamier and less mango-y. I'd probably go for a tea next time.  The owner was super engaging and helpful when I asked about menu. Even though this place is new and has some kinks to work out, the staff here are great and I hope that they stay around!"}
{"text":"TKRE was a great find - wandering on Yonge St and decided on it for dinner.  Was glad that happened!  TKRE serves Indian food, but not what you'd find as easily in many other Indian restaurants.  The owner (very friendly, and came to visit our table!) explained that the cuisine is specifically Indian Street food.  This particular variation stems from the last 100 years, when a need for having 'food on the go' came about.  He was more than willing to explain the history of the cuisine, which was cool to learn.   The food had great flavor, and again offers to the city a different 'spin' on Indian cuisine.  If you're already a fan of Indian food, TKRE is a great place to have a new experience on a fave."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with some friends from out of town once before, so this review is based on my second visit:  When my friend who just landed from Korea asked me to choose a place to eat, I immediately thought to myself, 'What restaurant is close enough to the hotel she's staying at along Yonge St/would I want to introduce her to?' And so I Yelp'd it, found TKRE bookmarked from before and said, yup this is the place I liked from before.   So we enter and the owner greeted us with a smile and ask if we have been here before. I replied with yes and showed him my phone that I checked-in to receive a FREE POP. My friend didn't have the Yelp app on her phone, but he was so nice and offered to add a pop can ON THE HOUSE to her order! :D   We both got the Butter Chicken Egg Kathi Roll and man was it good!!! I remembered ordering this the first time round and absolutely loved it so I ordered it again. My friend also agreed that this was the best butter chicken she ever had. All the other butter chicken she's ever had were either sweet or not very authentic (think Westernized butter chicken). She liked the fact that she could actually taste the spices and also liked how the egg was incorporated into the roll.   I'll definitely be back because 1) great service 2) yummy food 3) reasonable price"}
{"text":"Lunch   Ambience: 3-3.5/5   Food: 3.5/5  Service: 3.5/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Perhaps."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD kathi rolls. I don't know if it was the mood I was in or the actual love for this roll, but I felt this place is better than Kati Roll Company in NYC.   I ordered the shami kabob roll (minus the fried egg) and LOVED it. From the flavorful meat to the bread it's wrapped in, the whole roll was finger-licking good.   My husband tried the pepper chicken roll which was also phenomenal.   Prices are reasonable. Go for the food, not the service (take-out is best)  Remember to get a TON of napkins because things will get a little messy."}
{"text":"what can I say but A-MAZ-ING!!!   It was cold out so I felt the need for some spice and decided to try these people out ad it was NOT a mistake.  We ordered from the new location at 1753 Avenue Rd (new location) and order 3 entrees (two with naan and one with rice)  Palack Pineer, Butter Chicken, and Lamb Roganjosh. Nice portions, Excellent flavour and friendly delivery.  They were going to be a little late (Something with Naan Machine) but they called to keep us in the loop so all was cool.  This may very well become the new Indian choice for delivery in our house.  Now have to go before I miss seconds LOL"}
{"text":"Like if you gave it to me I'd eat it but the food wasn't soooo good that I'll go there again.  I mean the food isn't bad, but I feel like it's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get and also it's just kind of take out style so the experience isn't something I would pay extra for."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday, and was very underwhelmed.   I was so excited to try it, as I love kathi rolls.    First of all, I would not recommend this place to office workers out on a lunch break who are pressed for time.  It takes them a very, very long time to get your order ready, and it's not as if the food is cooked right then on the spot.  I had the Lahore chickpea kathi roll, and found it rather dry and dull.  Fortunately, it was not greasy or overly salted, but I was expecting much, much more flavour and interest.    That and a pre-made mango lassi cost me almost 12 dollars!  The men at the counter spent most of their time on the phone rather than preparing food and attending to customers."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with kathi rolls, which are a type of street-food popular in Kolkata. They're kind of like a cross between a kabab and a burrito. I'm very excited that more interesting restaurants such as this are opening on this stretch of Yonge.   In general, I was very impressed with Kathi Roll Express. I had the lamb seekh kabab with \"jumbo meat.\" I used quotations there because even with extra meat it wasn't all that filling. I really enjoyed it though! The bits of kabab were very falvourful and under the wrap was cooked egg and some very tasty spices.  The restaurant itself has a great vibe. There's a projector playing Bollywood music videos non-stop, lots of old Bollywood posters on the exposed-brick walls, and wooden bench-like seating. They really went all out with the Indian streetfood theme. It's also a bit hipsterish for Yonge street with its edison bulbs and plastic crate chandelier.   I plan to return to try some of the fusion dishes, such as the Mexican and Korean-style rolls. There's a lot on this menu that looks really interesting. Since my only complaint was the serving size was a bit small, I'll order a side next time."}
{"text":"Decor 5+ star - I mean this place is Instagram heaven not even kidding you! Love the oldschool indian movie posters and vintage items around!  Service - 3 Though friendly its very very slow even though the place wasn't that busy. I get that they make everything fresh etc but like someone else said if you have \"express\" in your name, better get going. And Kathi roll is street style food - it shouldn't take 20 mins  Food - 3.5 - The rolls were delicious and packed with flavour, the chutney was very good. Mango lassi probably one of the best I had - not too sweet. Look forward to trying the street style lassi when available. But something kept telling me that the food could be a lot better; the parathas can be a bit less doughy and well cooked.  I'd go back, for take out that I pre-order."}
{"text":"What should have tipped me off that it was empty during lunchtime. I was the only one there. The wrap I got dripped all over the place and wasn't built well. I asked for a little hot sauce a got a lot. I think if this was better managed that this could be a great lunch time stop."}
{"text":"So far I've had the Achari Paneer and the chana roll, both fresh tasting and appropriately spicy, and not overly heavy.  The decor is very well done, and the staff are pleasant.  No, it's not as fast as the fastest fast food., but much better value. service, and taste, and a welcome change from the standard wraps and falafel.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Had a very strange experience here. The staff were very disorganized. I  ordered a Kathi tikka roll and a butter chucken burrito and said I would pick then up. The counter man said come back in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we arrive and they start to put the food on. If he wanted us to wait he should have said for us to wait. I don't think the turn around on their rolls is typically 10 minutes so maybe they were waiting on something.   Also the signs outside are somewhat misleading. Butter chicken burrito was advertised for 6.99 on the chalkboard outside but was 9.99. The Kathi rolls are advertised as 6.99 but this is for the small snack size. Not outright lying but a bit shady."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a \"Kathi Roll\" for years.  I first heard of them when visiting New York City but never had the opportunity to try.  So when TKRE opened in Toronto I vowed I would sample this Indian street food delicacy.  Well, after a year I finally made it and I'm happy to say I approve!  I had the butter chicken kathi roll and while maybe it's not as flavourful as a roti (ahem Ghandi) or burrito (you can't help but compare) I'd definitely return to try another one. One thing about the roll was that it was extremely eggy.... Not sure if this is true of Kathi rolls in general and also not sure I love it.  One other comment is that I asked for it spicy and it was anything but.  I think part of the appeal of this place for me is just that it's completely different on a stretch of Yonge St. that is generally filled with hum drum sushi, chains, or other generic Asian food.  If you're in the neighbourhood, it's a great place to pop by for a fast, casual, and unique experience."}
{"text":"I saw it; I tried it; I loved it! The Butter Chicken Burrito is the best \"East meets West\" taste experience I've had since getting fabulous Chinese food in Mexico City! (That's another story)  Thin naan encompassed the moist chicken in butter sauce, spicy rice, chick peas, crushed Indian crackers, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions - a quite satisfying & filling medley of flavour. Bravo! I will definitely return,  with friends and solo,"}
{"text":"Tried the butter chicken burrito and it did not disappoint!  Standard sized burrito stuffed with seasoned basmati rice, chick peas, bell peppers, and tender chicken, it was a quick and filling meal. I have a very low spice tolerance so I was sniffling away with my runny nose as I ate this, but it was worth it! The staff member who served me was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, but they need to improve their combo sides. Really, not everyone wants potatoes or chickpeas- especially if their roll already has one or the other as filling. Why not offer kachumber salad?"}
{"text":"At least I come here once in a month, Achari Paneer Tikka is one of the best rolls. Try it out.."}
{"text":"Bottom line: If you have 'EXPRESS' in your name and 'Street food' in your tagline, I would think speed is implied, not the case. The roll was quite delicious, I had the minced lamb, it was a little finely minced for my tastes however the flavors worked and I would go again, just not when my friend is on her 30 minute break.  Good: -easy location -cool decor for a 'fast food?' Joint -higher quality than you'd expect from a tourist street -Freshly cooked ingredients! Nothing was sitting on a hotplate. -owner was engaging -loyalty program -delicious product   Bad: -the wait, freshness comes at a price and for two wraps/rolls it was a 20 minute price tag, all while standing there. -lamb was minced too finely, had a mush like texture. -a little messy, easier to eat sitting down -that's it! Maybe more negatives, just didn't see it on my visit."}
{"text":"Of the possible 5 stars: +1 for being easy on the eyes (finally, an aesthetic improvement to this strip of Yonge a.k.a. Dresses-That-Look-Like-Belts 'R' Us and Payday Loans-ville) +1 for a number of vegetarian options -1 for the super long wait time -1 for no acknowledgement of the super long wait time 0 for decent food but nothing to write home about  We walked in to a spacious, well-decorated and almost empty restaurant, ordering two rolls to-go. Considering the whole \"street food\" thing, I thought we'd be in/out/full of paneer in no time, but I was wrong. 25 minutes later I was still browsing AskReddit and wondering what was taking so long. The owner in few words told us \"2 minutes\", but five more passed. I was desolately about to resort to a tragic round of Candy Crush Saga when we finally got our rolls, which were about the size of lightweight collapsible travel umbrellas.  Food was good - flavourful and authentic (I think)! The paranthas were a tad oily. I liked the Achari Paneer Tikka Roll, though the enticing \"spicy pickle\" was hard to find. My dining partner was happy with the spice level but next time I'll eat in so I can try cooling off with the \"authentic Indian ice cream\" afterward. For around $6 including tax, the smaller size portions are about on par with nearby options, but hungry visitors may desire the larger size.  Pricing looks a little wacky. $5.99 for a small chicken tikka roll, but with rice & chickpeas, it's a $12.99 platter. Huh?"}
{"text":"Was craving a taste of home yesterday and based on yelp reviews decided to try TKRE for lunch. The Dahi Puri was forgetful at best - flavorless and bland. My chicken tikka kathi roll was underwhelming. Chicken was dry, under-seasoned, and was not cooked in a tandoor (who are you trying to fool here?)! The parantha itself was very thick and undercooked."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dropped by TKRE today on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We had never heard of the place before (albeit they've only been open for seven days) but will definitely be coming back soon.  The food is delicious and portion are large.  We shared a Kathi Street Special ($12.99) which comes with a Chicken tikka roll, rice and chickpeas, and barely made our way through it between the two of us.  Having been to Mumbai before, I'd definitely say their menu hits the spot in terms of authentic street style Indian food.  I'd definitely recommend trying one of the tikka rolls on your first visit.  A small will run you $6 and a jumbo is $8, which all in all is pretty affordable."}
{"text":"Excellent discovery!  Walked in a little before12 and timed it just right. By the time we were finishing up, there was a line out the door.   I had the Chicken Tikka roll, which was delicious! The chicken was juicy with no weird pieces. It was spicier than i expected, but in a good way. My combo included 2 small cups of salad. There were two to choose from, so I asked for one of each- chickpea and potato. Both good!  Only bad thing is that it's really smokey in there due to their cooking method, and I now smell like I have been at a bonfire.   Oh well, small price to pay. I will definitely add it to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Have walked by this place many times and never thought much of it...\"another yonge st dive\", well I was wrong....\"def a yonge st gem\"!!  The guy who owns it is super friendly and accommodates with a smile....food was fantastic and I will def be back again to try some of the other genuine Indian Street Food Kathi Rolls.  If your in the area or not, I highly suggest that you make a stop into TKRE!!! You won't be disappointed!  Tip: the paratha is made to order so understand that there is a little wait as it's all fresh made"}
{"text":"So four of us from work decided to give this place a shot today (Kathi Roll Express being the new joint on Yonge St.). Stepping in, we were pleasantly amused by the creative & unique interior decor that was reminiscent of the ambience around street food stalls in Calcutta (or India in general). The western twist was pretty cool, and the vintage Amitabh bollwood posters...pretty epic!  The basic premise of a kathi roll, is a skewer of kathi kabab enclosed within a paratha, and in line with this, the menu boards definitely piqued our hunger.   Size options include \"Mumbo\" (a single skewer of meat) and \"Jumbo\" (two skewers of meat).  Two of us decided to try the Chicken Sheekh kebab (Jumbo) and the other two got a Chicken Tikka roll and a Lamb Seekh kabab roll.  While waiting for the meal, the owner passed around some coupons for free drinks on our next visit, and gave us a rundown of the concept & work in progress. He also noted that the quality and taste of the  \"food\" was the most importance criteria for him, and that the initial feedback had been very positive. Needless to say, we were excited...  *Fast-forward to post-meal discussion and final verdict*  Although this place is only 5 days old, the four of us unanimously shared the following opinions/sentiments about the food:  1. \"Jumbo\" isn't really \"jumbo.\" For $8+tax, the size of the paratha was noticeably small, and the portion, insignificant to satiate our hunger. I'm pretty sure most would agree with this. One of my colleagues had to pop into The Market to grab a second lunch to treat his post kathi roll hunger! Not so exciting, after you've dropped almost $10 on the roll...  2. There was a distinct lack of flavor or a \"party in the mouth\" (as my colleague put it). Our tastebuds could only make out the kababs - which were somewhat dry - and a hint  of the green mint sauce. There was nothing distinct to the roll besides this. As a suggestion, coriander or raitha might add a kick to to the flavour.  3. There were no additional sauces for extra flavoring. Again, as a suggestion, it would be interesting to integrate some familiar Indian sauces such as raitha, chutney, or even the infamous Maggi Chilly Sauce.   So to sum it up, although the concept can definitely work, the execution needs some tuning-up, and I hope the above suggestions can be used to keep things moving in the right direction. :)"}
{"text":"I was told by a fellow Yelp member a few nights ago that a lot of his/her friends really like this place, so since I finally I got a break from work, I had to decide where to go for lunch.  I've probably been everywhere in the Yonge/Bloor area and then I remembered, how about we try TKRE again?  I'm very glad I did.  I had the butter chicken kathi roll and it is apparently today was only the 2nd day they were offering it.  I got a combo for just over $12 including tax, which included a chick pea salad and a drink. The salad was okay, but it was a fairly good sized salad for a side, but the star of the show was the butter chicken kathi.  Picture a nice creamy butter chicken wrapped in good fresh naan bread, but rolled up so you can eat it like a burrito.  Doesn't that sound yummy?  It was great.  I think the butter chicken at this place is just as good, if not better than Kothur. Yes, I know, it's in a wrap, but if anyone has ever seen me eat, all my wraps/burritos/shawrma's fall apart and then meat spills out.  So when the butter chicken spilled out, I tasted it by its lonesome and it was really good.   And compared to my last review, I didn't feel hungry so their size probably increased.  So I think for food and price 4/5 now.  As for service, it is a bit slow (maybe a 5-10 minute wait), however the food is cooked fresh, so you just have to deal with it like you do at gourmet burger places.  In addition, the owner is trying to get feedback and I think that's key.  He genuinely cares about his business and those are the type of places I want to go to.  So service is 3.5/5 (4/5 for the owner, 3/5 for wait time), so really 3.5/5.  Verdict: 3.75/4, but will round up slightly.  Will come back soon."}
{"text":"I have been to TKRE a number of times and have thoroughly enjoyed their delicious food and friendly service. The ingredients are very fresh and the food is homemade. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Kathi Roll express is when fusion food goes well. I would definitely recommend the kathi rolls for their authentic paratha style wrap. A huge bonus is the always friendly and welcoming customer service. I have been here a handful of times, and am always amazed at the patience of the customer service in explaining and recommending all the menu items. Unlike many of the quick-dine places along this strip of Yonge Street, you will actually want to sit and hang around Kathi Roll. This place is such a gem!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the spicy chicken peri peri wrap (traditional Indian wrap, can't remember the name). Friendly staff. Well priced"}
{"text":"I've picked up lunch from this place a couple times now and I'm a fan. The staff have been very friendly and the decor is unique. I am a passionate fan of the paneer shaslik roll. I'm the one that always gets annoyed at Indian restaurants when there are two cubes of paneer in a bucket of gravy. This thing is packed with delicious paneer goodness. The sides are acceptable. The aloo chaat is good and tangy. The chickpeas are fine but would be better with some cilantro or black salt or something to give them some flair. There is a Yelp check-in offer and the man at the cash was actually excited I used it and gave me another coupon for next time. I do love free stuff. There are a few minor points that could be improved. The food takes more than five minutes so it's not really \"express\" as one would think. There is a desperate need of air conditioning. It is sooo damn hot in there in the afternoons. Another added to the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I was feeling serious hunger pangs on the way home from a hot-doc, and my GF convinced me it was time to give Kathi Roll express another shot. Here's my diagnosis:  SERVICE: We popped inside, and I ordered myself a Butter Paneer Roll. It took a few tries to get the server (and I believe proprietor) to remember my order - thankfully double-checking because considering my diet, a hungry bite into a butter chicken roll would definitely have spoiled my appetite. Otherwise, he was very friendly and eager to please.  TIMING: Since my last order was such a long wait, I timed this one: 11 minutes. A definite upgrade, and probably about the same wait-time as I've had at my local favourite, Capitano Gelato Burger. Definitely happy about that. (In that time I also checked in on my Yelp app, and discovered I had a free can of soda waiting for me!)  FLAVOUR: As in my original review, there is nothing wrong with these rolls. I never get to eat Butter-anything because most Indian restaurants only serve the chicken variety, and I was very excited about the butter sauce AND some hypercubes of Paneer. I was not disappointed in the least by how the meal tasted.  VALUE: The Butter Paneer only came as a \"Jumbo\" order. The price came to 9 dollars, and I'm not sure the price warranted the difference between this and the previous two \"Mumbo\" rolls I had ordered, nor do I feel there was a significant size disparity. I think that at that price point, I wouldn't expect to be hungry afterward, though I was.  OVERALL: I upgrade to a 3.5, with a few caveats:   I absolutely recommend the food. It's terrific. I will certainly return. Hopefully, they've worked out the timing issues, but as I mentioned before - if you order in advance you won't go wrong. The prices are a little wonky, so I think the best way to experience (provided you're hungry and also a vegetarian like me) would be to order multiple mumbo rolls."}
{"text":"Good place for a grab & go or stay-in meal.  Kathi rolls is street food that originated from Kolkata.  I think of it as their take on a burrito.  They have a lot of meat and veggie options to choose from and I settled for the butter chicken roll which tasted as advertised.  They even offer Limca which is a refreshing but not very sweet lemon-lime drink that is popular in India.  Decor was a little eclectic and they were showing cricket matches on the project screen to add to that atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've come here twice and I've enjoyed the food. However, it takes some time to get your food.   They have this drink called Pakola, a drink from Pakistan which is rare to find. I recommend everyone give it a try!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken seekh kabab. Was delicious! I had never had one before but came with a friend who has been many times to TKRE and recommended the chicken kabab. The staff were very friendly and personable. I think the price is a tad high for my liking...but was yum."}
{"text":"What's not to love? My husband and I have been longing for ages for the Kati Rolls we get in New York and now this place has come along and answered our prayers. I can only speak to the veg options which are excellent and varied. The owner remembers us whenever we come in and is always friendly and helpful. Cute decor too. You have to wait about 10 minutes for your food sometimes but I don't really see the problem with that if you are prepared for it. And yes - they do cater parties (speaking from experience, your drunk friends will THANK YOU, ours did), ask them about it!"}
{"text":"This place offers Indian fusion based on grilled parantha flat breads stuffed with toppings then rolled up.  The prices are reasonable in the $6-$12 range  The Greatest Street Food Platter includes chicken tikka, lamb kebabs, basamti rice and a spicy mint chutney. Ask for extra sauce as its fiery and delicious  They offer a Korean BBQ chicken roll  They offer a Go Green rolled stuffed with spicy vegetables  The Paneer Tikka roll is stuffed with spicy cottage cheese  This an interesting food offering for those that love wraps and those that love indian food and those that love both.  The menu offering has something for everyone and chef Sarop Singh expects to change things up and add different menu items as time goes by.  Place can get busy with hungry Ryerson students nearby"}
{"text":"I'll start with the decor and atmosphere - it's great. Bollywood posters and pictures give it fun and interesting feel as opposed to a traditional Indian vibe.   But that's where the good stops. I had the jumbo chicken tikka, which for $11 should be filling. However, it fell short of being enough and moreover, was lacking taste and flavour. This was literally the first time I've had to add hot sauce and flavour to Indian food. Overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"loved the curry chicken wrap i got! this place is yummy as hell!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and freshly made. The place gets busy for weekday lunch, so it's generally a 5-10 minute wait for food. The employers are nice, and they let you pay at the counter and bring the food to your table when it's ready so you don't have to hover around the counter.  Nice spicy Indian food in wraps made of bread similar to naan bread, but thinner, You can get lunch for $8 and not be hungry after.  The place has seats for probably 30 people, but the gem is going to be the patio. It may be a long wait, though, as currently there is no side wall until the adjacent lot becomes a building. Not so fun to sit out there with the construction workers and debris. Maybe next summer!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot with Shonna looking for lunch along Yonge Street. The servers were v nice and had many recommendations based on our questions: taste wise, ingredient wise, and price wise too. We played it safe and got a butter chicken burrito each. Based off of our experience - v average. There was too much rice, and not enough meat. Which maaay be why they were dry and bland (that, or they didn't put enough sauce!). It was this close to being tasteless, but by the bottom of the burrito... it started tasting like butter chicken. The place itself has an old school vibe to it. Playing tracks from the 90's and a cool creation of milk crate lights on the ceiling."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but what scares me about going to a lot of Indian restaurants is leaving smelling like the restaurant.  For days (well, my coat does anyways).  No such problem here though - the place was tastefully decorated, well ventilated, and very pleasant in general (ok, maybe the table wobbled - but I nitpick..).  We sat inside though they also have a quaint back patio that will be nice for warm summer days/nights - will have to come back to experience that soon.  On to the food..We shared the butter chicken kathi roll and tikka chicken kathi rolls, along with the Indian nachos.    The rolls were phenomenal - the butter chicken was a real surprise as it wasn't just drowned in orange soup like it is many other places.  This particular sauce was a hybrid marinara-style sauce that's worth coming here all on its own.  The 'medium' spice requested for the tikka chicken roll was just right, and gave a pleasant balance of spice and flavour.  Both these rolls were terrific.  And quite filling - but don't be afraid of them, it's a good full.  The Indian nachos were interesting though honestly I'm not as much of a fan.  They were a cold dish, which is fine, though I wasn't a fan of the sauce - a little too tangy perhaps.  Then again, perhaps this is exactly how it's supposed to taste - it's my first time trying it so as an Indian nacho virgin I didn't know what to expect.  The server was friendly and quite knowledgeable, and took time explaining the menu and what the items meant, which was quite nice.   I also really appreciated the authenticity of a lot of the dishes - it's always nice to get something real and not overly compromised for Western tastes.  If I can offer any suggestions to the owners, it may be to provide some translation on the menu (I imagine when it's busy here that they can't describe everything as well as they did to us [we came at a less busy time]), and also to let people know to pay at the cash whenever they're ready (an issue with many restaurants - you often never really know whether to wait for your bill, flag a server for the bill, or pay at the counter).  I'll be back for sure - need to try some more rolls, plus the curry dishes.  This is going to be my go-to place for Indian for the next while whenever I'm in the city.    ps. Check in with the Yelp app for a free pop with your meal (sweet!)"}
{"text":"DO NOT eat here.  During my meal, one of the wooden poster things fell on the back of my head pretty hard, and instead of apologizing, I got a perfunctory \"Did it hurt?\"!!  Then this other guy says \"shake it off\"!!  Worst experience ever.  Food is at par at best, too."}
{"text":"My first time with my friends. The decor is amazing with some Bollywood touch to it. It reminds you of Indian streets. Ordered butter chicken and chicken tikka kathi roll. Enjoyed butter chicken. Initially wanted shammi kabab roll but the owner/ manager said they didn't have lamb meat. They also have a bar, and a cocktail pitcher for $8.99 but again were told they didn't know how to prepare it as the bar tender was not there. Was a little disappointed because it was a Friday night and you would think all this would be available. Overall food was good hence a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Very good butter chicken. Friendly staff and laid back. A bit slow, worth checking out."}
{"text":"I like it when any business follows up on customer feedback. I went back, and this time the service was up to mark. The food was great too. I tried the black pepper and silken chicken roll. Both were great. Personally I liked the black pepper more. Looking fwd to go again."}
{"text":"Tried the daily special kathi roll. Was served quickly, food had lots of flavour. Not a big meal but a cheap, quick, light, flavourful lunch.   Indian food usually leaves you feeling heavy or tired- didn't feel that way because the food wasn't overly greasy or a large quantity.  The restaurant is take out style and quite casual. The staff was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I walked in there this afternoon with a friend and got the special of the day.....the portions are extremely small and very pricey...food was average. Felt ripped off, probably wont return."}
{"text":"The owner alone makes me want to support this place for as long as I can (super sweet and attentive from the get-go), but the service and the food all combine to make this a jewel of a find. I'm both blessed and cursed that it's so close to work, cause I have a feeling I'll be returning as often as I can afford to on my lunch hours. And maybe for dinner too :$"}
{"text":"Okay so as cool as this place was decor wise (especially since I just got back from India) the food was too expensive and not all that good.  It was confusing to order and I feel like we ordered more than we thought we did.  Ended up getting indian nachos, which was a sort of chip with a yogurty sweet coriander sauce. We got the curry wraps. I didn't really care for the egg inside but the sauce was decent. Ended up being way too full for hours. We should have read better!"}
{"text":"The menu seemed interesting, and the staff is very nice. But I was sorely disappointed with the food. My sister and I order two different plates, but they both tasted the same. They add scrambled egg to a lot of items on the menu and it overpowers the taste of chicken or any of the spices."}
{"text":"nice that these guys deliver in DT too.  authentic verified."}
{"text":"I tried out their butter chicken burrito through the TOfinest passport (so it was a steal $ and I'm not sure of the regular prices...), and I have to say, it was pretty amazing! The burrito is VERY filling since it was packed with big chunks of butter chicken, chick peas, bell peppers and rice. There's a small kick of spice to it which was perfect for me.   Also, service was great during my experience! We were actually seated with menus after being asked if we were here for take out. The overall ambience of the place is cozy and comfortable with many tables and chairs which is a big bonus for a mainly take-out restaurant.   All in all, would I come back? Yes - a big fan of good butter chicken."}
{"text":"3 star service 3 star star quantity  2 star quality and. 1 star price. Had their flagship butter chicken roll. Dry meat and the sauce was too sweet. All for whopping. 11 bucks 3 star ambience"}
{"text":"Second visit here and came out disappointed. My first visit convinced me to come back but going forward I will not be making the trip to eat here. Unfortunately, my bar is quite high - Kathi Roll company in NYC. The paratha itself is quite dry and gets boring after a while. I've tried 4 different rolls so far and I think the achari paneer is the winner amongst them - not that I am a vegetarian. The fusion paratha - kung pao chicken is very mild, fell way below expectations. They tend to use the same green chutney in all their rolls which overpowers the flavors inside. The service is very friendly though and I appreciated the fact that the owner was asking for feedback on how they could improve. He even offered us a discount coupon for a future visit. The concept definitely is 5 stars but the execution doesn't live upto the promise. While I was in New York city, I remember how much I savored the trip to the Kathi Roll company in Greenwich village - this place does not give me the same high. I hope these guys survive though for a while since the concept is fairly new for Toronto and adds a different spin on Indian street food. I sincerely hope they revisit their menu and probably cut down on the fluff and focus on flavors."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed at this place. It looked like a great idea and presented well enough.  What should have tipped me off that it was empty during lunchtime. I was the only one there. The wrap I got dripped all over the place and wasn't built well. I asked for a little hot sauce a got a lot. I think if this was better managed that this could be a great lunch time stop. But in it's current iteration, Unsubscribe."}
{"text":"I was sooooooooooo excited to try tkre.  I think I set my expectations too high. I stalked them on instagram, I'd salivate every time I passed their \"butter chicken paneer\"  sign. Let's face it,  butter and chicken are some of my hot words. When I came in here on pride weekend with my sister, we ordered a beer, a pop, and two butter chicken paneers. Points for selling beer. Points off for a bug being in my beer. For 2 wraps and two beverages, the total came to  $32 and change. WTH, not worth it! We asked for something non spicy for my sister because she's a baby and they suggested the butter chicken.  It was too spicy for her. I ended up eating both. They tasted bland to me. I REALLY wanted to love this place, but I just didn't."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place less then a star.  Me and my friend tried this restaurant couple days ago and the service and food was implacable . As walking in to the restaurant we were not greeted by anybody after 5 min I walked up to the counter and asked if we can have a menu to look at it then the serve finally noticed us might I add there was only 2 ppl inside the restaurant , it was dead . So then the serve went ahead and told us the popular \"items\" of the menu.  We ordered the butter chicken burrito and the Nann pizza , we were told to take a seat since we were dinning in . It took them 30 min to make our dish !! Did I mention there was no one at the restaurant !! When the food came to the table it was so cold ! And the nann pizza was burnt not crispy but legit burnt I asked the server to send it back as it was not edible . The serve didn't even ask if I want something else he just took the food and left !   Then I had to ask them for the bill 3 times !! I finally got fed up and went up to the counter to pay . Tell me how they had the audacity to try and charge me for the nann pizza that we didn't even touch ! I had to argue with the server to get it removed as he was telling me it was your Choice to eat it or not.  If you are looking for flavourless food and horrible service this is defiantly the place to go !!"}
{"text":"we went on a weekend night. There was no wait and it was pretty empty, which is a good thing. The service was excellent. The rolls were not hot enough. The lamb roll got too much onion taste which over powered the taste of the lamb and other flavour. The burritos were not bad in terms of flavour but still didn't meet my expectation. The mango laksa and dessert was really good though."}
{"text":"Before I start commenting on my experience, I would like some of the reviewers here to know that kati rolls are traditional indian street food as people think this is some kind of fusion dish. Also to correctly represent his culture, he should not call them this is indian burrito cuz that definitely can confuse people who dont know kati rolls.  Anyway, the place isnt pretty. The small kitchens kinda dingy. I got the butter chicken egg kati roll. The white meat chicken pieces were microwaved. The overall product was pretty dry even with dripping amount of butter chicken sauce. The flavor was kinda boring. The bread and egg which should have been moist were not and did not help making up for the dry pieces of meat. But they do give you a lot of chicken. Oh, this guys a huge dripper.  I got the combo that comes with samosa and a soda for $4 more. Samosa was pretty gross. Microwaved (aka soggy) with overly generous amount of sour yoghurt and terrible green chutney. So dont get this combo. It is not even that good of a deal.  Also the guy was the cashier and the cook and obviously did not wash hands switching tasks. Yum the dollar bill$"}
{"text":"A friend was going on about Kathi Rolls so when I saw Kathi Rolls Express, I thought this is my opportunity to figure out what these things are.  I made an order for a veg (paneer) Kathi roll and it took a few minutes to cook up. I checked out the place, it's small and cozy and I like the Bollywood décor with the NYC mural. The place has a good look. When I got my order (which I feel was a bit pricy) and tried it out... I have to say that these rolls are AWESOME!!!! Way better than anything other roll or wrap you may try in the city... it's not a contest. I'll definitely be introducing this place to other people. Good job!!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE - Jul 30-15 The owner responded to my review below. He kindly offered a roll on the house and wanted me to come back and visit. I declined but wanted to let you all know that I appreciated the offer. They have a lot of repeat business so they must be doing something right.     REVIEW - Jul 29-15  So I went to TKRE when they first opened as I have had kathi rolls in India. Kathi rolls are a street food. hey are basically a wrap containing a filling & scrambled egg enfolded in an Indian roti (flat bread).   I was so excited to try this place when they first opened but was very disappointed. I wanted to give another try so went back last week on a Thursday for lunch. I was sorely disappointd again!!  I ordered the butter chicken roll. It was so small, I had to eat somewhere else after. Please see my review for Como En Casa. The flavor was not good and the supposedly butter chicken gravy didn't even taste like butter chicken gravy. It was too tomato-y.  Nimboo pani is a version of lemonade. I had it and it was very good but almost $3! A rip off!  Needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Liked the ambience which per my taste was interesting and basic, some thought had gone into it and the various touches like the posters, hanging 'chandelier' table tops were creative. Now the food, what I came for.... I really wanted to like and fall in love with the place but have to stay with the Yelpers average of three stars. The Cannaught place Cold Coffee ( and I have had plenty at the origional place) was weak, just think a frothy vanilly shake with some coffee in the background. The Kathi Rolls were pretty good. Too much of the red dye though. The paratha that you wrap the fillings in is the most important element of the Kathi Roll. The origional in Calcutta is greasy like the philly sub. Owners here have tried to cater to popular taste by reducing the fat content dramatically which makes the roll a bit dry specially the parts not hit by the mint chutney. Tasted by wife's Acari Paneer which was very good. I tried the Mutton Roll for 9.95. They assued me it was goat meat which it most certainly was NOT. The meat was tender and they were generous with it, tastewise the meat seasoning was pretty good. In my opinion it would be better if they would keep the pieces smaller also if the quantity of egg was increased a bit there would be a better balance with the meat and paratha. The spicy mint chutney in the roll was excellent, if you like spicy ask for plenty of this stuff. Overall a good effort. I am sure they will work things out as they go. We were there late evening so it was ok but I see where other Yelpers are comming from when they mention long waits for their food."}
{"text":"Strolling by on a lunch break and wanted to grab something quick before heading back to my hole (er, I mean, office), I stopped in at TKRE.  I ordered the mumbo sized chick pea masala roll ($3.99) and eyed the pre-packaged desserts while I waited.  I enjoyed my roll and found it to be on the small size.  Next time, I will upgrade to the jumbo size."}
{"text":"I thought I'd eat the chicken tikka roll and all my childhood memories of Calcutta street food would come rushing back. No such luck. It wasn't that good. I lifted the roll off my plate and juices from the roll dripped onto my skirt. Annoying. They should wrap it better.  Service - slow. The girl at the counter took forever to take our order.  Drinks were good and authentic - the mango shake and nibu pani (Indian lemonade).  Maybe they should add some other varieties of Indian street food too, like paw bhaji"}
{"text":"Food here is terrific, I tried the chicken platter and Lamb roti. Was great amount to share between two people. Mango Lassi was great, not too sweet but quite tasty. I would skip the kulfi ice cream, consistency was strangely sticky with no real favour.   Staff was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived but then disappeared. Ambiance of the place is fun with great design but still pretty low key.   Prices are good value for dinner $40 for dinner for 2 but maybe too pricey for lunch goers. They also offered alcoholic because including $5/glass for wine with dinner. If def come back!"}
{"text":"Great prices, good food, long wait!  I walked by this place before dinner on my way to the Eaton's center. It was so cold that I had to stop by to warm up. Inside I saw the menu and decided to try the chicken tikka roll.  Now the wait here was probably 15-20 minutes which is way too long for a fast food joint. That was pretty disappointing, but it was worth the wait. The food was well spiced and good quality meat. I was happiest about the incredibly low prices.  If you're looking for a quick snack and want to watch a few indian music videos while you wait, this is the place to check out!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find. I've been coming here since it opened. The rolls are great and it's overall some really great Indian food. The butter chicken and lamb rolls are stand out. Hey have Indian cola and beer. It takes about ten minutes to make it but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"So I recently decided to give this place a second chance, since my first visit was a bad experience.  I thought that having had a few more weeks these guys would've really worked on their customer service & dealt with a few of their food kinks, but it wasn't so, unfortunately.  My smallest gripe was when I recently found out that the whole concept of the restaurant is just a copy of a similarly named one in New York (Kathi Roll Company). That was a bit of a turn off, since I enjoyed how these guys seemed to be something new & unique.  During my second visit here, I ordered a jumbo because I knew that the Mumbo I ordered before was definitely not enough. The chicken was very dry and all I could taste was the sauce ( I couldn't even taste the egg in my chicken tikka roll)..  Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant, these guys took their sweet time preparing one measly chicken roll..:(  All in all, I feel like I wasted my time and money. I don't know what all these 5 star reviews are on about, maybe they had better experiences than me, maybe they weren't honest, but, guys if you are reading this, PLEASE work on your portions, & hire more people! Please do these things to better your business, it will only better Yonge street. I will see you again once you work on these pleas from many of your customers."}
{"text":"SUNDAY ADVENTURE: also first time at this place (just adjacent to House of Lords) and you get a free regular can if pop you use the app.  THE Butter Chicken Kathi Roll ($11.29) is wrapped in a paratha and thin layer of egg. the sauce is thick like tomato sauce. The spices are just right, pleasant -- sweet and tangy just the way I like it. 8 minute wait. Recommended on a cold, windy day b/c it hit the spot. Staff explain what it's in it when you order,  is great and bollywood music is at a great volume. A1 THOUSAND PERCENT!"}
{"text":"TKRE which stands for The Kathi Roll Express (@tkretoronto) is a restaurant on Yonge & Bloor that specializes in Kathi Rolls just as the name suggest.  Kathi roll is street- food originating from Kolkata, India. It is a Kabab wrapped in a layered paratha. The paratha is a dough that is kneaded into a rope, then coiled into a round patty which is then flattened and partly fried in oil. These semi-cooked parathas are then kept aside till needed at which time they are cooked on the tawa (the large round cast iron disc/pan in the picture below), Then an egg is to be cracked directly onto the tawa and then the paratha put on top which will result in a one side coated paratha. Then just add the meat or veggies of your choice and voila a Kathi Roll.   Since Kathi Rolls are very popular street food in India, the decor of the place kept the same theme. I was pleasantly surprise how much I like the decor here complete with a Bollywood movie on the projector.  I was invited to a tasting event and we were quickly created with a thick mango lassi.   We were given 3 types of Kathi Rolls to try right away after everyone was settled at the back patio.  Achari Paneer Tikka Roll ~ spicy pickle & yogurt marinated chunks of Indian cottage cheese ~ If you never had Indian cottage cheese before, you'll have to try it at least once. They have a much firmer texture almost like harder tofu... it take on any flavors pretty well and are normally use or cook like meat. This was probably the spiciest out of the 3 which I love but it's the most filling one as well.  Shami Kebab (Lamb) Roll ~ minced lamb, chickpea lentils & spices bound with egg ~ Love this, the lamb are just so tender & flavorful and def my favorite out of the 3.  Chicken Tikka Roll ~ bbq'd chicken, marinated in yogurt & magical spices   The owner, Sumit Kohli is a huge fan of Kung Pao Chicken, so he created a roll than combine the 2 cultures together. They also have a Mexican, Korean and Thai style rolls.  Chicken Kung Pao Szechwan Style Roll ~ spicy stir fried chicken, peanuts, veggies & chillies    We were also allowed to chooe any one item from the menu and we decided to try their rice dishes.  BBQ'd Indian Quarter Chicken Leg Rice (New York Style) ~ grilled with a delicious yogurt & spice marinade  ~ Love the flavors but though it was a tad dry but I have to say that I loved the tawa griddled basmati rice.  The Greatest Street Food Platter ~ This was basically choosing any 4 types of kababs or tikka. I don't really remember what my friend choose but the Shami Kabab (Lamb) was still my fave just like the rolls.   Verdict : I will definitely be back and wish I work close by so I can grab lunch here Very affordable with rolls from $3.99 single fillings up to $9.99 for doubled filling.  *** This meal was complimentary. Opinions are my own***"}
{"text":"Originality counts and I haven't come across another spot like this in the city.  Given that it is competing with other faster food spots - in the league of gourmet burgers and burritos - it's one of the better options in the city.  I love the atmosphere - the Bollywood posters/videos, the bicycles, outdoor patio and chandelier made from colourful milk cartons.  It's fun and inviting.    I've tried a couple of rolls which where unique and full of flavour.  They've had fun twisting traditional Indian street food with other cuisine.    Service has been prompt and issue free - I've not experienced the problems previously reported.  A great option on the go or for lunch."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat lunch near work and passed by this place. Walked in, sat down and the server came over with menus. He asked if this was the first visit then went over the menu and explained some of their more popular items.  The presentation of the food was clean and served to the table on a plastic tray. Ordered the butter chicken egg wrap, it was spicy and that was about it. Was lacking the flavour and spices of a good butter chicken. The egg wrap was bland but held all the fillings well. After finishing the food, walked up to the front counter to pay. While waiting to pay, saw the cook scoop rice into a plastic container and put it in the microwave. Wasn't very impressed with that, not sure the quality of the other food after seeing that.  Overall, won't be back for the food."}
{"text":"I've been following the restaurant on Instagram for some time now and keep tagging my friends in their pictures because there food looks so scrumptious. I finally got a chance to try it and it was delicious! I tried their butter chicken burrito! It was super filling (could only eat half). The chef was doing the cooking as well as making sure all the guests in the restaurant were acknowledged. Great place!"}
