{"text":"This place is right up the street from us and we are impressed!! The food is made fresh to order and the girl behind the counter is always really nice and helpful! I also really like how clean it is."}
{"text":"First time there. Had rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Great price for a belly full of good food. Quick service also. I will return to try out some more dishes."}
{"text":"Must have changed owners. Go there and you will see what I mean. Not the same friendly service and the food did not taste the same. I left sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"Maaaaaan this place is goooood! So I called in an order and picked up the carne asada tostada and a chicken quesadilla from this place.... It was great, the tostada was crispy and not stale, had a ton of meat, the tostada packed in a bunch of flavor. And the red sauce was perfect with the chicken quesadilla... lots of cheese and chicken and their tortillas are great! I usually rate a Mexican joint on how great their tortillas are and let me tell you they are way up there. I will be coming back to try a bunch more from their huge selection."}
{"text":"Authentic, quick Mexican food. Very clean and great salsa bar.  Some other places skimp on the guacamole on the rolled tacos, but they serve just the right amount. Beans are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Really good food. We found ourselves coming here for their tacos at least once a week. I hope they make it, we need more small businesses like this to succeed."}
{"text":"When in need of street tacos and you don't want to drive to south Phoenix.... you guessed it! Alfonso's! Excellent service and authentic salsa to die for...yum!"}
{"text":"love this place. food is always excellent. service is excellent. love the salsa bar. they must do a lot of takeout as it is usually empty when we go."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have seen this place for some time.  First time I tried to go, it was closed during stated open hours.  It happens...   I tried again today after a few months and although it should have been open for breakfast at 730 am, it was not.  Still, I persisted because it would be great to have a good Mexican place close by.  So, I tried by lunch time and it was open.  I walked in and there was one couple eating, one person walked out with an order, so I though - OK, not bad for a Tuesday.  The girl up front was not welcoming, but acknowledged that I was perusing the menu.  I ordered the special mini chimi and was told, after asking, that they were all 3 mini's were beef chimis.  I looked at the salsa bar and found it to have a red and green sauce, some chunky vegies and something else that I can't remember.  There was an empty pan as well.  It was unimpressive...The food came out pretty quick though and I left for home.  The three chimis' came with rice, beans and sour cream as promised.  Rice and beans tasted salty...typical for this fast casual venue.  The chimi's where terrible.  I've had more meat in a won ton.  It was obviously hand rolled - that's good - lot's of cheese...but a mere shadow of beef."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. I got two beef tacos, and they were relatively inexpensive but very flavorful. OK customer service, but the food makes up for it. I would come back."}
{"text":"I've had several different burritos at this place so tonight I tried the Macho Nachos. Insanely good! It's a meal and a half. No toppings on top with nothing below - nope, there was enough toppings for all the chips, piled high. Chunks of meat the right size and awesome chips. Honestly the best Nachos I've ever had. All the burritos I've had there are super filling and really good too. I don't know this place isn't packed all the time! Definitely my Go-To Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Alfonso based on Yelp good reviews and it bring a half mile from my house.  I'm glad to report the food was very good.   Guacamole was very fresh and tasty.   Went with a group  of  people  and they all loved it.  WI will definetly be coming back again. My new go to establishment."}
{"text":"We got the  Alfanso's burrito. We tried the location in Payson and loved it.  It's  1.00 more in  Phoenix but the  burrito is Def bigger. Has any one person finished one of these? The hubby and I can barely finish half."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast burritos and they were awesome.  Friendly and fast service.  This is a very convenient location for us, we'll be coming back frequently."}
{"text":"Moved here recently and was looking for the best breakfast burrito. We found it at Alfonso's. great price, willing to add stuff (try adding rice and a little sour cream). Cooked nicely, not over cooked. Good distribution of ingredients throughout the burrito. The restaurant is simple, clean and comfortable.  The hot sauces are yummy."}
{"text":"It's really pathetic that people write reviews that the food is good but yet give it a 1 star because there was flys inside the restaurant, I work in a three-story building and flys seem to find their way up there. Any who the food is amazing I always end up getting the same thing which is beef tacos and carne asada fries"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast burritos and chilaquiles. Also my kids quesadillas were really good!!!! Will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Not often that I order food, take two bites, and walk out...  First off let me start by saying that this is no New Mexican Grill.   This restaurant back filled their own location and is not nearly as good.  Carne asada in burrito was cold.  My wife's beef burrito was chewy.  Salsa bar looked like it hadn't been refreshed in 5 days. Tortillas tasted stale.  And the tortilla to filling ratio was WAY off.  Thought I would try this new place because it is a little closer to my house than the other New Mexican grill location.  My mistake.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars because they no longer take pride in the appearance of their business. Dirty tables, dirty windows, dirty floors, flies inside, and a disgustingly dirty salsa bar. Also, they're not always open during the stated business hours on the door. It would be best to call ahead to make sure that they are open."}
{"text":"Transplanted from Napa, CA; every time I go back I visit my favorite place: Tannya's Taqueria on Jefferson.  They make the best everything!   In comparison, yes, short of the fan out-of-balance near Alfonso's front window and windows requiring a wipe-down, the best green chile burrito/dinner that I've had in AZ."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast burrito really good!!! The young ladies working there are really nice and great customer service.  Very clean place Will come back soon"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp because my brothers were in town and wanted real Mexican food. This place is sooooo good! True authentic Mexican food! My brothers came here last night and brought home tacos and burritos. They had carna asada and carnitas. The carnitas burrito I tried was great! Then we came here this morning and got breakfast burritos!!! Bomb!!! This place is legit! They also have breakfast plates! Next time we're trying the huveous rancheros. Def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This has been my third visit to Alfonso's Mexican Food restaurant on 19th Ave and Union Hills. Out of the three times I have found hair in my food twice. Second time I reached out to the staff to let them know about the issue. Julie was very unprofessional and rude over the phone; I requested to speak with the manager instead. Julie was very hesitant to even give the manager's name. I politely asked for a refund after this atrocious discovery. Staff refused to refund my purchase. I will NEVER go to another Alfonso's Mexican Food."}
{"text":"This place is hella bomb, and plus you get to support the little guy. I get adovada and love it, get yo self here and munch on down!!!"}
{"text":"Update:  I went back at lunch and was happy to see the place was full.  Food was awesome as always, but my favorite part is the Salsa Bar.  They have some of the most interesting and freshest salsa recipes I have found in the Gilbert/Chandler area (I would say the same of Juan Jaime's salsa bar).  Friday they have a Chile Relleno special.  Yummmmmm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this place!!! Excellent flavor and close to home. The beans and carne asada are out of this world great!! I would pick Alfonsos over Los any day."}
{"text":"This was an excellent choice for authentic Mexican food. The meal could not have been tastier; the service is cordial and very accommodating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is made fresh and tastes amazing. Dont go to that bertos place! ...Alfonsos is so much better!"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 different enchiladas: chicken, beef and cheese. They all tasted the same and had the same sauce. No variety and all you could taste was salt.    The chips and cheese was literally chips with melted shredded cheese on top.  Needless to say it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place. I called in an order went to pick it up and when I got there they said they were out of the item I ordered. What kind of low budget place takes your order gives you a total and then when you come to pick up your food its not available. That is really poor business practice don't waste your time like they wasted mine."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant but very tasteless food. I'm surprised that Mexican food can be so bland!  I had the crunchy carne Asada tacos. The meat was chewy and bland with more lettuce than flavor. My husband had a carne Asada burrito which didn't have any rice or beans in them - just meat, guac and salsa. So disappointing! We won't be back as there is amazing Mexican food out there. This just wasn't one of those places. The empty restaurant should have been an indicator."}
{"text":"Comfortable family-style restaurant with order at the counter and pick up service. The chili Rellanos were outstanding , tacos were average they were good however they lacked much meat.beans were undercooked and tasteless. If I return I'd order a la carte skipping on beans and rice altogether."}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick lunch take out, ordered a carnitas taco and a adobada taco, they were both very taste. They are big and filling. Wish they had street tacos (smaller ones) but this definitely were great!"}
{"text":"My husband really liked his carne asada chimi. I think the guac could be better, but my bean burro hit the spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was disappointed and feel misled by a Yelper saying this place is da' bomb. I had a fish taco and chicken enchilada. Neither item would make me want to come back  again. The chips were good, but a restaurant can't stay in business on just having good chips. And what is it with these little Mexican food places providing napkins that are as thin as a Kleenex tissue. You end up using 20 napkins! Ambience is the same as a Filiberto's - cheap and all sounds echoe in the dining area."}
{"text":"Solid spot. Came across Alfonso's while visiting for Spring Training. Everything was very fresh (chips tasted like they were fresh out of the fryer) and tasted great. We tried the tacos, enchiladas and sopes, all were great. To top it off, the staff were very friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not good Mexican food. Very straight forward dishes done very poorly. Bland salsa, chile verde was bland, escabeche was lackluster. Very disappointing. The place was hot inside, drinks had no ice, service was apprehensive. One star is given for food being hot.  I don't think this place will be around for long..."}
{"text":"My new fave for a quick tasty and affordable Mexican meal!  Had the carne asada plate and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's the closest Mexican food place to my house. First what I like about it; certainly the location. The interior has also been updated nicely too. The owners of this place are completely new; this location had previously been 2 other Mexican places before; one was good, one not so good. The women working the counter were very friendly and the menu is clear. Where it needs improvement; the layout inside is sparse, they can not accomodate a family eating a meal here. A few small tables is all they currently have. I'd like to see a chips and salsa station; waiting for your food isn't as bad when you have a snack. I've ordered breakfast burrito's here twice; the first time I ordered an egg & cheese. I got egg, cheese and potato (I'm not a potato fan). The menu does list potatoes in all the burrito's and I didn't specify \"no potato\" so I really won't ding them for that. So I decided to give it another try and this time I did specify \"no potato\" and I did get what I ordered, however, my tortilla is overcooked with several burnt spots (meh, I don't like a burnt taste to my tortilla). I do like the green and red salsa they serve (I mix them together). A good kick but not over the top. They are open M-Sat, closed on Sunday. So overall, currently they have a \"meh\" 2.5 rating from me, however, I will give them another try and will update my review accordingly. I have to try some of the other foods as well. I think this place has potential to be a good one so give it a try; they are new and perhaps they will use the feedback they are getting from customers to make improvements."}
{"text":"got a carne asada burrito and carnitas taco.  both came with guacamole & pico de gallo, and both were excellent.  the meat is tasty, the guacamole is nice & chunky, and the pico de gallo is fresh.  the salsa bar is awesome.  i tried the fiery red hot salsa and avocado salsa, which were both great.  they also have tomatillo salsa, red salsa, spicy carrots/jalapenos, and limes at the salsa bar.  don't listen to amy.  rice does not belong in a burrito.  beans, yes.  but if you want rice in your burrito, go to chipotle.  carne asada burritos in southern california & arizona come with guac and pico.  that is the style, and it is done well here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner tonight and had a great experience. The food was fresh (carne asada is amazing), the sauces are all fantastic and for me, the tortillas are exactly what I am looking for, a little salty and zero sweetness.     The staff are super cool people and a pleasure to chat with. Highly recommend you stop in and see these guys!"}
{"text":"Two stars for the service, the food on the other hand was very bland, we had the beef taco combinations, super nachos, bean bowls and a Pork burrito  ($48.00) all which taisted the same. BLAND!  Mexican food in my experience has many flavors from the beans to the meats all very distinctive Not at this place, it didn't matter what you were eating it all taisted the same. The food gets no rating from me. Anyone that has eat mexican food before will be disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"I consider myself truly lucky to live in Arizona, where good Mexican food is very easy to find. Their are a plethora of Mexican fast food places everywhere you look in the Valley, and most of them are miles ahead of any \"Mexican\" fare you could find in other parts of the country. Alfonso's is a solid choice.  Ok, you will not be wowed by the decor or the ambiance. But you will be satisfied with the food. On this visit, I went with the California burrito and was feeling particularly gluttonous so I added three rolled tacos with guacamole.  The California Burritto was spot on - a FRESH flour tortilla, succulent cuts of carne adasa, veggies, sour cream, and of course - french fries. As someone who grew up in Southern California, I can say that these are up to par with the California burritos I enjoyed in my youth. The rolled tacos were also very good, with a heaping serving of guacamole and cheese.  If I had any complaints, they would be:  1. They are a touch higher than average when it comes to price. ($3.95 for 3 rolled tacos?) With ice tea, lunch was $13. Not crazy expensive, but a bit more that what I'm used to paying for comparable fare.  2. They don't have a salsa bar. They have two varieties - green and red - which they will give you at the counter, but I like trying the different flavors and taking advantage of the jalapenos and spicy carrots that other places offer.  Not huge complaints. Service is friendly and efficient. Free iced tea refills. The food here is solid and I will probably be back.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover.   I guess the saying must be true \"You can't judge a book by its cover\".  The  exterior at Alfonso's is unassuming, the restaurant is very clean, the service is efficient, and I cannot say enough about the food.  Alfonso's Mexican Food is a delicious surprise.    Alfonso's offers a large variety of great menu choices. Alfonso's does not have table service, so you order your entrée  at the counter, pick up your food, and take it to your table.  The food is not what you would call \"fast\" food but carefully prepared food would be a better choice of words.  On this visit I had the shredded beef and ground beef tacos and both were really very good and seasoned perfectly. My lunch companion had the Carne Asada Burrito and he said it was the best he's ever had. The burritos at Alfonso's are huge, inexpensive, and most important, delicious.   If your ever in the area stop by Alfonso's. The food is authentic and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We bought a restaurant.com certificate for this place.  Reviews looked good.  Well, when we showed up they refused to honor the restaurant.com.  That is a bait and switch.  I will not patronize any place that does not honor their offers.  it's dishonest and poor business practice."}
{"text":"Hey, ho, let's go, to Alfonso's. My wife and I were up from Tucson and looking for a place to eat around our son and daughter's house.  We Yelped restaurants and up came Alfonso's Mexican Food. The reviews were very good so we decided to visit this mom and pop and we weren't disappointed. The food was excellent and served quickly. Fish tacos were battered and deep fried to perfection, crisp and not greasy. I was expecting ground beef in my  taco and was surprised to find shredded beef. The beans and rice were plentiful and very tasty. Leftovers for lunch tomorrow! If you're looking for Mexican food Alfonso's is the place to go."}
{"text":"this place is awesome kind of hidden behind the Circle K went there for lunch from work ordered Alfonso burrito they cost around 9 bucks but it's over a foot long I couldn't believe it it was a giant burrito and it was so so good I went there yesterday and I plan on going back there today for another giant burrito and they're really nice there and their own sauces that they make they were all fantastic spicy mild  guacamole sauce is awesome 5-stars ."}
{"text":"I had the nachos with carne asada awesome. Bean and cheese burritos were good. Beef taco was a tad greasy but good flavor."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.   2nd time I have been to this place.   This time the cashier girl messed up the order.  Didn't bring us the chips and salsa she charged me for.  She is too busy on her phone to care."}
{"text":"Stopped in this afternoon the place was nice and clean. Great customer service very friendly staff. Food was excellent. 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food and generous portions.  The tacos are huge and always hot and fresh.  Fresh, hot chips with a large selection of salsa on their salsa bar.  The salsa bar is always clean and kept cold with ice that is refreshed often.  I eat there at least once a week but many times twice.  So many good choices.  I highly recommend Alfonso's."}
{"text":"Nice Mom and Pop place.  I had the enchilada plate which I thought was reasonably priced.  Nice portion size, everything tasted very authentic.  Great salsa bar.  Friendly staff.  Would return for sure!"}
{"text":"I was really excited that this place opened so close to my house being that I love breakfast burritos. First time I went, the burrito was great. Second time, I'm pretty sure I was served the potatoes from a few days before mixed with fresh ones along with a bunch of bacon grease. I gave this place another chance this morning hoping the last time was just a mess up. I saw the cook cleaning the grill with a cleaning rag and then directly reach into the container of potatoes and put them on the grill... before washing his hands or putting gloves on.. GROSS. If they are doing this IN FRONT of the customers, who knows what goes on when no one can see! I couldn't even eat the burrito, I was so grossed out. Guess I'll have to keep driving the extra few miles to Los Favritos."}
{"text":"I work nearby at the urgent care and often come here when I am craving Mexican food.  They are always very nice and the food is consistently good.  Never fails to put a smile on my face."}
{"text":"There tacos taste Soo good make you wanna slap your Momma                                                                            ......"}
{"text":"Love the tacos. Price was great. 99 cents on mon and Tues. Really great. Ordered carne asada tacos and enchiladas. Awsome. Restaurant was very clean.  Will definitely be back for more and will reccomend for family and friends. Only downfall.... not open 24 hrs. Lol"}
{"text":"Great Chimichungas and Carne Asada Burrittos!"}
{"text":"I'm here having lunch and taking the time to write this review because I had to take a break. Ok so this isn't the most luxurious restaurant, however, their food is really good!! I had the Alfonso burro and it was huge and fresh. They are clearly a mom and pop place and they don't have hot sauce but it's made up for with the food!! This is definitely my most favorite spot for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I've had their carne asada and carnitas.  Both are quite delicious.  Higher quality than the average mexican fast food."}
{"text":"If I eat Mexican food it is only this place! The tortillas they use are amazing. If I must recommend something it will have to be the beef tacos with sour cream that's always my go to."}
{"text":"Such a great little place. The food is yummy and fresh, I was a little worried walking in an hour before closing time. Carne asada fries are a must! Huge serving, more than enough to share. The staff at the counter were pleasant and very helpful. I'm looking forward to trying more of their menu. Not much of an atmosphere/decor, not really important when you bring good company and have great food to share."}
{"text":"I'm always hunting for great tacos, and this place has them! Lots of meat and lots of flavor. I tried my husband's beans and those were very good as well. It's tucked into a plaza so you can't see it from the road - definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"This is a simple place, decor wise. You order at a counter and there are several tables you can eat at. Everyone else that came in took their order to go.  The food was amazing. Two of us had the carne asada taco combo meal and they were amazing. Husband got the ranchero burrito without the breakfast potatoes and it was out-of-this-world. We barely talked during the meal other than to say \"So good\" or groan with pleasure."}
{"text":"Right by my house, so this place is super convenient! However, the food just seemed average. Better than Filiberto's, but not as good as Los Favoritos or Betillo's:-/ we had carne asada fries and a carne asada burrito. The flavor was lacking and seemed to be just mostly salty. Extra star for being friendly and speedy, but despite the convenience, I can't have this be my go to place. Might try again another time for other menu items."}
{"text":"Chicken burrito was decent. Salsa is cheap/watery/no flavor. It's a fast food style restaurant even though the prices are the same as a sit down. Definitely would not recommend to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Recently a cashier by the name of Jazmine took my order. I've seen some reviews of how the girls up front tend to be \" unwelcoming\" or \"rude\" and that is absolutely wrong, except for an old employee who I have not seen in a while for some time, tall , quiet and totally awkward. Jazmine's never fails to be considerate of how my day is going and unlike other casual places that usually tell you to \"have a nice day\" . She tells me \" drive safe and I hope you have a wonderful day \" . The food... the menudo, carne asada burritos, and literally anything is mouth watering. I live a bit closer to filibertos  but there is no way on earth I'll ever go there due to past experiences. If you're skeptical about this place , hey , don't knock it till you try it. Delicious and fast . Is all I got to say."}
{"text":"this place is trash!! i bought a $25 gift certificate from here and then came back and they said they no longer accept gift cards!!! place is a complete rip off! save your money and eat anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night for our Friday night Mexican food fix. I had the vegetarian burrito. It. Was. Bomb. Hubby had the carne asada burrito & loved it as well. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay the steak in my carne Asada was not the best but I've had worse... I don't think I'll eat here anymore but it wasn't bad just not something I'll go back too"}
{"text":"Came in at lunch. Wanted to check this place out as a saw a great pic from a fellow yelper & thought : \"what the heck, I'll try it out\"!  I had the combo #5. Beef taco & cheese enchilada. I had them add chopped onion in it for added flavor. The meal comes with rice & beans. It also came with a drink. The young man (cashier) informed me that they were out of medium cups ( requested that size) however they only had large. I said, \"I'll take the large, as long as it's the same price as the medium?!\", He said, \"Yes, I can do that\"!  I was somewhat taken back as the total was $10.34. I thought that was really pricey! Their salsa bar was nice, but could have been replenished . Low on BOTH salsas. Green was better than the red. Just the two options. Carrots were a little mushy, I prefer them still kinda crunchy. My meal I can say wasn't great. The enchilada ( corn tortilla) was greasy, cheese wasn't melted. Hardly any enchilada sauce on top. The entire taco was fully fried so the meat inside was dry & again fairly greasy. Would really enjoy, just one time from a traditional Mexican joint having a taco shell cooked separately & then filled with that juicy flavorful meat. Guess I'm just dreaming! LOL On a positive note-I would say the restaurant is clean & the young man upfront was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Food was not good.  Made Teach Bell taste like 5 star.  Carnitas were so tough they were like old jerky.  Will never be back!"}
{"text":"I will try them again eventually and hopefully get better service. The Burrito was good but the chips and salsa was brutal. Service was shit though while I was the only person in the restaurant and the food was sitting finished behind the counter for 5 minutes when the help was too busy watching TV."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. They have daily specials and probably the best housemade pico I've ever had. I had cheese enchiladas, beans, rice, chips and salsa and it was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered two Alfonso's.  I ordered mine with shrimp ($2.00 extra), and my husband got his with Carne.  We took it home, and divided ours in half, for the next day. The shrimp was amazing, nice and large, and both of the burros were filled with everything!!  This is the the 2nd time, that we have been in here.  We usually \"eat in\" the restaurant, but tonight we took it to go.  The salsas are delicious, and while we waited, we munched on the carrots and jalapenos that they serve on the side.  Please give this little gem a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times . Never lets me down it's under new management . The new owners are really cool! Way better than filibertos"}
{"text":"First visit so review is for only one experience. I got the breakfast burrito steak egg and cheese. This is the only \"fast food\" Mexican restaurant in Arizona that I have been too which uses fresh eggs, not out of a carton so they got an extra star for that. The burrito was good with plenty of meat. The salsa was fresh and the flavor was top notch. I highly recommend the brownish salsa as it pairs with the steak so well. I look forward too more samplings from this place. Restaurant was clean and workers were friendly and for less than 5 bucks a bargain for the size."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Unique shells - not like those 'bertos places or the del/bells. Rolled tacos are great. 1st time here - we'll be back! Sauces are pretty good too btw."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was great. Tasted fresh and had a ton of flavor. The salsa could be improved a little bit but overall it was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"I quite possibly had the worst restaurant experience of my life here last Sunday.  Out of groceries and craving huevos rancheros my girl friend and I yelped Mexican in North Vegas, Alfonso's Mexican Food was close to the casa and had two solid reviews so we decided to give it a shot.  Situated next to Sushi Wow and Dennys this place used to be an Italian restaurant at one time I believe.  Doesn't look like they've done much remodeling since the last owners left, the inside was clean and well lit.       Standard Mexican \"fast food\" set up with a picture menu above the register and counter. The lone employee was in the kitchen when we came in and had a barely concealed look of annoyance gracing his unshaven blearily eyed face upon being summoned to the counter by the bell on the counter.  We asked a few questions about some of the breakfast dishes and received two word grumbled answers for our trouble.     We ordered two plates of eggs, with various chilies, rice and refried beans with two drinks.  There was no coffee (it was about 8:30 AM) no ice (the \"cook\" gave us some), the horchata machine was empty, and soda was flat.  After waiting at least 15 minutes he brought our food out and tossed it onto our table before shuffling back into the kitchen to, I can only assume, take a nap. Our eggs were runny and over cooked respectively, the rice may as well have been shredded cardboard, and the beans were clearly microwaved.     I will never again step foot back into this place, should someone who is a manager or owner of this establishment read this please know I took a few day to write this so as to not let my negative emotions unreasonably affect my review.  And you should probably fire whoever was working on October 24th 2010 so as to not lose future customers who may be unlucky enough to enter into your \"restaurant\".  Anyone who may be considering eating here I beg you: take your business elsewhere, there has to be a Roberto's nearby, there is a Denny's within walking distance, go across the street to McDonald's!"}
{"text":"We actually went to this location by mistake. We believed it to be a Burrito Bandito, but after reading some reviews, we decided to try it anyways. The three times we have visited this place, it was pretty slow. The 1st time I got the 3 mini beef and cheese chimis. I'm pretty certain they used a slice of real cheddar cheese because it was so melty and gooey! The torta I had the 2nd time was so big I couldn't finish it all. The flavors here are great and the service is always very friendly as well. Can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food served fast with friendly service. I am a regular with their breakfast burritos, $4 each and served all day. The chorizo, egg and potato breakfast burrito is a personal favorite. Tacos, enchiladas, huevos rancheros and carne asada are also tasty."}
{"text":"this is my favorite little Mexican restaurant. I use to live right behind them before they opened so I was there the day they opened and cannot stop going. I was curious if there food was going to taste as fresh and good like it did the day they opened and it always does. it is always clean in there and although I got to know the owners personally from going in there all the time they are pleasant to everyone. There are so many things on the menu to choose from and although some things at first glance may seem pricey you get a huge portion they are not skimpy with toppings. This will always be my favorite"}
{"text":"In my opinion not a good Mexican restaurant with the exception of the poor decor. There is no music and no fruit water I.e. Pinapple etc. the burrito was $7+ for chorizo, and ham added as extra... Not impressive. I give it three stars at least because it was tasty and they weren't stingy on the meat."}
{"text":"Tonight I had purchased a Groupon to try this restaurant. We got there ordered our food, presented to Groupon and they refused to honor it because they no except Groupon. With the respect I only purchased it an hour before means they were still advertising with Groupon. Owner was extremely rude and would not work with us at all. Told us we needed to contact the merchant to get a refund. It is their responsibility to contact Groupon and cancel. With the experience I had with Alfonzos I do not recommend anyone to go there. Yelp requires you to put a star rating. Alfonzos star rating is negative doesn't deserve not even 1 star. We ended up eating at Chinese Express across the parking lot. Less expensive,  awesome customer service and very friendly.  I recommend going to Chinese Express."}
{"text":"We've passed Alfonso's many times and after seeing the many positive reviews decided to give it a try and are we glad we did!!!  My boyfriend ordered the Alfonso Burrito, but he customized it by adding shrimp and enchilada sauce- I couldn't believe how humongous this burrito was- had to fit into 2 containers!!! What matters, though, is that he loved it- made fresh, carne asada was excellent. And he's got the other half of the burrito for lunch tomorrow.   I ordered the carne asada quesadilla- again, huge, couldn't eat it all and it was yummy.   We will definitely be back!!!"}
