{"text":"Stopped here before our flight out of Cleveland. Great food! Onion rings are the bomb, friendly atmosphere and quick service  Great place to stop if you're stuck in Cleveland overnight like I was"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in on the way home from an appointment out in Rocky River. She had the Chicken Paprikash Soup and salad. I had a Reuben (after considering many things). I had to take half of the sandwich home, not that it was enormous but a decent size. The fries were great.,, piping hot! We will return. Total bill for 2 with tip $22.00. The place was clean. We had very good service. And free wi fi ... come on! How can we give less than four stars???"}
{"text":"Greek & American food, Greek owned.  Always great service, always great food, great portion sizes, best bang for your buck, and food is always out to you quickly!  Oh and authentic gyro meat off the spit!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sign said best Gyro in town.  So I thought to myself even if it was an exaggeration how bad could it be? Mistake #1 - Don't answer question above until you know if any other places serve Gyros.  Because if that was the best I would hate to see what came in second.  Mistake #2 - I ate it.       This thing was served to me that looked like dried up dog feces sliced with some diced tomato (I had asked to hold the onions). It was dried out almost to the point of being jerky. However,  It was late and my only other option was a Bob Evans across the street (in hind sight a much safer option) so I dug in. The taste wasn't bad once I got past the died out pieces of what I hope was meat. Some pieces were just not editable but the majority went down with a couple diet Pepsis. I paid the tab and went back to my hotel across the street. Four hours later the real problems started happening. I will spare you the details but Montezuma would be proud.        So if you are in need of a meal in this area and don't have a vehicleI recommend any of the other places the hotel recommends but steer clear of Goodys."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! They have excellent breakfast skillets, I went there on 2 separate occasions and ordered the same thing and both times my Italian Skillet was consistently good. There menu is a perfect size, not too small and not too big to overwhelm you.  I also went on Father's Day and we only had to wait about 5 minutes (even though they said it would be a 20 minute wait).  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had the hangover special. the chilly over powered the eggs,  but over all it was good. my husband had the southern combo he said for the price I was good. cheap biscuits but it was ok."}
{"text":"Okay so after the last issue with this place. Re returned today for lunch. Food was good and this time the chef wasn't even on his phone. However the what turned out to be the owners wife. Was talking to one of the waitresses or better said the entire restaurant about how much the items cost the owner and why they can't give discounts to the associates telling her every other sentence in my opinion you should do this and in my opinion you should do that yada yada yada. SHE WAS SO LOUD I THOUGGT SHE WAS YELLING AT THE WAITRESS. So when we were leaving my wife mentioned to her thAt she was so LOUD it was obnoxious to all the customers. She replied with oh okay well this is a family establishment not a fine dining restaurant. My wife said well you don't need to be so loud and she replied well I will tell my husband the owner maybe he will fire me and then laughed in my wiges face. Just to sum it up We have eaten there on average of once a month or so for the last 3 years or so. All I can say is we will not be going back. THE OWNERS WIFE is nasty."}
{"text":"This is a family restaurant run by a man who is out of control.  I went there to join my family in a meal but they were late.  I was told I could not occupy a table until the entire party was there.  OK I understand but I asked for coffee while I waited but they refused.  When my family arrived I told them that I was REFUSED coffee and the owner went nuts!  He started to shake and yelled \"get out\" to us.  He was clearly out of control and I feared for my life!  We left in a hurry and will never go back.  I recommend you stay away.  The owner could go off like a bomb again any time and it will be unsafe for you if he does while you are there."}
{"text":"Smiles and fast, attentive service abound amidst a menu of fresh, homemade food. This is a true family restaurant that lives up to its name. I found a real gem, just around corner from the Cleveland Airport.    No WIFI, unfortunately, or at least my kind server was not aware of their password.    Clean restrooms, a good sign of attention to the details of the customer experience.    I heard my server welcome several guests by name, as they walked in the door.  Gabby, my server who introduced herself, made me feel right at home.  Omelettes are huge.  I ordered a veggie omelette made healthy and the extra effort was no problem to accommodate my healthy food requirements.  No skim milk....only 2%.  (I was not about to ask for soy milk.)  I am not the norm, I realize, so no harm, no foul.   I have officially changed my flight pattern when departing from Hopkins Airport... I will stop to enjoy a hearty breakfast and smile at Goody's first."}
{"text":"Always great food except This time the sausage gravy had pink meat in it. Never before had that. Waitress and cook insist its cooked and say thats how it comes packaged and precooked. Only time will tell if i get sick."}
{"text":"Goody's is the reason I came to Cleveland. OK, that's not true but it could be. I am a simple man. I love breakfast food. Goody's has good breakfast food, good service, low prices, and nice people. They even have grits, which for a Southerner traveling in the North is a rare find. The food comes very quickly. Too quickly. I am thinking the NSA must have hacked my GPS and placed my order in advance. If so, thanks!"}
{"text":"Very good food, wait staff caring and anticipate expectations/needs (brought extra napkins for a messy food)."}
{"text":"I grew up in southern Ohio and this place reminds me of home.  A small diner/restaurant that makes good food with good service at an affordable price.  Its pretty simple, if you like food...  you will like Goody's."}
{"text":"Very friendly and hospitable family restaurant.  Outstanding service, real busboys, wonderful home style cooking. I tried chicken and waffles for the first time here, will return often!   I think the proprietor is bilingual English/Russian, who provided translation service for a family that spoke no English while I dined."}
{"text":"Ok to poor quality food, good service.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat there quite often and have found the service to be very friendly, with the food arriving quickly.  We have never found the owner to be anything but friendly and mild mannered.  Perhaps the people who indicated the owner was rude had the wrong restaurant in mind.  We've arrived there with a group before and not everyone was there at the same time.  We were seated and offered beverages while we waited.    Restroom is always clean.  Food is decent, reasonably priced.  The soup is great.  It's our go-to place when we decide to stop after work or while running errands."}
{"text":"Old school service with constant attention and smiles.    Don't remember having a better breakfast anywhere else, and truly do appreciate the protein options available to go along with the typical eggs, toast sides.    Went right in at 7:30am and was greeted and seated by people who genuinely seemed happy for us to be there (which can be hard to find, considering we were one of the first people in the door, and I've been in plenty of places where employees felt like they should be having \"set-up time.\")  This will be my breakfast place when I come to town."}
{"text":"ALWAYS great food and the nicest waitresses. There's a little something of everything on the menu. I wish the hours they were open was longer though."}
{"text":"Great Chili.  Big portions.  Homemade iced tea. Salad dressing so-so. Fresh soup.  Go for the mashed potatoes alone!"}
{"text":"Hey! I thought this place was pretty good. They serve breakfast all day!The prices are great! Cheap! Made me wonder why I spend $15 on brunch when I can get a darn good spinach and feta omelette for $4.50. My friend got the two egg breakfast. The food came out pretty fast,   Service was attentive. My coffee cup was always full. The place was clean. And I got to eat breakfast for lunch!"}
{"text":"Plenty of breakfast options. Grecian breakfast wrap hit the spot. Tzatziki on the side was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast w/ the beau on a Saturday.  We were seated right away.  The waitress was very nice & kept the refills coming.  The food was fast.  I had a great omelette and the hash-browns were real fried potatoes not those frozen things.... The man said the breakfast meat was meh. (I'd agree).  Overall, I'll agree w/ Cara & her \"middle of the road\" decision.  WIll I go back?  Maybe."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Breakfast all day and it's so tasty. The staff is always friendly and food comes out fast. Omelets are good and sandwiches and burgers are great too. Just wish they had longer hrs."}
{"text":"I enjoy their breakfast it's just that I went early in the morning and their a/c wasn't working. It was already hot by 11. But the steak breakfast was good. Another thing I did not like was their orange juice it tasted like its been refrigerated for months and for 1 meal close to 25 bucks when I could of gone around  the corner to gusses and get a steak breakfast for 10.99 and they have great air conditioning which makes my morning a lot better. Eating at Goody's restaurant the food was good but I was sweating while eating my food, which made it all uncomfortable to be in there."}
{"text":"Service and Food were excellent.  Goody's is your prototypical diner that serves comfort food at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended to anyone traveling and staying near the Cleveland Airport.  Come hungry and leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and friendly service but the food has some work to be done. Ordered the homemade meat loaf,  don't know whose home it came from but definitely brought in from some where,  it was edible but not that good or homemade. Would recommend the place but definitely do not eat the meat loaf"}
{"text":"This eatery is located right off I-71 on Snow Rd East of ramp.....I often stop here for lunch..er breakfast is what I usually have at luchtime- if you get there B4 11:30 $3.99- 3 eggs, home fries, toast-3 sausage links & coffee!   Always good food, great service, and restroom gets a 5 star rating.  Oh yea I really enjoy reading the paper while I eat & there is always a copy of PD & USA Today on the counter to borrow & enjoy.   Very complete menu with daily specials, also a small patio if it's nice out."}
{"text":"Hit the Planet Fitness nearby and decided to stop here afterward for some eggs. Had vegetable omelette which rocked! The bacon was ok - not crispy like I prefer. The coffee tasty. Service exceptional at the counter. People around these parts just seem friendlier and in this place it was great. Family owned and operated, no part of a big chain and it shows in how they care. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. Great coffee. Chicken noodle soup was bland, but the stuffed pepper soup was out of this world. My husbands patty melt was ok, my tuna melt was ok, I have had better. Maybe next time we will try breakfast. The French fries could have been fried longer."}
{"text":"Pros: Really great, tasty food and you won't go hungry! The gyro is the real stuff, shaved off the spit. When i'm in the area it's a comfort food stop.  Cons: Felt like the price was just a wee bit high for what it was. I'm used to Canary's prices, where I'm a regular. If they took off a dollar each on the breakfast plates, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Middle of the road--I think that's the perfect way to describe this place.   A little local diner in Brook Park that you can tell is catered toward an older crowd, and super family friendly to boot.   The waitress could be a little more smiley, but they certainly weren't rude to us. What really tops the \"impress me\" charts is how quickly the food comes out. I seriously had just finished uttering the words \"veggie, egg white omelet\" before the plate was slide into front of my hungry face. Well, well, well... you can't top that when you have a hungry 6yr old in tow!  The hashbrowns were more like mashed potatoes, smashed into a frying pan and seared. Interesting, but not my fave. Let's just say I had to load 'em up with salt and hot sauce. The veggie omelet was also pretty standard. All your typical vegetables and nothing stand-out-ish. Not the worst one I've ever had, but I wouldn't say it was the best.  I think if we were in the area, we'd come back for lunch or something. Who knows, their lunch and dinner menu could be way better."}
{"text":"Very traditional family-owned restaurant that feels very \"homey\" inside. The food is good, the prices are great, and the portions are filling. I wouldn't say that the food was the best I've ever had, but it was pretty great -- and it's a great break from the plethora of chain restaurants which are otherwise available in the vicinity!"}
{"text":"Back home yet again!  This place still rocks for a breakfast joint. Hangover Omelet and French Toast; I think so. If you come here thinking 5 star dinning, you will be disappointed.  This is a diner in a great location off the 71 or 480.  Not much more you could ask for in a breakfast joint like this. As always service was great, food was quick, and light on the pockets. Not sure how many cities Samantha has ate breakfast at, but this place rocks a GREAT breakfast. Take it from a traveling civilian and former U.S. Marine. This place Rocks!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food was fantastic. The tater bowl was very good. Thank you for the honesty of my credit card falling in the booth."}
{"text":"I stopped Today to Try a new place and very good food and service. Constantly brought me refills without asking. Will be back hopefully soon"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quiet dinner with your family. Loved the coffee and the waitress was really helpful."}
{"text":"always spotlessly clean .. always friendly .. always tasty .. hands down the best tuna melt EVER"}
{"text":"As for a breakfast place, they would be hard to beat.  Very fast service, great prices, great food, friendly people.  What more could want?  I didn't want to write this in fear of them getting too busy but they deserve the review and I have been there many times.  Yes, Bob Evans is across the street but I would have to wait for service and additional coffee.  At Goody's any of the waitresses are glad to give you a refill."}
{"text":"This was the best home cooked food place. Very cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.  We where in town on vacation for my son's 17th birthday weekend. I ordered cake for dessert and the waitress brought his piece out, with a candle and even sang Happy Birthday with us."}
{"text":"I love this family friendly restaurant. Locally owned not a chain from out of town.  Service is fast. The food is always hot and how  i order it every time.  Stop in see Mike and his staff for a pleasant meal.  Oh don't forget breakfast served all day."}
{"text":"Had breakfast.  It was pretty good and not bad for the price.  People are also nice & friendly.  Had eggs, bacon,  pancakes."}
{"text":"Place is very clean. Food great and cooked perfectly service as well. The hostess was so sweet. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great Food and really Great Service Our server Gabby so nice"}
{"text":"We were just passing through. Great value. Home style breakfast that is cheap. Very friendly service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and really helpful, friendly staff. You can't go wrong for the price, but the fact that it's so good makes it a must stop if you're around. Really good portion sizes as well that just make it even more worth it.  Had the biscuits and gravy, was killer...just right and decent coffee too!"}
{"text":"love this place! been going here since opened in 2006. all home made food fresh hot and delicious. never a complaint and food is out to you quick! highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered grouper..was panfried with some type of breading! It was under cooked!! I usually only eat grouper when I'm in Florida! It was awful!  Took it back and the guy was no it's cooked right! Well it wasn't! He didn't want to redo order. He gave the money back!  The first time I went there when they first opened..I had under cooked chicken..I just paid and left the whole order!!  So this is my last time!!"}
