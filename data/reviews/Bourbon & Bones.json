{"text":"Went and sat at two open seats at the bar. One of the managers came over after we ordered a drink and said \"can't you obviously see these seats are taken\". Very rude. We moved to a different seat at the bar. The bartenders apologized profusely and bought us a round of drinks. No one ended up sitting at these \"reserved seats at the bar\" so the bartenders moved us back. The bar staff was phenomenal. Manager was a complete tool. Let me know when you let him go and we'll be back for drinks."}
{"text":"First time won't be the last. Exceptional food, drinks and ambiance surpassed by the service. A new fav!"}
{"text":"Dined here during restaurant week, fall 2017.  Good service from our server; very personable and provided us with good drink recommendations and info about their menu.  Started with oysters. Fresh, good.  Caesar salad - fast food-like quality. Main course - Petite Filet, ordered medium rare, and came out medium to medium well. Sides were alright. Main course - Steak Frites, ordered medium rare, and came out medium to medium well. Frites weren't really seasoned, not anything special. Sides were alright. Dessert - Bourbon cake (came highly recommended): this was ok. Dessert - Cheesecake: was a tower of whipped cream. Actual cheesecake was a little bit on the light side; almost bland.  Hot towels were offered after oysters, so that was nice. Knife selection for the steak -- I suppose this is a 'neat' idea, but I asked the employee what he would recommend, and he was not really sure. So yes, this is an idea, but it would only get the brownie points under the assumption that their dining guests have an appreciation of, or at least know a tad bit, about knives and steak.  Three positive takeaways: server service was good, chimichurri was solid, and the restaurant layout was nice.  Food, not so much."}
{"text":"I travel quite a bit and I also love steak quite a bit so I've eaten my fair share in many different cities. The steak was cooked to perfection, the bourbon pound cake was to die for and most importantly, the service was superb. Could be my favorite Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drink.  Have had the ribeye and pork chop and both were excellent.  For drinks, have had their classic martini, sub zero whiskey and coke, and the best ever expresso martini.  Ambiance and service were also top notch.  Will be one of my frequent dining out stops."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place. Disappointed with the food. Both of our steaks were overcooked. My 6 oz filet looked about 4 oz and was flat instead if high and juicy. I just think if you are going to be a steak restaurant they should be perfect every time. French Onion soup was delicious, french fries came out luke warm. I feel like others food wasn't perfect for the price."}
{"text":"Favorite new restaurant!  My friends and I went here during their grand opening.  The food was amazing and our server, Tony, made the evening absolutely delightful.  He was so knowledgeable about the menu, the specials and the wine.  Such a great restaurant and staff.   This is a must stop restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday for a work event with a $1000 dollar spending limit for 4 people.   WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  The Hostess staff were surprisingly rude at such a high end restaurant. I started too tell them I was meeting co workers who I thought were there and received dirty looks and attitude. Upon realizing I was the first in my group to arrive, I went back and told them we would like to get a round of drinks from the bar until everyone was there and our table was ready. One girl responds \"There are no seats at the bar\"  So I ask \"where would you recommend I get a drink?\"  Response from hostess \"IDK squeeze in somewhere I guess\"  Two of my co workers arrived and come up to me saying \"is it me or do they seem kind of rude here?\"  I said \"yes very\"  Then they suggested we go somewhere else that would take our business. I called up Mastro's City Hall who obviously was more then accommodating to take us last minute and hold a cocktail table for us to have a drink at.   I've been to Mastro's over a dozen times and can say that I should have scheduled the event there from the start.   Being that Bourbon and Bones is a newer steakhouse in the area, I wanted to give them a shot. BIG MISTAKE!!!  I spoke with the manager Frank before leaving and told him my story... all he had to say was \"Sorry, I hope you will give us another try\"  I doubt that will ever happen, additionally I have shared this story with friends, colleagues, and family who all enjoy fine dining. I will continue to do so.   Don't waste your time or money. Go to Mastro's where they know what they are doing!  \"Disappointed\" is an understatement."}
{"text":"The food was less than marginal.  The prices were bizarrely high... More expensive than Mastro's down the street, which is 3-4 times the quality.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great steak place, in old town Scottsdale! What awesome drinks! Cool vibe, and selecting your own steak knife is a great touch! Not pricey like the other steak places around the valley! Get a great meal and drinks and have a fun time!"}
{"text":"Been to B&B 3 times since it opened.  Really like the bar are with the open windows (great for people watching)...  My steak was overcooked the last time I was in, but it was still really good.   B&B needs to expand the \"Bacon Service\" beyond just the bar (if you've been there you know what I am talking about)...Although we requested it last time...It's good! Will go back again."}
{"text":"Solid...all of it. Steak tartare, tuna tartare, filet...and getting bacon instead is a bread basket??? Priceless..."}
{"text":"Great food-drinks and most comfortable chairs in town....  Upscale place but the front door walks right into restaurant where all the dinning is. (reminds me of fast food place because of that) They need to add a wall in front of the door area to separate it.  When eating you consistently find yourself looking at all the new people arriving.  For the money it should be a bit more private."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time for dinner this past Saturday evening.  We didn't have reservations and it was packed when we arrived but the manager kindly found a couple who were cashing out at the bar so we could snag those seats (full menu is available at the bar).  We were doing wine that night - I had a wine on tap that was a very reasonable $9/glass.  I had the scallops for dinner which were served with fresh shaved asparagus.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and so decadent.  My friend had the petit filet and brussels sprouts (which were giant).  We had the pecan cake with cinnamon ice cream for dessert...which was incredible. The service couldn't have been better - bartenders and managers both checked in on us to ensure our evening was going well and seemed to genuinely care what the answer was.  They really have it dialed in here.  Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Hi! It would really be nice if you quoted real wait times.  If you tell us an hour and 15 minutes, yes, we might leave... but we'd come back again. On the other hand, if you quote 45-60, and then tell us it'll be 15-30... we leave and we don't come back.  I know you guys are busy and you can afford to lose a customer, just sayin'"}
{"text":"This place is great!! I have dined here numerous times and each time the food has been spot on! Service is great, and drinks are delicious!! They have a huge selection of both wine and bourbons along with a tasty cocktail list, so pick your poison wisely. :)  Great for special occasions, group dinners, and date nights if you're thinking of \"wining and dining\" with your special someone!  Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Went here to try the amazing selection of bourbon, ended up staying all evening. Incredible meat and sides. And of course a huge selection of bourbon. I got the bison, it was spectacular."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona for a work trip and found Bourbon and Bones. This place was amaaaazing! Great 5 star service and one of the best steaks I have ever ate. I got the ten OZ filet with the roasted broccoli. Definitely will be returning when i visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. Only complaint would be how loud it was. Bone in ribeye to die for and the sides were just as good."}
{"text":"Best bar in Arizona by far. Richie Moe, Justin and Rafael are so great. They make the best cocktails, especially whiskey cocktails. The head chef is also amazing. He cooked me the best Pittsburgh veal chop ever, and the chimicurri sauce I ordered on the side was amazing.  I can't say enough about this place. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance & decor 5 stars for filets  4 stars for service (waitress awesome - bartender kept messing up drinks) 3 stars for steak tartare & octopus apps  1 star for the $18 martinis   I really liked this place but I think I am too annoyed by their $18 martinis.  Just don't understand why Scottsdale always tries (and thinks it is) to be LA."}
{"text":"What a waste of money. My daughter and I came to Bourbon and Bones for a weekday dinner. We started off with the House Salad, which consists of field greens, candied pecans, dried cranberries, balsamic vinaigrette and goat cheese. It was just average...too many field greens and not enough topping and dressing. We had higher hopes for the entree, but were sorely disappointed. We split the 10 oz filet and desired to have it cooked to medium well. We were presented with a rare steak that was almost impossible to eat. In fact, I had to descreetly take out of my mouth four pieces that were not chewable. Someone should tell the chef that the silverskin (the sllimy, shiny thin skin on a piece of beef) should be removed. With the bernaise sause, it was still tasteless. We also ordered two sides. The creamed spinach was not chopped (in fact the spinach stem was still attached) and did not have a true cream sauce to it. It was a thin, watery sauce without taste. The corn off the cob was frozen corn with some stuff stirred into it. I could not identify what the stuff was. On top of the meal being horrible, this place is overpriced. As far as the food overall, it was like someone opened a place and not knew what they were doing. It was not run like a fine steakhouse. Tourist....if you want steak, there are many fine places in the Valley...City Hall, Mastros, Flemings, Donovens, Ruth Chris. While its location is great, the food is not."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places where I have had oysters! The service was great, and enjoyed my meal as well"}
{"text":"This place really has it all. Especially if you love Bourbon! They have 250 bourbons, whiskeys and scotches to choose from, and there are plenty of choices on the menu to satisfy any pallet.  My husband had steak and I had the salmon, each cooked to perfection. If you are gluten free, they go out of their way to make any modification to your meal. The atmosphere is warm and contemporary. I'd recommend sitting at the high top tables on the bar side of the restaurant. They overlook Scottsdale road and if you like to people watch... it's the perfect spot. Go early if you don't have a reservation, the place fills up fast."}
{"text":"Last night I had the honor to taste chef J s Food  I had the 6 ounce filet with top with the full Guam is one of the best fights I've ever had I had the brussels sprouts and the service was expecting my ice tea glass is always full plates were cleaned cleared it timely manner for dessert we had the P con butter cake I give this place five stars"}
{"text":"We heard great things about this place but my husband and I were not impressed. My husband is a big bourban lover and the bourban was triple the price of other restaurants. Then there is the food, it's not bad but nothing was worth the price on the menu. The waitress was not very nice and the service was not very good. Overall a bad experience."}
{"text":"Free bacon pub grub is waaaaay better than bread and would be even better if it was freshly cooked. A bit on the expensive side even for Scottsdale and I'm not sure I saw what made it so unique? Cocktails were delish."}
{"text":"I wanted to celebrate my birthday at someplace new and just happened to see an ad for B&B in this month's issue of Phoenix magazine.  Scottsdale is a bit far for us to go for dinner but we saw they start serving dinner at 3:00 PM so we thought that would cut down the drive time...so off we went and are we ever glad we did.  Our dinner and dining experience was absolutely fantastic - thanks in large part to Chef J's presence at table side and his suggestions of scallops for my wife and veal chop for me.  We added hash browns and brussel sprouts, which were perfect compliments to our entrees.  My wife started with the tomato onion salad and I had the best iceberg wedge salad I've ever had with absolutely delicious blue cheese crumbles.  And for dessert, my wife had the butter cake and I had the apple crumble...both memorable and wonderful caps to one of the best meals we've ever had, anywhere.  It's quite unique to have an executive chef interact so personally with guests but a really nice touch, to be sure.  Despite the distance and drive time, we expect to be regulars at Bourbon & Bones...our new favorite restaurant!  Thank you, Chef J, for your great recommendations, super table-side manner, fabulous food and warm & friendly hospitality.  Bourbon & Bones is the kind of upscale restaurant where we want to spend our time and money."}
{"text":"We spotted this place and right away thought \"let's check it on out\".  Let's be honest, it was the bar ambiance that got us.  We seated ourselves at the end of the bar on the comfy leather bar chairs and ordered the house Manhattan.  Probably the best Manhattan I have had so far!  Dry and smooth!  We didn't order big for the entrees and opted for a melange of appetizers instead.  - wedge salad - crisp and fresh lettuce that paired well with the dressing and crispy bacon - meatballs - tender, juicy and the mushrooms were tasty - wagyu beef slices - sizzle your own thinly sliced wagyu with a drizzle of sea salt.  The meat just melts in your mouth - pork belly with quail egg - absolutely Devine!  Tender pieces of pork belly piled high with maple drizzle and a fried quail egg on top.  Did I mention that there was bar bacon???  Our bartender was super personable and made our eating and drinking experience superb!"}
{"text":"First time at Bourbon & Bones . . . After a long work week, I was ready for a great dinner and a full glass of red wine. Mission accomplished. Zac was our server and came over to our table with a big smile, a great attitude and the wine list . . . Just what the doctor ordered. The restaurant was busy, and I like a nice crowd. We both ordered a ribeye and shared brussel sprouts glazed with bourbon and cauliflower. For dessert, we ordered an expresso martini to wake us up in preparation for some dancing after a big meal. We are expresso martini snobs, this one is a little more creamy than I like, but still good and did the job . . . Go caffeine! I'm awake now and ready to party tonight.   I would recommend B&B for any occasion. Thank you for a great night Zac, we never wanted for anything and your energy was contagious. Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Waygu beef on a hot rock during happy hour was delicious! I paired it with Brussels sprouts! They also offered complimentary bacon and bread. My husband had a delicious looking bacon burger also from the happy hour menu. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"With an advanced reservation for busy February, we were seated exactly at our scheduled time in a half booth, half chair table for 4.  After we ordered drinks, we were kindly asked by the manager if we didn't mind switching to half-circle booth overlooking our old table in exchange for their covering our first round of drinks...well, sure I suppose!  The new booth had basically a bright spotlight on my seat (weird...maybe they need to change out the bulb or redirect it since it was uncomfortable to be seated there...but hey, a free drink?).  Anyways, no one ever ended up sitting at the table we got bumped from..weird.  Regarding service, we never had to wait for drinks or water refills.  The bread basket was lovely (we liked it all EXCEPT the pretzel breads) and refilled upon request.  Entrees  I had the crab cakes as entree - decent but not spectacular. I finished but my bf only took a single bite and kept to his steak My bf had the filet since that's what I will take a few bites of, and we both enjoyed it - not a bite was left The other diner had the bison steak (recommended by the server as \"I mean, where else can you get a bison steak?\") and it was finished and reportedly good  We also got a dessert (gratis I believe) but it was so unremarkable I don't even remember.  Service was fine.  The only weird thing besides the musical tables we experienced was their \"choose a knife\" gimmick.  I asked incredulously, so...what knife should I get for crab cakes and the response was \"um I don't know\".  LOL, ok well neither do I, buddy!"}
{"text":"I knew nothing about this place before going in.  We just happened to be nearby when we decided it was time for a drink.  The drinks were very expensive.  The place is quite dark.  The best part was the surprise bacon.    I never even read the menu, but based on the name and the very masculine atmosphere, I'd expect lots of expensive meat."}
{"text":"Came here opening week and from the second we pulled up we were impressed!! Glass windows all around with a cutting modern feel yet cozy at the same time. We were greeted graciously at the door by several host eager to make you feel welcome. We were sat at a booth by a window which is nice because we love to people watch (Old town is definitely the place for that). We were poured water and greeted by our smiling, enthusiastic server Christopher. Although being a new restaurant he was very knowledgeable and walked us through the menu offering exceptional options and suggestions. I started off with the Fizzing Flowers and my boyfriend got the Manhattan up. Both rolled into appetizers where I got the steak tartare and he got the beef carpaccio. Both were delicious but I absolutely loved the tartare (can't stop thinking about it actually). They have this great knife presentation as well, a wooden box with a selection of different knives to chose, it was a great touch. I got the lamb for an entree and he got the bone in ribeye, paired with a ZD Cabernet. Both were great but I think I will get the ribeye next time, it was just about the best steak I've ever had!!! We ended the night with the Mason jar banana split and butter cake, just wow. It's hard to believe this place just opened and how on point everything was from the food and the service by Christopher. Pretty sure I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to have dinner on a Friday night while she was in town. I had been eyeing the restaurant since it opened and was ready to give it a try and it was the perfect distance from the hotel.   We arrived about an hour before our reservation and were seated promptly at an open table. Our server Zac greeted us quickly and remained attentive throughout the night!   We ordered a ribeye and New York strip..they were seasoned and cooked just right but way to big for one serving. Along with the steaks we had the brussels sprouts and cauliflower and they were delish! Finished the night with an espresso martini that was a tad bit heavy on the cream.  I knocked 1 star off because we seemed to be sat in an extremely high traffic area with waiters and it was warm inside before they opened the door for a breeze. But I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Now my 4th visit and they very better every time! Started with oysters and smoked salmon - outstanding.  Next the bone in filet- one of the best, most tastey and tender I've ever had (sorry Dominic's and Mastro's).  And off course, bourbon.   The choices are extreme.  Next, the $35,000 Epic Crystal dinner.   As a local, we will be back even more after our welcomed tourists leave for the north.  Great job by the staff (Jared and Andrew), our server (Katya) and the team in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I am a steak snob being from Iowa and have been thoroughly disappointed in steakhouses in Arizona, including the high end ones, until I found this place! And go figure, the steak is from Iowa! This is a must if you like steak. Has a great happy hour too. The food is phenomenal and prepared to perfection. Great for dates, with friends, special occasions, and big groups! Can't go wrong with Bourbon & Bones!"}
{"text":"It's new, they're still finding their footings. With that, the ambiance is Scottsdale casual.  This place has a huge semi covered outside seating with a bar ~ reminiscent of Sol restaurant style.   I had their house Manhattan martini- it's a bourbon martini, I think.  All I know is that after just that one drink ~ I was a goner. Of course, my alcohol tolerance level is low. Still, it was a good, very stiff drink. We also enjoyed shrimp cocktail and oysters (what kind escaped me after that martini) which was fresh and firm.  Next, their filet mignon was cooked to perfection (rare) and delicious.  Now, their bourbon butter cake deserves an award! Absolutely delish and had to hold myself back from licking the plate.   One odd thing I did notice is that they have ninja servers and bus peeps and I swear if I blink, they clear something off of the table so quickly, I thought I was just seeing, err, unseeing things.  It was weird. Maybe they want you to leave as soon as you're done??  Lastly, it's just my personal opinion, but, the type of foods and drinks, whiskey and bourbons, emphasized for this place, just doesn't seem to belong together. The feel of place is more of new American cuisine with vodka mix drinks.    Personally, for rich steaks, bourbons, scotch drinks and looking at a very similar price points; I'll go to places like Dominic's, steak 44 or City Hall for the befitting ambiance.  I'd come here for HH with friends for some unique cocktails and some fun. Not recommend for romantic dinners though."}
{"text":"A few girlfriends and I are foodies we always like to try new places , so we decided to give this place a try since its new. We made reservations and when we got there they asked us if we would mind sitting at a high top in the bar, because it would be a wait for a table.... I was confused since we had reservations. Our waitress was great, she was very knowledgeable. The bus boys knocked things over a few times and didn't know how to serve side dishes (got food everywhere ). The steak was good, the other food was ok. It's definitely not worth the price. I would much rather go to Mastros down the road for an amazing meal and the same price point."}
{"text":"Dinner with 3 friends tonight. Steak was good but overpriced. Baked potato cold. Way to loud. People were having to talk very loud to hear each other. My friends steak was overcooked n my other friends undercooked. Mine was spot on.   They have City Hall prices but their Quality Control is no match at this point. Service was slow.  Will wait a month and try again to see if they have stepped their game up"}
{"text":"The customer service was outstanding, the food was good. However, two of us had the lamb chops. They were full of fat, so we didn't have much meat. If I ever go back, I'll be getting something different!   We were definitely blown away with the night overall.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the entire menu."}
{"text":"If the name doesn't give it away, let me tell you, if you like bourbon and steaks you should definitely try this place out. The service was great."}
{"text":"Very good dinner.  Oysters were sweet and mild.  The onion soup was only average, a little too sweet for our tastes.  The bacon and eggs were a huge portion of pork short rib.  The wagyu beef rib eye was outstanding!  Season perfectly, flavorful and prepared perfectly.  Ending any meal with Nickel and Nickel  Dolce late harvest and a pecan bourbon butter cake makes for a great finish."}
{"text":"Had a dinner here again and highly recommend. This time brought spouses. Waiter (Jeff) and assistants do an excellent job of looking after your needs. Beef Carpaccio was excellent and the Bone in tenderloin was cooked to perfection with great flair we. All enjoyed and the 2013 Faust Cabernet was perfect from a good wine list and whiskey selection (love the frozen round ice cube)."}
{"text":"Went there 2 times so far. All I have to say is the service was the best. But the food needs some work for the price you pay."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for restaurant week and experience absolutely phenomenal service. Aly, our server, was funny and warm and incredibly knowledgeable of the menu.   The steaks were perfectly prepared and the wine was good. The only reason 4/5 stars is because I ordered the bearnaise sauce and it has, cinnamon..? Why? No. Plz stop.   Good steak restaurant, not nearly as pretentious as Steak 44, we will be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a reservation here for dinner a few days in advance. We were excited to try it out since it had just opened not to long ago and they had a good selection of bone-in steaks. When we arrived 10 minutes before our 8 pm reservation, we checked in and were informed that they needed a few moments. We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and finally got a seat on the patio. We were thankful for that because the fish smell was overwhelming on the dining room side of the building. We were greeted by a friendly server very quickly and ordered margarita and a martini; both priced a little high. They were good after they arrived, it took about 20 minutes. After our drinks had got there, a gentleman walked up to our table and asked my boyfriend to turn his hat around. Really?! I didn't realize we were paying 20 bucks a round for our drinks and over 300 dollars to eat a steak in a nightclub?!? I was a little peeved. We shrugged it off and ordered our meals. They also took a while; I was hoping it meant that the food was going to be really good. Well, my boxcar strip steak was ordered medium, it came out rare/not even warm in the center and tough and hard as a rock on the outside. I ended asking for them to throw it back on and ate my $12 baked potato while we waited. It was very loud, everything takes forever and is extremely overpriced. We do not mind going to dinner and spending a bit of money, but I feel like we wasted it here. It was disappointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"GREAT experience!!!! Visiting from NY so not familiar with the area, but this place had an interesting look and name. Upon arrival we were greeted graciously and seated right away. Tina our server was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable of the menu, also added bonus of being a Sommelier. She went above and beyond to serve us and as well as the rest of the staff did not dissapoint. We will definately be back when visiting AZ."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Food is very good as is the service.  The menu is somewhat limited in size but has a wide variety to choose from. As you would expect from the name their meat selections are fantastic. The only reason I gave them four instead of five stars is the ambiance of the dinning room. It is located on Scottsdale Blvd in Old Town Scottsdale and while the dining room is nicely appointed, you are sitting in a room with large windows all around looking at the traffic pass by.  Not a big deal but it does distract from what would be a 5-star evening.  And, if you happen to like Manhattans, they make the best Manhattan I have ever had by far.  I highly recommend this place. We will certainly by back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing! My boyfriend and I went to celebrate an anniversary recently and we loved it. Very high-end atmosphere with attention to detail. (the restaurant lets you pick your own steak knife!) The petite filet mignon was perfectly cooked and just enough food to not feel stuffed. And I would absolutely recommend ordering the Hot Rock Wagyu Beef. It was such a fun experience to cook the food together."}
{"text":"Great service & food. Steaks were made to order. You will not be disappointed. Everything was perfect. Definitely not an inexpensive place"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and food!Nice crowd, great location. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My dining experience here was incredible.  We had 8:30 PM reservations on a Friday night. We grabbed a drink at the bar and were seated at 8:40 PM which was fine because I did ask for time to grab a glass of wine! Our server was attentive and not over bearing.    Jumbo shrimp cocktail was good, however, it does contain a lot of horseradish. So if you don't like that then stay away from this particular appetizer!   We split the bone-in rib-eye for $49 and it was amazing! Please note- the only reason why we split the steak was because I don't eat much.  This steak was flavorful and we still didn't finish it between the two of us!   We got sweet corn and mushrooms on the side, didn't finish all of them either, but I was very pleased with both dishes. Would order them both again.   We split everything and we did not leave hungry. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely OUTSTANDING Experience. The food was beyond incredible. The wait staff made our anniversary dinner one to remember."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  The bartenders are very entertaining, and the manager was incredible. The chairs are incredibly comfortable, and the food is spot on.  If you like manhattan's, THIS IS THE PLACE!  Don't miss the \"Hot Rock\" Wagyu Beef! I'm salivating just typing about it.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"SO WORTH IT!!! Been here a few times now, always sat at the bar.  The steak is phenomenal! I also had the hot rock one visit.  Steak served rare and cooked on a hot rock. our rock wasn't very hot at all but i still ate the steak and loved it.  The drinks are wonderful and my favorite is the Bittered Boulevard. The must have is the duck fat fries tho and the homemade ketchup. The brussel sprouts were a little soggy and overly buttery but my guest enjoyed them, not me tho.  Overall, i enjoy the bar atmosphere and the bartenders were super attentive and fun. Being able to choose your own knife is fun too! cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this place and our food was cold when it was brought to our table.  We asked the waitress to send it back to be warmed and then waited for about 30 min, maybe more.  Waitress didn't seem to care so my husband finally went and asked someone to see if the manager was available.  When he came we were just shocked at how cocky he was. I believe his name was Randy. Anyhow he was an arrogant jerk and we ended up just leaving and going to Tommy V's and had the best meal and a great time."}
{"text":"Hands down best dining experience we've ever had-and I married a chef! Food was amazing, service was beyond exceptional and the wine/cocktails perfectly complimented every course. Thank you, Bourbon & Bones for this new mom & dad's perfect date night!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - great food - and great whiskey!  What more can you ask for.  The staff was attentive, but not intrusive - the menu - while heavily grounded in 'beef' - is creative and well executed.  I had the Wagyu hot rock as an appetizer, and the pan seared scallops for the entree - both excellent - This was my first time here, but it's definitely a repeat anytime I'm in the greater Phoenix area.  Even if you can only stop by for a cocktail - it's worth it  - and be sure to taste the complimentary bar bites!"}
{"text":"Food was very good but the whole place was just phenomenally overpriced. If you want a steak - which doesn't include anything other than the meat - once you're done with sides you should expect to pay $60-$100 per person without any drinks or appetizers. I've eaten far better steaks for considerably more reasonable prices..."}
{"text":"Steak was cooked perfectly. Gave compliments to the chef and he personally came to our table to talk to us. Great drink menu. Staff is great, super friendly!"}
{"text":"Top notch, only been open 8 weeks. Past reviews have to keep in mind they were  getting the kinks out...had wine, tuna tartar,  carpachia...was excellent...wait staff at bar awesome...totally worth the visit...and after dinner they bought out a complimentary dessert...visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"If you drink enough of the cocktails, you might enjoy the food more than I did. Had the Bison New York strip which was under-seasoned and overcooked. Had a party of 6 for a business dinner and was there early, but the food was very disappointing.   Order a Sazerac, it's not the best in the valley, but it comes with a fun show. The bourbon selection is great, and the wait staff was very attentive. Wish the food was better, perhaps the business threw off my enjoyment."}
{"text":"Food and wine were excellent. a nice alternative to Mastro's when you want fine dining with a slightly more casual and hipster feel to it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks before going out. We sat at the bar and kicked it with the bartenders who were awesome and really laid back. If you're a whiskey person the only thing you need to know is the Manhattan. It is SO SMOOTH and has this knockout smokey flavor from the bitters. I had two and felt like a million bucks."}
{"text":"Heard much about this restaurant and decided to give it a go. Started with the bacon and egg app and that was the highlight of the night. My medium rare fillet came out cold in the center and I had to send it back for a little more heat. It came back much too overdone but I didn't want to be a pain so I kept it. Aside from the temperature dilemma the steak was slightly over seasoned. The side dishes were ok, ordered the duck fat fries, creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Going to many higher end Steakhouse's the managers usually come out to discuss when there are dishes sent back. At this establishment I don't know if there was a manager working as we didn't see anyone. Overall this location bills itself as a high end steakhouse and definitely charges like one but this visit barely beats out chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Solid place.  Steaks were great and cooked perfectly -- rib eye was medium rare and filet rare. Oysters and shrimp cocktail were fantastic , love how they give you extra horseradish of the Extra spicy variety.  And of course the bourbon selection was huge. Old fashion made correctly with a ball ice. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"This is a must dine establishment. They get it ! The food is spectacular, service is impeccable, and management is solid. We had a situation of late for our reservation and the manager was excellent and worked to accommodate us. Fantastic place, just can say enough ! Sit at a high top table on the street have a Whiskey and definitely try the Octopus ! It's unbelievably good !!!"}
{"text":"Great meal.  Steaks were awesome and all the side dishes were incredible.  You must have the Brussel Sprouts.  TOO DIE FOR.  Desert was great."}
{"text":"Had a little date night here last night. Our waiter Tony was as professional as could be.  You could tell he has had years of experience with high end dining.  I had the 10oz filet and it was done to perfection.  My fiancé and I were so happy with our meal and service. Definitely in the top meals I have ever had, and that's saying something!   Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth experiencing...go elsewhere.  Compared to Steak 44, Mastro's, Oceanclub, etc., B&B just does not deliver; not even close.  Very disappointing and we will not be returning.  Do yourself a favor and go to a different steakhouse; there are many great options.  Service was okay.  Not great & definitely not spectacular.  Definitely not on par with their prices.  Mastro's, Oceanclub, and Steak 44 blow this place out of the water.  Waiter kept the wine glasses on the table until we piled them up in the corner (this was after taking the drink order and no one ordering wine).  Waiter packaged all our food together, which I felt was incredibly sloppy (multiple couples who were obviously not going to be going back to the same location).  No one asked if our steaks were cooked to the appropriate temperature.  Food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I didn't think my filet was well seasoned; actually none of the steaks at the table were that fabulous (including their $95 ribeye).  if you're looking for setting, I thought the setting was good.  A little noisy but that's to be expected in Olde Towne.  Rather attractive setting imo.  This is the only thing that this restaurant has going for it."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service. Our server, Maddie was very attentive, friendly and knowledge about the menu. We had the ribeye, filet and lobster mac n cheese. All were delicious. For dessert, try the banana bread pudding and apple crumble.  Both exceptional, but the Apple was to die for. The manager came by to check on us several times. All in all a great experience. You can't go wrong at Bourbon & Bones!"}
{"text":"We went to B&B for a bachelorette party evening and I was thoroughly unimpressed. The layout of the restaurant wasn't fluid for our conversation, the food was extremely mediocre, a few of the girls food didn't come out as ordered and the wine wasn't great.   Our service was fabulous, which was a win but overall I feel like the concept just misses it."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic dining experience! We made a reservation on Open Table, and we were seated immediately. Everyone was courteous, professional, and even checked on us during the meal. Everything we ate was top-notch! Starting with warm pretzel rolls and an extremely fresh seafood tower. The rib eye was one of the best I've ever had--highly recommend. Don't forget to look at the craft cocktails and wine list. Did I mention over 75 types of whiskey! Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Way better than Mastros or Ruth's Chris. I get the one in filet rare and it's heaven! The oysters are the biggest I've ever seen and are so fresh. Also, you have to try the raw steak box as an appetizer. Best steakhouse in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"After going back and giving this restaurant another shot, everything about our meal was on point.  The entire staff and food were phenomenal.  Location is ideal as it is centrally located in old town, but has valet parking.  Will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Always a great time here at B&B! Nick and Ritchie are amazing"}
{"text":"Wow! Came to Scottsdale and this was my first meal. The bone-in rib eye was amazing! No need to even add a sauce. Perfection! Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"We had happy hour last night,  what a great experience.  Loved Rich the Bar manager and his crew. We had the cheese board and wagyu beef on the Himalayan hot salt block, amazing!  Had a really wonderful happy hour chardonnay. We would highly recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"Tried Bourbon & Bones this evening because my mother wanted steak. Menu is typical of a steakhouse as were the prices, we had bone in filet and sautéed scallops. Both were tasty. Steak was booked perfectly. Good marbling. Mashed potatoes were very potato forward and not over seasoned. Scallops were a little salty. Sauce of kale and mushrooms was delicious but somewhat thick, so it took me a minute to notice it. Cauliflower and golden raisins were done before so not excited about these. Overall food was tasty. Service was excellent. Did not have drinks because I was driving. I would come here again."}
{"text":"3 of us had dinner 4/21/17 and it was great. Cocktails were good, steaks were good and service was good. Only thing I would change would be the music selection. Little lower volume and easy listening  music.   We ate here about a week ago and it was very good too."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and definitely captures the trendy feel of Scottsdale. I was more than impressed with their bar selection after finding an extremely rare bourbon on their list that I of course had to try. I ordered a steak and my girlfriend had the salmon. My steak was absolutely perfect but her salmon was very dry but she ate the majority of it. When we told our server she apologized for the salmon, took it off our check, and offered us a free dessert! I thought the food was good but the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was amazing, service was superb! Our server Zach was very knowledgeable and personable. About time that old town Scottsdale has a restaurant comparable to Mastros. Loved the bar area too!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the second time in 2 weeks! Absolutely phenomenal restaurant. Really impressed with the beet tartare starter, was almost a dessert. Steaks are fantastic quality, and ours were prepared perfectly. Great atmosphere, fun vibe. Old Town needed something new and interesting. The drinks are as creative and top notch as it gets! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect date night spot! My fiancé and I love steak, call us connoisseurs, and I was dying to try this new spot in Old Town. We both started with salads and shared their dry-aged cowboy rib eye with brussels sprouts and creamed spinach. I had the tomato and mozzarella salad and my fiancé had the wedge, both were delicious. The dry aged steak was incredible and done just right. I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed spinach but the brussels were amazing! Our waiter Jeffrey was very attentive and provided great service, I had a glass of cabernet on his recommendation and it was very good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I first came here after looking for a place to get a good steak in Scottsdale for a friends birthday. I have since come in a few times when I'm in town for various reasons. I have yet to be disappointed by the service or food. We usually order a few appetizers to share, steaks and a few drinks, switching things up each time to try something new. The appetizers are always creative and tasty. The steaks are always cooked on point. I'm pretty easy going when it comes to drinks but I do like to try different things and haven't been let down there either.  The service is always great, whether we are at the bar or a table. You gotta love being able to select your knife to use during dinner.  Yes, it is a bit pricey. No, its not your normal snooty, over priced restaurant. People talk, and enjoy themselves here. I guess if you're trying to have a good time, this is your place. If you want to eat in silence, while staring at your plate... Try some ear plugs... because its still worth it."}
{"text":"AMazing meal here love my food as I have been wanting to try this new restaurant in old town. Will be back again"}
{"text":"Awful. Had guests from Ca in town and took them here. I was embarrassed.  When one of my friends steak wasn't cooked mid rare as requested and the server was informed, the manager on duty came over and rudely shined a flashlight on the food to \"verify\" and question him. How completely unprofessional which in turn made my friend just tell the guy in the suit never-mind just to avoid a further production.   Needless to say, we won't be going back here again!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place late last night  They kept the kitchen open for us   The wine list and bourbon list was excellent  The staff and management where completely knowledgeable ! They couldn't do enough for us !  Everything we had was great  The dates  The stone beef  The salads   This place is a hidden gem!   Will return !"}
{"text":"I came in with some girls.  We sat at the bar and had drinks and food.  Richie was our bartender/server.  He's amazing.  The food was great and drinks.  He makes these signature cocktails with whipping on top.  So good.  We got shrimp tuna tar lobster steak.  I love the bar and patio.  I will def be coming here on a reg basis.  My new go to spot."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for dinner earlier this week with some friends to celebrate the holidays and Bourbon & Bones did not disappoint!  The atmosphere is lively, the decor is sleek and modern, the service is fantastic (young, but extremely professional) and the food was top notch!    I enjoyed a petite filet mignon medium rare plus and it was cooked to perfection.  Our group of 4 enjoyed the corn, mashed potatoes, asparagus, creamed spinach, and brussels sprouts sides - all of them were so flavorful and delicious.  For dessert, we shared the warm apple crumble and the bourbon pecan butter cake...amazing as well.    Bourbon & Bones is a great addition to the Old Town Scottsdale dining scene!"}
{"text":"We loved this place the steaks were amazing so yummy!! The drinks were perfect and the atmosphere we so much fun lots of people watching. Bone in tomahawk steaks! Awesome!! We went with friends from out of town and thought it was great! We will back again!"}
{"text":"We went at 6:30 and were excited to try this new spot. There were 3 open tables in the bar and 4 in the restaurant. But it was a 45-60 minute wait. We were going to wait at the bar but the 4 open spots weren't together. Sad disappointment:("}
{"text":"Fourth visit.  Had a great time .   Vastly improved. Food good   Jenna,  very nice dry humor enhanced our experience.    Very friendly valet service"}
{"text":"Amazing food, I'm a pescatarian and had the sea bass.. totally worth the price! For desert I recommend the Apple Crumb, best desert I've ever had-no joke!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  great atmosphere and service.  would definately recommend!! Raphael was on point as my bartender/server."}
{"text":"My wife and I are both from Chicago and know great steak houses.  We were in awe of this restaurant.  Had the absolute best steaks we have ever had anywhere in the world.  You could cut it with a butter knife.  This place is an absolute must if you are in Scottsdale for a special occasion/vacation.  We will be back every year on our annual trips to AZ."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and boyfriend for dinner. It has a great atmosphere, excellent selection, and the food was very good. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while in town for spring training with a friend. This place was over priced and not worth the experience. The filet was decent. A bit overcooked but still had good flavor. But not worth the money they were charging. What most shocked me was the price on the alcohol. I was taken back by the prices of the cocktails. For the price I paid I would rather go down the street to City Hall. Better service and higher quality. Even our server laughed when I made mention of the pricing. He said he hears that a lot.        The food overall was good. But in Scottsdale, there are far better choices for food and drink for less money. The restaurant decor was nice and clean. But the pricing will ensure I do not go back."}
{"text":"Very modern and upscale place, the theme is suiting and it's certainly one of the nicer establishment around. Their Bacon & Eggs (pork belly, quail egg over a rosemary Johnny cake), Beet Tartare (diced beets over whipped goat cheese on fried walnut banana bread), Medjool Bleu Cheese Stuffed Dates and Devil's Cut Hot Rock Wagyu Beef are a must-have for starters! Probably my current favorite appetizers of any place at the moment. As for entrée, I've had both the 10oz Filet, medium rare of course, and the Double Cut Dry Aged Pork Chop on separate occasions, and my only complaint is that the filet was not as flavorful as I expected, given the dry aging, but I would order it again either Oscar Style (Crab Claws, Béarnaise, Asparagus) or with the Bleu Cheese Granola, and the Pork Chop was a bit fatty for my liking, but otherwise tasty. Everything paired great with a Boulevardier (my drink of choice) and the nifty thing about it, is they allow you to \"choose your weapon\"; they have a small case full of steak knives, and you select which one you will be using, neat little idea."}
{"text":"When you open busy anything can happen, There are several great reviews and The Chef and Ownership team is pretty solid. The old Alpha Graphics location was transformed beautifully. On paper this place looks great.  I had a different experience on my visit, first I was shocked at the prices, It is the most expensive restaurant in Old town. I was honestly expecting a more casual restaurant. Prices are high and I am sure the team here is aiming high as well, but my meal and service fell short, that happens, also sometimes with busy openings things don't go as well as expectations. I will chalk it up just being new and an off night by a new server and overwhelmed kitchen.  I live in the area and I am sure I will eventually get back, but at least it will be knowing that its a very expensive casual/upscale loud open steakhouse.  revised review JV"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely excellent.  I 100% would give five stars, except both times I have eaten here, I had the same experience: Amazing food, I mean, amazing.  However, the servers always seem unhappy to be working, you really have to engage them to get a smile.  Highly recommend this restaurant.  Everything I've tried on the menu has been some of the best food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"My 15 year old son and I came here on \"accident\" because Don and Charlie's wasn't open yet. (I was hungry at 4 and it was my birthday haha)  Our server treated my son like he was an \"important\" guest.  When he was given the option to select his own knife preference he was so happy.  He is a very picky eater (his Grandmother is a gourmet chef) and he ate everything on his plate.  The filet mignon  was soooooo good!  Our server even brought me a free birthday dessert.  It was such an awesome way to spend my birthday!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. This place looks sexy on the outside, But like that hot  girl on first glance, inside was a nightmare. Slow service in a 75% empty restaurant it took over 40 minutes to get out entrees. My NY steak was inedible which they were kind enough to remove from my bill because I took one bite and almost gagged. In addition the staff who had some personality could not not deliver. My friend had the ribs and another sea bass so no complaints there. I would avoid this place unless you are going just for drinks at the bar. They won't be in business long with a deadly combination of bad service, very bad food, and high prices."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  The hostess and servers were very pretentious.  They were very unprofessional which was a huge turn-off.  Funny because I am guessing that most (or none) of the employees could afford to eat here as a patron.  If you would like your guests to return you should treat them better or at least smile.  I will not be returning. There are plenty of places to get a good steak i.e. City Hall, Steak 44, J&G   I would much rather spend my money at a classy restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh...my...goodness! Where do I begin with this restaurant...the service that we received from Anna was amazing. I love to see someone who truly loves her job.  The food was so delicious and the atmosphere was casual yet classy. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"$32 for a Jack & Coke (least expensive whiskey I could find) and a beer is just too rich for my blood. The atmosphere isn't cool enough or the people that wonderful to command that kind of money. Not for me."}
{"text":"Once again , another great experience from the staff of this amazing restaurant. From food to service, they always deliver."}
{"text":"Their food is equivalent to the quality of Mastros but with a more welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We are here visiting from Dallas and love steak. My husband loves Old Fashion cocktails, so when we saw the name Bourbon and Bones, we just had to go there. The food was outstanding! My husband had a t-bone and I had the halibut special. We were accompanied by our 21-month-old son, who isn't usually too welcome in most steakhouses. He is always on his best behavior and was this evening as well. The Chef brought him strawberries and bananas and the staff was super friendly. They even played hide and seek with him, which kept him entertained and enjoying the experience as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a chance to eat here in December 2017.  The food was absolutely phenomenal and the location was beautiful.  It was like eating at a Las Vegas steakhouse but here in Phoenix.  All the sides were thoughtfully prepared and completely original and delicious!"}
{"text":"I love whiskey, I love steak and work with bones for a living so I thought this place was the place for me. I was wrong.   My 6oz steak was more like 3-4 and over cooked. It was as thin as my hand.  Gave us bottled water when it wasn't requested. They took it away and still charged for it Asparagus was served floating in oil The 15 dollar martini I ordered was mainly mixer. I asked for kernel or GG. It was obviously not and when I asked they were upset that I would question their mixology.   Very loud need to almost yell at your company sitting across from you. People are either dressed for a high end steakhouse or short shorts and flip flops.   $200 that would've been better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Strangest night ever!  I'm out with my girlfriend & Dad and the manager follows me into the bathroom trying to pick a fight.  I was honestly confused by the entire ordeal and when I began to question what the hell was going on, he says you're kicked out and tells an employee to escort me out.  Since I'm a gentleman, I said that I had a tab open and would like to close it out since it's unfair to the bartender not to get a tip. Manager says you're gone and I'll take care of it.  In closing, come here if you want a manager who comps food and wants to fight everyone.  Definitely a first and a strange night for me!  Just thought I'd offer my story so the owners realize what kind of psycho they have on their hands.  Thanks for the free food & drinks that I was offering to pay for! Don't eat here until the owners get rid of said psycho!"}
{"text":"Can't get in and eat with bday party because I'm wearing a tank top... no sleeve no service! Don't support this place because they judge you on what your wearing not what your spending!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Arizona. I wish I could give them a higher rating than 5. We gad our reservation to this place which is highly recommended before you go here. Once seated drinks orders were taken quickly. They have a large selection of wines, Bourbons, scotch's and beers. So you might need some time to choose your drinks. The manager offered us a free meatball appetizer just because our table wasn't cleaned well before we were seated. This was a very good indication that they care about service and their food. I ordered the New York bone in strip steak medium rare with mashed potatoes while my wife had the petite sirloin with fries. I cannot explain enough how well the steak tasted with the right amount of fat and a near perfect sear. All in all this place is worth all the praise it gets"}
{"text":"This is a very nice steak house.  I had the octopus and filet - both great.  The drink choices here are also very expansive."}
{"text":"So so thrilled with this experience. We went in for my boyfriend's birthday and were treated like royalty.  The menu from drinks to sides was unreal. He ordered the rib eye and I ordered the New York. Both phenomenal. Next time I want to try the filet!  Presentation was clean and the sides were plated for us by our servers-  nice touch! The mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts were delicious. Madeline was a lovely server. Very attentive and kind. She made my guy's birthday extra special with a treat at the end.  Excellent environment. Well decorated and organized. If you can, get a booth in the back. They are high up and look cozy. If you are looking for a quiet dinner, this is not the place. It's is a loud and buzzing environment that you have to embrace to enjoy."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming with prices that rival some of the best Steakhouses in the Valley, but this is not one of them. Food was not well thought out, flavor profiles were off, tasted cheap and to top it off service was inconsistent and lacked menu knowledge. The restaurant decor is on trend and picking your own steak knife was a nice touch but they need to come way down on price if they are trying to compete with a Mastros or Steak 44."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this chophouse. It's nestled right in old town. I ordered the bone in ribeye and my wife ordered the bone in filet. The bone in ribeye is one of two steaks that are prime cut. It was amazing. I order all my ribeyes medium rare and it was cooked perfectly! My wife and I ordered three sauces. I highly recommend the Chimichurri sauce. Our waitress Tina was amazing. She recommended the sauce and it added a whole new flavor to the steak. Amazing! Must try IMO.  My wife's bone in filet was tender and perfectly cooked as well. We also ordered the chocolate decadence desert. It was good. The passion fruit coulis threw me off at first but it ended up making the dish very flavorful. Overall I enjoyed it. Top 10 steak houses in Phx area IMO"}
{"text":"Not quite sure how this place has 4 stars.  Came here on the advice of a server at Talking Stick, I won't get her in trouble by naming her but she knows who she is.   I was starving, first meal of the day. So we jumped right in to a couple of appetizers: Cheese board and hot rock wagyu beef. They were on happy hour, but you wouldn't tell. Both were delicious! And there was so much food we had to wait 2 hours to order our actual dinner.   I had the bone-in ribeye. Cousin had the 10oz filet. Both were amazing. I ordered mine medium rare with a little extra char outside. It was the most perfectly cooked steak I've ever had.   The attention to detail with the food and cocktails is incredible. Raphael, Ryan, and the bar staff were super friendly and on top of it 100%. I have absolutely nothing to complain about at all other than I forgot to photo my steak! From LA but we'll be back!  It sucks that there's a lot of \"alleged\" 4 star places around here that kinda drown out this obvious 5 star establishment. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Have to be honest and say that the food here is nothing special and very over-salted. Had the filet that was crusted with salt and also a side of broccoli I couldn't finish due to all the salt. Drinks are very good and bartenders are nice but a bit pretentious. Good to see such a nice place with so many whiskeys on hand but do something to get away from what tastes like expensive chain food. Seems to be crowded most of the time although the dining area is not very large. For the price there are definitely more quality restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is an upscale modern steak house. The boubon list showcases depth in a variety of bourbons and whiskies.  Upscale service and presentation is what you can expect here. The food is traditional and served in the style of a Chicago or NY restaurant.  The open air seating facing the main drag in Old Town enhances the ambiance. The wine list is well conceived, however it would be nice to see more \"By the Glass\" offerings from differing producers.  My Onion soup was fantastic and the pretzel rolls in the bread basket kicked ass! I'll be back and I reccomend it for anyone heading to Old Town... #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak Oscar (large filet) expecting a traditional steak Oscar with lots of crab meat smothered in béarnaise sauce. It came with 2 small crab claws on top in the shell and a small ramekin of béarnaise, how disappointing. We ordered one small and one large filet. I had the lager and hardly ate any of it and took the rest home. When I opened my to go box the next day after spending over $70.00 on a steak. I found somebody's else's leftovers (ribs) in my box really pissed off now...... It wasn't that busy of a night either!! I can say that the Bourbon was good, to bad its not enough to bring me back to this place....."}
{"text":"I have to say, it feels really odd to be reviewing a steak place when I don't eat steak.  We had a work dinner here and I split several side dishes with another non-steak-eating co-worker.  We had the mashed potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, and brussels sprouts.  Everything was delicious and we saved room for dessert too - a banana bread pudding of some kind.  That was fantastic.  Overall great experience, for a non-steak eater!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to dine with friends, family or business associates. The wine selection was out of the world along with the 300 different whiskies. Service was also fantastic and we were not rushed through our meal.   My friend and I shared the Oysters Rockefeller - way too much for two people as an appetizer. The oysters were very tender, not over cooked and there was enough spinach and sauce on the dish to make it memorable however, there was a little too much bacon for our taste. For the main coarse we both had the petite filet, which was very generous in size and very tender. Both steaks were cooked to perfection. The grilled Brussels Sprouts were also fantastic. All in all a fantastic experience and exactly what we expected for the price."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced for what it offers . Menu is very limited . The food is good , but I've had better steak at The Keg . The location is good, and the atmosphere is pretty nice , but that's not enough to justify the price. Over all, just mediocre . I was not impressed with anything ."}
{"text":"We went here for our second time today, and as always it was great! We did the restaurant week special, but our friends ordered the ribeye! She asked for more of a chuck cut instead of the sirloin, and we were pleasantly surprised that the head chef came out with 3 ribeyes and let her choose! What amazing service!!! Thanks for making my husband's birthday dinner so delicious with such friendly service!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here for my husbands birthday!  The atmosphere was perfect - we sat in the bar area with the windows/walls open to outside and enjoyed the evening so much.  Good food, good wine/alcohol choices and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Verdict: Decent food but be prepared to spend some serious bones.  If you're not into bourbon, there's an extensive wine list and some beers as well. If you're not into bones, you can opt out of those too. Even a vegetarian has options, though not a ton. It is a steakhouse after all.   They know what they're doing with a filet mignon. No doubt about that. Their appetizers were well made too, from the oysters, to the octopus, and so on. Got their French Onion Soup. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it's attractive and has plenty of flavor. There's the right amount of cheese, bread, and soup for a good balance.  The Caesar salad has an interesting crouton-like ring around it, acting as a sort of bowl that houses the lettuce. You have to give points for being clever. I don't mean the ring for the salad so much as finding a way to price it above $10 where it probably costs about a buck or two for the ingredients, haha.  The one disappointing dish out of them all was the salmon. The cuts were thick and the cook time was only enough to put a light sear on one side. The meat melted in your mouth, which sounds great. The problem is, it had virtually no flavor on the entirely portions and that was most of the meat.  If you're getting desert here, go for the apple crumble. It's great. Otherwise, head across the street and enjoy some gelato."}
{"text":"Ugh. This place has such a great location and sexy vibe I hate to leave a somewhat negative review. We showed up to our reservation about 20 minutes early but they seated us right away which I really loved. Our server came by after ~8 minutes which I thought was a little long to be waiting. She was very friendly and provided great service throughout the meal so no other complaints there. I want to say her name was Ashley.   I ordered the East Coast Sour {Four Roses Bourbon | house sour | Cocchi Barolo Chinato | raspberry sorbet} and it was as delicious as it was beautiful! The key is to drink it from the side so you get the raspberry flavor in every sip. My friend got the Go Green {Hendricks Gin | cucumber | lemon juice | simple syrup | Fevertree bitter lemon soda} which was also excellent.   For appetizers we ordered 1/2 dozen west coast oysters served with daily house mignonette and cocktail sauce. I'm not sure exactly what type of oysters they were, but they were tiny and lacked flavor in my opinion. We also ordered the grilled squid and octopus, the octopus being dry but the seasoning was on point. For entrees we ordered twin lobster tails and the scallops. I didn't try the scallops but my friend said they were great. My lobster was chewy and didn't really have any flavor and didn't seem very fresh. The butter didn't even help! I also think they should offer to deshell it for you but maybe that's just me being snobby. I would definitely not order it again. We got a side of grilled mushrooms which were so overly seasoned and salty they were inedible. The mac & cheese on the other hand was the opposite-so bland with no flavor. The breadcrumbs on top were soft and not crunchy at all like it had been microwaved.   Like I said- the ambience and service in general were great, and the drinks were awesome. The food was just so forgettable and it ended up being a pricey 3 star meal."}
{"text":"For how this menu is priced, you expect to be served a decent steak. Unfortunately, I cannot say that was the case here. Not only that, but the other several friends that I chatted to about eating here were also disappointed.   My recommendation: if you are looking to spend $100 a person, go to Maestros."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour with a friend.   We were celebrating our birthdays and he said I could pick the place.   Since I had never been to B&B, I thought we should check it out.     We sat at the bar since all of the tables were taken.   The bartender was friendly, Rafael, very competent, and made a great drink, which I guess one can't really miss up Grey Goose shaken with ice up, which is billed as the classic martini.   It was one of the HH drink items.   I told him to skip the green olives -- any variation of it --- but to substitute it with the dark cherries used in manhattans.   My friend ordered the SUB ZERO WHISKEY N COKE.   He said it tasted just like a slushy.    I tasted it.   He was right.    I guess that would be an alcoholic slushy.  Rafael gave us two thick cut, very crispy pieces of bacon.   YUMMM!   I don't know 'bout you, but I LOVE thick cut crispy bacon.   We quickly devoured it.  For food we had the fried calamari and the THE DEVILS CUT, HOT ROCK WAGYU BEEF from the HH menu.   What a concept.   I hot rock was placed in front of us.   The beef is raw.   One puts the beef on the hot rock to cook, dip it in one of the two dips provided and pop in one's mouth.   YUMMMM!    The calamari was good as well but nothing compared to the beef.  I would definitely return.   I like the place.  I am giving it four stars instead of five ONLY because I think it needs more options as far as the food and drinks for HH.   I am not a fan of bread, therefore, the sliders and burger were not something I'd order.   And I can't really get excited over a cheese board.   That is so ho hum. ..."}
{"text":"Night five of the restaurant being open and I believe they have a bright future. The staff was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in the door. We were early, so we had a drink at the bar. The bartender was quite knowledgeable and recommended a phenomenal Bourbon. We then moved over to the dining section and had a wonderful dinner. Started with steak tartar and hot rock beef and then we all ordered steaks and shared sides. Everyone enjoyed their meal, so we finished by splitting the butter cake, which was a good call. Ambience was cool. Picking your steak knife was unique and a nice touch. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is really good.  I've been here twice.  The first time I sat at the bar and had a drink.  The bacon strips that they give you as a snack are fantastic.  Justin the bartender is a real pro and provided great service.  I brought over two friends last night for dinner and they liked B&B so much that they are coming back for dinner Saturday night.  This visit we split a medium rare bone-in filet and it was delicious.  I like the simple salt and pepper rub they do on the steak.  Our wine and cocktails were very good and the service was just about perfect.  This is a nice alternative to the other steak places in town.  It's a little smaller and more hip."}
{"text":"A fabulous night filled with great wine, cocktails, food, and let's not forget the Butter Cake!  Thanks to Jessica and team for the wonderful service - you rock!"}
{"text":"Words. Can't. Express. This place is fantastic!   I wish there were more stars to give.   Typically, at a high-end establishment like this one, you'll have two great aspects at the price of one other (ex. Great service, great food, not great ambiance), but I have YET to find an aspect of this restaurant that I don't absolutely LOVE. I've been here maybe 10-15 times (both at the bar and dining), and every time the bar specialists like Lauren or the service staff like Aly have made this place a MUST TRY for any and every steak, seafood, or fine cocktail lover.   THE PEOPLE- The management is friendly and attentive, always walking around to make sure every table is fully satisfied with their experience. The bartenders are personable and responsive while the servers are professional with an honestly impressive knowledge base about the drinks and food items.  THE MENU- The food is TO DIE FOR. Don't get me wrong, this place is not for everyday out-of-pocket dining, they spare no expense on the menu options so you know that every single item comes with the highest quality ingredients, which makes the pricing pretty steep but more worth it than any place I've been in the area to date. I had such a great dish that I asked to meet the chef, Kevin Gage, whose imagination has filled the menu with a carpaccio to write home about and a bone-in ribeye to cry over!   THE DRINKS-  This is my highlight, I'm saving the best for last. I'm a whiskey guy- always have been. I love a good whiskey cocktail, so much so that I've hunted for the best manhattan in the area and...I have to say... I think I've found it. The cocktails here are AMAZING. They have some genius mixologist who finds ways to introduce obscure alcohols like absinthe into whiskey drinks and have them taste jaw-droppingly amazing. I can't say enough about the drinks here. Just go get one for yourself!   From drinks that light on fire to seared scallops Oscar-style to grilled octopus to a dish called \"Dry-aged Tomahawk Ribeye\" that looks like it could both change your life and challenge your sense of adventure, this place is not just a restaurant- it's an experience. But don't take my word for it, go and judge for yourself. Have a drink, have a steak, have a conversation with whoever's serving you- you'll be very very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant, the service was to notch, our waitress knew exactly how to make our night. With humor and expert selections we were well looked after. The ford was expertly prepared and tasted just as good. The will be a regular on my trips to the city."}
{"text":"stopped in on Saturday evening, to have a drink with some friends. Overcrowded with drunk college-age kids and not the atmosphere I was expecting. Ordered a manhattan, and it was not as good as I had hoped. It wasn't chilled and was clearly rushed as the proportions tasted off. I might be willing to try again as the food looked good, but not if it's the same crowd."}
{"text":"We were on a vacation and looking for a roof top restaurant on Oct 15th around 7pm. We came to Second Story Liquor Bar but it was closed and we  happened to see this wonderful steakhouse.  We were very impressed. The food was terrific! The waitress was very attentive. The music is what we like..piano/lounge music ... not overwhelming and added to the ambiance. The interior has a classy and cozy atmosphere with an attractive bar area. I love the seating area with an open view like you are dining outside.  The drink came with olives stuffed with blue cheese, love it, hard to find but few expensive, great restaurant have it.  Some of the food we ordered were Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Octopus, Bacon & Eggs, Lobster Tail Cocktail.  They were flavorful and beautifully presented. The menu were pricey but worth it. Overall, a 5 star experience. A perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, and Yes again please kind Sir !  I walked by and thought 'hmm that looks like a cool place' whilst on the way to another destination. When I got to my original destination I found myself still thinking about \"bones\" and headed right back. I was not disappointed. I had the fillet and loved it. I do have a few notes to warn - I would avoid the happy hour Sauvignon Blanc - I had to give it up and go back to my regular tipple. The Second thing I wanted to add is a note to the Management - STOP HOVERING OVER YOUR STAFF. I have worked in the industry before and I can say you have a winning theme but... (1) Your checking on how things are, (2) how the drinks are going, (3) how the turnaround time is aka your micromanagement is only going to make your staff nervous and detract from your goals  I had a good time - well done, its a cool place, great atmosphere, great food, drinks, service  Go here !"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fabulous anniversary dinner here. The service was exceptional, the food was great and the drinks were on point. They brought us a nice apple cobbler dessert for our special evening. I had a petite filet cooked medium plus- perfect for me...no gray, but no red either. My husband had a bone-in ribeye, mid-rare and it was perfect for him. Sides are big- I'd suggest getting two and splitting them. We didn't have apps or salads - plenty to eat w/steaks and sides."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but came away a bit let down.  Overall it's not a bad place, it's simply not on par with other steakhouses in the same price range.   The atmosphere was a bit like eating a steak at a club. My wife and I had to shout at each other. Granted, it was Friday night, but the boxy layout filled with flat reflective surfaces would probably make it loud any time.   They offer 70 or so types of bourbon, which is great. We love bourbon and had a couple of glasses. I could definitely see this place as a good spot to have drinks with friends who also appreciate quality bourbon.  The food however, was not particularly impressive. I got a filet that was cooked very inconsistently. I ordered it medium plus, which many steakhouses don't seem to understand, and it came out half overdone and half underdone. It also lacked the natural flavor I expect from a $50 steak. They offer several sauces for a couple of bucks more but I don't believe quality meat requires bearnaise.   The bread bowl had an odd mix of rolls that were unimpressive. We shared grilled asparagus that really had no fantastic flavor. For on plate addictions my wife got some crab claws with bearnaise and asparagus. The crab claws were sort of funny in that they were tiny and difficult to get the meat out of. I opted for their lobster fingers which were lobster pieces baked in filo dough. These might have been pretty good but a strong lemon flavor overpowered the meat. My wife liked them, I did not.   We skipped dessert as nothing offered had chocolate, and with so many options nearby, like Gelato Spot across the street, the menu didn't inspire us to try anything.   Ultimately, if you're looking for a night out in old town for drinks with friends, and food isn't your primary concern, Bourbon and Bones is fine. If you're wanting a great steak with outstanding sides, desserts, and details where you can hear your dinner companions, it's not the best. Roaring Fork is a mile up the road and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but drink was delicious and the service was great. Nice ambiance as well. The manager was nice and cleaned up a seat for us so we can bring our baby to ring his first NYE"}
{"text":"Steak was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. Foie gras was not good, skip that option. The service was ok except the sommelier who actually insulted the wine one of us chose. lol in all I would go back but beware of iffy service."}
{"text":"This five star beauty was a surprising treat last night. Great atmosphere , great tasting food , and the staff is on their game ! Don't forget dessert the butter cake! so delicious and mouth watering it was worth the calories !!! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Some restaurants are just better than others and you know it as soon as you walk in; BOURBON & BONES is one of those restaurants.  Everything about this restaurant is 5 STARS.  BOURBON & BONES  Carefully selected cuts of aged beef and a sizable bourbon list are highlights at this downtown Scottsdale chophouse, also serving up seafood, global wines and craft cocktails inside a contemporary, industrial-chic dining room with hand-forged metal details and reclaimed wood.   THE STORY   I had a business meeting and my colleague picked Bourbon & Bones.  \"Great!\" I said. I had been looking forward to trying this restaurant.  When I walked in, I just KNEW I was in the right place. The manager was at the host desk and welcomed me in: It felt like a good friend was having me over for dinner.  I found my colleague, and the manager found us a lovely booth by the window overlooking Old Town Scottsdale. We asked him about the history of the decor, which was impossibly gorgeous. What a great and very charming guy.  I had the west coast oysters and the crab cakes. All of our food was OUTSTANDING. Bourbon & Bones has the kind of menu that you can't fully appreciate in just one visit.  (I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the delicious bacon that is offered as a bar snack. Such an adorable touch.)  CONCLUSION  I absolutely LOVE this restaurant! TREMENDOUS ambiance, food, and service! What a fantastic find! I can't wait to go back to Bourbon & Bones!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Available for special events.  *Parking wasn't evident: It's Old Town Scottsdale.  *For more information: bourbonandbonesaz.com"}
{"text":"In fairness to the review we sat at the bar and only ordered after dinner drinks.  We had ate somewhere else and were walking the strip and this place looked too cool to pass up.   The drinks were fantastic and carefully and skillfully crafted at the bar.  The bar is gorgeous and has the largest selection of liquor I have seen of different whiskeys, rues, bourbons, etc. the ambience is gorgeous and it is an open air environment with beautiful lighting. they give you complimentary Bacon at the bar We watched as others around us were delivered their meals and dish after dish looked so delicious and beautifully plated.   In a great location and a fun inviting atmosphere.  Don't pass this one up!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to this place opening and tried it for the first time last week. I always go into prime steak houses hopeful but not all are created equal. I had a favorite here in town that I use to rate other places and not many hold a candle. However, Bourbon & Bones is now my new favorite. I don't know what magic they are working but the Bone in Ribeye I had was incredible. Maybe it is the \"wet aged process\" or the perfect amount of seasoning or the temperature and cooking technique, I don't know but whatever it is it is a perfect storm. I also enjoyed the fact bacon is brought out while you order. That was a great surprise. I had several of the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and they were perfect. The staff was very friendly and professional as well. I love the vibe of this place. It has good energy, great design and good flow. The open air concept and the fact it looks out over Scottsdale Road makes it very inviting. Bottom line is that you need to go. I plan on making my way through the menu over time and I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Nice, fancy vibe to it..shouldn't have took my daughter but luckily she was well behaved .. the ribs were super soft, came right off the bone, I just didn't like the after taste I would get from whatever BBQ sauce or spice they used & they are not stingy with their mixed drinks..a little expensive but nice place to go to for an intimate night out"}
{"text":"Have to update my review after I found out they charge $3 for an ice ball in your drink. It was kindly offered but extra costs were not disclosed by server. Delicious food. Chill atmosphere in the bar area. Darker lighting. Good people watching on Scottsdale road.  Had the online special for 3 course meal for $45. Filet mignon was amazing. Couldn't finish all our food!  The only downside is that you will literally pay $16-$24 for a cocktail. Granted, they are tasty with a huge selection of bourbon but our bill quickly inflated."}
{"text":"An honest review start to finish. Little too loud. Bar overflows into seated dinning experience. Staff slightly unsure of things. Main dish awesome. Slightly over priced.  Liquor list needs some creativity. Main dish is worth mentioning twice-great!    Our waitress was very nice but clearly new to the customer service scene. Just seemed a little uncertain.  Busboys clear everything from the table when ever they go by, causing us to have to ask for utensils   Three separate times. Very polite and nice staff.   Oysters appetizer came shucked but not cut from the shell and rolled. Causing me to have to cut the muscle, roll them and then sip. I'm not a prude but this is oyster presentation 101 and they failed. Their oysters hold a new record for me as the smallest I have ever had. They were tasty tho.   Main meal was outstanding in presentation and flavor. Wow, fantastic. I had the bacon and eggs, great! Small to medium sized portions, which I sort of liked but slightly costly for portion, but not outrageous. Fantastic flavor.   We had cocktails and they were nice and to be expected. The cocktail list was basic especially for a place with bourbon in their name.  We suggested add a bourbon or whiskey flight to the menu.. Our waitress seemed confused when we asked if they had a bourbon sampling flight.  Odd.    The place is really nice inside but loud. The bar over flows into the dinning area and distracts from the ambiance.   Over all it has the, \"this place is clearly new and learning what they are doing with a great chef\" feel about it.  I wish them well, glad I tried it, but don't think I'll be back until the luster wears down and they figure out what they are doing."}
{"text":"Tall, older bartender was unbelievably rude, as well as the manager. Treated us terribly, so pretentious, acted like this was the greatest restaurant and customers should be privileged to dine here. *all the other bartenders and staff were super nice though*"}
{"text":"Just finishing up my goody bag delights from last night's EXCELLENT dinner at this fabulous restaurant.  We're always on the prowl for a new and different dinner spot but after eating here this will be our go to - so many selections and if we can go by our meals from last night (salads, petit filet, salmon, topped off with outrageously delicious desserts of cookie sandwich and apple crumble) we will back to sample more.  My husband was also hooked on our server Zack's suggestion of bourbon, so much so he had seconds. The wine list from which I chose also provided several excellent selections. If you're deciding where to have dinner in or around Old Towne Scottsdale, hands down - it's Bourbon & Bones!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in this place. The food was pretty terrible. Both my boyfriend and I's steaks were over cooked and when we told the manager he said we were wrong!!! Unbelievable. Will not be returning here. Drive the minute down the street and go to Mastros instead, much better for the same price."}
{"text":"I'm from MI, but I love our local chop house in GR and never found another as good in NY or CHI.  This is special!  Friends of the owners gave me a cell boost at Pinnacle Peek and said to try it, no regrets!  The house salad is amazing (add some fresh pepper), the steak was cooked perfectly.  My favorite was choosing my own knife (this is special and reminds me of my dad showing me how to choose a knife).  Give this a try you will be so glad you did!!!  Ask for Jeff he did a great job!"}
{"text":"Very good Manhattan to start which came with two slices of complimentary bacon followed by a well seasoned serious and octopus appetizer.  The squid was perfect but the octopus was over cooked.  Bone in filet was week cooked and tender but a strong taste of bacon in every bite grew tiresome.  Sat at bar and the server was very knowledgeable and personable."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly with our reservation time. Nice atmosphere but it's a bit loud.  Service was excellent. Extensive list of wine, whiskey and mixed drinks.   Had oysters as an appetizer. Nice presentation and excellent horseradish.  Warm spinach salad was very tasty. Everyone in our party ordered steaks which were all good. I especially enjoyed my New York strip.  Very much enjoyed my evening here. I would definitely return. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the better Chop House experiences we've had Very popular even on a Tuesday, perhaps the newness of it all has Bourbon and Bones buzzing. We had a reservation but because of the popularity of the place our table wasn't quite ready. No worries, we found seats for two at the bar. That's where we met Justin, a hard working, quick to pour bartender extraordinaire! We enjoyed his service so much that we opted to just sit and dine at the bar.  Then it happened, I spotted foie gras as a side/topping to your dish and the hubs asked Justin if we could get the foie as an appetizer .... \" let me check\" ....  out comes this delicious bruschetta topped with an Apple crisp compote, sprinkled with blue cheese and the foie gras adorned atop all the goodness!  Justin smiled. We smiled. A bromance began between the two and I was just elated to witness such joy!  Because we had such an amazing start with HH over at a sushi restaurant we decided to share a dish because we were pretty full. We ordered the bone in ribeye a 24oz monster of a steak and a side of beets with goat cheese. The steak was A-Ok for me it arrived warm and by the time we cut to the middle it was cold as if the steak was cooked and sat. Then plated and left in the expo window. We didn't send it back but the gentleman next to us sent his back experiencing the same problem. The beets were good we love beets but they were a bit on the heavy salted side. We might go with the asparagus next time.  All in all, we dined for a few hours which is always a sign that we are enjoying ourselves, the company and the surroundings.  A 4 star \" better than most Chop house\" adventure."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience!  We were able to enjoy the private dining room and our waiter Tony could not have been more fun and helpful! The vibe of the restaurant is exactly what we were looking for to celebrate our friends' birthdays.  Food- 10 out of 10 stars Ambience 10 out of 10 Service 10 out of 10 Choosing your own steak knife was such a nice touch!"}
{"text":"It's good food with a good atmosphere but the bill will set you back much more than what it's all worth. If I'm going to shell out that kind of cash I'm not doing there for the simple fact the foods \"wow factor\" is a more like an \"eh factor\"."}
{"text":"WOW! What a bar! Hidden gem for crazy good cocktails! Fun vibe, good crowd. Bartender was THE best I've had-EVER.  Ask for Rich.  Enjoyed the selection too. Food was very good. Nice change of pace from all the same old places in Old Town."}
{"text":"The best part of this place is prob the bar area that serves up some solid but overpriced cocktails. Food was average. Presentation and quality a tad below. Kind of place that assumes it produces a good product because it charges a certain price and hopes you'll buy into that.  Vegas-ish mindset. You'll find a better steak, setting, and service about a mile north at Maestros City Hall."}
{"text":"First time at this place, excellent service the management is excellent the food is excellent and  the ambience is excellent five stars"}
{"text":"For almost $140 a person I expect a lot more.     We had a group of 12 to celebrate a birthday.   Our server was pleasant and attentive.  It was weird that we had to ask for bread while we waited though....and from the GM who just happened to be walking by.  The Grilled Squid and Octopus appetizer was very good.  The Ceaser had a beautiful presentation and was delicious.   The steaks however were just okay.  I love bone in filet and order it anytime I can find it.  The steak's temperature was done exactly as requested; the meat was tender.   There was absolutely no flavor....which for $49 there should be some sort of flavor.  My husband had the Ribeye; it was good but not great....again lacked flavor.  And the brussel sprouts were inedible due to their lack of seasoning; they were just bitter.   None of the other sides looked very inspiring either.  I didn't try the dessert but I heard it was very good.  I won't be back.  I love a decadent experience and I don't feel you can get that at Bones and Bourbon.  And for their prices it should be decadent, not 'just okay.'"}
{"text":"By far one of the worse \"nice\" steak houses I have eaten at. Sides were cold. Steak was dry and flavorless. I went for a drug rep dinner so I personally did not have to pay for the meal;however, if I did I would have sent the food back and walked down to Mastros."}
{"text":"This place is so terrible I don't even know where to begin. Let's start at Bourbon... I'm from Kentucky, so I know my bourbon better than the average person, their selection is very weak and very overpriced, especially compared to other high end restaurants in the area. On top of that, if you want it severed on the rocks you have 2 options. Options #1 - Pay $5 for one large ice cube, yes that is correct $5 for frozen water. Option #2 - a cup full of crushed ice, full to the brim smh! The food is very subpar, for the price save yourself time and money and go to City Hall and have an actual good high end steak and high end bourbon. Service was crappy too, our server didn't know much.   Tourist stay away, this place is a terrible representation of what our great old town neighborhood has to offer.  Very excited to see what goes in next after this place goes out of business! Hope it's soon :)"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals ever. Wonderful staff. Excellent Manhattans. OMG. The steaks were supreme.  We were in town visiting. I wish Los Angeles had a steakhouse this good."}
{"text":"After spending 14 days in Scottsdale this had to be my favorite restaurant of the 14 dinners we had well in town the food was excellent the service was excellent spoke to the general manager we stopped by to check on our meal....... expressed how much we enjoyed our meal. Everything from the greeters to our server was excellent the bourbon selection was top-notch would definitely recommend it to anyone in town we are in Indianapolis area and have been too many nice restaurants in the area this ranks among the best that I have been to."}
{"text":"I was super hesitant to go to this place after reading some of the reviews here, but I am glad i did. We had 9 people in our party and this was one of the few times that a big party's order didn't get messed up and that food was actually on time.  Their service is excellent. Food and sides were delicious. They keep checking on us and refilling out waters. I am a big steak fan and I definitely recommend this place. I tried the bone filet mignon and they cooked it flawlessly. Everyone loved their food and service. If you are Looking for a delicious steak at a fair price, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Everything you want in a night out. Great atmosphere and delicious food! Some of the best steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went last night with my wife and some good friends. We had great service, good drinks and yummy food, my steak was a little over cooked, but was tasty, the other three had their steaks perfectly prepared. We had a side of Mac n cheese that was a delight and mashed potatoes.   I would definitely recommend it for folks wanting a good steak."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great  Cocktails are excellent  Food is meh... little overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second time here and it was as good as the first. Service, drinks, food was all excellent. Scallops were amazing! My husband is a steak snob and had the bone in filet and said every time the cook is perfect. I am a pescatarian and the seafood here is as good as it gets being in Arizona."}
{"text":"Extrodinary service! From the host to the cook and everyone in between. Thank you for the good times."}
{"text":"Bone in prime rib was terrible. Ordered medium rare , turned out to be chewy and mushy. Really disappointed. The sides were good so I guess there's that. But for a $50 steak I would expect more. 2 stars is kind."}
{"text":"It was good and the service was excellent. Platings could use a little refinement. I ordered the petite filet mignon Oscar style and it was very good. My husband had the pork chop and while he said it was good, it wasn't the best he ever had. The pork chop just came out on the plate by itself, no sauce, no nothing. Therefore it lost out with us not only in taste but visually as well. We had Oysters Rockefeller for an appetizer and they were good as was the French onion soup. We also shared a cremé brûlée for dessert and it was good. We also tried some of the bourbons. It is very pricey here and I think that is more for the service than the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC, my husband and I actually went two nights in a row. We discovered this place while walking through old town, and decided to stop in for a few apps and cocktails. We had the tuna tartare, truffle mushrooms, and meatballs. The food was so incredible, and the customer service was even better! Our only regret is that we didn't eat a full dinner, so we went back the next night. My husband and I are extreme foodies, and have NEVER visited a restaurant two nights back to back while on vacation. Well, we went the second night for the steak, and again were blown away! The steak melted in your mouth, and the sides were incredible. The staff really made our experience amazing, and took the time to ensure we had everything we needed and had fun while doing so!!! This dining experience is in our top 3, and gives Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, Steak, a run for its money! Well done guys!"}
{"text":"Bad vibes from second you walk in. Bunch of old men and super small like a match box. Sat at bar, bartender didn't acknowledge us and then we look at their VERY awkward menu and my boyfriend and I frequent at Steak44 and City Hall and have steak knowledge. When we asked if they had a porterhouse cut, bartender looked like we were aliens. He said he had to ask the chef because they don't normally carry it and saw him go to the manager. I've heard the food and service was bad and after our greeting we decided not to waste any money in that awkward place.  Very disappointing. City Hall worth the bucks!"}
{"text":"Man, seriously... not again. This pains me to update my review again for basically food that was hardly edible and horrendous service at Bourbon & Bones.   So, lets rewind here for a second and get the facts straight. I first dined here a few months back when they first opened. Anything that could go wrong, did... and I still ended up shelling out over $100.00 for that disaster (that was even after they took off several just horrible items). I was invited back by their GM Nick (who was great) to have a re-do of my evening, and the food was so much better that time around that I felt comfortable recommending it to friends who were visiting from out of town.  So off we all went and yet again,and it was like a repeat of my initial visit... We waited nearly 30 minutes past our scheduled reservation time with ZERO communication from the hostesses, the food was inedible... Think shells in the oysters, the shrimp cocktail lacked any flavor and the shrimp was overcooked to the point that we couldn't eat them, the pork belly was so overcooked that it they should just change the name to beef jerky and eggs  (where was that juicy pork belly). All of our steaks (but one but that's not saying much since they eat it basically burnt) were overcooked and under seasoned. The sides weren't anything to write home about, they got cold 5 minutes after being set down on the table. The whole pick your own steak knife still confuses me since it serves zero purpose.   I will give them the sexy vibe and a great location... but I am starting to think this restaurant concept group should either stick with cheese burgers and beer or get a chef in the kitchen that knows how to cook.   Yet again, I walked away from the place feeling embarrassed that I recommended this place to close family friends who forked over nearly $600.00 for dinner, and left still hungry (We stopped for pizza on the way home). Go anywhere but here... seriously anywhere."}
{"text":"We had family vacation in Scottsdale and found this gem in Old Town.  We sat in the bar area where the windows were open and the weather was perfect.  Our waitress (can't remember her name but she is a Russian woman) was amazing! Prompt, knowledgeable and friendly.  The steaks were on point.  Would definitely go back if we visit Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 on Friday night and we were very impressed. The bar area has a great vibe and great energy. Steaks were perfect. My wife and I slit the bone in ribeye. Plenty of food. The off the cob corn is the best I have had. For only being open for a couple of weeks the service was great. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 were the booze prices."}
{"text":"I don't see how this concept is going to succeed.   It's priced like a high end steakhouse but without the attributes of a high end dining experience.  The service was fine. The atmosphere is okay....going for that trendy, sparse look.  The tables are a little close; servers and customers are constantly trying to squeeze through spaces that barely exist. The noise volume is pretty high.  That, however, is the least of their worries.  The food just doesn't deliver for this price point.  The starters and salads were nice but the steaks simply had no flavor....decent cuts, cooked okay but there is nothing there flavor wise.  The sides are also nothing to write home about either.   Everything seemed to lack taste.  We had a good time but if I'm going to spend over $250 for my wife and I to go to dinner I want \"Amazing\", not average.  And if I'm entertaining clients I have to have a 'Wow' factor; unfortunately, there is no 'Wow' here.  (And, yes, the steak knife presentation is a cool touch but that shouldn't be the most interesting part of a meal.)  I'm glad we gave it a try but this is a one time only visit for us."}
{"text":"New spot in town and I'm liking it. I can only speak about Happy hour and late night happy hours however.   The happy hour menu is amazing. The truffle popcorn, yes please and the burger is enormous!!   We had to get it because it comes with duck fat fries.  What's not to love?  The menu also has homemade potato chips, a meat/cheese board, etc.    The restaurant also gives everyone amazing bacon as an appetizer.  Crisp, salted perfectly and is perfect."}
{"text":"Our for a little dinner with my pal and really wanted to try this place. It looked really fun from the outside so I talked him into it. He had been there previously and got a filet and lobster.  Unfortunately on his last visit he had a problem with the lobster and returned it to the kitchen, then the manager apologized and said he would take it off the bill but never did. It took so long to get the waiter back over, he just paid and left. So it took some convincing to get him back in there.  Sadly, the service was extremely slow (but it was courteous). We ordered a couple of steaks and some apps and it seemed like forever before they got to our table.  Bread bowl was pretty good, pretzel was a little dry.  Steaks were over cooked, and I'm not a penny pincher, but if your going to be in the high end steak business you should know the difference between medium and well done (not pink at all throughout). They were bricks. They were also Luke warm which makes me think they sat under heat lamps for a bit.  The bacon wrapped dates were off too. Half were burnt and the other half was ok. So I ate half of the apps and only the middle part of my ribeye steak. My buddy just sat and gloated... he didn't eat.  I didn't complain because it took so long for the waiter to come by all I wanted to do was leave because I was still hungry.  My buddy laughed at me and we went to Bottled Blonde for a pizza... which was really good by the way.  Atmosphere is pretty but very loud in the dining room. Great concept, poor execution. Time will tell... I will try it again on a slower night."}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant! My brother in law was in town for business and is a huge bourbon/whiskey fan. A colleague of his suggested this place so we all went. We made a reservation, but probably wasn't necessary for a Thursday night as there were plenty of tables available. They also offer free valet parking behind the restaurant. Service was excellent and the food matched. We will definitely be back for special occasions."}
{"text":"Sadly a huge miss. Over cooked beef filet, over cooked halibut, cocktails not consistent, service rushed and prices too high for what you get. Precision is key in establishing yourself as a serious contender in the Steakhouse space. Good luck!"}
{"text":"We took my sister here for her birthday. This place is excellent! From the service to the food everything was simply perfect. I highly recommend if you have a chance. Wonderful selection of appetizers and entrees. There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"This place is quite the restaurant - wonderful selection of food choices and types. The menu is awesome. I'd say it's probably one of the new, better quality restaurants in Old Town. Quite surprisingly, I read some of the previous Yelp reviews to be a little shocked at some of the -ve reviews. I definitely did not have this experience at all.. We booked through OpenTable and had a booth.. we were on a double date night with friends, so we knew we were committed for the long haul of the evening.  Were seated by the hostess immediately inside (there is also bar and high-top table seating) and were presented with the menu, the wine and cocktail list.. I always prefer to start off with a beer to cleanse the palate before a good meal, and so the boys had an IPA (Hop Knot) and the girls G&T and a Berried Alive (from the cocktail menu).  There were lots of wonderful selections on the menu - making a decision on the starters was fun and allowed us to share across the table. We did have to find GF food choices, but the quality of GF these days is amazing and you honestly cannot tell the difference.  So we started with 1/2 dozen West Coast oysters, which were sooo tasty. The Tomato Mozzarella salad was also really nice and fresh. We didn't want to over heat on the starters so stuck with just the two. We had a non-red meat eater also, so a fish choice from their waiters specials menu was on order as well. The girls went the petite filet (one with the peppercorn sauce (which was surprisingly over-sweet - very unlike a normal peppercorn flavor) and a béarnaise sauce, which was the star of the 2 sauces. Perfectly cooked at medium rare. I had the Colorado Lamb Chop, also medium rare, which was huge (compared to a regular lamb chop anyway!). Looked like it came from a massive beast!!  We all agreed the meals were outstanding - presentation wise (please see images) but flavor-wise too. My only real comment on the lamb was that it was really quite fatty - sure fat adds flavor, but I had to trim excessive amounts off the chops. However the meat was very nicely flavoured, cooked perfectly, but somewhat different from a traditional Australian or New Zealand lamb chop (these are a generally sweeter, gamier meat).  Our waiter also brought out a series of different steak knives for choice in a case - which as really nice being offered the choice of your own knife, as opposed to having a standard steak knife just laid out.. Really nice touch..  To pair with these meals, we chose an Australian Shiraz - the Peter Lehman 'Portrait' series from 2014, which is an exceptional wine (and vintage season) for the price on the menu (and not expensive either). I had this decanted when we ordered our starters, so it was nicely aerating and opening by the time it arrived to our table. It was a definite winner all round so when the bottle dried up, we grabbed another. Uber was our mode of transport, so we wanted to be able to enjoy our wine and not be worried about driving. I have had this wine many times before when in Australia, so our US friend relished the varietal differences between our countries..  Sides we went with were the country mashed potatoes, the grilled and truffled asparagus spears with egg and the grilled broccoli. These sides paired easily with the main courses, so overall was a fairly easy dining choice.  Next we hit the dessert menu, although we were planning on skipping it at the time. However, our waiter said they had some pretty nice desserts worth looking at, so we decided to go family style with 3 different ones (maintaining our GF choices on 2 out of the 3).. Vanilla crème brûlée (with the cookie dough in a small dish on the side (allowed us to share with our GF friend), the Banana Fosters Twinkie cheesecake (which is not on the menu (but a concoction from one of the dessert/pastry chefs who came and spoke to us about it) and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding.. All were really nice, not overtly rich but also satisfying on flavors and size.. Well rounded finish to the evening, thats for sure.."}
{"text":"Loved it! I was strolling down Scottsdale Road with my family when we decided to pop into Bourbon & Bones. As it turns out, it's not exactly the type of place you pop into, it's a pretty fancy menu. I had the scallop meal which was delicious. The tomato and onion salad was a different story. It was literally just pieces of cut up plain tomato and onions. The pieces were much too thick. That being said, everything else made up for it... the ambience, the crowd, the windows that open up so it has an outside feel, etc. 5 stars for Bourbon & Bones!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Bourbon & Bones. Great wine and bourbon selection. Food was good and the service was great. I would definitely recommend checking them out if you are looking for a good steak."}
{"text":"You're paying for the Scottsdale scene. The food is ok but not worth the price. The servers are pretentious and the bartenders are even worse. I left LA to try to get away from that but b&b does a good job at capturing the los angeles arrogance."}
{"text":"NomNomz: 10/5 Cocktails: 5/5 Service: 10/5 Ambiance: Trendy, modern, upscale   Wow, just WOW! I've been dreaming about this place all week since I went there last weekend. This is perfect for a hot date or some best friends in town, showing them the great food scene in Scottsdale. I've heard about this place for a while, and have been waiting to check it out. It's pricey, but it's definitely worth it. They don't skimp out on proportions, so you definitely get your money's worth. The location is in the heart of Old Town, easily accessible for a night out after.  This place is a steak house ladies and gentlemen. And it's one to write home about. From the moment we got there, everyone was extremely nice/welcoming, and the service was impeccable. The bus boys were also at the table often, clearing away dishes and refilling waters. We also had a special delivery for our steak orders, with a lovely wooden box full of beautiful knives to choose from. Our waitress was amazing, and highly knowledgeable and I could tell that the entire staff were all on point.   Cocktails: Impressive. The list is extensive, and includes more than 120 bourbons and 320 whiskey offerings. My favorites are the Chophouse Martini ($18) or the Imperial Old Fashioned ($18). They have some other select house cocktails to choose from ranging from $14-$18, and a wide ranging wine list on top of that ($10-$30/glass). They have quite the elite wine bottle selection if celebrations are in order. Take your pick!   Nomz: If you're a seafood person, start with the oysters (1/2 dozen $18), and jumbo shrimp cocktail ($7) with your party - you will not regret. The Caesar ($12) and Wedge salad ($10) are two of the best I've ever had, so those are recommended as well (large portions , so definitely split before your main courses). There are other great items on the appetizer list ranging from $12-$24, so you'll be happy with whatever you order because everything is phenomenal.  Main Nomz: This is a steakhouse, so get ready to salivate over your dishes. All the steak is USDA Prime & certified Angus beef. My favorite was the 6oz Petit Filet Mignon ($39), and they have a 10oz for ($47). The New York Strip (14oz $49) is also incredible. Their steak menu ranges from $39-$95, and all can be accompanied with delicious house signature sauces ($4-$9), or \"Over The Top\" items such as \"Oscar Style\" ($16), blue cheese crust ($5), foie gras ($16), onions & mushrooms ($4), pork belly ($10), sautéed shrimp ($14), or main lobster tail ($MP). Oscar style is the most popular, and my favorite pick (come with lobster, ahem). They have other seafood dishes ranging from $33-$40, like grilled salmon or pan seared scallops, and a roasted chicken ($27) and braised pork shank dish ($31). They have a prime rib dinner available Sundays & Monday's, slow roasted with a twice baked potato ($36-$42). Their side signature options are also NOT to be ignored. Truffled Lobster Mac n Cheese ($25), and the Sherried Wild Mushrooms ($10) were our favorite, and the Grilled Asparagus and Roasted Broccoli ($10) were other great additions, as well. All side dishes range from $8-$24, and look amazing. Everything is probably great on the menu, the food quality is to perfection.   Desert: I'm not a huge banana fan, but their Banana Bread Pudding with ice cream and whiskey sauce is out of this world. They have a few other sweets to select from like Creme Brulee, or Key Lime Cheesecake (all $10) or just some ice cream scoops for $3. If you're a fan, they also have a decent sized menu for Desert Wine & Port or Brandy.   There is a $25k item on the menu that looks absolutely insane, but I'm curious how many times it's been ordered! It comes with Vintage Cristal (limited edition), a handcrafted 6 course meal with a dozen 32oz Dry-aged Tomahawk Ribeye Steaks, with limo transportation as well. Part of the proceeds go to one of Arizona's homeless shelters so some of it goes to good cause.   Tip: Definitely make a reservation online, the place is always packed. They also have happy hour, which I'll definitely be going back for (Monday through Friday 4-6pm).  Tip: During the holidays, if you book early enough you'll get a complimentary champagne toast.   Hours for easy reference: Sunday & Monday: 5pm-9pm Tuesday-Thursday: 5pm-10pm Friday-Sunday: 5pm-11pm Bar- Open daily until 4pm"}
{"text":"I have to do bullet points or else it this raving review will be entirely too long.  I have been there twice and both times the service has been INCREDIBLE.  The team is friendly, outgoing, and fun.  1. Sit in the bar.  You get Bar Bacon for an aperitif.  It's amazing. Trust me. 2. The pretzel bread is perfectly cooked every time.  Moist and fluffy on the inside with a  salted crispy outside. 3. I had the filet.  It was was cooked exactly to the temp I ordered and the seasoning tasted great.  They season a bit more than  some of my other favorite steak houses but it's still really, really good. 4. Get the Bourbon Pecan Butter cake.  The cake has a slightly caramelized crust and is topped with vanilla ice cream.  I like my desserts extra sweet, which this was, but then the bourbon cut that sweetness and added a tad bit of a Smokey flavor and I loved it!  I've also had the burger here.  It's juicy and cooked to perfection.   This is a must do in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you see my reviews, you'll see I rarely take the time to write a negative review but this place warrants it.  I was so excited to try Bourbon n Bones.  The place looks cool as you drive by and the vibe is engaging.  But that's where my praise ends.  The food is mediocre AT best! The service is sooooo bad that even if the food was worth the wait you'd be annoyed anyway.  The bar is filled with great energy as far as clientele BUT the \"bar manager\" has to be the rudest man I've ever encountered in the business.  When I asked about a specific bourbon ( I guess it is one that they did not carry) he responded annoyed, \" No lady, but I have a hundred other bourbons you could try!\" ... not only the fact that he said \"lady\" in a tone that was condescending but his attitude was pompous!   (Not to mention there was a story behind the bourbon I had requested that may have been interesting to this particular venue!) At the table, that we had a reservation for ... (we waited 45 minutes past that time) We were a party of 8!  the food came out at different times... some of it cold. We ordered a steak medium well ... it came rare! That wouldn't matter but when we asked our waitress to cook it a little more she said I'll be back for it and didn't return for 16 minutes.   By the time she brought our order back it was 25 minutes after everyone else at the table had been served and finished their meals.  The people watching is superb but the service and quality do NOT warrant the high price tag.  Have a drink... don't ask for anything off the bar menu and dine elsewhere.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in this general area crossing this off will make your choices a little easier."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner at Bourbon & Bones! Being in the restaurant business and having dined at some of the finest steakhouses in the country, Bourbon & Bones service, food, and atmosphere was second to none. Extremely impressed by the quality and selection of beef (especially with the dry & wet aged selection). It was very refreshing to dine at Bourbon & Bones as it is a very unique restaurant. The GM was on top of it and had the place in order. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"As new locals, we must find our local steakhouse go-to for my hubby. Just by the name alone, we needed to check this place out. We ordered a little of everything:  Oysters were excellent.  Tomato and onion salad was everything we expected.   Pretzel bread was yummy!   Ribeye was just ok. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, just not the best quality I have had for the price.   Corn side was ok, I'd skip it next time. Nothing too special. Could have used a little kick of flavor. Maybe more salt?  Sherried wild mushrooms were also nothing special, we have had better (stronger) flavor at other steakhouses.   Martini pours and wine by the glass pours are generous.   Pretty sexy place, great vibe for a date night. Service was excellent too. We might not go back to order a steak again because there is better execution in town by other steakhouses, but I will be back for cocktails, wine, and snacks."}
{"text":"This meal was excellent,  top to bottom.  The prices are high, but service and quality were so impressive that I never questioned the value of what we received.   This would be a place to bring loved ones, clients you'd like to impress, or anyone who really deserves something special.   If you have children who are mature and well behaved, maybe bring them, but probably you'll prefer to get a babysitter and enjoy this experience thoroughly free from parental distractions."}
{"text":"Bourbon & Bones is terrific.  I have never had a better steak than the one that I had at Bourbon & Bones.  The atmosphere, the staff and the food are terrific.  Be sure to book your table ahead of time.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time in to Bourbon & Bones and the space is really cool. I'm kind of a snob about restaurant bathrooms and felt like they were underwhelming (Only downside)  Otherwise everything was really good. Prices are what you'd expect for a Scottsdale Steakhouse so with any alcohol be prepared to drop a couple hundred dollars for dinner for two.   Steak was cooked to perfection. Fiancee has a 24oz T Bone and the flavor got better and better as you worked into the middle of the cut. Lobster mac and cheese was good but I think it was a little overpriced for what you get. Oysters were perfectly shucked. Special of the night was a braised short rib and the flavor and glaz on that were 100% amazing.   Our server was Bobby and he was awesome. I personally enjoy the service aspect of eating out as much as the food/ambience and he really delivered good service. Friendly, trendy, attentive but not over the top or in your face. He had superb product knowledge and you can tell that he is a true professional.   Overall 5 stars. Would take clients/friends here if they were in town."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner, it was very modern and relaxing. The servers were polite and prompt, which is always appreciated. The ice balls that they put in your drinks are so fascinating, you'd think huh ice ball no big deal but it's the small details that really polish up an evening. The food was amazing, I had Wagyu steak and lobster Mac and cheese, so good!"}
{"text":"Spur of the moment, what a great decision... Bone in Rib-eye, Ribs and Scallops for the 3 of us, all cooked fabulous. Service was very attentive and the  drinks are well made but not for the weak."}
{"text":"This rating is for the bar section only. I came here to enjoy great cocktails but that wasn't the case when the bartender didn't know what Orgeat was, so instead of ordering from their menu I ordered a Stella which they were out so I settled for a Guinness which was served completely at the wrong temperature and glass. The good thing about this place was the open air bar, the great music and decor. If they can fix these small things I would come back. Here is a quick little link for the nice bartender girl who didn't know what orgeat was. Quick and simple recipes. http://smallhandfoods.com/recipes/"}
{"text":"Wonderful service. Staff has great knowledge of menu. Beautiful location. Went while Christi was behind the bar and she Is the best. Most friendly!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to try this place again.  I got stuffed really fast and didn't get to try the steak, but they have so many good items on the menu.  The bacon they give you to try is phenom!  The place is small but we sat up at the bar after a day of drinking and everything was really good.  Good people watching too."}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday dinner and left fat and happy. Emphasis on \"fat.\"  We didn't have a reservation, but I figured since we were early-ish (about 6:20 on a Saturday) that we could give it a shot. We had no problem snagging a small booth by the window. The space is sleek and modern, and our server was very nice.  We split the truffled mushrooms (truffle gouda, holy crap right?) to start, and they were amazing. I opted for the half roasted (herby, juicy) chicken over mashed potatoes, and my husband went with the bone-in filet with a side of mac and cheese. His steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare. Before they were served, we got to select our own knives out of their little knife collection box. A fun touch.  The food was divine. Like I said, everything was cooked perfectly and the little crock of mac was deceiving--it was so rich and cheesy that we couldn't finish it off! Our server found out we were celebrating a birthday and presented us with a free order of their butter cake (GOOEY, molten cake with sauteed peaches, topped with candied pecans and a side of bacon-vanilla ice cream. OMG.) It was an amazing way to end the meal, but we honestly didn't NEED it. We were so, so stuffed. (But were we going to turn down free butter cake? NO WAY.)  There seemed to be a little too much time between ending our appetizer and receiving our main dishes, as well as getting our credit card picked up after we were done, but I know it takes a while for new places to get their bearings. Prices are pretty steep, but you're definitely paying for the location, the amazing food and the nice touches.  With my glass of wine, an appetizer, two mains and a side, we came out to $150 after tip. Definitely not a regular dining experience for us, but absolutely a place for celebrating and having a special night. It's Monday, and I'm still full!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere,  the food has the potential to be great.  It's not there yet.  Nothing seemed to be hot when it came out.  The plates are too large, don't keep the heat for warm food.  Steak so cool that the ghost chili butter (yum) wouldn't melt on meat.  Butter cake was not warm at all!  Kitchen needs to step it up to make this place worth it.  Cocktails were perfect from Burbon (even tho u have to pay xtra for an ice ball) all the way to the latte .  Staff is very accommodating w removing food from bill and asking if everything is ok but the prices are still too high for the experience.  For the $500 bill we had I would prefer Steak44. Knowing my steak will be sizzling and my butter cake will be warm!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and I can say with authority that the quality and value of this steakhouse outstanding. The steak and the crust were amazing. In fact all the sides and everyone's meal was top notch. Best brussel sprouts I have ever consumed. Prices are also reasonable for the quality and the service was also great. For the main the bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the steak was ahhhhh~ highly recommended"}
{"text":"Ambiance: I absolutely love the ambiance! One side of the restaurant could be opened up for fresh outside air. The decor is modern and unique in its own terms, compared to the likes of Morton's, Mastro's, etc. You feel energetic yet relaxed. Perfect for business or leisure. On a Tuesday night, I am surprised by how busy it got. Service: Our server was also serving a table of 10+ people next to us, so there were a few times that we were waiting on her and couldn't flag her down. They also made a minor mistake on our order but generously made up for it: one of my colleagues ordered a 9oz steak, plain while another ordered a 6oz dressed. They mixed up the steak sizes and made up for it by giving an extra 6oz steak, which none of us could finish so it was a meal for tomorrow. Food: the table side bread was delicious, great with my bourbon. My starter salad is acceptable, nothing to rave about. My colleagues had the French onion soup that they were flabbergasted with how delicious it was. I had the scallops which came with sauteed asparagus: I'd give it a 7.5 our of 10, good but not memorable. Other orders on the table included the salmon and ahi, which had no complaints. The macaroni side was delicious. The truffle fries were \"meh\". The baked potato was indeed loaded and extra buttery! All in all, I wish Yelp allowed 1/2 stars as I'd give this place 4.5!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! I been to Mastro (city Hall) J&G and I find that Bourbon and Bones was hands down my favorite.  Thank you for a wonder experience"}
{"text":"Disappointed in food and service at Bourbon & Bones. It's noisy and expensive -- not worth the price for a Saturday evening outing with friends (four couples total), when there are so many excellent restaurants in Scottsdale. Some things that stuck with us the next morning:  * Ordering a nice bourbon -- Angel's Envy -- resulted in this comment by the waiter: \"That's a starter bourbon. You should have this instead,\" he said, pointing to one costing nearly twice as much. Uh, no. (The Angel's Envy is listed as $16 on the menu, but came through as $19 on the bill.)  * We only knew that appetizers had been ordered when servings of Hot Rock Wagyu Beef arrived for half the table. Sitting on the other side of the table, we were never asked about appetizers -- which is a shame, because we had planned to try the Chop House Meatballs.   * My order of \"OVEN ROASTED 1/2 RED BIRD CHICKEN\" was more like the size of three Chicken McNuggets. Not even close to a half chicken. It was tasty, but frankly, I've had half-chicken dinners at Boston Market that were bigger and tastier.  * My wife's order of the 14oz veal chop was fatty and largely inedible. She mentioned this was the worst veal chop dinner she'd ever had. The waiter never came back to ask how things were -- at least not to our side of the table. He spent about 95% of his time chatting with the other side of the table.  * My bourbon was gone before the dinner came; I was never offered another beverage. But then again, the waiter wasn't interested in our side of the table, he was too busy laughing and pouring wine for the other side.  * This event celebrated one of our party's birthday. We didn't feel celebratory when it turned out that the house's surprise birthday dessert (I think it was a warm apple crumble) ended up on the bill! It was removed when we complained.  * On the positive side: the baked potato was excellent, as was the sautéed corn. My \"starter\" bourbon was tasty and satisfying. The wine ordered by one of the couples was not too marked-up: $42 for the bottle, compared to a retail of $20. One of our party was drinking soft drinks, and the waiter kept him \"filled.\" And they do a neat thing where they present each diner with a big box of different steak knives, and you get to choose your weapon -- we all enjoyed that.  Our dinner bill was $131. It was overpriced for what we were served, and how it was served."}
{"text":"So I've tried b & b a few times now to get a fair assessment. My first visits were when the weather was a bit cooler and it is super cool that the windows come out and create a patio so it's a good ambiance on a nice day. Since it's hot now of course a no go. Servers are always nice and managers come by and check on you so that's nice. Best thing about this place is their hh burger which is amazing. Worst thing is you can only order it during happy hour which sucks because in my opinion it's better than their steaks!  Best sides are the brussel sprouts and the mac and cheese is pretty yum too. Drinks are good, bartenders are awesome. I would probably have given it a 3.5 but you can't so I rounded up. The reason being is that it is a steakhouse and I have tried their steaks twice- the bone in rib eye and the filet and both were decent but not amazing. In my opinion the steak at a steakhouse should be amazing. They have other things that are though which is why I've been back a few times. I also like that it's a good crowd but not over crowded like some of the old town spots. I'll be back. Especially for the hh burger and fries or Mac and cheese and calamari."}
{"text":"Great cuts of meat,  cocktail menu, and service!   This just might be my new favorite place in old town!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! The cocktails, wine list, starters and steak never disappoint! Lively bar scene if that's your jam, sweet little table for two (snore) or private dining for you and your tribe. They got you!"}
{"text":"Great place. Our bartender Richard was amazing. Suggested great food choices and excellent drinks.  The atmosphere was airy and fresh.  His bareback was also great.  Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I called to make a resv. and stated that i would take anytime as long as i was given a table...   the Gentleman who took my resv. said 8pm is the earliest...   Ill take....  Well when i get there i was given a table... i questioned the booth and the reply i got was.   Sorry but we gave ur table to a bigger party....    i asked then why did i make a resv for a table...    and not one person answered me.     They all looked at me that i had 3 heads......      So we decided to take our table of 4 to a different restaurant.... And we found an amazing Italian restaurant...."}
{"text":"So my son wanted to try B&B cause a co-worker recommended this place. I bookmarked it cause I'm always game for a good steakhouse. I made reservations on Open Table which made it really convenient.   This place is downtown Scottsdale and I really am hesitant coming here cause of parking but to my surprise there is a public parking structure right behind B&B. Also, they have complementary valet parking too.   Walking in the place it's dimly lit with a modern decor. They have both a bar area and dining area. Not huge but would say medium sized but a really nice ambience to the place.   I basically messed up on my reservation and made it for four but we had five. They were very kind and went out of their way to seat us in their dinning area which I thought was nice of them when I basically screwed up.   We started out with their complementary bread basket. Wow. Pretzel bread and rolls. Really good but my favorite was there pretzel bread. Outstanding. We also ordered the crispy calamari. We always have to try calamari wherever we go. The calamari was really good. Breaded lightly. Cooked perfectly and not to chewy. Really liked the dipping sauce too. So the appetizer was very good.   I ordered the 26oz Bone-In Ribeye. It was cooked perfectly. Very moist. Very tasty. Enjoyed it but it seemed like it had a lot more fat on the steak than other steakhouses. I mean cutting off the fat is no problem but just saying. My wife got the petite filet mignon. I had a few bites and it was very good. Very tender and delicious. Most importantly, my wife enjoyed it too.   As with most steakhouses, you have to order your sides separate. We ordered the Brussel Sprouts, hash Browns, and Mushrooms. When our order came out, they brought out mashed potatoes instead of mushrooms. They also serve your sides for you. So we had three people dishing out our sides. When the manger came by to ask how's it going someone mentioned that we ordered mushrooms and not mashed potatoes. They got on it right away and brought out our mushrooms. No fuss. No arguments but service. It's also great that they didn't charge us for their mistake too. I thought all the sides were very good but really liked the Brussel Sprouts the most.   So we were all so full but just ordered the dessert Warm Apple Crumble. It was pretty big. Really good. Just enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. Just loved the warm apples inside.   So the service was really good. Right when we sat down our server greeted us and asked us for our drinks. The service seemed a little slow at times but I guess they allow their guest to enjoy and have a relaxing meal. I would say our server was fairly friendly and took care of our table. Always filling our water cups. The cool thing about this place is when you order a steak, they bring out a wooden box and allow you to pick out your steak knife. They have big thick manly knives to more smaller knives for the women. You get to chose your own.   We did like the ambiance. Dimly lit with a few blue light and everything seems so open with the ability so see outside with all the people walking by and the cars going by. It's just so scottsdale. Enjoyed it  Like I said, I enjoyed the meal.  Really good service. Very good steaks. Food is excellent. Great ambiance. Really did enjoy. There are so many great steakhouse it's just your preference. Enjoy. We did"}
{"text":"The best steak, cocktails, and wine around!!  Definitely the best cocktails I've had!  Great atmosphere, too.  One of my favorite hot spots in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a firm B with a few extra  points for service, which is very good. The food? It's not bad either, but falls short stacked up next to some of the other steakhouses in the area, like Capital Grill or Don & Charlie's. I ordered a box car cut that came to the table cooked a notch or two past my medium rare request - slightly rubbery and not much sear or texture. I didn't pick up any signature flavors either. Surprisingly average. My cocktail order was odd too. I ordered a simple old fashioned with a decent bourbon and it came out looking like a cheap well drink with chipped ice. No large rock of ice, no orange peel. If you charge premium prices for drinks, and especially if you call yourself Bourbon & Bones, you have to nail the classics and bring some style to your cocktails. One other minor complaint. Even though it's a well designed restaurant with a nice modern look, if you're seated next to the bar it feels more like you're sitting in the bar. There's no buffer zone and it was difficult to have dinner conversation. Relatively new place and I may try it again after they work out a few kinks."}
{"text":"Average. For the price you can get a better meal at City Hall Grill.  Service fell short.  Food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Nice place, but the hostess girls are extremely rude! Staff is caught up in only serving people that look like they have money. I would say pass it up and head to city hall or steak 44."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Great food and drink options especially for happy hour. The service was so-so but was a unique experience. Recommend if you want great ambience and good food!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, basic atmosphere, junior league service, mediocre food. Expect a semi-hip Outback Steakhouse-like experience with $49 filets. If you're in Old Town and want a legitimate steak dinner, City Hall is three blocks away. Same prices, part of Maestro's, and the atmosphere, service, and food quality will meet your expectations."}
{"text":"Ah. Fn. Mazing. Best steak I have EVER had. I'm so full and happy, I cannot finish this review. Very expensive but worth every cent."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 5 on a Friday around 6:30pm. There was no one on the dining side which was great.  We all ordered some bones and bourbon.. A lot of bourbon... I got the filet mignon rare and it came out perfect. The sides were a little small for the bigger guys but the steak filled me up. They bring out a selection of knives in a wooden box and let you choose one which is a nice touch.  The only mistake they made was when I ordered a drink neat and it came out on the rocks. They fixed it quickly with no extra charge.  The waitresses there were smoking hot and had classy/sexy outfits on but they only stayed on the bar side.. They should at least let them do drink orders on the dining end which = more drinks + higher tips.  We had a very good time overall and would come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best hands down!!! Great food great staff great Bourbon. 5 stars and if there were 6 I  would give it 6. The steak was amazing and desert was beyond phenomenal."}
{"text":"Nothing special steak  was over cooked I expected more for the money I spent good selection of bourbon not worth the money"}
{"text":"Took my (chef) husband here for our first anniversary as we were both excited to try it. Great atmosphere from The start and the cocktails were on point. We  were loving the tuna tartare appetizer, but was immediately disappointed when my husbands supposed to be mid rare steak came out mid well.  For a man(my husband) who cooks steaks to proper temp all day long at a high end resort, we were disappointed to come to a specialty steakhouse, pay a hefty price for a steak, and have it not  be to temp.   The waiter was great- came over and agreed that my husbands steak was overcooked and told us a new one would be out shortly.  What turned the evening sour, was when the \"manager\" came over and asked to see my husbands steak. We showed the manager without hesitation the steak, and the manger replies \"well it looks pretty rare to me, you sure you want to have one re-cooked more rare?\"  Being in the culinary industry for more than 8 years, it shocked my husband that he was getting a little push back on sending his food back from the manager rather than a apology, not to mention, once the new properly cooked steak arrived at our table, the manager never came back to us to ask how everything was.  In the end, the food was a little over priced for what you got quality wise(in our opinion). Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"No way can I take a star away from here. Nice ambience but not over the top. Service was attentive and polite but not overwhelming. The bourbon selection is amazing and the BNB Manhattan was one of the best I've had. The filets were excellent and done perfectly. Everything is a la cart so we had the Brussels sprouts and Mac n cheese- both extremely good. Maybe when I win the lottery I'll order the $35k Cristal dinner! Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Caution, bad business practices. I ordered the bone in ribeye for $49. 5 minutes later the bartender informed me that they are transitioning to a new meat supplier and my ribeye would now be $60. I'm sorry but that's their problem not the customers. Either print new menus or take the hit in food costs. For the record the steak was fantastic, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"No  Had two drinks and three apps and that was enough...and we didn't finish anything, we couldn't...too awful.   I had a Fizzing Flower...prosecco was flat. Fail.  He had a whiskey sour, $18 dollar fail.   We tried: Grey tartare with an already broken yolk. Ew.  Octopus and squid, the octopus was the only passable item.  Oysters...can't mess those up, right? Unless they happened to incorrectly shucked...don't worry, they were.   The manager called me after and offered to do a redo of our meal. I couldn't. Even for free...I'd pass.    Bourbon and Bones, Crab and Mermaid and Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers...all terrible...all in a row. Just stay away."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. I live in Chicago and this restaurant could hold its own in Chicago. And the steak knife selection, perhaps slightly gimmicky, was thoroughly well presented and entertaining."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Food portions huge and perfectly seasoned. Don't expect to find salt and pepper on your table you won't need it! Our waitress ordered deserts to celebrate my graduation she was on point I wished I knew her name.  She  was training and her trainee was great!!!Thank you B& B"}
{"text":"The drinks here were SO good. All the fruit and ingredients in the drinks were fresh and so yummy. We went right before closing and the host and waiters were so friendly still and made sure we could get a few quick drinks in. I would recommend the east coast sour!"}
{"text":"Filet mignon was ok, not more not less. Had hoped for more of a 'wow this Arizona meat!' experience.  Service was very professional, prompt and friendly. Brussels sprout for side very tasty.   What brings this down to 3 stars or even less for me is the noise level - too loud to have a decent conversation. At a place were I quickly pay close to $100 per person,  I find it ridiculous having to yell all the time and ask my partner 'sorry can you repeat that?'. It's not a pub or bar after all."}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked that this place has received so many bad reviews. I can't speak to other peoples' experiences here, but ours was Perfection.   I'm from the midwest, grew up in Nebraska & Iowa. They basically raise you on steak dinners there. And my filet mignon from Bourbon & Bones was - hands down - the single best steak I have ever had in my life. It can't get better than this. Perfectly cooked at medium rare +. The side dishes were great. My fiance is a vegetarian and they made a special meal just for her, that was also amazing.   Everything from our Old Fashioneds to the excellent wait service, I will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a great meal here. We came in around 5:30pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. I guess it picks up more around 7-8, which makes sense, but definitely would come back much later if we returned. Noted.   Upon arrival, there is complementary valet which is super convenient. There is also a parking garage behind the building as well. The valet guy was super friendly.   When we walked in it was a bit awkward... a bunch of the wait staff was just kind of standing by the hostess stand staring. I get it wasn't busy yet and clearly we came a bit too early but it was a weird initial vibe. The hostess seemed in a horrible mood too, so as we sat down we had a bad taste in our mouth and were worried it was going to be a disastrous meal.   Luckily, our waitress came over and immediately turned it around! She was friendly, went over the menu, had great recommendations and checked in just enough. Not too much but she was still around. The guys assisting with refills and clearing plates were attentive and friendly as well.   They have an extensive bourbon list (duh!) as well as a good wine selection and other various cocktails. I just went with a glass of wine since I'm not a huge bourbon drinker. It was good.   They bring you a bread basket with some pretzel bread and traditional white bread. We also started with the grilled octopus, which I really enjoyed. It had good flavor but wasn't overwhelming and was the perfect starter.   After clearing our appetizer, they brought over a box of steak knives and let you select which kind of knife you want. I thought it was a fun concept and a cool touch.   We both ordered the filet, I ordered the 6oz with a side of chimichurri sauce, and my girlfriend ordered the 10oz. We decided to split a side of Mac n cheese as well.   Both of our steaks were cooked as requested and were delicious. I got the chimichurri sauce at the recommendation of our waitress and it was amazing.. it has a bit of a kick to it but it wasn't too spicy. It was awesome. My girlfriend enjoyed her steak plain as well.   The Mac n cheese was more than enough to split between the two of us. It was super creamy and had a milder cheese flavor. I was a big fan. They even scooped out the first serving into our plates for us when they delivered the meal. Nice touch.   After the meal, we did peruse the dessert menu and there were some interesting selections but we were just too full.   The overall building is nice, the bathrooms were sparking clean, and I liked the ambiance. Comfortable seating, part industrial, part pub, it was modern and trendy.   In the end, the food was delicious, it was a bit pricey but it's steak in old town Scottsdale so it's to be expected. I'd recommend if you are looking for a nicer meal and in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to grab a drink and an appetizer. It has an awesome atmosphere and good vibes, with that said, I wouldn't recommend it for dinner..   I feel as if the main course was mediocre and way overpriced, my husband and I shared the filet and mash potatoes, it wasn't anything special. As for the drinks, I started off with the bucking(something) but had to send it back because it was way to strong so I decided to go with wine, which was great. My husband went with their signature manhattan and he said it was wonderful. We had the hot stone waygu for an appetizer and it was amazing. Overall I think the place was over priced...but would go back for drinks because it has a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This my my new favorite restaurant. Great food the service was ridiculous I definitely recommend checking this place out I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Well this was my first visit after living approximately 8 minutes away and I can honestly say the service and food was phenomenal!! Our server Anna was beyond superb with her kindness and great recommendations, she was so welcoming and very accommodating to our group of 5 for my mothers birthday. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the bar area for cocktails and apps and the very intimate scenery they have to offer, thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"New steak house in old town!  It was packed the music was loud so everyone had to talk loud - not the place to go for a quiet dinner. Service was great - made a lot of recommendations on food and drinks - loved that you can pick your own knife!  Some hiccups on our food order but everything tasted great. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Great steak. We ordered the hash browns as a side and thought they were fantastic. Loved the wine on tap. Open air seating. We would absolutely return!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed Bourbon & Bones for New Year's Eve. Reservations made in advance at 8pm, later confirmed,  and we were sat promptly upon arrival. They had a NYE prefix menu for $110 per person, but we chose to order off the menu. We had a good night and enjoyed the food/dinner. Bourbon & Bones was a good choice for what we wanted, and it delivered good food. But there is no doubt, the noise level is high, so be prepared.  Drinks, well made and enjoyed. Nice wine list, and my 1000 Stories Zinfandel went well with my steak. Food, was very good, cooked perfectly and flavorful. We had the filet & NY strip, then sides of mac&cheese and creamed spinach. Both sides also very good; actually the M&C was fantastic.Then we had dessert to finish the evening. All of our food was served hot and cooked perfectly.  Service, was average, and acceptable. Ashley had a pleasant attitude and was friendly. We did appreciate that the manager was visible, moving about the dining room, checking on tables.  We appreciated what was offered, and felt Bourbon & Bones lived up to our expectations. Would revisit and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Well the menu looks amazing so we were so excited. Ordered some great cocktails off their em us. Did the shrimp cocktail, it was hard to bite into and not fresh. $7 a piece? I ordered the ribs with duck fat fries. Ribs were far from fall off the bone and fries were just average. So disappointing. Probably never have had to chew so hard on ribs, and I've eaten a lot of ribs. Sauce was good but come on. Your name is bourbon and bones, cook your ribs longer. My husband got the veal chop and Brussels sprouts. Not tender or juicy. Another over priced scottsdale restaurant that does not deliver. Giving it three stars because of the ambiance, service and cocktails. If rating based on food it would've been two."}
{"text":"As far as a fine cut of meat goes, count on this place.  My good friend was visiting from Chicago and said she wanted to dine at an upscale restaurant where we could enjoy a good steak and bottle of wine. This place nailed it, with a packed house during Restaurant Week on a Friday night to boot!  The service was impeccable. Within moments of sitting down we had a gentleman greeting us and asking for our drink choices. From then until we finished our meal and left, the staff worked nonstop to make sure every table in the restaurant was taken care of at all times with drinks, bread, and water.   The food came out, perfectly timed. For RW, they had a 3 course meal option. My friend and I both chose the caesar salad, Petite Filet with mashed potatoes and sautéed corn, cheesecake for dessert. It was simple in presentation but the flavor was out of this world on ALL fronts. I asked for medium rare and got exactly that. This steak was juicy, each bite was incredible!  Unique touch allowing patrons to select their own steak knife.   Can't forget to mention the killer high tops with the open-window seating looking at Scottsdale Rd. If you're looking for a fun Friday night date spot or Girls Night Out, check this place out."}
{"text":"B&B was simply perfect!  We came in with a large party and were well taken care of. Great food, great atmosphere and management that honestly cared about the restaurant!  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had only been here for cocktails a few times, but wanted to try dinner.  After reading a few negative reviews, I was hesitant but still decided to go. Well, it was nothing less than perfect! My date and I ate dinner at the bar and was served beautifully by Justin, bartender/waiter par excellence! He had a great personality, provided fabulous suggestions and was truly a joy.  He knows is stuff!  The shrimp cocktail is to die for....big, juicy and perfectly prepared chilled HUGE shrimp with a cocktail sauce that had the perfect amount of kick.  The bone in filet was gorgeous....medium rare and divine. The brownie dessert was amazing, although I was hesitant because he said it had toffee in the center....but delicious and every bit was eaten!  Yes, it is pricey....but what good steakhouse in the valley isn't?   Go. You will be very happy!"}
{"text":"To sum it up....this place was good, not great.  Our server was good and they gain a lot of points, because they always kept my water cup filled.  The steak was good, but nothing that memorable.  I've had better at other places.  Their mac n cheese was my favorite part of the dinner.....that was tasty.   I don't feel that the quality matches the cost.  I'm all about paying a little more for great food, but I don't feel the food here was.  I'm glad I tried it out, it wasn't that I disliked it, but there are so many other places to dine at that I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and service was excellent, but that is where the positives end.  Pedestrian Caesar's Salad that was literally tasteless combined with a $49 BoneIn Ribeye that was overcooked and simply not the quality of meat I expected.   Reminds me of their sister restaurant down the street; Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.  Slick, well run restaurant with great service and average food.  Mgt. needs to make some serious changes in the kitchen at B&B or I wouldn't give the place more than a year before going out of business.  I will not go back.  Too many other choices in town!"}
{"text":"First of all the service was spot on....very attentive, helpful and efficient.  The menu is incredibly appealing,  as well as the cool and inviting decor; but for the prices, the place is way too loud and crowded.  The servers are bumping into tables trying to serve guests and guest have to squeeze by other diners to walk either to your table or to the restrooms.  This would all be acceptable if the price point was lower.....but for fine dining prices (as well as an EPIC Cristal dinner listed for 35,000..seriously) you want more comfort and peace of mind.  We were a group of 10 that sat in the private dining room and we could not hear each other while talking to each other.....even if you yelled to each other it was hard to hear.  The private dining room table was ridiculously large, so sharing side dishes was a process of sliding( really sling-shotting) the plates across the granite table top. Lastly, the portions (again for the price) were too small and skippy.  The side dishes should give you the appearance of value for price.  I think Bourbon and Bones has an identity crisis....they want to be a Maestros, City Hall, Dominicks etc but want to appeal to a hipper, downtown Scottsdale crowd.........they should either lower their prices or remove a few tables and work on their acoustics."}
{"text":"What a score finding this place! We were struggling with finding a good steak but didn't want to go to one of the typical places, this place delivered the steak but in a much more fun and cool and friendly atmosphere. The food was outstanding and we both got the bone in filet and New York steak that was fantastic. It was a bit overcooked so I would go down a rarity if you're looking for something more on the rare side Medium was more like medium well.. The sides are great and I emphasize the cauliflower was amazing The bourbon selection at the end was a highlight with the great ice balls and killer selection. I could use better wines by the glass but it was still nothing to worry about. Bartenders are great. Fun and open environment on  a warm night. Loved it.."}
{"text":"Went here with a total of 6 people. It's a pricey spot.   Wait staff was very friendly, and tended to our needs as a group very well.   Appetizers that we had was the beef carpaccio, wagyu beef, and fried calamari. All excellent. Calamari was tender, not rubbery. The wagyu came with a hot rock for cooking. Presentation for all was good.  For dinner I ordered the Colorado lamb. Large lamb chops which was surprising. Others ordered ribeye and I believe NY strip. These cuts looked amazing.     This is a solid spot to try. Could be a little less pricey. I've been in restaurants of same food presentation and quality and spent less as a group."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Old Town needed. This place has it all from wet aged to dry aged meats. I have had both the Bone in Ribeye and the Dry Aged pork chop and they are out of this world!  The cocktails and wine list will compete with any ones in the Valley. Their Bourbon & Whiskey list is unprecedented with almost 200 selections.   The atmosphere is very energetic and upbeat. The decor is what separates this from any traditional steak house in the valley. The take reservations which is great, because on the weekends this place is packed.   As for Desserts go with the Butter Cake! They add peaches, toasted pecans and an bourbon glaze...do I need to say anything else!"}
{"text":"Came in on Friday feb 16 and had a wonderful time. Hillary was so sweet and took great care of me and my boyfriend. We started with the truffled stuffed mushrooms which were phenomenal. I got a filet and my boyfriend had a ny strip, both of which were cooked perfectly! Thank you for the excellent food and experience!"}
{"text":"3 of us went tonight for the first time. They definitely have a very nice selection of spirits and wine. Will not go wrong there. Had drinks at the bar before going to table and the bartender was prompt, and courteous. Wine, Woodford neat, and a dirty martini were ordered. Good pours. For the food we started out with their shrimp cocktail. This was really good. Very good size pieces, nice and cold, and cocktail sauce came with additional horseradish to add more kick to it. Would definitely recommend. They also provide complimentary pieces of thick cut candied bacon (had at bar before table) and warm bread prior to main dishes (at table), both were very good and are nice beforehand. The server did a good job of explaining the menu in detail. She also was quick with drinks and water was re-filled in a fast manner throughout. For dinner we did a 10oz Filet, and their bone in New York. The other guest ordered a crab seafood plate, and their tomato/mozzarella/balsamic plate. He said both were good. Both steaks ordered medium rare. The Filet was perfect, however, the NY seemed slightly above that. Im not one for complaining, as it was still very flavorful. They also brought out a variety of steak knives for you to pick your preference to cut with. For the sides we did a loaded baked potato and their regular Mac and cheese. Both were great, and everything came out on hot plates. Dessert was the apple crumble dish with ice cream this was excellent. Two of us ordered coffee afterwards and came out hot and prompt with all fix-ins. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because in my personal opinion, I feel if I had to choose between B&B and Steak 44, or if someone was new to AZ and asked for a steak house recommendation, for me, it's Steak 44. This is a good restaurant though. I don't want anyone to think 4 stars is a bad thing by any means. It is 4.5, just not an option on Yelp. I tried to put as much detail in my review as possible. I took some time to read through others reviews before coming tonight, and I don't think some of the bad ones are that factual. I feel some people took it to the extreme and a lot of comments just didn't seem accurate based on our experience. The service was very good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for Great Steak Seafood Bourbon and craft cocktails. I've been here a few times. Excellent fun eclectic outgoing crowd with a very friendly helpful staff that has a great knowledge of the restaurant spirits and food served. If you're looking for a fun casually upscale restaurant with great drinks service and atmosphere this is your spot. Definitely come by grab a drink and some food. Plus they have a happy hour Monday through Friday from 4 to 6. Excellent specials."}
{"text":"Good service, pretty good  food, awesome wine selection. Establishment is pretty small, complementary valet parking."}
{"text":"I am from Boston, and have tried every relevant steak restaurant in town (both Smith & Wollenskies, Grill 23, Moo, Ruth's Chris, Del Frisco's, Morton's, and a few others); Bourbon & Bones served me the best bone-in ribeye I have ever had, and the filet I tried from a friend was equally phenomenal.  Service was great, as we had a loud group of friends, but Madeline kept us organized and did a great job with recommendations.  Must visit if you are looking for top quality steak in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Walked by on Saturday night, looked like great ambience and decided to eat there. Sat at the bar, amazing service, i don't eat meat or drink whiskey and found great options! the go green drink (gin) was perfect, food fantastic as well, such as the asparagus and the stuffed truffle mushrooms! Crowd is 35+ years old. Music was great and beautiful place ! Great overall experience. Will go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in late one night for dessert on a date! I can't wait to come back for dinner one day. They have a great wine selection and obviously a lot of bourbon. Their dessert was good. We had cheesecake and creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"It's been a while, but this review is very much deserved.  Let's get started, staff and service was good, food was awful.  Complimentary bacon, fantastic, best food on the menu that's not on the menu! +$0  Octopus, presentation was a bunch of undercooked calamari pieces in a white bowl with onions that look the same, chewy, salty. -$22  Cauliflower, decent. It was a side, $8 yay for health.  Bourbon Pecan Buttercake, presentation, shit on a plate, the ice cream on top was fantastic. Pieces of pecan would've look better if individually placed one by one on the ice cream. $10.  Glass of Prisoner wine, $27. Very expensive glass but it was good!! Friendly female bartender offered another glass but I wanted to keep my thoughts to my self.   Last but not least, mixed, unorganized order but yeah stay along..  WAGYU New York Strip, - - - - - negative negative -$49 for 8 oz. okay seemed a little too good to be true, maybe I misunderstood what WAGYU is but I've never had bad WAGYU, this was a bad steak and worst WAGYU, I should've asked for the meats paperwork, it's name, origin and everything I felt like I got scammed! Can they legally call a steak wagyu if it's not wagyu, idfk but god awful.   Anyways this isn't directed towards the staff because it ain't your fault sweet child of mine. Maybe Chef, maybe chef received bad quality produce. Who knows.   I came here two years ago, thought it was trash, reconfirmed it's trash.  Please don't place a hit on me due to an honest review!"}
{"text":"TOP 5 MEALS I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! My boyfriend and I are big steak lovers! While on vacation, I was on the hunt for the perfect \"nice\" dinner. This was a GREAT find!! The staff, especially our server (shout out to Tina) was amazing and friendly from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out.  Tina was very knowledgeable and helpful with guiding us through the VERY extensive whiskey/boubon and wine list. (So many choices!) The ribeye was to die for! So tender and juicy! We tried the house steak sauce and the chimichurri. They were both delicious! I highly recommend the brussel sprouts, truffled mashed potatoes, and truffle mushrooms! The banter we had with Tina throughout the meal was awesome! It's great to find a steakhouse that isn't snobby and pretentious. The atmosphere was trendy, welcoming, and \"casual\". Money well spent! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this spot that recently opened I was pretty excited and looked it up on Yelp, of course. After reading the reviews and looking at the menu, I wasn't super impressed and wasn't planning to come here. One of my friends booked his bday dinner here so I decided to come with an open mind and give it a real shot.  Nice ambiance and decor especially since we had a group of 8 and were able to reserve the back, private room for our dinner. Service was just ok. Waitress was sweet and had a great attitude but she repeatedly forgot things. I had to ask at least twice for each little thing I wanted (salt and pepper, lemons, etc.). She also completely mixed up our bills. I will say she knew the menu inside and out but maybe writing things down might have helped her remember everything.   In terms of food, they ran out of scallops which was a big bummer so I had to create my own seafood platter out of the appetizer sampler. All of those options are served cold so it just wasn't as great as I had wished. My husband did not care for his lamb chops at all. The flavor wasn't great. Also, prices are HIGH -- especially for what you get. Everything and I mean everything is a la carte, including sauces and sides. The sides were family style and they were a pretty good size, but again, the taste just wasn't amazing to me -- and I tried several different ones.  Nice place in terms of decor but I don't feel inclined to return. Service and food flavors could be better and for that price point, there are just so many other amazing, better options in the area."}
