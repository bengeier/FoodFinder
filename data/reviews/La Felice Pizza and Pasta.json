{"text":"So pizza places are a dime a dozen here in Pittsburgh. When I order from a place that's new to me, I expect the experience to be satisfactory at least. This place was well below the satisfactory bar. We ordered half a steak hoagie, chicken Caesar salad, mozzarella sticks, and a 2 liter. The food did come fast, but when we checked our order it was disappointing. My hoagie looked awful and the toppings were scarce. My wife's salad had old lettuce and extra toppings on it that did not state on the menu. The marinara cup that came with the mozzarella sticks was less than half full. The 2 liter was a 20oz bottle. Then my wife told me that the delivery driver made a inappropriate comment to her. So I called to resolve the multiple errors with our order. The man who answered the phone just said hello, no name of the company. I had to ask if it was LA Felice. They said the would fix it. Then when the delivery driver called when he arrived again, he said another inappropriate thing to my wife. Needless to say this place is a joke. Their food was awful, and they are extremely unprofessional. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. I know I will going forward."}
{"text":"RUDE. Don't get delivery from them. They're drivers don't have GPS's for some reason even though it's 2015. I had a driver call me to get directions, couldn't understand him at all and while trying to give him directions he hung up on me. Someone else called me back and he also hung up on me. I gave them 2 stars because they're food is good (except the wings) despite their terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The homemade appetizers are wonderful; we especially love the pizza rolls.  The Buffalo Chicken pizza is a favorite and their regular sauce is always good.  I've never eaten in the restaurant, so I can't comment on the service there, but delivery has always been good to us. Their online ordering is convenient and a deal because you get free breadsticks for a $20 order.  We had an issue with it once and the management took care of it right away, which is something I can't say about other pizza places in the area that I've since stopped ordering.  Their delivery has always been fast for us; I've probably ordered 15 times here."}
{"text":"Their food has always been consistent, but I have noticed a decline in their delivery people. I ordered this evening, and when I received a call that my food he said that he couldn't find me. We recently moved down the street, and I had forgotten to update my information online, so that confusion was my fault. But when I tried to explain to him my new address, he didn't understand me. At all. We eventually understood each other, but it caused far more frustration than necessary."}
{"text":"I work in the area and I always read reviews before I try a new place.  Even though the reviews were split on La Felice, I decided to try it out because their prices were extremely reasonable and because of the convenience of online ordering.

I placed an order for pick up as I was leaving work and the pizza was ready by the time I arrived 10 min later.  I planned to take it home to have for dinner, but it smelled so good that I couldn't resist trying a slice on the way home.  The sauce was delicious and the cheese/sauce ratio was spot on.  The crust is thin and chewy... I like mine a little crispier so I used my pizza stone to reheat the slices later that night- fantastic!

And the true test of a good pizza- can you eat it cold for breakfast the next day?  Ayup!  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, people were great.  The buffalo chicken wrap was to die for. Definitely will go back a few more times to say the least."}
{"text":"Love there buffalo chx pizza. Best in Pittsburgh! They are very quick. Only take like 15-20 minutes to get the order"}
{"text":"So Good!!! Called 20 minutes before closing time! They where more than happy to take my order & deliver it. Always so nice! Delivery guy is so sweet! I would say the Spinach & feta wedge was up there with the best I've ever had! And their breadsticks are by far the best we have ever had. Thank You.. Especially for being open so late on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Went to this little family owned restaurant for the second time tonight because I have some coupons for it.

The food is pretty awesome.  I got a 16\" Hawaiian pizza and are four of the twelve slices there, and since getting home I have already eaten two more.

Boyfriend got the tuna hoagie and really liked it as well.  

The only thing I dislike about the place is that all of the drinks are bottles and cans.  Oh well.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends got their wings because they are open late. So bad. Worse than their pizza."}
{"text":"I have not found any food from La Felice that I do not like. Their pizza is excellent and their appetizers are so good! We order drom them a lot and friends from out of town ask for it when they visit now. The staff there are friendly and always get our order right. Fast and efficient delivery as well, they always say 45 minutes but always deliver within 30. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got an XL pizza from here: half hawaiian and half pepperoni.  It was pretty big for the price and fed 3 people easily.  It's nothing crazy but it satisfied the cravings.  The best part was probably the pepperoni, it was those smaller ones that curl up when you cook them."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious!  Order here once/week..quality food, fast delivery, and delicious!  Prices are great for the quantity/quality of meals!!!  Will definitely continue to order!"}
{"text":"This is best Italian dinner delivery in North Hills. The food is delicious without a high price tag. I ordered Tuscany chicken pasta, just the right combination of chicken, artichoke hearts, my favorite, roast red peppers and spinach, another favorite, served over pasta with garlic butter!! 
Wow, Yes,  I ate the whole dinner and carved for more, check this out if your tired of pizza and wings for dinner, Oh they have that too on a hugh menu, the Tuscany chicken salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, reasonable prices, food is made quick delivery is really quick.  Tastes great we've had hoagies and pizza.  This is a really great business."}
{"text":"The bread sticks are soft, large and fabulous! The pizza has a nice thick crust and the sauce is just right! The shop has a small, cozy  eat in area too! I have found my new favorite north hills pizza shop!"}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, these guys knock it out of the park. The crust is foldable and chewy, the sauce has a great zesty flavor, and they use just the right amount of cheese, it's not heaped on by the handful. Their pizza comes with a side of homemade ranch which is killer. I also tried the hot wings; they were light on the sauce, but still had great flavor. A medium three topping pizza and 6 wings set me back $21 and were delivered in about 20 minutes. La Falice just made its way on to my short list of go-to pizza joints."}
{"text":"Ok, I used to order form this place all the time.  Love their food, and I had put up with the poor service because of it.  Until tonight.  The driver had trouble finding my place, probably for the 5th time or so, and I got upset on the phone trying to help them find my place.  I finally got my food, then about 45 minutes later, I started getting multiple threatening and explicit phone calls from someone at the restaurant.  If the phone calls don't stop I'm considering calling the police.  Order at your own risk, just understand the type of people you're dealing with if you do."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. WORST PIZZA in the North Hills area,hands down. I have definitely never felt more ripped off from a pizza joint. I ordered a large two topping pizza. When it was delivered, it was ice cold. Keep in mind I am 4 miles from the Ross location. Totally unacceptable. The worst part was not only the pizza was ice cold but the toppings were not even attached to the pizza!!! They were falling off all over the place because they didn't add the toppings originally when they made my pizza. Instead they took a cheese pizza that was ordered previously by someone else and just threw raw toppings on top. This was my first time ordering from them and definitely my LAST.  La Felice you really know how to screw up the easiest dish in the world. My best pizza experiences have been at Bellisarios and Supremos Pizza! Check out those two places and don't make the same mistake I did going to this garbage place."}
{"text":"Placed an order online..when the order got here it was 4 dollars more then what it said online..and the delivery was 10 minutes late..lets talk about the food...the Sicilian pizza tasted like cardboard..i mean everything was cooked ok but it had absolutely no flavor..i also ordered buffalo chips (fries) everyone was rock hard.
I also. Ordered a haogie that was pretty good..it was a pretty good hoagie.. if as a last resort i order from there again it will just be a hoagie..unless im brave enough to try something else"}
{"text":"Always great service whether it's take-out or delivery. Pizza is good and prices are even better. New go to pizza joint"}
{"text":"I gave it to my dogs    See photos 

Worst pizza in my life.  Thin burnt pepperoni , smelly dark sausage 

Nobody at home liked this crap 

Spongy crust was nothing like Sicilian is supposed to be

I should have gone to Luciano's! Or Italian oven. Or even Pizza Hut"}
{"text":"The best part was the fries, they had a great crispiness to it. The price was good bc of the deals they offered. The bread sticks were average. The pizza is a solid three star, but you can not mess up pizza. I can pick four better pizza places. The toppings I ordered were really lacking. For almost $2 dollars a topping I expected my pizza to have toppings in the middle of the pizza, but it was nothing but cheese. The toppings that was on there was very minimal.  The gyro had frozen meat just thawed out on it. It was the texture of seitan I am assuming bc it has high amounts of filler in it. The chicken wings were fine, but once again the BBQ was cheap out of the bottle."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and appetizers. The sauce is always excellent. It's never too sweet or too spicy. The ranch dressing included is excellent for dipping the crust in. The appetizer sampler gives a good taste of the choices."}
{"text":"We ordered on a Friday night. Order arrived on time about half an hour. Food delicious. We ordered an extra cheese pizza with their homemade marinara sauce cheesy breadsticks popcorn chicken and a Caesar salad. Cost about $31. Will definitely order again. Family pretty fussy about pizza. This place pleased all of us!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak hoagie and hot wings. The hoagie was ok, but nothing you couldn't get at any other pizza place. The hot wings would have been really good as the hot sauce was great, but there was next to no sauce on the wings (see my pic). It looks like they took the wings out of the fryer, put them right into the to go container, and just used a squeeze bottle to drizzle tje sauce on. One wing was compmety sauceless. It isn't that hard to put the wings in a bowl and actually toss them in the sauce.  I won't be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"We gave up meat for lent, so keeping in mind that we didn't order anything with meat...

This place was really good, and I'm looking forward to going back when I can order meat-filled items!  

We got cheesy bread sticks, a seafood calzone, and a caprese salad.  The breadsticks were pretty good.  The seafood calzone was weird...but...well...no meat, so we wouldn't have normally gotten that.  The caprese salad was a standard salad.  Not much to say.  They have house ranch, though, which is pretty good.  There are a bunch of coupons for this place if you look around.  I think we may have found one of our go-to pizza places :-)"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesday's in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Le Felice was one of them.  Whenever I called the restaurant and placed the order for a large cheese pizza, I was asked if I had any coupons.  I responded that I did have an ad in my hands but could not locate any coupons on it that I could use.  He then told me to bring it in and he could see if there was anything I could use.  About 45 minutes later (I was told 15 minutes but it took me awhile to get there) I arrived at the restaurant ready to pick up my pizza.  The inside of the restaurant is decent looking with the pickup counter and kitchen right in front of you whenever you walk in with a dining room off to the right.  Whenever I explained to the guy behind the counter that I had the ad but no coupon on it, he decided to give me the Large take-out special (ironically this new ad would come in the mail the next evening) which I was thankful for. As for the pizza itself it was a fairly thin crust with more cheese than sauce.  The sauce was also a little sweet but not too sweet which was nice and the cheese on the pizza was good as well.  Overall, it was a solid pizza and while not being my favorite of the three that I tried that night, it was the one that we ate the most of.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop back here again in the future.  I really liked the customer service that I received and the pizza itself was pretty good so it may be a change of pace pizza place for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly service!!! The food is always on time, hot and delicious! Would highly recommend this place if you live in North hills!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch. Love that I can order online and not have to call. They have a great menu with variety. I opted for a small cheese lovers and a garden salad with cheese. came out to $24 with tip.

They are very generous with the cheese on pizza and salad (I love cheese so this is great!) pizza smells and tastes delicious. The crust is a little thick for my liking (I like it thinner like New York style). The salad had fresh greens in it.. Not big chucks of gross lettuce.

Overall good experience. 

My only compliant was the delivery driver knocked on my door one time and was walking back to his car when I got to the door like I was taking too long for him. I answered the door as soon as I heard him, but oh well."}
{"text":"All things considered, La Felice is an OK place to eat. 

I ordered a chicken burger, soda, and an order of sugar balls because I had no clue what they were and figured, worst case scenario I can give them to someone else at work.

What I liked: The convenience of ordering online, the chicken burger was crispy and the bun toasted. It looked appetizing. The fries were yummy and perfectly made. 

What I disliked: Despite specifying that I did not want pickles, I received my burger with 6 sliced pickles underneath it. Because pickles are wet and the burger had a bun, the whole bottom was saturated in sour grossness. It took away from the otherwise tasty sandwich. As for the sugar balls, they were just kind of fried bread with a pinch of powdered sugar over them (seriously not enough for one ball, let alone the 20+ that were in there). The chocolate sauce they served it with was warm Hershey's syrup. I guess I just expected something with a little more effort. 

Decide for yourselves. I don't like saying a place is bad- it could always have been an off day or something- but I do think my order was put together carelessly, and to me, that is a red flag. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent. It has been too greasy on some occasions though. Delivery is usually prompt and they always get the order correct. In the past, drivers have not always been prompt and the food has arrived cold, which, combined with the overwhelming grease at times, is why I give three stars. The portions are average as compared to other places."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty solid, but they have the BEST buffalo chicken wrap I've ever eaten. I love hot sauce and get buffalo chicken quite often. This one here is absolute perfection. Tender, grilled chicken with a unique (very spicy) hot sauce, onions, lettuce and ranch dressing. Phenomenal. Have the ability to order online and any order over $20 gets you a FREE order of breadsticks. I've never gotten anything here that wasn't good. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered from here quite regularly. Because the food was good. One night we had company and placed a 60$ dollar order and the food was undercooked and the wings were raw. We called back and complained naturally and they said all they could do is give us a discount off our next order. We waited about a month and called them back. Pizza and wings 10 bucks! Great (what we had thought). That night she was vomiting and into the next day I couldn't stay out of the bathroom. Coincidence I think not!!!!!"}
{"text":"False Advertising!  Be warned that what you see on their website isn't necessary what you are going to get.  I ordered the Hot Sausage Sub.  On their website, they had an image of a big juicy sausage link.  When the sub came, it contained a handful of pizza topping crumbled sausage, and it was simply awful."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the north hills area. The sauce has a different (sweet) taste to it, which is refreshing and very good."}
{"text":"Placed pick up order on a Friday night. We had the cheese lovers pizza which includes five or so different cheeses as well as the chicken salad. The pizza was delicious, still piping hot once I had made it back home. The chicken salad was top notch as well. All the vegetables were fresh and crispy. Being from NY, I have high expectations when it comes to pizza and I am always skeptical when trying a new place. So glad we did.  The service was great too. Upon my arrival, a delivery driver who had just got back from a delivery greeted me in the parking lot and held the door open for me. These folks understand good customer service and quality food. We are truly excited to have discovered them and will definitely be back again soon. A big thanks to the other yelpers for their reviews as this is why we chose them to try out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for their $5.99 half hoagie and fries lunch special. For the price paid, the portion was huge. Ordered the buffalo chicken hoagie and it was excellent... I would highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"This was our first time to try La Felice Pizzeria, and we definitely were impressed! We ordered (delivery) a meat lover's pizza and bread sticks, and everything was great. I think this was the first time I ever had salami, bologna, etc. on a pizza. Fantastic! We definitely will savor La Felice pizza again, the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"They are a hidden gem on a boulevard containing many pizzerias and restaurants. Stop by to enjoy terrific food or order and have it delivered quickly while it's still piping hot! My favorite is the breaded cauliflower but my husband's is the pizza, \"any pizza, they're all good!\" Free delivery after $10. Nearly nightly I see their driver on his way to deliver to someone in my plan.  Plus, every time they deliver you get more coupons. Why keep reading reviews? Give them a try!"}
