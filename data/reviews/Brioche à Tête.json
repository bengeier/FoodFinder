{"text":"Nicest people around and awesome coffee and pastries! It is a real hidden gem and people should know about this place because they really deserve it."}
{"text":"If great coffee and perfect croissants served by handsome, smiling men is not your thing, then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Hidden gem alert! My number 1 spot to get  brioche in Montreal. (And I tried quite a few - like a crazy French woman roaming Montreal streets in need of her brioche fix.) Know that I'm very picky about brioche. It has to be lightly sweet, moist, buttery, dense, flavourful,with a thin golden crust and a hint of orange blossom. This hits the spot every time. This is the Traditional French brioche very similar to the ones I can find in my hometown in France. Come early as the best brioche sell out. Try the brioche a tete with chocolate chips...(drooling). Friendly Francais de France service. Easy to miss on fairmount street in mile end. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Always make sure to ask for the freshest croissants. They tend to keep their inventory for an unusually long time to cut on cost. When you buy their pastries at the right time, it's really great."}
{"text":"Very good coffee place, a little small but the owner was very friendly and, even though his English wasn't the best, he did his best to help us through our order. We had just eaten, so I can't attest to the croissant here. Would go back!"}
{"text":"La brioche à Tête!! Oh yes!! Si vous aimez les brioches, cet endroit est parfait. Cette boulangerie sert bien entendu des baguettes, pains etc... Perso, j'y vais uniquement pour les brioches. Une brioche au beurre et sucre perlée sur le dessus et un cappuccino, cela fait toute la différence. Je ne mets pas 5 étoiles tout simplement car la dernière fois que j'y suis allée, je suis arrivée en milieu d'aprem et il n'y avait déjà plus de brioches. Quelle déception! Je vous explique, je traverse la ville juste pour ces brioches. En même temps, elles sont tellement bonnes que faut faire vite."}
{"text":"Wow. Comme dans watatow! Comme dans j'suis addict et ça me prend ma brioche à tous les jours. Allez-y, c'est tout petit et sympa, ça sent bon et c'est tout simplement menoum. Et puis tout le monde parle des viennoiseries et du café, mais les quiches sont parfaites: savoureuses, pas trop denses, pas trop salées, même bébé Roméo en raffole ;)"}
{"text":"Oh my god, the almond croissant is to die for. Light, fluffy, not too overly sweet and perfect for any time of the day. My cortado was also perfectly made. The brioche is also a great option if you're looking for something else. The place is a little small so this isn't a great spot to sit down and have a conversation but nonetheless, a must go place. Try all the croissants! If you are there early, they'll come out hot and fresh. Definitely one of my favorite places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in a bakery. We just read a great review and went there, but the people didn't even say hi to us. No espressos, but the pastries look good."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best croissants we have ever had.. yes ever had!!!! Came to the neighborhood for bagels at the famous bagel shop on the same street. We went for a quick stroll to check out the area. We came by this tiny little bakery, with 2 friendly french guys working there. We have been in Montreal for 5 days and have tried many croissants this visit. But these ones looked very good and we saw the baker making another 5 trays. So why not one more. Thank goodness we did since these we perfect in every way, buttery, crispy deliciousness. We had 3 croissants and 2 kinds of brioche that were also good. But it is all about the croissants. Listen to me - it is worth the drive or walk or cab to try this place. Coffee also very good. We will be back every time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. The best almond croissant I've EVER had. Coffee is delicious and prices are reasonable. I want their bread treats everyday!"}
{"text":"AMAZING MARSHMALLOW & CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. Such a cute little place with authentic pastries. Super friendly staff and cozy vibe. Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Spotted this cozy café on the way to Fairmount.  Went in to have breakfast before heading to get the bagels; and I'm glad I did.  The coffee here is great and the pastries are excellent.  My fave is their canele.  Its crust has such a rich caramelized flavor; and the inside is so soft.  Superb service!!  This place is now on the top of my must-stop-by list when visiting Montreal!!"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé leurs petites brioche le tout avec un bon latte. 
Franchement l'endroit n'est pas très grand mais c'est tout de même tres sympa, je pense qu'il y a plus de gens qui prennent pour apporter chez eux que pour rester sur place mais c'est tout de même faisable.

L'accueil est tres sympa et souriant ce qui ne gache rien."}

Great place Best croisants and good Coffee"}
{"text":"This is my favourite croissant in Montreal.  There, I said it.

I know others will disagree, I've heard my fair share of arguments of other places that are \"better\" but it isn't going to change my mind!

Brioche a Tete have mastered the art of a croissant with a crunchy-crackly outer shell, with a soft, buttery, fluffy dough texture on the inside.

But don't stop there!  Not to be missed are the Choco-Marshmallow Cookies (just as delicious as they sound), and the Chocolatines.  As well as a host of other viennoiseries available in the display cases, yum!

They also make quiches (meat and vegetarian options available), sandwiches, and fresh coffee.  Hibiscus tea from Atigh's (Le Khaima) across the street is also available.


I know it's a little hyperbolic, but words cannot describe the perfection of the croissants here, so I won't try any further.  That being said, my conscience is torn about giving Brioche à Tête a five star review because unfortunately not every other viennoiserie is as on point.  I'm going with five nonetheless because this place is just a little slice of heaven for me.  Since I moved to Toronto, hell even before I moved I already knew they had something special, but now I definitely miss them!

Go and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently had a contract and spent a few months in Montreal. She mentioned this magical, delicious, highly addictive little bakery on Fairmont and I thought...mmmm...where? What's it called? I had never heard of it! For various reasons I was never able to make it there until...today.

Oh mon dieu!! She recommended the classic croissant. Said it was the best she'd had in the city. And she's a foodie so...today when I went in I ordered a few things to sample: croissant, chocolatine, danish (sadly they were out! next time...), \"brioche a tete\" (chouette! their signature creation) and for kicks a gluten free chocolate brownie. I ordered an espresso (most reasonable price in the neighborhood, fair trade, and DELICIOUS...so flavourful no sugar necessary!) and sat down with \"the croissant.\" ($1.50/ea)

Yes, it was crispy and buttery and divine on the outside and the interior denser but very, very good. The chocolatine was also delicious but I imagine it's best fresh out of the oven when the chocolate is warm. The brioche -  I'm not normally a fan although savoury ones I enjoy from time to time - was simple but tasty and terribly cute to look at. Not sweet, not savoury...somewhere in between. I kept thinking it would be yummy with some creme fraiche and smoked trout/capers and a roquette salad (my stomach is grumbling as I'm typing this!). The only thing that was only \"good\" was the gluten free brownie. It was a little on the dry side and could have used more chocolate. But I imagine since they are traditional bakers from France they are only beginning to experiment with gluten free recipes. 

Oh my...I just checked their facebook and they also sell \"délicieuses confitures maison.\" 
Framboises - bleuets/eau de roses - canneberges/oranges  ($5.25-7.00/ea)
Ainsi que notre fameuse tartinade de caramel au beurre salé ($5.75) 

There were also savouries on the menu - meat pies, quiche, pizzas - and other classic sweets like chocolate fondant, Paris brest etc. Highly recommend this cozy little bakery and look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Finally! Finally! Been trying to eat here for years and it finally came true! And it was worth the wait. The city considers this one of the best croissants and I agree. My second favorite in the city and killer good. Really. Now the owner, is proudest of his brioche so I had to try that too. It was excellent but we cheated and go it straight out of the oven. What a perfect breakfast morning. Enjoy"}
{"text":"As the previous reviewer Eva C wrote this is indeed a hidden gem. If you come early you will see a short line of people or a bunch of happy costumers drinking great coffee and loving every second of it. 
The made a wonderful latte and the croissant I ate was just perfect. The prices are somewhere between inexpensive and moderate but the quality as I wrote is superb. Mile end is filled with great coffee shops this one I believe is in the top 10% if you are nearby just go for it"}
