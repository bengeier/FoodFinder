{"text":"We love Renaissance Patisserie! Their butter croissant is amazing! We also like to pick up a jar of fresh made soup and a baguette. Great on a cold night!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a good bakery in town. They don't make a huge variety, but you don't really need it and it's not a cupcake/brownie place. The food is all so delicious that you won't go wrong regardless of your choice. It's a small, local establishment that takes real pride in their craft and the owner is a chef trained in France so it's very authentic."}
{"text":"A great place for French pastries! Stopped in for a croissant but ended up walking out with the croissant, an almond croissant, and a bag full of macarons. Without a doubt, the best macarons I've had here in Charlotte, barely edging out the macarons at Cafe Monte! Will definitely frequent here more to eventually try everything in the case!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here over the weekend and got a few pastries. Would definitely go back! Huge fan of the (French?) cheesecake, the chocolate brownie cake (I think it was called?), and the Napoleon. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice place but small.  I recommend for taking out as it has limited seating area.  The bread and the bakery items are great.  Careful with  the pastries as some are not too fresh (e.g,, the Napoleon my husband had was old) and they are on the expensive side.  Their coffee was not fresh so I recommend requesting espresso based drinks to ensure freshness.  Not a good place to hang out or work as space is very limited and there is no WiFi.  Overall a good place to try out but not even close to Amelie's."}
{"text":"Stopped by this new French bakery when it caught my eye coming out of the cleaners next door. Bought a baguette and some tiramisu, the baguette was by far the better of the two, it had that nice crisp but chewy texture that I look for. The tiramisu however was very disappointing, it had little coffee flavor and was much to thick. I get that tiramisu is an Italian specialty but feel that if they are going to offer it they need to reevaluate their recipe. Will stop by again but stick to more traditional French offerings."}
{"text":"Just stopped in on a whim. They mentioned they had fresh baked croissants in the back that had just come out of the oven. Absolutely perfect. My new favorite. Friendly staff and best croissants! Macaroons were great also."}
{"text":"We took my Father-in-Law here when he visited us from Indiana because he grew up in Paris and misses the great baked-goods. The owner was there and spent a good deal of time chatting with my father in law about their home country. We had an amazing baguette that was so fresh and perfectly crisp on the outside and soft and light on the inside. We also got a number of pastries and desserts to sample and one was better than the next! We were all raving about how special everything was and they are even considering going back to pick up a few things to bring back with them. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Best dessert in Charlotte! The Napoleon is out of this world!! In fact, we had one for breakfast and it was so amazing that we drove all the way back to buy another one at 3:00 pm that same day! This time we added a pecan tart. I got to talk to the French chef, who clearly knows and enjoys his craft, and he was a pleasure to talk to. I can't wait to go back (today?!) to try the apple tart, macarons, baguette, ricotta orange zest croissant, quiche, and/or the eclairs! Try this place...it's heaven!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte, hands down. I haven't had French pastries this wonderful and authentic since I was in France. I stop in at least once a week and love every trip! You simply can't go wrong with Renaissance PÃ¢tisserie."}
{"text":"Amazing spot with TO DIE FOR pastries. I just finished trying the chocolate almond croissant and the quiche lorraine and was so excited about this place that I had to write a review immediately after consumption. The atmosphere is wonderful, the staff is very helpful and friendly, and the assortment of treats (savory and sweet, best of both worlds) is superb. Their hazelnut latte was wonderful as well. Bravo, Renaissance Patisserie! 

Ps. Pro tips: their quiche slices are HUGE and only $5. Great meal to share unless you're feeling ambitious. The chocolate almond croissant was also $5 and worth every penny. The latte comes out super hot, I didn't see any coffee sleeves for the to go cups so you may need to ask or double up on some napkins."}
{"text":"Great new storefront in Specialty Shops. Love the outdoor seating and French aesthetic. Staff is helpful and friendly and there are lots of options for lunch like soups, sandwiches and salads as well as pastries of all kinds but I was in a hurry so I just wanted a hot tea. No organic choices which is disappointing since Sunflour Bakery has countless Rishi organic options. It could be a rival to the ever popular Amelie's if it ups its quality to edge it out of conventional and into the progressive category. Add some gluten free options other than macarons and this place could be really special. Check it out, worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for chocolate croissants! I've been searching for the perfect ones since I arrived here. Unfortunately no one ever reviews chocolate croissants so I had to go around trying them from different places. The chocolate croissants are pretty good, they have three batons of chocolate so there's chocolate in each bite. They're flaky and delicious! I also tried the spinach and cheese quiche that really had no flavor, no salt or spices or herbs of any kind! I also tried the cheesecake which was terrible! It tasted like nothing! And had the weirdest texture!! However they do birthday cakes so I'll keep them in mind for that!"}
{"text":"Excellent macarons! These desserts are light, flaky, just a hint of sweet flavor. I tried the vanilla and carmel macarons and they are just as delicious as other local bakeries. The fresh and sweet flavors were lovely. I also tried the almond croissant based on the Yelp reviews. The Yelp's recommended choice almond croissant is decadent delight! The almond filling was moist and sweet, with a flaky pastry surrounding. And while not fluffy dough, it was very buttery. I cannot wait to return and try more desserts!   
The south end bakery is in a shopping plaza near Monsoon thai and the dry cleaners next door to the bakery. The lot is near loads of construction so I think the parking is complex now."}
{"text":"Best bakery in Charlotte and always a fan. I had to order a cake for my in-law's anniversary, so I decided to call our favorite--Renaissance--and that was the best decision. Chocolate Mousse Cake...AMAZING. Seriously, the best cake I may have ever had."}
{"text":"The best Almond Croissant in Charlotte, hands down, and the brewed coffee is excellent too!

Usually the simple things like brewed coffee and food quality are overlooked in favor of flashy advertising and hype. With an unassuming storefront and attention to all the savory details, Renaissance Patisserie is just the opposite. Even advice from the barista(?) on how to properly store leftovers for best flavor.

While I do love the ambiance of the 'other' French themed hangout in Charlotte, Renaissance Patisserie has really nailed the taste, texture and consistency of the main event."}
{"text":"I made a special cake order and I am happy to say I will be ordering the same cake yet again! All everyone could say was WOW! My Spanish Fruitcake was excellent, the chef was pleasant and assured me he could handle the order and it would be great, and he did not disappoint! Prices to me are reasonable as well. Keep it up, Renaissance!"}
{"text":"Oui Oui - this is my new favorite place!!

This opened near my house and I couldn't be happier, except that I'm trying to lose weight! Oh well - life is short. Have a freaking awesome cinnamon pecan Danish :)

My goal is to try every wonderful-looking item at this bakery. I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I have made the rounds through most of Charlotte's bakeries but Renaissance is my new favorite. You can't beat the quality and authenticity of their items. Not to mention the adorable french accent. Most other places are cookie cutter American take on french. Their  macaron is just one of their stand outs. I wish I could remember the actual name of the golden raisin pastry but it was amazing. Merci!"}
{"text":"Best desserts in charlotte!! Their buttercream icing is one of a kind. The almond chocolate croissants are perfection. This place is truly a treat to charlotte."}
{"text":"Great selection of classic pastries. I went in specifically to try the almond croissant - it's my favorite and whenever I get to go to Europe to see family or friends I would live on these. The one I had today was very unexpected. Taste - excellent and captures the essence of delicious almonds and marzipan. Texture - very surprising; it was like a large madeleines (French butter cake) / pound cake wrapped inside a thin layer of croissant. I love croissant because of the buttery, flaky and fluffy lightness of the dough, and for an almond croissant I especially appreciate a classic texture with a good amount of marzipan inside, and less of an almond butter cake that's wrapped inside a croissant like the one I tried today. Very dense. My husband loved his apple tart and he grew up with buttery apple tarts, so definitely recommend that if you love apple sweets! I enjoyed the berry tart - the berries were fresh and plump - the texture of the tart was surprising as well - it was more like a cookie tart. We would LOVE to see a few more gluten free options in the future. Wonder if they can do a fruit tart with almond flour? I look forward to returning and trying the classic croissant next. They also have chocolate and Nutella croissants. Definitely go support this local shop - in my opinion this beats Amelie in authenticity."}
{"text":"Good almond croissant and Kougn Amann.  Little store in a random strip mall.  Great service."}
{"text":"What a cool little place. Very clean and trendy. They offer samples and the lady behind the counter was very helpful in finding us something that we would like. Everything is presented beautifully and delicious."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast today, ordered 3 different savory items (the croque Monsieur, the ham and cheese croissant with a delicious bechamel sauce and the ham and cheese quiche which was a hit with my 2 toddlers) and 4 sweet ones (French donuts, almond croissant and the pastry of the day) and every single one was absolutely delicious. We also ordered 2 cappuccinos that were really good The customer service was great, the lady behind the counter was very knowledgeable on all the pastries and she was super nice."}
{"text":"If you like Amelies you will love this place. Some one wrote the best almond croissant in Charlotte and they are 100% correct. Amelies coffee is better but this place is small and cozy like Amelies was prior to going corporate. Both good places, take your choice."}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in the Bay Area so we're used to having access to really quality French? pastries. My wife is from Europe and I lived in France for a little bit so it's fair to say we're a bit of pastry snobs lol. We hadn't been able to find a truly authentic place until we found renaissance. We were blown and have taken her parents? when they came to stay with us for a while and we all loved it! It's become \"our place\""}
{"text":"For sure the best croissants in Charlotte, they have the best eclair I have ever had as well. The croissants are buttery and flaky as they should be. Their coffee is fair trade which is alwnice to hear. I really do like this place, it feels classy and authentically french."}
{"text":"I make special trips here for one thing and one thing only, the absolute best almond croissant EVER!  They have other goodies, like the Kouign Amman and it is amazing in it's own right but the only thing that comes to mind when I'm in this neck of the woods is the almond croissant.  I've had almond croissants before but this place is separate from all others and somehow that almond flavor is baked into this pastry perfectly..........I'll have 1 more.....please and thank you!"}
{"text":"Since they moved recently from South Blvd, I figure it's time to update my review.   If you have ever relocated a business, you know it ain't a piece of cake.   So many headaches, disappointments, and long hours sprinkled with the occasional joys of success.  

Renaissance Patisserie had their baker's dozen of trials in the first few weeks after opening.  To those patrons who nonchalantly tossed them aside like a stale macaroon, I say, \"Really?!\"  This is a one-off, locally owned establishment grinding it out to add a moment of pleasure to your life.  Cut 'em some slack.  There is goodness baking in the oven.  Be patient . . . they are getting there. 

So,  in the mood for something more intimate, more authentic, and more upscale than Amelie's?  Way up and climbing on my \"Give 'em a whirl\" meter.  Go here.  And say \"bon jour\" to Sylvain, the owner.  He's the real deal."}
{"text":"I made a hobby of finding and eating macarons all around Charlotte, based on Alton Browns guide.  This small, French restaurant specializes in most carry out items and probably serves my favorite in all of Charlotte.  I love the small business atmosphere here, and the espresso is delicious.  If I recall, I don't think they have iced drinks though.  Also, if you want to eat the quiche there, you'll have to tell them so they warm it up."}
{"text":"Okay I've been dying to try this place since I heard about it. I had not tried their pastries from the farmers market before but I know they're very popular. So I went in and got a range of samplings!! A chocolate croissant which was recommended by the super nice sales girl and it was divine!! Probably the best croissant I've gotten in Charlotte. I also got an apple tart and again it was sooo good!! Above all it wasn't too sweet and it was just so real tasting. The ingredients I think must be really well chosen. I also got some meringues. These I wasn't so impressed with. They were hard as rocks the entire way through. I realize they are supposed to be crispy but these about broke our teeth. While that was a minor disappointment the croissants and tarts will more than make up for some bad meringues!! I can't wait to go back and try more things, especially some quiche and more croissants of course!!"}
{"text":"Bonjour! J'aimerais manger un Ã©clair. 

That is the extent of my French...but probably the most important. I will be well fed with a delicious pastry filled with vanilla custard with sugary icing.

It's a very small store front off of South Boulevard with, I think, maybe one cafe table with 2 chairs. They have a couple of cases to showcase their pastries. Besides the eclair, I ordered a French donut. Wow. Get the donut. 

They have quiche, flatbreads, and a variety of croissants. They can do custom orders, like cakes. You can get a fancy Croque-en-bouche!"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall, phenomenal macaroons!!! I had lavender and coffee flavored, will definitely stop in again when nearby!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best bakery in all of Charlotte. The chef is a French master who moved to Charlotte after owning and running a restaurant in LA (and was also private Chef to Michael Jackson's family and has cooked for Oprah). Highly recommend the chocolate domes (bottom layer is a brownie, topped with a chocolate mousse dome and covered in a chocolate shell), the cannelÃ©s (traditional french custardy pastry that they make perfectly), macarons, opera cake, and the tiramisu!"}
{"text":"Good morning y'all. I was staying at the hotel across the street and saw the outstanding reviews. I just had to swing by for a coffee and croissant. When I arrived there was no line and was served immediately. 

I got my order to stay, but my coffee was put in a to go cup. The croissant was hard and flavorless, and the lady behind the counter had no means of warming it up at least. I looked to the coffee prep area and saw no milk/cream. I turned back to inquire, and she flatly replied that she was filling them right now. Behind her I saw 4 carafes, so I thanked her and sat down. 

10 minutes later, those canisters were still empty. I just said nothing and left with my twice bitten croissant and black coffee sitting on the table."}
{"text":"The new shop is precious. It's in an interior courtyard, so don't waste your time circling the parking lot looking for their black and white striped awning. I'm really glad to see this place doing so well."}
{"text":"The closest this southern boy has ever been to Paris is the one in Florida... at EPCOT. I did have three years of French in high school however,  so I knew that \"patisserie\" meant \"bakery\" (sorta) which means fresh croissants, macaroons and lots of other sweet, buttery and flaky treats. So on a sunny Saturday morning, my wife and I ventured to the Southend area of uptown Charlotte to try this place for ourselves. According to my fellow Yelpers, it appeared to be a slam dunk.

We were greeted by the actual chef, who allegedly worked for Oprah... not so sure about that but he did have a French accent  and the chocolate croissants were supreme. They ran about $4 each. We also purchased a small chocolate birthday cake with buttercream icing. It was moist and delicious.

The store itself is tiny. There is room for a couple of two-seater tables but little else. They're also tables outside. The cafe-like atmosphere is very appealing and, most importantly, the display case, although small, has all of expected French pastries.

In Charlotte, when you mention French bakeries, the first one that pops into your head is usually Amelie's, which unfortunately has franchised itself all over Charlotte, and it has lost some of its appeal. With Renaissance, it's all about the pastries. We enjoyed it and look forward to its move to South Park."}
{"text":"Cute bakery in the specialty shops near South Park Mall. They have a case of delicious treats, as well as a fridge of soups and quiches you can take home. 

There are a few tables and chairs inside as well as patio space. 

The chocolate brownie bomb did not disappoint."}
{"text":"The cake goddess, recommended this den of yumminess to me. So I stopped by on my way home from work on (10/6/17). The bakery is tiny, two small glass cases and a small refrigerated cooler that also had bottled drinks for sale. All of the offerings looked great but they were really expensive. I had initially been drawn to the macaroons but wound up with two different quiche slices and a couple small deserts. I wouldn't mind going back & indulging myself when I have the funds available. Everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Such an unassuming place in a strip mall off of South Blvd. The pastries and sweets are excellent, though best fresh earlier in the day. I like that this bakery offers long hours from morning until 6 pm during the week and is open on Sundays, making it easy to grad something for a party or event. The window advertising cooking classes which I imagine would be amazing! I follow on social media so I'm often drooling over the latest pastry and wanting to stop in. My absolute favorite is the pain au raisins, a round wheel of pastry dough speckled with raisins that get juicy upon baking, it reminds me of the pastries I enjoyed in Paris where I learned to prefer the pain au raisins to traditional croissants. I also enjoy their large slices of quiche, for about $5 you can grab a very filling piece to take home and make a meal of. I love quiche and a small salad for dinner. Today I tried the seasonal pumpkin croissant, I'm assuming it was twice baked and I didn't love it, I haven't been impressed by any of the twice-baked pastries but it might just not be my preference over all."}
{"text":"I had been to the South Blvd. location a number of times and was always pleased.  This was my first trip to the South Park location and I was rather disappointed.

My wife and I split a slice of cake.  The cake itself was rather disappointing.  It was crumbly and a bit on the dry side.  When you put your fork in, the top half of the cake slide would fall apart from the bottom half.  The flavor was decent, but nothing great.  I had much preferred the pastries I had form the South Blvd. location (which, still looked tasty here!)  I also got an iced coffee which was pretty weak.  When I first got it, I thought they had made a mistake and given my unsweet tea.  

Service seems to be having some growing pains.  It was clear they are not used to serving customers who are planning to eat there.  I imagine that will come with time.

I'll certainly return.  If it gets better next time, I'll update my rating."}
{"text":"In all fairness I did not try the croissants, but what I did have was a level below Amelie's. First off, the lady behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful. Unfortunately this place lost its credibility in the desserts that I tried.

The vanilla eclair was hard, and lacked flavor. The inside cream tasted extremely generic. I also tried a vanilla macaroon, which was also harder than normal and tasted like it was left in the refrigerator too long. Unfortunately I left and went straight to Amelie's for my sugar fix. I did enjoy the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Great French Bakery! How could anybody go to fast food when this place is an option?!  What's wrong with you Charlotte?! Best Kouign Amann I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Since the Kouign Amanns are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, I set my alarm for Saturday morning to make sure I got to Renaissance early! I think I was the first person in at 7:10 a.m., which meant the Kouign Amanns were still warm. Mmmmm.

Renaissance was a little tricky to find since it's in an unassuming strip mall on South Blvd (in the same building as Monsoon Thai near Mac's), and the place is tiny. There is a small table with two chairs, but they look more like decoration than a place to sit and eat, so I got two Kouign Amanns and a cheese danish to go. 

I got them home and gave the fella the danish and gave the Kouign Amann to my belly! I'd never had one before, but it was dense... chewy, caramelized sugar dough around the perimeter and fluffy, buttery dough in the middle. The fella said the danish was solid, but we split the second Kouign Amann, and he said that was definitely the winner.

It was only $12 for all three pastries, which I thought was pretty reasonable. There was a MASSIVE almond croissant in the cabinet that I'm already dreaming about for my second trip."}
{"text":"A true French Patisserie in Charlotte. I've been on an almond croissant kick lately and my hunt for the best one in CLT brought me to Renaissance. 

Nicely baked, flaky, and plenty buttery. The almond filling was fragrant and nicely balanced throughout the entire croissant. They had brewed coffee that complimented the croissant well. I would definitely recommend Renaissance's almond croissant."}
{"text":"They made us a 3 tiered retirement cake and it turned out exactly how I envisioned it! They were easy to work with and had no problem adding a top tier when our headcount increased by 50 less than a week before our event. 
I tried a few of their pastries and they were amazing! I'll definitely call them again when I need our next cake!"}
{"text":"If anyone likes Macaroons they know how delicious and addicting they are. They also know how insanely expensive they are too, which is why there can be no room for error. If I pay almost 3$  for a macaroon I expect it to be PERFECT! Unfortunately that was not the case here. The Macaroons all taste the same with no real authentic flavor to them. In addition to being flavorless, they also crumbled apart when you bite into them. They should be soft and chewy and I experienced the complete opposite. 

 The young lady behind the counter was friendly but I didn't get the same feeling from the arrogant \"chef\" who didn't even acknowledge the customer spending money in his bakery. I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"I am one of those people who always feels like pastries look better than they end up tasting. I never understood excitement over croissants. Then I had one of the almond croissants at Renaissance and a bite of my friend's Kouign Amann. Now I understand why these pastries are famous. Just excellent- flaky, light, buttery.  It was a true treat of epic proportions. And the shop is charming. I look forward to eating many more!"}
{"text":"Love this place. And I'm a New Orleanian so I'd like to think that means my review would carry some weight. The croissants remind me of walking to Croissant D'Or near the French quarter. I highly recommend it. It's also a great place if you enjoy eclairs that aren't stale."}
{"text":"Did you know that they have a pastry stand at the Charlotte Regional Farmers Market? Well, now you do! Not sure if it's permanent or a pop up!

Two refrigerator cases packed with beautiful glistening goodies. Cheesecake dressed in fresh fruit, eclairs, mega flaky croissants, peach danish, apple tarts. The chocolate croissant was outstanding!

And if you're a lady... the young smiling man/chef with the French accent was quite the salesman. He was describing the pastries to browsers and making \"love matches\" with all things sweet! \"You will love the custard - it is just what you are looking for!\"

Still need to get to their home base. If this is any representation of what I'm in for, it's going to be great! Stay tuned for an update!"}
{"text":"The croissants are among the best that I've had in the US.  The Kougin Aman, their signature pastry can be spectacular... or dense and lardy when they serve you an old one (about 1/3 of the time).  Skip coffee here... one time it was weak like tea, another time it was barely warm (like it was left 24 hours in a pump pot, almost room temp).    If they would focus on quality, this has the chance to be something spectacular."}
{"text":"Fantastique! I went in and ordered a bit of everything (macaroons, eclairs, croissants, napoleon, danishes) and everything was excellent."}
{"text":"Cute!! This new little bakery hidden in a shopping center on South Boulevard is positively dripping with charm and French-iness. I wish the shopping center weren't so plain so this place stood out more. 
I wish there were just a few more options. Everything in the case looked delicious, but there were several labels for products that were not there. And I get it, it's a bakery, and it's new, so you can't just continually stock products that might go bad before they sell, but still, a nice full case of pastries would help with visual appeal. They also had a refrigerated case with pasta sauce, sandwiches, and quiche.
The girl behind the counter was delightful, helping us out with our orders and even offering a different pastry when my friend's daughter didn't like her \"pink cookie.\" (Apparently not every 3-year-old is a fan of rose macarons.) The rest of us didn't have that problem and gobbled up our treats, which were delicious. They also sell locally-roasted coffee, even though I've forgotten the name of the roastery. Sorry! 
One downside was seating. The four of us plus a baby pretty much filled up the space. I was hoping for big, lounge-y chairs and tables. The chairs were adorable, but not very homey. This would definitely be a grab-and-go stop.
If I could give half a star, this would be 3.5. I hope to see improvements in the future and I will definitely be back to check them out!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I've only had their macaroons but each flavor is delicious. 

Friendly staff as well. I was happy to hear that even with the new development they are staying in the same general area once the new Harris Teeter opens"}
{"text":"Great bakery. Amazing artisan treats!  

A true gem for South Charlotte and Uptown."}
{"text":"Love this bakery! More mom&pop and authentic feel than Amelie's. Has both savory and sweet treats! Apple tart is one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pastries by Chef Sylvain Rivet!!  Wow, about time Charlotte had a real French bakery!!  Everything is authentic and spectacular!!  Napoleons, eclairs, cheese cake, fruit tarts, croissants, all amazing!!"}
{"text":"We discovered Renaissance Patisserie last year.  It has become a regular spot for our family.  The almond croissants are amazing and the coconut macaroons are delightful.  We even use them for making gift baskets for office occasions, etc.  A recent discovery is their brioche which we buy at least every other week - it's the source of our sunday french toast breakfast!  If you haven't visited them, you are missing out.  I also don't mind the location - I'd rather they spend their money on their friendly staff and their delicious creations - that's what I'm buying - not a fancy storefront.  Keep doing great things!"}
{"text":"Unlike that chain of French bakeries, this place is warm and inviting.   You can see the kitchen while waiting in line, so you can see the products are fresh, not unloaded from an institutional wholesaler.

There is seating inside with French music playing softly and tables outside in a plaza.

Service was attentive and responsive.    This is located across Morrison Boulevard from South Park.   The entrance is off the central plaza toward the back of the Specialty Shops"}
{"text":"Wow.  Seriously great. The only drawback is that now I'm going to have to try everything they make. Simply wonderful croissant. Well, there goes the diet.  The best baguette I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are absolutely perfect. They look like treasures and taste spectacular with the best texture.  I've sampled the almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and Kouign Amman and plan to try as many others as possible. The Kouign Amman (similar to a croissant but with carmelized sugar in and around the pastry) was my absolute favorite! The sugar was perfectly carmelized and the flavor was nothing like I've had before.  

If you can't make it out to this location, note that some (maybe all?) of the goods can be found at the Regional Farmer's Market!"}
{"text":"I really love this place for a great pastry and coffee in the morning. So many delicious choices and definitely will remind you of Paris. I need to try a baguette, that's my only regret so far is not grabbing one for dinner one night. Maybe today!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the croissants or savory items, just a banana macaron and the opera cake, so I'm hesitant to give a 5 but this place has potential. It's tucked away in a small high end shopping plaza and not visible from the parking lot. Upon entering, the girl behind the counter was super friendly and asked me if I liked bananas, then recommended the banana macaron. She also helped me narrow down what else to choose based on my palate, etc. Since I like chocolate she said the opera cake was popular, and I was like sure. This place is pricey but not too bad, considering the cake was really beautiful with the different layers and a gold foil accent. Taste-wise, I actually preferred the macaron - I couldn't really taste the banana but the cookie was delicate and chewy and the filling was super light and creamy. Definitely would come back for more macarons."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my favorite bakery in Charlotte. I'd marry the chef just to eat his chocolate brownie cake on a regular basis! There are so many delicious choices here and everything I've tasted has been absolutely divine."}
{"text":"Won't ever go here. If you've been to AmÃ©lie's especially don't go here. Broken macarons in the case. Two young girls who don't know what's up or down running the register. My order was for there, we got it to go. We had a watery creme caramel. Then a disgusting strawberry with everything dried out. The quiche dough was completely raw on the bottom. I mean completely inedible. The French onion soup had no cheese and it was tepid. I ask for more cheese and it heated up. It comes back with more tepid broth and now cheese that you can see unmelted. The pastry case was a disaster. Everything looked sloppy. It's a no for me and i won't recommend to anyone else. Get into the city and go find yourself the real deal."}
{"text":"This little French bakery is reminiscent of my time in France. The pains aux chocolat, croissants aux beurre, and croissants aux amande are all exemplary of French baking traditions. It makes me very happy to have a reminder of my time abroad learning about other people, cultures, and languages nearby my office. I look forward to many more croissants and the chance to practice my rusty French. Profitez-bien!"}
{"text":"Warm and charming,and the pastries are magnifique!
Wonderful to have a French bakery in Charlotte and now I know where to get my custom order cakes.
Fun staff too"}
{"text":"Holy cow. Got the chocolate brownie cake and literally got chills. Delicious and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this morning. Amazingly satisfying and delicious pastries!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great and everyone here is very nice. My favorite is the almond croissant... hands down the best almond croissant in town, and I've had them from all the bakeries in South End and Uptown.... I might have a problem!"}
{"text":"Just found this lovely place today. If you are looking for authentic French Pastry, breads, etc. this is your place. Love it."}
{"text":"Shortly after reading Aleks' ROTD and seeing the picture she included of the eclair, I bookmarked Renaissance Patisserie. And now I'm here in the afternoon.

I got two pastries to take home and lucked out that I got to eat half of one of them. The apple tart was the one where my wife let me eat half. It was tasty, flaky and delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed.

I also thought that their croissant looked excellent and my wife told me that it was. (Thanks, Mrs. K.!) And she said that I could stop by Renaissance Patisserie any time and get her another one."}
{"text":"I was such in a rush to buy my kid a birthday cake so I look up on Yelp.. so I gotta tell you their pastries are the best! I bought tons of pastries for the small party. I've always went to Amelie's but always thought their was so sweet I could be coming out as diabetic, also their price is too high! But this place was head on, great taste and inexpensive.. found my place!"}
{"text":"Great to have another local bakery open up in the neighborhood. They have great breakfast pastries, and serve yourself coffee. The owner and staff are extremely friendly, and make solid desserts."}
{"text":"This bakery is soooooo awesome! Food that has layers of flavor and is capable of awakening all your senses is what you find here!! I can only think of the movie Ratatouille and what the joy of good food can be. I tasted their \"Opera\" cake today and all I could do was say \"Yumm\" It was that good. I was without words. I typically do not write reviews, as I find a lot of food just adequate. In the case of Renaissance Patisserie, it is delightful! Joyful! Bravo!"}
{"text":"The butter and almond croissants are excellent. Their baguettes rate 5 stars and the best in the city.  I've also indulged in their ratatouille, and tomato soup which are very delicious, a brioche loaf and a maple walnut pound cake that I'll be working off at the gym for the next 10 years.  I'm not a dessert person, so I cannot comment on any of the creamy looking goodies in the fridge case.  The owner, his wife, and the staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I noticed Renaissance Patisserie on a trip down South Blvd recently and made a mental note to check it out on Yelp. I stopped in on Saturday afternoon to check it out. Pastry case was full and there was an enthusiastic couple waiting to purchase before me. It's a good sign when strangers ask you, \"isn't this place great?!\" as you wait in line. I purchased a Paris Brest hazelnut eclair to go for $5. For the amount of work involved in making eclairs,  I am always glad to fork over the cash instead of doing it myself. It tasted exactly how it's supposed to - lightly sweet, hazelnut pastry cream inside of a soft pate a choux shell. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm beyond thrilled. I've never been more excited to write a review. 

My husband, knowing that I love all things French, recently surprised me with a trip to Renaissance Patisserie. It's really close to where I work, so I blame the fact that it's in an unassuming shopping strip that I've missed this place. 

I was convinced that I would have to go to France or at least to New York to have authentically scrumptious French pastries again. I'm a self-proclaimed Francophile who's traveled to France several times and studied abroad there; it's when my love for French pastries and bread blossomed. I then lived in New York City, which also had a few good options due to the number of French people living there.

The almond croissant is my favorite thing, and the one here is phenomenal! It was just as good as the ones I've had in Paris and the one from my beloved patisserie in New York. So flavorful, so flakey, so perfect. 

The interior is quaint and cute, with its bumblebee color scheme. The service was excellent and I loved that the woman working had a French accent (it's the little things, right?). The only complaint is the lack of tables and seating. It's more of a grab and go type of setup. 

With more seating and space, I would come here over AmÃ©lie's any day. But, at the same time, I like that it's small. It feels more like a patisserie that you're stopping into for a croissant, opÃ¨ra cake or a baguette on your way to work or back home, just as the French do. 

Merci beaucoup pour l'ouverture d'une vraie pÃ¢tisserie Ã  Charlotte! J'ai hÃ¢te de revenir!"}
{"text":"It was our second time at this bakery - their sweets are divine! I love the French atmosphere and employees - it gives such an authentic vibe!"}
{"text":"Macarons are the best I've ever had. Perfect flavors filling and textures... Just make sure to leave out for a bit since they are in a cold case... The fillings are light and delicate and I'm sure would melt if sat out all day... I tried the mixed berry, lemon, pistachio and coconut and the coconut was my favorite! Also purchased the almond croissant and warmed up just a bit was equally delicious! I love this place ... It is a small shop in a short strip mall and so glad I found it!"}
{"text":"I could give myself a swift kick (if that was possible) for constantly driving past this place. We've all done it, telling ourselves, \"I'll stop in next time\". I'll make it simple, stop in next time! 

Rene was kind enough to explain everything, and I mean everything to us, after we told him it was our first time. How nice to say yes to that question! Everything looked so yummy, from the nice sized macarons, to the tiramisu, the meringue, I could go on. We selected the chocolate brownie cake and a chocolate croissant. 

The croissant was lovely. Flaky, light with some chocolate in the middle. I would've liked for more chocolate, but I'm a bit greedy, so for someone who doesn't have such a raging sweet tooth- I'm sure it would be perfect.

And now for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance...the chocolate brownie cake. I did my best to ignore the cries from the box all evening. I wanted to savor it the next day, but that didn't happen. Covered with my favorite ganache and a raspberry, underneath was a heap of mousse and a chocolate brownie on the bottom. Now let me explain, I don't very much care for mousse. But after one bite, I didn't care. It was magnificent. There were also chocolate chips dispersed throughout. Not too much, just a few. And it made the cake even better.

My daughter, who loves cakes with mousse, said it was even better than where she usually likes, which is the bakery at the Ritz Carlton. This place is worth five stars."}
