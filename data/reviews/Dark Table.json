{"text":"Dining in the dark removes a huge part of how you're used to eating, with your eyes. This requires complete trust and faith in the kitchen and wait staff that you're getting what you ask for.

So imagine how violated my vegan wife felt when she took a bite of shrimp, after eating over half of her 'vegan' risotto...

I will preface my review by saying that our server, Aaron was the only positive of the night, he was very helpful, entertaining, and very apologetic for this inexcusable mishap.

We placed our drink and meal order in the lobby of the restaurant where we could see the menu, my wife ordered the mushroom risotto (which the menu specified it could be made vegetarian or vegan). After being lead to our table and having our first course, our main courses soon arrived. My wife grew suspicious at the scent of parmesan cheese and asked our server, Aaron, who checked with the kitchen. He was assured that the plate was vegan-friendly, so my wife skeptically ate until she had the dreaded bite of seafood. Aaron came by to check on our dinner when we brought this to his attention, he took the plate to the kitchen and soon returned to apologize and to inform us that there had been a mix up in the kitchen, This plate had been mixed up with someone else's, and that the kitchen was preparing a new vegan plate.  My wife's trust and faith were gone at this point and she was too upset to enjoy the rest of dinner, let alone attempt another bite.

After dinner, we were lead back to the lobby where the staff had offered to only charge us for a two-course meal rather than our three-course meal we had signed up for. We had, however, previously purchased a Groupon for this meal, so we were instead comped 2 of our 3 drinks. We were told that the expo in the kitchen that night is blind, and that's where the mix up occurred. 

We find this entire situation inexcusable. While being vegan is my wife's choice, this could have been much worse had it been a food allergy (which we were never asked about the entire night). Given the nature of not being able to see what you're eating, I would have expected more care and attention to dietary restrictions.

I would caution anyone with allergies or dietary restrictions against dining here."}
{"text":"We were a table of 3 and 2 of us loved the experience, however the 3rd was just too freaked out to enjoy it and only ate the 1st course. The 2nd was packaged up and taken home as she had no desire to eat anything she couldn't see. She was older and I don't thing she truly grasped the kind of restaurant it was when we explained beforehand. 
We first entered the front where we were given then menus and chose our main course. Appetizers, desserts, and munchies were surprises. The lady that greeted us came on a little pushy and rushed us through the process of choosing our main course a little more than we liked. We were then given a locker where we locked up our coats, purses and cellphones and were introduced to our server, Ashley. It was pitch black so she led us to our table Congo line style and made sure we were settled in before moving on. She was such a sweet, efficient and excellent server! Awesome! The meal was good, not great but pretty good. We also decided to eat our main course with our fingers after getting tired of the forks being empty by the time they reached our mouths so many times! And you'll be surprised at how much food lands on the table when you can't see what you're doing! We realized that after our plates were taken away. Was a very cool experience. I have to say that the restaurant does get very loud!! I guess it's automatic that when you can't see, you seem to talk louder almost to compensate! Lol!! 
All in all, I loved the experience and would go again.
One thing we did notice that you don't when you're eating in the dark, is that the portions are quite small for the price you pay (pretty pricey). We realized that when we saw the meal that was packaged up and taken home. When you're eating in the dark, you're so focused on the feel and taste of it all, you really don't realize how small it is. If you have a big appetite, grab a burger on your way there first! Overall though, I'd suggest experiencing it at least once!!"}
{"text":"Dark Table was an amazing experience! Carla was our server who lead us to our table and checked in on us lots to make sure everything was going good. She was very helpful and a great server! The braised lamb rigatoni was absolutely amazing. Overall we would definitely go back for another fun night!"}

{"text":"I recently brought my girlfriend to this restaurant after hearing about it from a close friend. I didn't know what to expect. I saw something on a movie once where waiters walk around with infagreen goggles and waiters customers bumping into eachother. This place was totally not the movies. This place was better! From the manager Sandy to our waiter Aaron, who by the way has better awareness without sight than a regular waiter with full perception! Who was filled with such relaxing humour, he made us feel completely comfortable. Calgary needed something like this! Sure we have restaurants, but this is an experience! Learning your environment, hearing what's around you. Smelling and tasting the food! To actually engaging in connected conversation with my gf, completely amazing. I can't give 10 stars on this because there isn't one , but the 5 stars it can receive , are completely worth every one and more! Take your family, kids, spouse , heck give a gift certificate to your favourite neighbour! From a great menu selection, wines and spirits to the surprise \"I'm right here \" from your waiter in ear shot, Dark table is truly a shining light ..in the dark."}
{"text":"This is a great concept that's finally made its way to the booming Calgary food scene.  

Dark Table knocks it out of the park! 

The food is tasty and the experience is definitely on point. Our server Blaine was attentive & quick.  Definitely on the ball.  

It was impressive how smooth the entire restaurant ran.  From arrival to departure their entire team was on the ball.  The food was tasty (a bit expensive if you're going just for the food) but the whole package is well worth the $$.  

Great job!"}
{"text":"Ever wondered what it would be like to eat in pitch dark? Served by a visually impaired server? Without knowing what you're eating? Best anniversary dinner ever."}
{"text":"Even the most willing participate will get anxiety LOL.
 The experience is something truly unique. After a while we just stopped using cutlery since it was easier to find your food with you hands. Our server was Mimi and she was a ray of sunshine! Once dessert was served she announced my husbands birthday and we all sang to him. I felt so special for him because we really had the whole restaurants undivided attention and it was so fun!

I docked a star for the food. My surprise salad starter used lettuces that I don't like the taste of, and barely had dressing.
My steak was bland, and tasted like it was only seasoned in salt and pepper. Our home BBQ makes better steak. My husband had zero complaints on the fish. The desert was amazing. They gave us two different dishes and that was a fun surprise! You can't go wrong with dessert. 
I assumed surprise munchies for $5 was going to be a chec mix. It wasn't, it was some kind of breaded amazing ball. They do tell you at the end but I forget now.

I would take my family and friends for the experience."}
{"text":"Dark Table was one of the coolest dining experiences I have ever had. I did the 3 course surprise meal, and I was shocked to find that what I had eaten was nothing like what I had guessed! The food was delicious and the service was amazing. I adore how the restraunt teamed up CNIB to employee visually impaired persons, and believe that supporting businesses that employee diverse populations is crucial. My only criticism is that the meal was very highly priced, but I would recommend this as a one-time date opportunity!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for valentines day and we had a great time. The staff were attentive and funny. We had a great waitress. The concept is really cool. I figured my eyes would adjust eventually to the darkness, but nope. It's completely black. I quite liked the food. The surprise starter was excellent, as were our mains (steak and fish.) The surprise desserts were great as well. My BF got a dessert that he has always said he hated... and ate it all. You find out at the end what they served and he was shocked! Im already planning a return visit with my daughter (15yo)"}
{"text":"It was exciting, uncomfortable, eye-opening, and something completely new! (Plus the food and staff were really great.) It's something you have to experience yourself. Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"This was such a cool experience! We tried the surprise menu and not knowing what was coming really added to the experience. Eating in pitch darkness was so different, and our waiter was super friendly! I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a unique, friendly, and eye-opening (pun) dining experience."}
{"text":"My partner and I were very eager to dine at Dark Table. We arrived for our reservation and it was very chaotic. There is a lobby area with bars and lockers. People were checked in and then left lingering around in the lobby. An employee came and had us line up against the wall to wait for our server. Meanwhile people were exiting and scrambling to grab their things from the lockers close by. We were taken into a pitch dark room by our server. He was very polite and courteous. The experience was fun. I had no idea how large the room was or how many people were in it. The acoustics in the room was loud. I was expecting chatters like in a coffee shop but I could hear everyone's conversations. The food... was terrible and was reminiscent of a school cafeteria lunches. The portions were very small. The food was bland. I opted to pay extra for a steak main course, which was very disappointing. The plate was cold and I was surprised to only have 3-4 bites before I finished my meal. The steak was pre-cut and served with stale French fries. Our server was great! The experience was fun! But I don't think we will be returning or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"I had a groupon for the 3 course meal for two. We got the surprise for everything which included a starter, shared munchies, main dish and dessert! Everything was good and it was a lot of fun guessing what you are eating! It was a really good environment and the staff were so friendly and inviting! I would 100%  recommend it to anyone looking for a fun dining experience and will definitely be going back one day!"}
{"text":"Service: Tianna our server was amazing at her job. She was very attentive and really took care of us throughout our experience. I think we take people waiting tables for granted and the experience at Dark Table exemplifies how paramount the role of a server really is. You are really at the mercy of your server for everything and Tianna did a tremendous job at not making the patrons anxious and was exceptional at her job. 

Ambience: NA 

Food: This was perhaps the worst food I have had period. Considering the absence of a light source, it becomes paramount that textures and flavours are paid close attention to. The food was grocery store quality, really bland and not worth the $47 per person for a three course meal. The starter was a salad served cold (intentional). From what I could make out, it had potatoes, celery and cucumbers with some sour drizzle. It was average at best. The main course was Wild Mushroom Risotto which was an insult to Italians. Finally the dessert was a 7-eleven bought (allegedly) cake dipped in some Kirkland (allegedly) liquor. The food was so bad that the only plausible explanation was the fact that cooks were visually impaired as well. However, I do think that would be an insult to the visually impaired as one would assume they would be experts in layering textures and amplifying flavors.  

I would not be back and would not recommend this place to anyone. While a novel concept, this restaurant fails at the thing people go to restaurants for: Food. 

TL;DR: Servers were amazing, food was shoddy to put it mildly. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Our server Kathryn took great care of us as she guided us through our meal.  She was attentive and went out of her way to give us the most authentic dining experience we have ever had. Go for the surprise meal when you go. It will enhance your experience!"}
{"text":"Loved the experience of eating and trying to interact with others in the dark.  They do a really good job on this, however, the food was marginal, at best.  I was hoping for really flavourful, distinct tastes and smells, which would have made the experience even better. the food was bland, indistinguishable.  Disappointing.

I would not recommend because of the food quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Groupon so we made use of it. Be prepared to pay a lot for this experience, even with the Groupon we paid close to $90 after all was said and done. (cost of Groupon + drinks and tip).
You enter a dimly lit lobby where you get a chance to look and the menu and decide what you'd like to eat and drink.
We had the 3 course meal with \"surprise munchies for the table\".
My husband chose the fish of the day and I chose to be surprised by all 3 courses.
The waitress guided us to our table and then brought our drinks and some large glasses of water.
The first course was a cold salad. I won't ruin the surprise but it was a variety of milk flavors and texture with a creamy vinaigrette. It was okay but nothing to write home about.
The second course was the main so my husband had the fish which was salmon with a lemon cream Sauce. He wasn't a fan of it, and he accidentally ate the roasted lemon garnish. He doesn't like to touch his food with his hands so he had a hard time with knowing if he was finished or where stuff was on his plate.
I got the surprise meal. It was really good. However I would recommend mentioning if you have any aversions to eating veal to the server before being surprised. They don't put seafood or pork as the surprise but mine was veal, and I know a few of my friends would not eat veal for personal reasons.
The dessert was ok. I made my husband give me his because I wasn't a fan of mine and his was delicious!
The desserts are shipped from Vancouver but they are made in House at the dark table there from my understanding.
The munchies we got were delicious deep dried nuggets of veggie and cheese.
I will give the staff and the concept 5 starts for sure, however, the food and the price could be a bit better. When I pay that much for dinner I expect food that's better than what I would rate Denny's food. The food was nothing to write home about for sure, but the experience was pretty fun. I'd go again for a double date or a party."}
{"text":"Dining in the dark is something I've always wanted to try but have never had an opportunity to experience. Unlike other \"unique\" dining situations, this is one that you really can't replicate at home. So, when I heard that Dark Table was coming to Calgary, I was very excited.

I looked at Dark Table's menu online in advance. Options include a 2 or 3 course meal with a surprise starter/dessert and you can either choose your main or opt for the surprise main. As well, there is a $5 add-in for \"surprise munchies for the table\". Wanting the full experience, I opted for the full three courses plus munchies, all surprise.

After placing our order at the front bar/reception, we were introduced to our waiter who led us, caravan style, into and through the pitch black restaurant to our table. Blind folds were provided, but where we were sitting they weren't necessary, as the environment was completely black.

We weren't seated long before our food started coming out. It was a really cool experience, feeling around in a dish having no idea what's in it. I chose to eat the entire meal with my fingers for two reasons: first, I was using touch as one of the ways to identify my food and second, I didn't trust myself to use a fork in the dark without stabbing myself and spilling food everywhere!

I won't spoil the surprise when it comes to the menu, so I'll just say that everything was delicious. It was so much fun playing the guessing game during the meal as to what I was eating. After finishing the meal and being lead back out into reception, we discussed the menu with the hosts to see how close our \"guesses\" were. 

I would definitely recommend a visit to the Dark Table to experience a new way of dining!"}
{"text":"Great fun experience.It's nice to try something new than a traditional dining. Food was great and our server ashley was amazing. We had 3 course meal and a surprise munchies and all taste good. Over all experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Loved the concept of this restaurant. I didn't quite know what to expect, other than the fact that we would be dining in the dark. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised at my experience here and would recommend everyone to try it at least once for the experience as well :)

When you enter the restaurant, there are people who greet you. They will confirm your reservation, and explain how the restaurant works. You will get to look through the menu at this point, and order what you'd like. They did have a good variety of options, like lamb, steak frites, pasta and etc. for the entrees. We chose the 3 course meal and the appetizer was surprise, as well as the dessert. They do this to keep you guessing, to see if you can figure out what the dish was without knowing!

Next, they set you up with a server who will walk you to your table in the dining area, which is, yes, dark. They provide you with an eye mask so that you don't have to overwork your eyes in the dark (which they totally do) 

The servers who work here are all visually impaired. I love that this restaurant provides employment for these individuals, and hope that others will dine here just to support this cause. I found our server friendly, professional, and very thorough. He even ensured that the kitchen packed up my leftovers and labelled the containers :)"}
{"text":"Dark Table is an extremely unique dining experience. You order your food in the bar area, put your coats and posessions in a locker, and then are guided through utter darkness to your seat. We were surprised at how dark it actually was. You could not see your own hand in front of your face. It was as if your eyes are closed while they are wide open. Do not go if you are claustrophobic or prone to panic attacks because it was a bit freaky! We ordered the surprise munchies which was fantastic. The surprise appy was a salad which was super tasty. I ordered the fish which had a delicious creamy tomatoe sauce on it and my husband ordered the lamb. We were both very impressed by the food and it was fun to try to guess what was in the dish without seeing it. Eating in the dark was a bit messy, but it was also pretty fun! The surprise dessert was also delicious. Our food came very quickly and the whole experience was quite swift - which was actually nice because it's a bit odd just sitting in the dark. Overall it's an experience I would definitely recommend you try once!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Staff was so friendly and fun. When you arrive there's a bar to get a drink before you enter the dining area, then they lead you into a completely blackout space and assist you to your table. The experience is very different but so enjoyable. Food was so good, we had the 3 course meal. Our starter and dessert were surprises they were both amazing, and you don't find out what they are until you settle at the end of the night. If you want to try something that you've never done before this is the place! I can't wait to bring friends and family here to partake in there 1st experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had a great time eating here. Our server Aaron was great! He led us to and from the table without incident, with our hands on each others' shoulders since we REALLY couldn't see anything! Each time he brought us food or water, he made sure we were able to locate it without knocking it over before he left, and also confirmed our entree orders before going to the kitchen to retrieve them. And, the food was really good! For the main course I had the vegetarian mushroom risotto and my boyfriend had the lamb ragout; we each got a starter salad and a surprise dessert as well. Overall, this was a really fun experience and we would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The experience was unique. The servers / waiters were funny and friendly and certainly made the experience great. 

Food was on the other hand very bland. I had the fish and it was quite bland and dry and certainly not worth the price.  The starter was just a garden salad. Munchies was just a bag of chips picked up from a grocery store.  Dessert was good. You're really there for the experience. But if this was a normal restaurant I would not return given food quality. 

The only negative experience I had was with the hostess. Cellphones are not allowed to be used in the dining area which is understandable given the need to preserve the darkness. Lockers were provided outside to store you cellphone if needed. However, given my phone was new and expensive, I chose to keep my cellphone on me, there was no signage or instruction that it has to be locked away. Besides, I never used my phone inside, similar to what you do in a show, theatre or movie, just leave it off in my pocket. Near the end of the meal, I came out of the dark area for a quick minute (into the lighted area), I took a quick look at the time on the phone, she saw me holding my phone, and in a stern and attacking manner I was ordered by her to put the phone in the locker.  Very rude and abrubt way. She goes \"I saw you took your phone out of your pocket and put it back in\" as if I was some sort of criminal. She was not polite about it at all. There was no sign that says \"thy shall store all cellphones in a locker\". The unwritten verbal policy is overkill as I didn't have it out during the meal. I was having a good time and she really ruined the experience for me. Even the top theatres in London UK allow you to keep your cell in your pocket. 

Other people at my table also had similar complains about the hostess rudeness, saying she was very abrupt when taking orders. 

I do not plan to return. The food is bland and not  good. Nice try it for once just to eat in the dark, but the hostess attitude needs to improve. The servers however are awesome.

Good to try it out but make sure to lock your cellphone or else the dragon hostess might come at you."}
{"text":"We did the 3 course meal with a group of 5 people. The food was of a very low quality: basic salad, tasteless fish, and a grocery quality slice of cake.

The price was way too high for the low quality food. It's a good concept but poorly executed.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to eat in the dark last night.

The concept is really intriguing and makes you aware of how dependent you are on your sense of sight. You end up depending on your other senses like touch and hearing. 

When you arrive, the host will take your entree order. You can do either 2 or 3 courses but you will only know what your entree is. The other two courses are surprises. I chose the lamb ragu rigatoni and my husband chose the salmon. 

The server will lead you into the dining room conga style where the only illuminated object is the exit sign. It's pitch black and might make you feel claustrophobic.

The first course was a salad with mayo based dressing. I won't spoil what else was in the salad but it's an assortment of tastes and textures.

I was disappointed by my pasta. The fact that I couldn't see it meant I could definitely tell how it tasted. It had differing hot and cold spots and the rigatoni was super soft and had broken pieces. I commented to my partner that it tasted like they heated pasta in a microwave and poured sauce from a barely warm pot. My partner's dish was more fresh than mine and the potatoes were delicious.

The desserts were disappointing too. I could tell right away they weren't made in house. We had a chocolate cake and a lemon pie.

When we paid our bill, our suspicion about the desserts were confirmed. They get ordered from a supplier in Vancouver. 

Overall it was a fun experience. However, if your sense of taste is going to be heightened in the dark, then the least the restaurant could've done was make better than average food because you can tell even more when something is of poor calibre. I left the restaurant exhilarated, yet disappointed. I feel the darkness concept is a money grab excuse for the restaurant to churn out mediocre dishes that normal restaurants in the downtown vicinity would've put more time and effort into.

I don't think I'd go back again, but at least it's something I can take off my bucket list. There's so many better restaurants in Calgary to tickle your taste buds and you don't need to sit in a dark room to enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is a very unique experience! Our server was a little confused with the table placement so I think it started her off in a wonky night. Got her off-track. She was fumbling a little bit, so service was slow. It was so loud in the resto - be prepared for that.. and dirty hands... haha :) food tasted really good, would have loved a bigger portion of them though. A lil bit pricey for the food... but its the experience you pay for."}
{"text":"I've learned to always be extra cautious when I plan to visit a new restaurant with reviews skewed so heavily to either end of the spectrum. Unfortunately for Dark Table, their skew towards to negative ended up being realized during my visit. 

Dark Table is an interesting concept, piloted in Montreal and Vancouver prior to its implementation in Calgary. The dining room is pitch black, and the wait staff are all visually impaired/blind. This concept has a ton of potential for a next-level culinary experience, but Dark Table not only hugely missed all these opportunities, but also boasts very poor food even compared to a regular restaurant. 

I won't repeat the details about the process that is well detailed in other reviews - that's all novelty. Ultimately a visit to any restaurant is about the experience, yes, but the experience is ultimately about the food, and the food at Dark Table falls way short. 

The restuarant layout was awful, it was clear that the tables and chairs were poorly organized, and the sitting spaces were incredibly tight - i was crammed right up against a wall. 

We opted for the 3 course, comprised of a \"surprise\" starter, a selection of main course options, and a \"surprise\" dessert. 

The surprise starter was a run of the mill salad - potato based, with mediocre flavours. Unfortunately, the vegan rendition of the starter salad was even worse, with a cheap tasting vinaigrette on top of some greens. Really, the starter in fact was more of a side salad.

While the salad came relatively fast, this was the point in the evening when the experience began to go rapidly downhill. The main course took probably 25 minutes to appear after the starter plates had been cleared! 

The main course was apparently a veal with veggies and mashed potato. I'm going to preface this by saying, I have a history of eating a LOT of frozen dinners in my early days, and the mashed potato was somehow WORSE than the mashed potato in a frozen dinner. Not only was it not creamy, it was also somehow watery. In addition to that, it had \"unmashed\" chunks, which you would imagine would not be \"watery and grainy\", but somehow was also watery. Needless to say I was perplexed. The veal was average at best and the veggies were unremarkable. The whole main course experience was exceptionally similar to a $5 hungryman plate (often on sale for less than $3). 

The other main was a vegan mushroom risotto..... oh boy. Okay, so I will say that the fact it was made vegan without cream and cheese etc really makes it difficult to get a good risotto, but even given this understanding it was a real miss. The food was bland, and the mushrooms were cheap and didn't impart a lot of earthy flavours, etc. Truffle would have been an ideal addition to this, or any type of premium mushroom. 

By this point in the night, the novelty of the dining in the dark experience has long worn off, especially given the food experience doesn't leverage the darkness at all. However, our night was not yet over. We were then \"forgotten\" about for HALF AN HOUR, AFTER we finished the main course. 

When we finally flagged down our waiter, we told him we wanted the desserts to go, and asked to GET THE HELL out of Dodge. He obliged, and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes before coming to fetch us to walk us out. 

(The dessert was grocery store sorbet and a small, store bought slice of cake, are you serious.)

It took us 2 hours to get a side salad and a main course. Ridiculous. This 3 course menu? It rings it at $42 a person, without selecting any supplements. FOR FOOD THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FROM THE TO GO SECTION OF A GROCERY STORE. 

I will say, the waiter was very friendly and as helpful as possible, though they appeared to be short staffed. However, I found the host and the manager both to be short with me, with some attitude. 

The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of one is because the visually-impaired wait staff are truly hardworking, pleasant, and friendly. 

Incredibly poor execution at Dark Table. If you want a Dark Table experience, go elsewhere. The only case that I would consider revisiting this place would be if they went under new management with a new executive chef."}
{"text":"We were at Dark Table last night and really enjoyed the experience.   Our server  Blaine was attentive and had a great sense of humour.  The food for the most part was pretty good however the salad could have been crisper.   We had a fair bit of fun trying not to spill our wine, which we didn't,  and getting food from plate to mouth.  I ended up wearing most of my salad but that's what a napkin is for.  I would absolutely recommend trying this dining experience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very interesting experience, I would definitely do it again, but not at this restaurant. It took us over 2.5 hours to have our meal, having to wait almost an hour for our appetizer, and again almost an hour for our main dish. Being forgotten by our waiter, twice, did ruin our experience. Food is very average at best, I don't recommend it for a culinary experience."}
{"text":"Really awesome concept and maybe my problem was more with other people and that not really their fault but the whole experience was way too loud to be enjoyable, I don't know why but everyone seemed to think cause it was dark they needed to talk twice as loud. There was one group that was ridiculously loud 
 laughter and practically yelling over the room. It ruined the experience for me. I didn't enjoy the food. I had the chicken kofta and it was not very good. Not very big portions I'm glad we used a groupon and didn't pay full price very tiny portions. My boyfriend ended up eating a sandwich when we got home."}
