{"text":"While sports bars and the bar/grill theme has been completely overdone, it's going to take some innovation to make a sports-themed bar/grill stand out, let alone survive.  The creativity I found on the menu at Bricks makes me think this spot will be around for a long time.

It was Memorial Day weekend, and I had to work.  I'll admit, I was bummed I wouldn't be able to go to any backyard parties.  I was so looking forward to a grilled burger that I made it my mission to have a fabulous burger adventure at a new place.  I used the mobile app to find Bricks.

Walking in on a Saturday afternoon, I noticed that the vibe of the place was subdued.  Then again, it was a Saturday afternoon and I was in a bar.  I was actually kind of glad it wasn't busy!  

As soon as we sat at a booth, we were welcomed by a waitress who took our drink orders and brought us menus.  Many of the usual items to be found here, ho-hum....but wait......grilled artichokes????  That certainly got my attention, and I promptly placed my order: we split a grilled artichoke appetizer, she had a salad and I had a habanero burger. 

The artichokes were a delight.  Tender, done to perfection, a mild, yet complimentary dipping sauce that did not overpower the mild, subtle flavor of the vegetable, and easy to eat (which is not always the way it goes when it comes to artichokes!)  I would offer comments on the salad my wife ordered, but quite frankly I was in sensory overload with my heavenly burger!  First, the patty was quite ample.  It was not a perfectly matched size to the bun.  No, it spilled out proudly.  I ordered mine medium rare.  The patty was soooo juicy that it drew my attention to the quality of the bun.  When it comes to burgers, the bun is often overlooked.  Not here.  The bun that sheathes this slab of ground beef has a handmade feel to it.  It reminded me of bakery style buns and breads from the east coast...not the mass produced plain jane breads and buns we're used to here in the valley.  This bun was the perfect compliment to the meat: it held together nicely even as it sopped up the juices that spilled from the patty.  Oh, and the habanero topping.... nicely done.  Many places tend to over emphasize the heat of the pepper toppings when involving the habanero pepper.  This burger has a lovely balance between the heat and the flavor of the pepper.  No individual component of this burger was overdone.  Each plays its part in a lovely beefy symphony.

My choice of side today was Asian slaw, which only slightly edged out the sweet potato fries.  The slaw alone may be worth going back for.  Again, the dish was pleasing in its balance.  Crisp cabbage in a flavorful dressing, which helped to manage the heat level of the peppers.

For those looking for a a good brew, I was also pleased by the assortment of beers available here.  A nicely chosen selection of microbrews and local beers, in addition to the usual Bud/Coors.

If the wait staff is as attentive in the evenings as they are on Saturday afternoons, you'll have no complaints about the service here.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wings were not good. Tasted very bland. Friendly service though. Not too many people here. TV was way too loud for the amount of people. Not sure how the 'family friendly' fits in: it's just another sports bar with blah food."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bricks for nearly 3 years!!! It is the best place in the area!! Great place to watch sports!!! Food is amazing!! The owners really put a massive emphasis on quality of food and service!! Fresh made everything!! Even the chicken tenders are handmade!! Monday night wing night and football with $6 dozen monster wings!! I love this place everyday of the week!!!"}
{"text":"For anyone who is OK with a Tuesday night 8pm dinner that takes 29 minutes from order to the table, you should go here.  And the owner thinks it's OK, when there were only 2 tables in the place eating.  Wings are good and meaty, and the wing special on Monday is worth it, if you can stand the service and the arrogance of the owner."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the great food, this place wouldn't deserve a star. The place was vacant and we still had terrible service, slow food delivery (30 minutes!), and forgotten drinks. Seems as though the waitresses would rather be on their phones than tend to customers. Doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I can't believe I live so close to this place but have never thought to eat here. It's just one of those places you drive by and don't really notice I suppose, but luckily I read some reviews on Yelp and decided to check it out. I want to thank Carol for her recommendation of the BBQ burger. It was fantastic, one of the best burgers I've ever had. The quality of the food seemed like a nice step up from your typical sports bar fare. I felt so full all night. You know, the good kind of full. The drinks were also very reasonably priced for happy hour and they had a decent selection of beers on tap. Service started out pretty slow and it wasn't at all busy. I think our waitress was a little too busy socializing but eventually we got drinks and placed our orders. It seems like everyone here knows each other, which I like. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I like the ambiance of the place overall. I think I get frustrated by the food usually.  I'm a big foodie so when the menu looks pretty good I'm let down when it's not quite what I conjured up in my head. Mind you the food isn't bad at all I fact it's quite good and apparent that someone in the kitchen knows \"how to cook\". Sometimes I'm not sure what it is but I think it may have to do with seasoning for the food. I once had the Mac and cheese and it was great but there was very low to no salt in the dish which left it incomplete and unsatisfying.  No I'm not a salter, only thing I add salt to after cooking is my eggs and fries. That's it and in cooking many times I half what's called for in recipes.  The wings are usually really good and like the different sauces available. Beer is yummy and cold. Last time I was their I enjoyed eating a bite and sipping a beer with my hubby and watching a guy try to pick up a girl, didn't go so well,..... To funny! Thanks Bricks!"}
{"text":"You know, I have been to Bricks 3 or 4 times and every time I enjoy the food. The owners are great people and most of the food is scratch prepared. My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and fries. The fries are soooo good. The atmosphere is that of a typical sports bar but has other areas that are more than suitable for family dinners. I will continue to go there to enjoy lunch and the company of the friendly bar tender. She is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food here has NEVER let me down.   Service last night was mediocre.   No settings on the tables, had to ask for basics like salt and pepper and don't give me the excuse of 'they're really busy in the kitchen' as a reason why you can't get me more of the sauce that's SUPPOSED to come with my meal!  And it would be nice of you brought those accompanying extras (like lemon for my fish) at the start of my getting it as opposed to 10 minutes into eating it.   
That being said, the burgers are always awesome.   Sliders being counted as burgers.   When you ask for it medium rare it comes out that way!  Love that!   Wing sauces are great.   We've had multiple kinds of them and in the past they've made extra of their extra spicy ghost pepper sauce for my spouse to order.   The Asian slaw is great and we're going to try and make it from home and the fried fish was good, hot and tartar sauce good, too.   
We'll definitely be back, but just know that service is below our standard.   And we'll tip accordingly (15% instead of 20% or 22%).  A little personality from your waitstaff (and promptness-  uh.... That is what TIPS stands for!) wouldn't kill them.   
Additionally, we're thrilled to see a place be successful in this location.  This is the 4th place in this space in 7 years, so kudos for that."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. The burgers are always amazing along with the fish & chips on fridays. I personally recommend the Bbq Burger & the Green Chili Mac and Cheese, food of the gods. Lots of screens to choose from and they always seem happy to switch to something you want to watch near your table."}
{"text":"Only been then once and was not impressed. Typical dive bar: fried food, low light, loud drunk idiots. They turn the TV's up to down out the drunks"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food is amazing! Service was amazing! Super friendly staff.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sliders! Yum! Their gluten free menu is awesome! And the server informed me that all their meat is from Midwestern Meat Packing Co. Soooo good! Ill definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Jennifer C. review ???

I was just wondering in Jennifer's review of Bricks, a couple things ??
Was this her first time at Bricks ?? It sounded like it wasn't with the Owner is always here comment, unless she heard that from others who go there. Also, what did you order that you could have made at home ?? What kind of music did they play ??  What time of the day did you go, considering your comment on the dead atmosphere, I doubt it was a Friday night ?? These type of details help a REAL review for others who come on here to get an idea of the establishment. Considering this was your only review of anyplace, either you are not that experienced at it or there was another purpose for writing it ?? The later of witch I see all too often by competing business's , their employees and their customers, especially when no check's and balances are in place to weed out the REAL reviews from ones with agendas .

I love Bricks food, have been loving it since it opened in October, I suggest to any who will listen : The Filet, Green Chilli Mac and Cheese (add chicken) the Nachos (add steak) or the Salmon Caesar Salad to name a few. I also suggest checking out their Friday or Saturday Nights for a fun atmosphere that is so lacking in East Mesa. This is just my opinion but hopefully I provided enough details to make this a REAL and HELPFUL review for those interested in checking out Bricks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  We received a coupon for a free nacho with purchase of two drinks so we figured we'd give it a try and we were not disappointed.  

The nachos were great they were served on a large plate with big crispy blue corn chips.  There were just enough toppings and the chips didn't get soggy.  I had the Blue Cheese sliders, which were hand formed mini patties.  They were served on a decent bun as well.  My girlfriend had the Garden Grilled cheese, which was really good too. It had portabella mushrooms with tomato 3 different cheeses and a basil pesto spread. It's not something you usually find on a sports bar menu.  It was served with a side salad, which was all spring greens not cheap lettuce.  They have steaks and burgers and some other unique items.  And even though they were short staffed our food came out hot and fresh.

As far as the atmosphere it's a huge place there is a bar area plenty of booths and tables.  They have Touch Tunes, which is cool cause you can download an app on your phone, and play songs directly from your table.  Being jamband fans this meant we could play songs from our favorite bands that aren't normally available on most jukeboxes.  The pricing is ridiculous but if you want to here good music it's a nice option.  They have one huge projector centered over the bar and several other plasmas around the place.  There is also a smoking patio with heaters and more plasmas.

Overall this is a really nice sports bar with unique menu items that go above what you normally find at most sports bars.  It's got a great atmosphere and it's right down the street.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and 20 minutes to get wings on a Sunday night. Place wasn't busy at all. Server apologized a few times and seemed like there may have been other issues, people not showing up for their shifts, bad scheduling, etc. Place not good enough to go back and try it all over again."}
{"text":"The place is very dark and divey.  The booth we sat in had torn upholstery.  The pool tables looked nice and the place had a good crowd at the bar just after 11am (that were discussing David Limbaugh's new book ??? ) plus a family at a table.  This wouldn't be my first choice for a family lunch but it isn't inappropriate.

My friend had the bacon burger with waffle fries and the Asian slaw.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich with waffle fries.    We were surprised to see that the waffle fries were sweet potato but they were crispy and tasty.  My friend liked his burger, but they forgot to put the bacon on and brought it out in bowl, the bacon was obviously overcooked and hard.  The chicken sandwich was well cooked but had a slightly overpowering grill flavor and could have used some kind of sauce.  My friend enjoyed the slaw. My Left Hand Lager was good.

This doesn't sound too bad so why two starts?  The servers were both friendly but inattentive.  I sat with an empty glass for a long time, and it took forever to get the bill and be rang up.  The prices were also too high for the atmosphere.  It was $36 for our lunch, Guinness is $6 a pint.  Monday is $1.50 PBRs but it wasn't Monday and I don't like PBR.  Theme restaurant prices, poor service and a dive bar don't add up to regular stop for me."}
{"text":"How do i say this in a nice way. .... if you don't like this place,  you need to be hit on the head with a tackhammer because you are a 'tard.  Ok,  that's too much,  but still. ... excellent EXCELLENT food (you won't find a better nacho,  but the prime rib, sandwiches,  burgers,  etc, are also genuinely good food,  not just \"for a bar\"),  excellent prices, superb sports bar atmosphere (including a single pool table), and excellent service.  Cool little \"frosty strip\" (as i call it) to set your beer on,  which is cool.   It's super fun to watch a Cardinals game here,  lots of noisy,  excited fans.   HUGE, quality,  projection  screen for the featured game,  too!  A close second to being at the game!"}
{"text":"Good beer good price and great staff and friendly bartender!"}
{"text":"Read alot of the reviews on here about how great this place was so we decided to try it. Our server was nice, but took forever to do anything. It took almost 30 minutes to get our food and it wasn't busy. Wings we ordered well done were far from it and greasy and pink in some areas. Nachos were good but overloaded with cheese and lacked flavor, and she charged me for salsa...seriously! The burger my kid ordered well done was medium rare, sent it back, came back super greasy and burnt. Grilled cheese sandwich is premade, I know this because I asked to alter it and she said I couldn't and they didn't have pickles either. How do u have burgers and sandwiches but no pickles?? The only awesome part were the fries, those were great. Sorely disappointed with service and food quality. I know its supposed to be bar food,  but I've had some great bar food and theirs is crap. How do u have premade grilled cheese? Never coming back here and I don't understand how people rate it so high! Don't waste your time here unless u plan on having fries and beer."}
{"text":"Really good food! Good service! The chicken sliders are super amazing! It's a very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"i just Wanted to reiterate on bricks yes i had the wings once again this guy makes all of his on sauces for the wings i order hot and get a side of extra hot and bring it home i love this sauce i use it on other things ...eggs Mexican food etc what ever floats your boat there are 12 meaty wings per order wife had Chinese chicken salad yummy as well"}
{"text":"I live just around the corner but had never been here. Tried out lunch the other day - it was fantastic!! Try the salmon sliders ... you won't be disappointed. Great food and great service. Hope they stick around for awhile because this is a really nice addition to the somewhat dismal dining scene in East Mesa."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.  I ordered a Bloody Mary noticed the cheese cube had mold on it.  I showed it to my waiter and he said he would tell the manger.  He than asked us if we wanted anything else and we asked to try a sample of the white IPA.  We waited 30 minutes until we had to remind him about our samples, which he said he forgot.  It was getting busy, however, it's football Sunday, they should plan on having more staff working.  After that, I'm pretty sure he did not tell the manger or they did not care about the mold on the cheese.  Did not receive an apology for the mold or the slow service/lack of staff.  I'm only giving two starts because I knew my waiter had a lot tables which he may have forgotten about our table and situation and caused him to lack on checking on our table in an appropriate manner.  We received good service when we were cashing out, however, if there was more staff, things would have been handled bettered."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple drinks and to pick up dinner to go.  Sat at the bar - bartender was friendly and poured decent drinks. Ordered the mac n cheese (no chicken or meat, just the green chilis), and it was RIDICULOUS. So freakin' good.  I dream about that mac n cheese now... wish I lived closer. Except I'd get it every week and my heart & cholesterol would not appreciate that."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was here until my husband come home one day and said he ate a ghost pepper  After about a week of referring to him as \"spice butt hole\" he decided we should both go check out the place. When I got there I was pleased to see that he had invited a few of my friends and family to celebrate the start of my new business!  The group was of about 10 people and our server did a great job, our beer glasses were never empty, our food was yummy and quick and he separated the checks without any difficulty. I go places with groups often (like book club) and these things are important and all too often rare. It's not too far from home and a great place to just hang out. I recommend it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this family-owned bar & grill. Lots of gluten-free options, including the best GF chicken tenders I've had. Great wing deal on Mondays."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here all the time.  The space is big and a great atmosphere for large groups or if you just want to enjoy some drinks with a couple of friends.  Happy hour prices are phenomenal and cheap especially if you get a stein of beer or a well-drink.  The TVs are perfect for anyone wanting to watch a sports match because they have a huge projector screen and a bunch of large TVs scattered all over the place.  The food is also great, and I have tried almost everything on the menu and love it all.  Some of my favorites are the BBQ salad, the cobb salad, the burgers are REALLY GOOD, the ribeye is surprisingly delicious and cooked perfectly (unlike a lot of other sports bars), and the appetizers are all good.  My one complaint that makes this place a four-start location instead of a five-star is that some of the waitresses are not very good at service and I have experienced a couple of them saying inappropriate things and being partial to certain guests.  However, if you're just looking to stop by and try the food and beer out this is a great place to come to."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit, so I can give a really fair review....
The atmosphere is a 3 star at best, much too LOUD for sure.
My first couple of visits were a 2 and a 4, so still a 3 average for my previous visits..
But, today.... Wow..... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE SPICY FOOD. I eat Thai, Mexican and Eastern Indian all the time. So that being said.... Today was the first time I have ever NOT eaten a piece of meat due to it being overly ridiculously spicy hot. I ordered the spicy pineapple teriyaki burger, it was basically not even edible, but I trudged through half of it hoping it would get better, it did not.
My bro got the habanero burger and had had it many times previously and also likes super spicy, his too was over the top hot.
The waitress forgot beverages, ketchup, salad dressing, didn't refill drinks in a timely manner.
I'm not hating, just being truthful, I want to like the place....
When we mentioned that my burger was not edible, no response (or discount), just took my plate and left with the other half that I didn't eat....
I won't return here, but I can see where some of the food is good and if you are into a dark divey bar for a drink and a game, give it a try. I'm more of a foody and when I go out I want something tasty and filling....."}
{"text":"Sorry to be the first to review and tell of the blah experience.  It's not to say this place doesn't have potential.  It is located on busy Power Road between Guadalupe and Baseline.  It has an outdoor patio and plenty of inside seating.  The walls are all Brick (don't know if that is due to the name or what).  Simple sports decor and comfortable seating...plenty of big booths for large groups. 

BTW (This used to be the location of Double Overtime Grill)

There were about 4 people at the bar on this Thursday night.  The waitress was wonderful (there were only 2 other tables during our visit).  She recommended the Green Chile Mac and Cheese and their nightly special of Carne Asada Tacos (i should have listened).  I went for the steak sliders with mushrooms and onions.  They were pretty good, especially when I asked for additional horsey sauce.  The french fries were the side, and no substitutions.  They were bland (only salted) and tasted like they were cooked in old oil.  M had the grilled chicken sandwich with asian coleslaw.  The chicken sandwich was one I could have made at home.  Nothing spectacular, but the asian slaw was different, and tasted sweet and salty.  It was good.  

The menu has a big selection of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, and entrees.  I will go back to try the mac and cheese and a couple other things.  
They also have plenty of televisions to watch sports, so I assume Sunday would be a big day for them.  Maybe we will try a Monday night football dinner and see if they are any busier.  

All in all, I wasn't impressed with the food, but they DO have potential.  The server listened to my comments about the food and said it is always good for the cook to know about what customers think.  So I WILL go back and write an update.   Hopefully 2nd time is better."}
{"text":"This place is your average sports bar.  Good for beer....not so good for Margaritas.  The blue corn nachos taste really good, but the blue corn chips are not actual blue corn....but dyed corn tortilla chips.  Don't want to tell you how I know this, cuz it's gross.  We've only been here on Saturday afternoons while my son's at guitar.  There's usually only 1...maybe 2 people working.  Sometimes it takes a while for our order to be taken, but generally the service is good.  They have pool tables lots of televisions.  Overall, a decent place."}
{"text":"We tried Brick's tonight and were very pleased! Erin was fabulous! We sat outside and never felt forgotten. My dozen wings will last me for days...huge portion. I ordered medium and was satisfied, not hot but a little kick. My guy ordered the green chili sliders and tater tots and loved both. I couldn't do the red meat but his tots were awesome! I highly recommend the pumpkin porter!"}
{"text":"Good food and a friendly staff. The service was very prompt and greeted you at the door making you feel very welcome. I would recommend the Chicken Saltimbo,  Awesome! They are family friendly but the ambiance is more tavern oriented than family."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. Stood at the hostess station for 10 minutes without as much as a look from anyone. It's no wonder this place was empty minus a few early drunks. We tried, and never will again."}
{"text":"Big Ass Burgers. Menu right to the point. Lots of TVs for your sports. Nice service.
Back to the Brick tonight for Monday night wings. Have to say worth the $6.00 hands down. All the basic favors and got up to 10 to 12 pieces. Our new waitress Brenda is a down to earth gal who tells you like it is. She made it a point to make us feel welcome. If your in the area you'd be dumb for not stopping in. Keeping it real."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sports bars ever. The food is amazing as far as sports bars go. They have a lot of televisions and the place is fairly kid friendly.

We come for the Cards game every week. The people are always friendly and the environment is open and laid back."}
{"text":"I went to Bricks by chance with my family. I had never been there before and I was expecting it to be impossible to find something I could eat that was gluten free. When I asked about dedicated fryers, etc. The server told me about all the gluten free options, I was WOWED! I ended up getting the chicken fingers and chicken wings (yes, a little redundant). SO GOOD! We even went back the following day."}
{"text":"This is the place to go. Wait don't go. It's perfect without you there. (if you do go, get the nachos!)"}
{"text":"Great food, cool place, and great people.  Stop in and try their monday wing special for only 5 bucks.  Great deal.  The only thing I can suggest is they need to show soccer.  lol. 

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"It's nothing fancy, but I'm a huge fan. Lots of TVs that the staff will gladly change to accommodate a sports fan. One of the few places in the valley that will show soccer games without being asked too.

The staff is super friendly and know how to have a good time too. It's definately a good place to be a regular at, but they treat the first-timers just as good.

For a sports bar, the food is super good. I'm a huge fan of the mac n cheese and I ask for some Habenaro paste in it just for the added heat. So good! The green chile burger is another yummy choice. And if you're ever in the mood for beer and wings, you're completely in luck!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tend to meet work friends here pretty often. Its quiet so that's why we like to go. It never seems to be too busy. The food is typical bar food, nothing really stands out but it is edible. The service is good if you are in the actual bar area, if you sit in the \"outskirts\" the seem to sometimes forget about you. We did have to wait quit awhile for our check."}
{"text":"First of all, I am usually leery about sports bars because a) i am not a sports fan and b) im not a big drinker.  But on this particular night, my husband and I needed somewhere to grab something to eat and he was interested in this specific bar.  We walked in and the atmosphere felt like someones garage. Everyone knew the staff and each other. We sat down and I immediately felt out of place.  Took us 10 minutes to get anyone to even acknowledge us. Which was weird because there were at least 5 servers standing around chatting literally right in front of us.  We got some drinks and immediately ordered.  While we were waiting for our food, a girl dressed in short shorts and high heels came around asking if we wanted shots of fireball whiskey.. I am 9 months pregnant so i politely declined but my husband took a shot (without being carded, and we are in our 20s). Once we got our food, we were totally turned off. greasy burgers and salty french fries were what we received.  Among all of this, there was a family with a very young baby being passed around while everyone shouted and drank beer. Im surprised the waitress didnt ask her if she wanted a shot.  Bottom line, this is a place where regulars are treated with the utmost respect and decency and newcomers are thrown by the wayside.  The place is entirely too dark and has a horrible atmosphere.  The food is bad and the service is even worse."}
{"text":"Everyone always is friendly. The service is consistently great and the food is SO good.
Freshly made. Great portions. Very nice casual atmosphere and comfy patio"}
{"text":"This place has good food not just your typical pub food. It's a bit more classy."}
{"text":"If anyone knows where they moved to please message me. There was a sign on the door after closing but no contact info."}
{"text":"This is not typical bar food. High quality meat and ingredients prepared by the chef/owner. Between me and my husband we have tried almost everything and have never been disappointed. Not on East Mesa? Make the drive if you want great food. A few favorites: beer can chicken, BBQ burger, garden grilled cheese, and buffalo chicken sandwich. Sweet potato fries are a must!"}
{"text":"this chef can cook!  never had something I didnt like.  and the filet is to die for and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try this place.  No hostess, no sign to say seat yourself.  Stood by the empty hostess stand for 10 minutes.  No employee made eye contact with me despite walking by on numerous occasions.  I left.  If they don't care enough to even seat their guests, then I don't care if I ever try it again."}
{"text":"Once again I find myself back here at Bricks. I've been coming here for a few years now; the name has changed a few times, but the great food and service has been a delightful constant. I've had several dishes and never had a complaint about a single one. I can heartily recommend the Green Chile Burger, the Blue Cheese Steak Salad, the Wings, the Garden Grilled Cheese (great with a side salad), the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and the Chipotle BBQ Ribs - I've had them all and they've been very delicious and satisfying, every time.

With great compliments like 12 large screen TVs (various sizes),  karaoke night (Tuesdays at 8pm) and free wi-fi, Bricks is a must-visit addition to the East Valley. Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quiet little sports bar. Nothing too fancy, small menu, decent food. Waitress got three things wrong with the order but somehow still managed to charge for extra dressing."}
{"text":"We finally found our favorite Happy Hour spot!!

GREAT food! Great beer, (unlike other spots in the area that only serve the same old tired domestic choices during happy hour), and great service!!

After reading the many reviews about the nachos, they were the first thing we ordered. Thanks to everyone who posted on this tip! Our OMG meter hasn't peaked like this in a looong time. Other items ordered included the Habanero Burger, the BBQ Chicken Flatbread, the Spinach Dip, and the Chicken Quesadilla - all of which were utterly delicious and generous portions. 

Thanks, Bricks! We'll see you again real soon. ;)"}
{"text":"Jessica is awesome!   Start out with the nachos-smoked gouda  & fresh topping like guacamole! !  Hamburgers were perfect!   Chicken quesadilla was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a sports on par to Blue 32  but unfortunately it fell short. It is definitely more upscale than your average sports bar. It gets a A for that and the pool table plus foosball. There were under staffed but the service was still decent, albeit slow. We were disappointed in the food. Good but nothing I would make an effort to come back to. Wings, grilled artichoke and salmon cakes just ok. Maybe we should have tried the burgers. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"What happened to this place??? I loves there food!! Only bar that I actually wanted to eat at and now they are closed. =( sad"}
