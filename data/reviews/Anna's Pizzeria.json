{"text":"Our choice for high quality pizza when we want to splurge. It's a case of \"you get what you pay for\". Great crust, sauce, toppings, etc. although the mushrooms are canned rather than fresh, unfortunately. But the Italian sausage is fabulous."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Stop by whenever we get to Sun Prairie. Best thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area.  Beats chain restaurants hands-down.  I haven't had anything better anywhere else in Madison so far."}
{"text":"FYI, Anna's is now carryout and delivery only.  Tried it for the first time today and was very impressed.  Great light, crispy crust and while some pizzas go for the \"spice bomb in your mouth\" approach Anna's has a more subtle flavor, which seems to be pretty common from around here and south to Rockford.  If you've been to Jim's in Janesville it's similar, but less sweet.  Yes, Anna's does use canned mushrooms but there was a time when just about EVERY pizza joint in this part of the country used them, and they're what a lot of us remember and love."}
{"text":"I've never been to Anna's so I can't comment on the atmosphere or service.  I have had delivery twice now and I haven't been impressed.  The first time was ok.  The pizza is nice and cheesy and good toppings but the crust is really bland and not impressive.   The second time was god awful.  It was a stormy night so I believe they were having some timing issues.  I ordered a pizza and cheese bread.  It took so long to get my order that by the time it arrived it smelled and tasted like the cardboard box(not kidding). I could make better cheese bread with white bread and cheddar cheese.  There was absolutely no seasoning...it was a little bit of mozz sprinkled on tiny slices of italian bread.  I will never order from them again.  I'll sooner buy a frozen pizza for what I have to spend at Anna's."}
{"text":"There is a reason why Anna's pizza has won so many awards and its not the canned mushrooms or the mediocre additional menu items... it's the pizza!   Please note, if you want to spend $5 for a pizza this is not the place for you. Their pizzas are more expensive than many of the chain pizza places out there, but they are well worth the money. Homemade sauce, quality meats, crispy fresh crust and oily mozzarella are what make this place great.    The restaurant is still family owned and run. Anna's is now only takeout and delivery, however, they have a few beers on tap and a place for you to sit while you wait for the to put the final touches on your made to order pizza. They do not take credit cards.   If you are in the area looking for a quality pizza without all the frills this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Website listed is wrong, here's the correct one : http://www.annaspizzeria.net/  Got Anna's Pizza about a week ago for pickup at 8pm.  my husband arrived on his way home to pick it up about 15 min early and was happy to wait 15 min past the estimated time before the 'zza was done.  The family staff was nice to chat with, as he did the whole 30 min he was there.  Our pizzas :  12\" green olives, onion and sausage (housemade, according to Anna)                        12\" anchovies and tomatoes The total came to less than $30.  We had nearly a whole pizza left after the 2 of us ate till full.    both where delish !    We try to eat healthy, so it's always disappointing whole grain crust isn't more available, but their crust (thin by default) was a good, thin white crust - a neutral vehicle for everything else.   It's homemade crust and isn't soggy in middle like some can be.  It's not cracker-thin, but if you want it, maybe ask?    The cheese is real good, genuine oily mozzarella.  Neither sauce or cheese was skimpy  (like some other reviewers said they experienced).  If you are worried about too little sauce, maybe request a side to dip and double cheese is available by request.    Though their selection is smaller and less adventurous, we agreed it was just as good as the highly esteemed Salvatore's pizzas.      We will order again soon and try lasagna, garlic bread and salad too.    PICKUP and DELIVERY ONLY, no dine-in.    CASH or LOCAL CHECK ONLY, no plastic currency accepted."}
{"text":"Wow this place is terrible!!!!!  We ordered a four slice garlic cheese bread. We got two slices of itty bitty bread cut in half to make four pieces. Worse part, it was store bought bread dabbed with butter with a spit of cheese that was barely melted on top. Add insult to injury, the sauce was fresh out of the fridge. Seriously???  The pizza had a healthy serving of canned mushrooms and bits of rubber resembling green peppers. Completely unappetizing. What a total waste of money!!!!  Never again!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The people who run this place are very friendly. It's more pricey than other pizza places in town but the quality of the product is top notch. I can't attest to any of their other menu items because I've only had the pizza. You definitely can't go wrong with the pizza here."}
{"text":"We got the pepperoni, mushroom and black olive pizza.  $20 for 16 inches, and cut in rectangles.  Thin, crispy crust.  Very tasty!  Only minor complaint is that they don't take credit cards, but as long as that's known, you can plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Wow, we ordered delivery. They were so nice to deliver all the way out to highway C and Vinburn. *Note to self* send Anna's a thank you card for the delivery of piping hot fresh pizza, J loved the Works pizza I ordered. Anna's definitely does not skimp on the toppings or real moz cheese. Another HUGE bonus was the bacon being super fresh too. I still like salvatore pies but this \"pizza war\" in SP does not even equivilate. Anna's is more of a traditional American pizza done right with fresh ingredients and tangy zesty sauce, which I'd order by the shot glass if they had a bar. My only regret is that I did not order from Anna's sooner."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've found in town.  Always friendly even to us relocated \"flatlanders\"."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant with the old-school wood panelling and cheapie tables and chairs.  Only Bud and Miller on tap and they don't take credit or debit cards.   The older woman who runs the place (Anna?) was adorable and super sweet, so I hate to say anything bad about the food.  That being said, the pizza was allright, but they used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  If I am paying $12 for a pizza, I expect fresh ingredients.  Anna's is actually right next to a Domino's and between the two of them, Anna's wins hands down, but it's pretty easy to find a better pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"ANNA's  pizza is to die for.  Anna's sauce is amazing and NO she will not share the receipt...... I've asked many times.  This is a small Mom & Pop and Anna's family is fully involved. Her husband Jeff makes the Pizza, Lonnie does the deliveries, and Anna is the waitress.  If you are looking for a fast meal, this is not the place, but if you want the best pizza ever, then it is worth the wait.  HINT:  If you are going to dine in, call and order your pizza ahead of time. Anna will set up a table and everything waiting when you arrive.  Quaint atmosphere with wonderful staff that just wants your experience to be the best possible."}
{"text":"Easily among the best pizza places into the area and my go to in sp.  Great sauce and thin crust and love anna!"}
{"text":"pizza is great but ordered a salad and garlic bread both of which were a joke.  basically other a quarter head of iceburg lettuce and a side of dressing that was the entire salad.  it should have read lettuce not salad. literally not even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce.   the order of garlic bread,  well that was two pieces of hard toast the size of the palm of my hand.  would order again only if it was for pizza alone."}
{"text":"Best traditional pizza in Sun Praire! Always hot and mmm mmm good! 5 stars! I would give more stars but there are only 5 allowed. Seriously, it is an old school pizza style that is hard to find these days. The best!"}
{"text":"Have always found Anna's to be an excellent choice for a great thin crust and very cheese heavy pizza."}
{"text":"I didn't know I liked thin crust pizza until I tried Anna's! I've never actually been TO Anna's. We've ordered delivery both times I've had it so far. Also, as far as I can tell, they don't have an online menu. We ordered the works off of a recommendation on a review and it.is.delicious. The garlic bread is great too!  Our order arrived to our house in a very timeline manner and the delivery guy was really friendly!  If you're looking for thin crust pizza in Sun Prairie, I haven't had better than Anna's."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area that I've found.  It's a little pricey, so I only get it on special occasions, but it's dang tasty."}
{"text":"There's no place like Anna's pizza. Anywhere! The best lil mom n pop (& son) joint with awesome thin crust pizza. Anna uses her Gramma's recipe and the best ingredients-- the sauce is not too acidic, not to sweet or spicy-- it's just right. Our favorite is double cheese, onion, and green olive. It's da bomb! You will never find coupons for Anna's either. But I (coupon queen) believe it's worth it any time we celebrate something special, we order Anna's and bring it home with a bottle of fine wine for a perfect celebration of life with a touch of Anna's. Try it, it's worth it! Leftovers are awesome-- but rarely do you have any!"}
