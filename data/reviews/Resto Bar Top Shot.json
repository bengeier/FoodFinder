{"text":"We went to Top-Shot to see a band play on the recommendation of a friend. The food was good; ribs and chicken. The service was also good. The show was really good. The sound, however, was terrible. We left before the show was over because we couldn't stand it any more. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Came here not really knowing what to expect and out two very happy people please try the chicken wings and the rips to die for will def come again all the way from Montreal and please come and see the bar tender she is really nice and great service"}
{"text":"A couple years ago, when I was visiting the family cottage, we were feeling lazy and not wanting to cook after a long day on the lake. We had heard about Top Shot from the neighbors, and we decided to head into town and give it a try. It's definitely more of a bar, but they had some seating in the front away from the pool tables. I feel the place could be fun later at night when it's an older crowd. I had a half rack of ribs with fries. The ribs were delicious, and I loved the sauce on them. We actually came back a few days later because we enjoyed them so much. This place is perfect when you want a nice, filling meal and an ice cold beer after a long day."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a group of seven other friends early on a Monday evening. There's not a lot of other restaurants open in Lachute on Mondays, so this seemed like a good choice. I want to stress that the service was excellent, and our waiter was extremely helpful, even bringing the table a round of samples of the local beer to try out before we ordered.

I ordered the half-rack of ribs and chicken breast ($15.99). The ribs were excellent - cooked just right, with a very tasty sauce. I would definitely order them again! The chicken breast (actually the breast and wing) was enormous. Unfortunately, it was also overcooked to the point where it was chalky and dry, completely inedible. The poutine we ordered (both regular and \"chicken\" - small bits of flavorless chicken breast meat scattered throughout) was bland and also not worth ordering.

To be fair, it appears that point of the restaurant is as pool and sports bar, and if you go for this and maybe order some ribs and a beer, you'll have a fine time. Just don't get too fancy!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a beer and a live show. I wouldn't go there without a good band playing... there are better alternatives like the Caucus. That said, Top Shot gets the best bands in town."}
{"text":"I love a good burger and usually willing to try something new. This wasn't my first time at Top Shots and I remember it being pretty good last time. I got a burger and some Poutine, which is fries with gravy and cheese curd. Food was good and services was friendly. The place was a little run down but still not to badly beaten up. The business looked like it was waiting for the bar crowd. Tip about Poutine, if your system isn't use to it there could be side effects, it is a bit heavy."}
{"text":"The Half rack of ribs I got were very delicious, (I should have gotten the whole rack). The barbecue sauce on them was very sweet and oh so very good. My husband got the fish and chips which he thought were good, a nice size portion. The nachos were tasty but a little skimpy, they should double the amount of chips and lower the price, $15.95 is a little pricey for nachos with no meat on them. We were a group of eight adults and they sat us in a reasonable amount of time. The place looks small but is very big inside. We all were satisfied and would go back again."}
