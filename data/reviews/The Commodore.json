{"text":"I'm really surprised by the 4.5 rating. The restaurant was nice, the service was good but almost too good our food came way too fast for a relaxed dining experience. The food was ok. Very mediocre absolutely nothing to write home about and the portion sizes didnt really match the prices. Wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited The Commodore for brunch and it was fantastic!   I ordered the chicken club with hard salad, she had tiramisu pancakes and grits; everything was fresh, well prepared, and delicious. I had a Caesar, which was heavy on the lemon juice and light on the spices, which is my only negative, but likely comes down to personal preference.  The waitress was friendly and helpful, service was speedy, and the atmosphere was great.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time in Toronto. Amazing food/service/atmosphere... Best I've had in a while and I live NYC! Five stars without a doubt"}
{"text":"Excellent experience start to finish. We were a group of four and ordered nearly everything off the small yet surprisingly varied menu. The bavette and shrimp toast were our favourites, but every dish was flavourful and delicious. The restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived, but by the time we left, there were no empty seats. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Toronto recently and trying to find a good place to eat near my place. The Commodore was the first one I tried. I was there for their dinner. We ordered seafood tower, Cauliflower Gratin, Duck Confit Banh Xeo and Atlantic Cod Risotto. Everything is delicious and portion size is reasonable. Cocktails are very good, too. We went back again on the weekend for the Brunch. We order Truffled Scrambled Eggs & Prosciutto, Eggs Benedict, Fluffy Pancakes and a side order of Pea Meal Bacon. The pancakes are to die for! It is really fluffy! The Russian style hollandaise is very light. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic night here with some friends sampling a few items on their menu and sipping on some well prepared cocktails. The service was super attentive and I really enjoyed myself. Just a cute little addition in Parkdale. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chef Jon knows what's up. Everything I've ever eaten there is beyond delicious. Don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"Holy shit is all I can say. Every dish was so on point. We were a group so we ordered almost everything. The duck, risotto, seafood tower and the surprise of it all the bread were phenomenal. And so cheap!"}
{"text":"While the food was well-executed, the ambiance was great, and the service was stellar, I can't help but think that these tapas-style restaurants are designed to keep Torontonians poor and hungry.   We spent $80.00 on dinner for two, but, just like other \"sharing\" restaurants, we were still peckish at the end. Is anyone else out there feeling like this tapas trend has to end? I mean,  one Vietnamese cracker covered in duck? You expect me to share that? I'm barely over 100 pounds, but even I can't survive off of that-- even if I eat three of them.  Don't get me wrong, though-- as I said earlier, the food is good.   It's not only The Commodore I'm talking about, but the rise of tapas-hungry Toronto in general.  Honestly, I'm tired of having an empty wallet and an empty stomach at the end of the night.  Is it just me?"}
{"text":"Wow I like interesting and different and these guys hit it on the button. Great vibe in the restaurant, I want to go back and try some more things!"}
{"text":"I love the commodore more for its interior design than their menu. I appreciate the unique brunch choices but my bf and I found our meals to be waaaaaaaaay too fishy. He ordered the octopus and I ordered the trout salad which were both just mediocre.  On the other hand, the tiramisu pancakes were delicious and something I would order again."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner we just had! Portions are on the smaller side but packed with flavor that leave you so satisfied at the end of the night.   The corn risotto was amazing (best dish for me) and perfect with the sourdough bread (extra charge) that was ordered. Bavette steak had an amazing topping to it. Snow crab linguine was tasty too but this would be my only criticism of the night - it tasted almost exactly like the lobster linguine at Hot House Cafe, not a bad thing except the portions on the latter are literally 3x the size. The pumpkin pudding was so intense in flavor and the berry trifle was yummy too.  We also had 3 cocktails and they were also very unique. I feel I am doing the resto an injustice by not describing the dishes more in detail but (except for the snow crab pasta dish) every single one had such unique flavors no doubt based on the all the masterful ingredients melded perfectly in the dish. Like the corn risotto had sunchokes and this amazing green (forgot what) and other ingredients that made what seemed a plain dish amazingly layered. I just don't remember what they all were just that they tasted delicious! Same with the pur√©e that came with the steak.  Service was great too! We got window ledge seating and a small suggestion for The Commodore would be get more comfortable high chair seating, they were pretty uncomfortable almost the minute you sat in them. But the food made you forget all about that!"}
{"text":"After hearing really good things about this new restaurant from a friend, we decided to make the trek across town to grab some small plates and cocktails. I started with 6 oysters, which came with really original ginger mignonette as well as the  spicy-sweet Korean gochujang sauce. Next time I'll get 12 - they were perfect. We snacked on Swordfish Crudo (amazing, balanced, little heat), as well as the Smoked Mackerel Rillette (my date loved this one, so creamy and flavorful). Bartenders here know the art of cocktails too so it's worth trying their house specialties. Beautiful interior which suits the neighborhood well. I really wanted to try the duck confit crepe so will have to visit again real soon."}
{"text":"Maybe if you only have ten tables, you shouldn't exclusively take reservations. Walking not welcome here."}
{"text":"Food here is okay but isn't justified by its portion size or price. We ordered 5 dishes, the only tnotable one being the spinach risotto halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly and the risotto giving a very unique taste. We also tried the Cape Breton Shrimp (basically garlic butter shrimp on bread), beef cheek (just taste like stewed beef on mashed potatoes), bone marrow pasta (sound shops but was disappointed) and the duck confit (very unique, decent flavour).   Each dish is about $15, and restaurant is tapas style. This place may be nice to try once but I don't think I would return again."}
{"text":"I went there for a few drinks before my night out, and I been to my fair share or bars and tapas, this place made it for me for Matt and his service alone, such an out going guy, best customer service I have seen in a long time,  I was blown away by his passion, we need more bartenders like him in the industry."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was happy that there isn't a wait. I ordered the eggs Benny, the first bite was amazing - and then it got really salty that I couldn't finish it. But even with that I have to give it 4 stars because the pancakes with espresso syrup was amazing balls. They were the fluffiest pancakes I've ever had. I was happy when I had them and forgot about the salty Benny's."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot! We came to visit another place on Queen and needed somewhere to wait.  Ducked into this place, wow what a spot! The ambiance is amazing, cool and cozy. Great music. Great service. I had a Lolita, which is an Earl Grey infused Bullet Rye with Nonino Amaro, Islay Scotch, Lemon and Egg.  Wyatt knows his way around a drink let me tell you!  Will definitely be coming back to try the menu."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Had dins with some friends tonight and it was delicious. We ordered the oysters, seafood tower, smoked trout and kale salad, gnocchi, swordfish and one more dish, which I don't remember. Everyone seemed very pleased with their dishes. My fave was the smoked trout and kale salad. Sweet Jesus, that dish was divine.   I had white wine tonight, but when I return I will cocktail-it-up. Believe that. We sat at the bar and each drink the bartender made looked pretty and I'm sure they tasted damn fine.   Love the decor, too. For some reason I kept thinking I was on The Love Boat. Trust me, it's a good thing.  Lastly, service was great! Both the hostess and the bartender were friendly and accommodating. Not your typical douchey, hipster joint in Parkdale. Yay!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch, great service, very cute place, excellent pancakes!  Can't wait to go back for dinner"}
{"text":"Are you tired of lining up for brunch? Or paying too much for brunch food that you could probably make at home? Come to the commodore for brunch!  Recommend: Shrimp grits, egg benedicts, kale smoked trout salad  The window seat is perfect for people watching for a slow start of your weekend. The atmosphere is relaxing and there's never a rush. Coffee is from Sam James (cut coffee). The instagram-able decoration is an homage from Captain John's."}
{"text":"Very good food! Came for brunch, restaurant very busy during Sunday morning. Tried their pancakes, delicious!!! Will definitely go back for the pancakes. Egg Benedict was very good as well. 4 stars because servers need to be more attentive."}
{"text":"Finally got to cross the Commodore off my list! Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. The interior really is quite charming with its white curved walls and nautical themed lighting. Even the surrounding curved walls leading to the bathrooms still hold the decor theme together nicely.  We sampled a few things, and nothing disappointed. The Zucchini Parmigiana was the one thing that was a little weird as the hot cooked zucchini was smothered with cold straciatella cheese which created a weird mix of temperature, but the taste combination was smooth and pleasing. The bavette steak was tender and cooked to a nice pinkish hue, and then sliced and plated nicely over creamy pureed potatoes. Great plate appeal and a tasty meal. Portions are a bit small but nothing on the menu is over $20 so it balances out.  Drink menu is almost comically large in size compared to the food menu. The downside is that while you are eating they leave a food menu but not a drink menu so its hard to be able to try different drinks with your meal. Luckily in my case, they had Leftfield Brewing's Resin Bag IPA which is a local brewed favourite, so my needs were easily met. But personally I'm a believer that you should always have a drink menu on the table. Service was admittedly a little inattentive at times but friendly on approach.   3 plates, 3 glasses of wine and 3 beers came to about $115 post-tax/pre-tip so its not a cheap night out, but it is a great date spot. They do offer reservations, and even on a week night the place was busy, so do take advantage of that fact to help ensure you get a good table instead of having to sit at the bar or in the window ledge seats."}
{"text":"So good.  Duck confit, shrimp bread, amazing.  Risotto, oysters, a bit less amazing but still pretty awesome.  This gin-based drink that went down way too easy ... goes down easy.  Chill spot for some good eats and drinks.  Just really unpretentious, laid-back kind of atmosphere here."}
{"text":"The Commodore is adorable! From the large potted lights to the mismatched plates and small UK flags in the brown sugar, I fell in love the moment I walked in for brunch.   I ordered a coffee to start but unfortunately it was warm and tasted a bit watered down (deduct 1 star). I'm not a coffee snob but I would at least like my coffee hot! However that did not deter me from enjoying myself.   Among the 3 of us we ordered the shrimp & grits, octopus frittata, truffled scrambled eggs, a full order of the tiramisu pancakes, and the fresh ginger beer to share.   For me, the star of the show was the truffled scrambled eggs followed (very) closely by the shrimp & grits. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and seasoned to perfection, the truffle flavour was there but not too overpowering. The prosciutto added a nice salty contrast to the creaminess of the eggs, truffle and creme fraiche. All of it was sitting on a delicious chewy pancake.   What really intrigued me about the shrimp & grits was the anchovy brown butter. Butter and anchovy are two of my favourite things so when I saw them together I had to have it! The grits was a nice texture and consistency, not too runny. The anchovy flavour was subtle but definitely identifiable and added an extra umami kick to the dish.  The octopus frittata was, unfortunately, underwhelming for me. It was actually what attracted my friends and I to the Commodore to begin with so we were really excited to try it. Nothing about it was really stood out. Perhaps because I tasted after the strong flavours of the other two dishes, the frittata taste bland.  The tiramisu pancakes came out at the same time as all our other dishes yet we got started on it last. This was a mistake as the whipped cream become a bit runny and the pancakes were no longer warm. Despite this, they were still a treat! In hindsight we should have asked the server to bring it last or wait until we were done our entrees to order the pancakes - rookie mistake!   The ginger beer was spicy and really had a kick from the real ginger they blend! I highly recommend it if you're a fan of ginger beer. I imagine it would taste even better with some dark rum (ahem Dark and Stormy anyone??).   Overall I really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and service here and plan on coming back for the dinner menu. Another fun surprise was that the bill comes out in an old book! I'm a book worm so this really amused me! Parking can be found on the street."}
{"text":"What we ate:  - Halibut ceviche  - Swordfish crudo - Duck confit crepe - Grilled Bavette Steak - Coconut cream pie pudding  The swordfish crudo was crisp and fresh with delicious crispy chicken skin on top to balance out the acidity of the vinaigrette and the delicate texture of the fish. The ceviche was certainly not as delicate and the pickled carrot and daikon seemed to overpower. The duck confit crepe was a warm, savoury open faced taco of sorts, but in a much more sophisticated form. The duck was perfectly cooked and and the peanuts and mayo were great on top. The grilled Bavette Steak was peppery and cooked perfectly. Solid dish served with a nice medley of asparagus and cauliflower. The coconut cream pie pudding was a nice ending to the meal. Good service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Commodore is a small low key unassuming spot with surprisingly great food.  We (4 guests) shared the seafood tower, two steak bavettes, softshell crab sandwich, and the braised pork cheek/tongue and we all still had room for dessert. (When I say shared I mean we shared the seafood tower and were supposed to split up the mains, but the mains were so good no one wanted to share them).  The seafood tower was smaller than I expected but turned out to be an awesome assortment. Huge snow crab legs, light crispy Haddock fritters, oysters, and this amazing fish tartar.  As with most West end Toronto restaurants our server was pretty stunned, (potentially stoned?), but the food was so excellent I'd go back again and again."}
{"text":"Nailed it!  We ate: - Pea meal bacon grilled cheese (5/5): That sour dough bread was so perfectly toasted!  - Famous eggs benny (4/5): Overall I loved this dish, the pastrami and sauerkraut were great additions, did not love the consistency of the hollandaise. - Peach Bellini(s) (5/5): SO GOOD   Great ambiance, good food and drinks! Next time, fluffy pancakes! Best of all, you can make reservations :)"}
{"text":"First time having brunch at this place. I was quite excited from the hype that a friend told us. I wasn't disappointed. Despite of the smaller portion the egg Benedict looked, it was very filling. Definitely recommended and I'll have my second visit in the future."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed both brunch and dinner. For brunch I had the Reuben Eggs Benedict - it's an interesting dish, with a very unique flavor to it. It wasn't necessarily something I will seek out again, but it was worth trying. For dinner, we landed on the seafood tower, which was unusual for us. It was good with lots of selection. This will be a restaurant we eat at several times."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a great night.  They have 7 draught beers that i have never heard of that all hAve unique flavours, try them out.  For their dishes it ranges from as light as their halibut ceviche, that had this fish sauce lime vinaigrette, to as rich as their pork cheeks topped with peaches. Dont forget to order their sour dough which is made in house! Delicious.  Worth coming down to visit in the vast restaurant in queen west."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 friends on one of their quieter nights. Ordered the seafood tower - portion was on the smaller size but it was a perfect sharing appetizer. Extremely fresh and delicious accompaniments for the oysters! Risotto: divine. Service: excellent, friendly, and we felt very welcome to stay a long time (and we did!). For me best part other than the food was the decor and ambiance. Dim, romantic, and all white."}
{"text":"This little restaurant has a lot to offer in terms of flavour, atmosphere and service. Let's dig in:  First, the food. For two, we ordered and shared: - The duck confit crepe (although maybe a little on the small side, this was delicious. The crepe had a nice crisp to it and was a great contrast to the savoury, tender duck.) - The bread (now I know this is simple, but this bread is so good! Do yourself a favour, though - order it last and save it for the leftover sauces on your plates. I wish I had done this!) - The Brussels sprouts (I don't typically like Brussels sprouts but these changed my mind. The sweet but savoury sauce, the chunks of pork...yum.) - the bavette steak (this tasted like home. A quite generous portion of steak you can cut with a butter knife, atop creamy mashed potatoes and smothered in mushroom gravy. It's the priciest thing on the menu but, especially if you're sharing, it's worth it.)  The service was great. Rarely longed for anything (except our candle to be relit!) and the servers seemed extremely knowledgable. Also the cocktails were fantastic.   Make sure to book a reservation as this place is pretty tiny - but what it lacks in size it makes up for by offering a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The initial walk in is great. Nautical decor gets you in the mood for the fishy goodness you're about to enjoy. Ordered the Seafood Tower and holy fish was it good. A perfect mixture of items and flavors. The highlights of the tower were the snow crab legs, grilled octopus, and rainbow trout. If you love seafood it's a must try."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for some drinks and dinner and found the commodore to be delightful. Plates here are made for sharing, making it a great place to go with some friends for casual food and drinks.   Ambiance: 4/5  - The restaurant is quite small, but makes great use of its limited space. We didn't make a reservation but were seated at the bar. This turned out to be a plus as the bar tender was friendly and offered great recommendations on food and drinks.   Service: 5/5 - The bartender was very attentive and doubled as great waiter. He offered insight into what foods would go well together, and also staggered the dishes so as to create a nice flow to the meal and ensured that all out plates wouldn't all come out at once and overwhelm the small amount of space we had at the bar.   Drinks: 4/5 - The drink menu is great, not too many choices so as to be overwhelming, but also a good variety of options. I had The Tenant, a gin and vermouth based drink served in a champagne coupe. It was pleasant and was a great compliment to the meal. Beyond that they offered a number of different options for traditional drinks as well.   Food: 4/5 - Salumi Board (5/5): The house cured meats were splendid, loved the wine-cured beef carpaccio. Would definitely recommend getting this with the fresh sourdough for the extra $2.50, the bread was lovely and game toasted which made it a great companion for the salumi.   - Edamame and Roasted Carrot Salad (2/5): This was the only disappointing part of the night and the food. The salad seemed lackluster and almost tasted like something you would find at an all you can eat style Japanese restaurant.   - Braised Duck Hard Crepe  (4/5): The duck was lovely, and the accompanying flavor of the kewpie mayo, scallions, and peanuts paired really well with it. This dish proved somewhat more difficult to share as it tended to fall apart when we tried to cut it up for individual plating.   - Venison Ragu Gnocchi (5/5): This dish knocked it out of the park, it was rich and creamy without feeling too heavy. The gnocchi were fresh and light, making the dish incredibly enjoyable.   - Beef Cheeks on Pomme Puree (4/5): The cheeks were lovely, and tasted quite nice. The cheeks themselves seemed to be more stewed and would flake apart. Overall this was a pretty tasty dish as well.   All in all the commodore was a great place and offered a nice variety of options on the menu, I look forward to coming back and giving some of the seafood options a try."}
{"text":"I've only tried The Commodore for brunch but...going once was definitely not enough. Brunch at this small Parkdale restaurant is amazing. Only gone twice, both times I've managed to find a table for 2 around noon time. The restaurant has a good flow of customers and service is friendly. The vibe/atmosphere is very relaxing and the interior has a nautical theme that is instagram worthy.   The dishes seem small in size but don't be fooled, they can easily fill you up and the portions are just right; each dish is also packed with flavour and presented on pretty vintage looking plates. So...in terms of brunch dishes I've tried, the Reuben eggs benny is hands down one of the best bennies I've had in the city. The sauerkraut gives the dish another element when combined with the smoked pastrami and cheese. And of course the hollandaise is as good as it gets; everything in the dish works together perfectly. Also tried the octopus frittata. The combination of octopus, eggs, chorizo, and romesco sauce results in a filling meal. Lastly, the fluffy pancakes are done just right, somewhat crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The tiramisu mousse/espresso syrup gives the pancakes a not so sweet element.  Overall, love coming here for brunch and will most likely return...hopefully for dinner!"}
