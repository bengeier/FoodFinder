{"text":"Excellent location, close to Kensington Market. 

It's definitely a favourite spot for a pint or two when in the area. It's even worth a special trip for the various bands/events/televised football (soccer) games. 
I think I've seen more selfies taken in their washrooms posted than from any other area pub. They are decorated pretty cool!

As mentioned, the pints feature a great selection of both difficult to find imports and domestic items. 

The vegan food options, although limited, are available. I had the vegan shepherds pie and thought it was fantastic. Fairly priced and well presented, along with accompanying side salad. I was stuffed!

The service was friendly and competent. 

Will be back. Again and again."}
{"text":"Went in for the Sunday Roast with my wife and her family and again everything exceeded expectations by miles. Not sure what's not to love about this pub, but truly it's a gem. From the food to the staff we were happy and very well taken care of all evening.

The roast was excellent, the portions are perfect, and everyone in my party left happy. Between the football, the staff, and the perfect Sunday Roast they're doing something right here."}
{"text":"Horrible place, very diry and dingy. The sound was incredibly bad, the sound guy was very obviously incompetent. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The pub only lasted 7 months???!!!  Former owner of The Bristol Yard, The Bristol.  I think Davy was not the greatest business person. Either he has no idea how to run a pub and or he is a difficult person to work with/for.  3 establishments in 5 years.....  Too bad because he is a great Chef.  :("}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks a few nights ago to watch a match. Good variety of beer on tap - the pints we ordered were cold and fresh. We didn't try any mixed drinks, but there seemed to be a good assortment of those as well.
The place was clean, the server was friendly, and the prices were fair.
All the food that came out to the tables near us looked awesome. We're definitely planning to go back soon for dinner!"}
{"text":"They have excellent brunch offerings and there's no ridiculous line up to keep you away from generous portions of delicious food. My boyfriend and I have been coming here regularly for weekend brunch and the odd evening meal and we always leave satisfied. We used to go to Aunties and Uncles (also a great neighbourhood establishment) but the line up, especially in the winter, is a drag. Service at the Old Laurel is friendly and prompt, but staff don't hover (which is great!). This place consistently serves up solid value and we're slowly but surely sampling our way through the menu's scrumptious offerings - it's been a treat so far and we really hope the Old Laurel is here to stay for a very, very long time."}
{"text":"This Brit pub is the best with the huge picture of the Clash on the wall as soon as you walk in you know the music is going to be good! The food is amazing, you have to try the full English roast on Sunday with a sticky toffee pudding they even have Walkers Brit potato chips (crisps) and monster munch! Staff are super friendly and fullers London pride and ESB on tap you can't go wrong they show all the premier league games too with full English breakfast, if you haven't been here yet go now RUN!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much when I went a few weeks ago that I decided to bring my boyfriend back for brunch. We were not disappointed.

We began with a coffees and caesars. Mmmm... Saturday morning goodness! We both had the proper fry up with the black pudding rashers, farmer's sausage and bacon. This meat extravaganza also came with fried toast, bubble and squeak, mushrooms, beans and a roasted tomato. Neither one of us made it through the whole thing but it was absolutely amazing!

And they have the football games on! Whether or not my attention span is good enough on a weekend morning to watch the game, I love the sound of it while I eat my english breakfast with a cider. It reminds me of London weekends :)

Service was warm and friendly and the place was all decked out for Christmas with a little tree beside the fireplace. I don't think I could have been happier. I plan on coming back to try more of their incredible food as there is almost nothing on the menu that doesn't entice me. 

I may just curl up under the Christmas tree."}
{"text":"Is not like they have the fastest service. This 2nd time we sat 5:25 (25 min. after they opened), and it took almost 10 min for any of the crew passing far in the hallway to decide to attend us. 

Maybe they were hang over, or they slept in there (the place is huge, and the crew looks different). I heard steps up, I saw movement, everything was set up, but no one was there. I could've tried to act as the bartender.

We had a shot and left.

The first time in there was too late. It was about to be last call, it was empty down stairs, but occupied by the filming of an independent movie on the 2nd floor. We were attended by a couple that would be the human version of the rabbit, and the crazy hat man of Alice wandering around the Old Laurel.

Bring 25c if you want to take possession of the jukebox."}
{"text":"Not sure what got into me, but I was jonesin' for a full English breakfast! I normally avoid brunch places like the plague, partly because I'd like to think that I can cook most items myself, and also because I hate lining up for mediocre food!

After skimming through Yelp, i wanted to try something relatively new. Could've chosen at least a dozen other spots along our walk, but that would've been playing it safe! 

Anyway, we finally reached the resto on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. Walked in and it was so dark, it took me at least 5 minutes to adjust my eyes. With the smell of beer in the carpets, and dingy decor, I knew I had made the right choice!

Finally, I ordered the \"Full Monty\", which was essentially a full English breakfast, with a crap ton of meat, two eggs, mushrooms, and toast. Also grabbed a fullers pint. My fiancee grabbed the Eggs Laurel ( Eggs Benny). 

Portions definitely lived up to British standards, with enough fat/carb on the plate to leave me fueled for days. I couldn't finish it all, but it definitely hit the spot. I could've skipped the beans, but that's just me. Can't speak for the Eggs Laurel, but she said was good.

I should mention they have a big screen, playing the live footy games front and center. Definitely a great, low key spot to watch the game. Looks like they had a few legit dart boards to behind the screen too, which is an added plus. 

It wouldn't be my first or second choice, but it makes a solid backup!"}
{"text":"I'm here right now and I can't wait to say how good this place is.

Food is proper English pub fare at proper portion sizes. Great spot to warm up to a hearty meal and a few good pints.

Fish and chips was fresh with a good portion of handout fries. Steak pie and mash was excellent, again with a good portion of mash and veggies and a very meaty steak pie.

Staff was exceptionally friendly and atmosphere was very laid back and cozy."}
