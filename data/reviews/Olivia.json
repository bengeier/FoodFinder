{"text":"I'm baffled by the poor reviews here. I really loved this place! Came on a Monday night and sat outside on the terrasse.   The \"Antipasto Olivia\" was excellent - a perfect variety of olives, nuts, veggies, cheese etc.   I had the Linguini Gigi, and my husband had the steak tartare. We both loved our meals!  The pasta was perfectly al dente and very tasty, but... a bit salty.    The wine list is good (I enjoyed the Bourgogne), but the beer options are totally lacking.  What a crap list of tap options. Such a shame.   The food was really great, and the wait staff couldn't have been friendlier!  Everyone we dealt with was super nice and chatty, bilingual, and just overall number 1.   Give it a try. Srsly."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 15 people. Most of the items we ordered were frozen and/or from Costco! My son's pizza was burnt hard. One of the servers were giving our kids the evil eye because they were being kids and talking loudly. Right before we left, she made sure all the kids did not leave with their dollar store fake candles."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. The food was delicious except for one of our dishes which was so al dente it was crunchy. We only got our meal 2 hours after arriving and had to ask repeatedly for water, drink menu, dessert menu etc.  The service was so bad that I chose not to tip. When we were paying the waiter was extremely presumptuous when asking how much change I wanted back (I.e. how much of a tip am I giving him). I said all my change, which was $3.40. He said he didn't have the 40 cents. He was literally nickel and diming.  This already irritating we get up to leave and when at the door he shouts out to us that one of us didn't tip. And singles me out. I said no I didn't and he asked why. I was totally put on the spot because withholding tip speaks for itself. We all told him that the service was bad and he agreed. Then why is he asking for a tip if he knows he didn't do a good job!?!?!? He then told us some bs that the waiters have to pay the busboys with their tips. I don't care. This was rude, aggressive and I HATE it when tips are expected. I also doubt he would have asked us for his tip if I was a huge body builder. So all in all, food was good but service was horrible."}
{"text":"Service long, aléatoire, on a demandé un verre d'eau avec du citron et on nous a charge 4,50$... Osso bucco très sec, pâtes trop cuite avec une sauce sans goût... Rien de spécial mais très cher. On a décidé de laisser passer le dessert à cause des chauffes-souris qui était sur la terrasse et les autres clients qui paniquaient..."}
{"text":"Ne vous laissez pas tromper par l'aspect \" resto de centre commercial \" du Olivia car cet établissement offre une cuisine méditerranéenne diversifiée, et surtout, raffinée. Le menu nous propose des poissons, des pâtes fraîches, des grillades de poulet, des risottos ou encore des viandes de buf poêlées. Pour ma part, j'ai gouté une délicieuse pizza à croute mince avec tapenade d'olives et chorizo qui m'a agréablement surpris par la subtilité des saveurs. Ma conjointe a dégusté un plat de pâtes fraiches qui était tout simplement délicieux. En entrée, nous avons tous les deux adoré notre assiette de calmars frits à la panure légère et croustillante.    Un menu table d'hôte est offert midi et soir et change régulièrement aux dires de la serveuse. Le prix du vin au verre est abordable (entre 8 à 12$) et la carte des vins offre une très belle diversité. En passant, l'établissement possède un cellier vitré qu'il est possible d'apercevoir à l'entrée du restaurant (voir ma photo).   Le décor est attrayant, et la disposition des tables assure une belle intimité. Dommage que les grandes baies vitrées donnent sur le paysage peu reluisant du stationnement. D'ailleurs, le seul point que je reproche à ce resto est sa location dans un édifice commerciale qui enlève au charme.    En bref, le Oliva est un resto qui se démarque à Vaudreuil-Dorion. Je recommande."}
{"text":"The decor and setting is very nice and great for a little romantic evening. My only complaint was that the tables are a bit too close together which made getting in and out of seats a bit uncomfortable.   We started off with drinks and the Brie appetizer which were great. The Brie while on the pricey side was well presented and very tasty. It was definitely the high point of the meal.   My husband ordered the creamy pizza and I ordered the Mediterranean penne. Our food arrived and I had Mediterranean linguine (not penne as ordered). The pizza was a bit bland and the crust seemed like a store bought naan bread crust. At 18$ we expected a better pizza. The pasta was flavourful and worth the price but it was nothing extraordinary.   The service was fast and our waiter was great.   Overall, our supper was pleasant but a tad overpriced for what we got. We will likely give it another go sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: the food was excellent.  Served quickly, we both enjoyed our entres (appetizers) of fried calamari and the portobello/goat cheese.  Our main course of Sicilian pizza and Gigi pasta were VERY well done, however my gf wasn't too crazy about her pasta as it was too \"meaty\", however it should be noted she's not a huge meat eater and this doesn't reflect on the food. Now, the bad: our waiter was rude and short throughout our experience.  When he seated us in the empty restaurant, he put us directly beside (and I'm talking within an inch or two between tables) of a couple who were obviously very very intimate with each other that evening.  No issue with that... But we had to ask to be seated elsewhere to give them (and us) some obvious privacy.  The waiter's response \" it makes no difference its going to get busy soon\".  Really? Thanks. For the rest of the evening he barely paid any attention to us, and didn't come by asking if we wanted refills on our drinks, simply taking them away when he saw they were empty. The highlight of the visit was the dessert... We opted for the fixed menu that night ($29) and enjoyed every part of the meal.  Unfortunately our experience was bad enough that we were talking about it throughout our meal, and out of the resto and into our car. Sadly, the service here seems to really bring down the quality of the experience.  Hopefully its just one person, but from other reviews I've read, this is the norm."}
