{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant that we ate at during our weeks stay in Montreal. Our server Gabrielle helped make the experience memorable, and the kitchen turned out amazing dishes...."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been there about 20 times and I always get the Dijon chicken or the Californian salad so I can not speak about any other menu items. A little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times. First, let's start with the building itself, semi-modern, raised and somewhat modern... however all of that is ruined by the BAR and the music coming from it! 

The food is really good, someone must be cracking the whip behind the scenes because unlike other places I've eaten in the quality of the food does not drop during the off-peak days like Monday/Tuesday etc.

Service? -- It depends who you get. I got one bad server who was fishing for tips and thinking that I was a a bad tipper, hovered around other tables. We (my girlfriend and I) had to wait around for bread! 

However - The tall man with glasses is a GREAT waiter! He really makes you feel special and makes sure that you have what you need. He also asks if you want bread right after taking your order. 

Overall a pretty good experience except for 2 of the servers. 

The Salads and Hamburgers are what I recommend."}
{"text":"Great ahi appetizer and salad. Food fresh and well displayed. Waiters and waitresses extra accommodating."}
{"text":"Average but consistent.

No amazing food here but a varied menu that can please different taste preferences.  

Lunch table d'hôte offer nice variety.  Service is fine."}
{"text":"Great place to have drinks and entrees meals

I only go in summer time to enjoy the terrasse and drinks very good service and good food.

Great place"}
{"text":"I would never serve such food to my family, nothing tasted good. The food is very low quality and bland tasting. After putting so much salt to make the food  taste better, you will leave with a your throat hurting."}
{"text":"Came here three times over the course of a week while traveling to Montreal for a conference.  The selection of food is great.  It's a very big restaurant and you can sit in large groups.  I got the californian salad the first time and it was super delicious.  It was hard to not re-order it the following day but I decided to get the prosciutto and brie sandwich.  I regretted it, the prosciutto was dried out and impossible to eat.  The third night I got the blackened chicken with rice and veggies and it was delicious.  Basic but well done and tasted yummy.  I did find the service was a bit on the slow side but I'd totally return here.  I'd recommend this to locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a friendly staff and good service. I highly recommend the salmon tartare(it's definitely one of the best out there.) Great cocktails as well. Perfect spot for an after work gathering, a birthday or even a date."}
{"text":"Oh! Boy! Quelle soirée désastreuse! De 1: service leeeeennnntttt très lent. Que ce soit pour les consommations ou pour le repas... 20/30 minutes pour servir une bière ou un verre de vin...  Ça passe pas! 3h pour se faire servir 3 repas infectes! Pas mangeable! J'ai pris le poisson du jour qui avait un goût de décongelé, sec, fade et insipide, accompagné de sa pelletée de riz au bovril! Mes amies on pris le tartare de saumon... Pas bon, raviolis au buf braisé, pas bon et le hamburger de poulet accompagné de ses bouts de frites sèches. Voilà ce que fut notre repas! Quand nous nous somme finalement plaint. Au lieu du gérant! On a eu la visite de l'hôtesse qui ne savait pas quoi répondre... Et à dû aller parler à son gérant! Franchement! Bref! Peut-être une place pour prendre un verre et zieuter les clients qui sont à la recherche d'affection ( même ça ça reste à voir) mais certainement pas une place pour aller gaspiller des $$ pour un souper! Trop de bon choix dans la région pour y retourner!"}
{"text":"Je sais pas pourquoi chaque fois que je propose d'aller là mes compagnons semblent  hésitants. Il y a des choix, mais pas trop. Salades, Pâtes, Pizzas, Burgers, steaks. Les pâtes a l'artichaut et fêta sont le meilleur item sur le menu selon moi, mais la salade asiatique au boeuf ne laisse pas sa place !  Les entrées sont copieuses et délicieuses (Nem au poulet et carpaccio de boeuf peuvent facilement se partager). Une sélection intéressante de vin au verre ou à la bouteille. 

Un bon resto à prix raisonnable pour dîner ou souper !"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! After a long day of walking, I stopped here for a late lunch at 4:30pm and was given a table. One thing I found weird is for such a beautiful place they give you a small paper napkin instead of an actual cloth napkin! It didn't match the decor! 
Anyway I ordered the chicken nems (spring rolls) and you get about 7 small crusty nems with a side sauce. This dish was to die for! 
I also ordered calamari and they were great too. I also ordered their southwest burger with fries but had to wrap it to go since by then I was full! 
It's a great place with great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"Was the duck poutine worth the 120+ minute wait?  

Eehh ....

Yes, you need to make reservations at this place.  You really do!  And if you don't feel like calling, you can make reservations on line too. 

We looked online and saw that the next available time slot was 8:30 so we called to verify this - hoping we could be seated earlier.  The hostess said, no guarantees but just come in and maybe a spot will open up ... 120+ minutes later we were seated at 8:30.

The food itself reminded me of trendy type chain restaurants - Joey Tomatoes, Earls, depending on the location - Moxies, etc.  

We ordered the salmon tartar (EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!) and the duck poutine (what brought us to the restaurant) for our appetizer.  According to my husband, the duck poutine was his favourite western dish on our trip.  Even better than his duck crepe - what?!?!?!? 

The salmon tartare was so flavourful ... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Capers, lemon, onion, garlic - OMG.

The gravy to the duck poutine was quite good, there were also some caramelized onions, and the fries were seasoned and relatively crispy.  It was good but I actually preferred the poutine from Reuben's.  The poutine from Reuben's was also larger and cheaper.  There is no way I would have been satisfied with ordering just the duck poutine as a meal.  

We split a pasta dish - some sort of asparagus, special cheese, and proscuitto concoction.  It was disappointingly bland and memorably bad - in my opinion.  The parmesan cheese that was sprinkled on was SWEET ... yuck.  I didn't even see or taste any proscuitto.  

Our server was nice but seemed really \"new\".  We had mentioned to him that we would be splitting our pasta dish so our pasta dish was brought out split into two dishes.  BUT!!!!  our two mini pasta dishes were given to my husband and to my cousin (she had ordered the same thing since it had sounded so delicious).  My brother who also ordered the same thing received one full serving and we just assumed the discrepancy in serving size was a human error.  So, my husband and I proceeded to split our MINI serving.  Then, another pasta dish came out and we said we didn't order it so it was sent away.  

Okay, so everyone at our table was just like \"oh well\"

But, I was upset ... I really felt like I should say something.  I had been waiting for two+ hours and was hungry and didn't think it was fair that I was paying $16 for a SMALL plate of BAD pasta.  

I asked the waiter when he stopped by our table about the discrepancy in serving size about the pasta dishes - since my dish was noticeably less than my brother's dish and the dish that they had brought out but we stupidly waved away (my girl cousin's dish).  

He quickly gave the explanation - which makes me think he knew what was going on but was choosing to let the situation slide....  I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but I really do think he was willing to let me starve with my 1/4 of a serving of bad pasta.

The bad thing is that this ALSO happened with a Duck Poutine that my brother and boy cousin were going to share ... my boy cousin mentioned that the shared serving of duck poutine seemed so much less than our poutine.  But, we just said \"oh well - what can you do\"  And sure enough, another poutine was brought to our table but we stupidly waved it away.  So, we were \"cheated\" of a poutine ... but with this, nobody had said anything...

And the thing is, my cousin's boyfriend said that our waiter was actually NOT new ... he had been served by the same waiter a year ago!  And that he also seemed \"new\" at that time too, hehe.  

Okay, so enough venting.

Well, with all the amazing and ethnically diverse food in Montreal, I highly doubt I'll want to return.  

I prefer mom and pop type restaurants anyway :)"}
{"text":"Not good for kids but good for young adults. Noisy, but there is a quieter room in the back. 
TV access with football on. Casual, good food."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I am very picky when it comes to food. First off, the atmosphere is beyond amazing. The decor is beautiful and it has a lively amazing vibe. For lunch my friend and I ordered the beef carpaccio. Oh my gosh I have never had anything so amazing before. It was so good that we ordered it 3 times!!! We also tried the ceviche and the poutine which were both amazing. I don't drink hard liquor so I asked for champagne with something fruity and was given champagne with muddled raspberries. It was delicious!!! After our amazing meal, we were greeted by the manager Johnny Christmas who was the nicest and most welcoming person in the world. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone for amazing food and service. I will definitely return for the amazing food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Eaten there 3 times, 3 times too many. The service was poor once, and the food wasn't good any of the times. If you're going to see a movie and figure this is a good place to grab bite prior, don't. The offering at the theatre is probably comparable if that gives you an idea."}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Eve dinner. It was absolutely delicious. The calamari comes with a chipotle mayo that is amazing. I had the beef bavette which was also delicious. Great atmosphere and attentive and pleasant staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Honestly, everything about Zibo effervesces douchebaggery. From the nauseating clientele to the utterly mediocre \"Italian\" food, this restaurant is l for yuppies and gross old Quebecers that dress like and think that they're in their twenties.

Zibo really turned me off, I find it profoundly off-putting, I had dinner there with a yuppie friend of mine that has very little common sense and absolutely no taste, he's a monkey and this place is stupid.

If you're in the Dix 30 area, I feel for you. It really is a veritable breeding ground for douchebags. That said, I would instead go to l'Aurochs, which is a pretty good dinner place, or Texas steakhouse, which is excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great design and is located in a good place. Unfortunately the staff there are not competent and put minimum their effort to make it an enjoyable lunch for you. Food is not very tasty but pizzas are salty."}
{"text":"We are visiting from North Carolina and have already been to Zibo twice!  The service is superb and the food is amazing. Gabrielle, Caroline and Jean Noelle are the best!  Very cool vibe. We'll be stopping by again before we leave."}
{"text":"Bon service et belle présentation mais je reste sur ma faim concernant le ratio qualité/prix. Les prix sont élevés pour de la nourriture un peu fade."}
{"text":"Had really quick service when we went out for dinner at 9 pm, the food was amazing. Would recommend the california chicken sandwich and the zucchini chips"}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner. I had the filet and shrimp both were a little over cooked but they were very delicious. The service and atmosphere were both a great way to end the day."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and really good service!  Zibo is a little less pricey than some of the other restaurants in the area, so if you are looking for something nicer but not over the top, this is a great option.

I got the Mango Pineapple Chicken dish and it was really good.  The piece of chicken was massive and they give a lot of mango and pineapple.  My girlfriend got the Veal meatballs and those were incredible.  Definitely recommend this place to everyone.

The only thing I would suggest is make sure that the servers are clear on the drink orders.  My friend ordered a Captain and Coke but got regular Bacardi, not even a spiced rum."}
{"text":"Donc nous sommes assis au restaurant en ce dimanche midi pour aller snacker et prendre la journée relax! 
Ca a facilement pri un bon 5 minutes pour nous faire recevoir a l'accueil et se faire asseoir a quelquepart. Une fois assis, un autre 10 minutes avant que le serveur passe nous dire bonjour et prendre notre commande. Un autre 10 minutes passe pour avoir nos verres d'eau qui ont des débris non-identifiés dans ceux ci et autour du verre. Nous avons commandé une pizza au proscuitto et roquette et un burrito quinoa fèves noires. Nous restons dans l'attente...
Finalement après un bon moment, notre repas est arrivé. La pizza était assez grasse mais quand même pas mauvaise, et le burrito au quinoa n'était pas très mémorable non plus mais pas mauvais."}
{"text":"Souper d'anniversaire. Un quasi fiasco. Service très lent. Repas très moyen mais facture élevée. Ils ne savent même pad à qui appartient chacun des repas. Serveur principal sympathique mais cherche à fructifier le montant de la facture. Le dessert hypersucré, attention diabétique s'abstenir.

C'est la première et dernière fois que j'y viens."}
{"text":"Dîner en terrasse car c'est l'été et il faut bien en profiter. Pris le cocktail mango zibo mais payer un cocktail qui goûte l'eau car glaçons en excès, pas top pour commencer. Les personnes qui amènent les plats ne connaissent pas les tables à servir donc  nous les voyons avec nos assiettes faire trois tables avant de trouver la bonne. J'ai commandé les pâtes du jour et plat excessivement gras car je voyais l'huile au fond de mon assiette donc expérience décevante dans le quartier dix30."}
{"text":"Honestly I'd only go back if I'm not the one paying:) pricey and upscale decor, (also they have nice bathrooms)... nice for a large group or parties. Food isn't great. Drinks are mostly good but again, pricey."}
{"text":"Decent food for a nice lunch environment. As per most chains of this kind, uniform feel, food, and drinks from one location to the next keep me coming back. Their Chorizo and Goat cheese pizza is always a classic, and their entrees are always enjoyable. Nothing innovative, but great for a lunch."}
{"text":"Our food was really good, we also had really great drinks, I would recommend this place for anyone looking for good Poutine with duck and also good drinks. The staff and service was really great too, they took their time to explain what their good drinks are and also what food is good to try. Our server was really nice, I forgot his name, but he was fun to talk to."}
{"text":"Trop cher pour la qualité. Les pâtes ne sont pas fait sur place et ne sont pas les plus fraîches que j'ai déjà mangée."}
{"text":"I went with a friend last night to try out Zibo at the dix30 for the special a la carte menu. The prices were reasonable and the options really appealed to us. 
I got the fried zucchini and it was good, very crunchy zucchini chips with tzaziki, not much taste other than the fried batter but still it was passable. Then I had the salmon tartare served with toast and French fries. The French fries tasted like old oil and were inedible. The salmon tartare didn't have much taste and was disappointing, although mixing it with the spicy mayo for the fries saved it. 
The apple crumble for dessert was fine, although very sweet but at least we ended with a good taste in our mouths. 
Our server was very nice although he brought our bill before we even finished dessert and then disappeared for almost an hour before we could pay and leave. We couldn't have even had another drink if we wanted to! 
The atmosphere is loud but comfortable and there were a few big groups, but I don't think I would bother with it again."}
{"text":"Zibo was across the street from our hotel and we need a quick place to eat.  The food was good I got the veggie wrap.  The drinks were a nice size and lasted the whole meal which is a plus!! The food also came out quickly.  The staff was supper nice and our waiter also spoke English and the menu was also in English."}
{"text":"Amazing food
Friendly staff
Only reason not a 5 star is our waitress ended up with a huge table and started forgetting our little things (fresh drink ect) and another waiter ended up stepping in. No biggie really."}
{"text":"Zibo was actually pretty good. My husband and I met up with some friends here for a late night dinner and just to catch up. It was across the street from their hotel, and right up the street from where we were staying. 

Because it was late we didn't do any appetizers. We all just ordered our food. I ordered the Dijon Chicken, my husband and the other male ordered the Blackened Cajun Chicken Breast with a Peppery Pineapple Relish. The other female ordered some type of pasta dish. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I really enjoyed my Dijon chicken and the fellas really like the blackened chicken. All of our dishes besides the pasta dish were served with roasted potatoes. 

Overall, Zibo has good food and I would recommend them to others. My only complaint was they were a little slow serving the food and it was only 4 of us (2 couples). I guess (my husband saw a big party when he went to the bathroom) they had 1 or 2 big parties so we got there around 8:50 PM and didn't leave until like 10:45 PM/11:00 PM."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended Zibo! and we had a very enjoyable dinner.  Good variety of menu options from salads, pasta, burgers and steak.  Staff is welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"Really love the food....a little expensive but great food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Waiter spilled mayonnaise all over my pants bringing my plate, honest mistake which wouldn't have been a big deal but they just kind of offered me a napkin and apologized and didn't really seem to be too phased by it. Little upset over how it was dealt with."}
{"text":"Bon restau avec beaucoup de choix, bon drinks, un peu cher pour la qualité, mais quand même bien. Ambiance sympathique. 

C'est parfait quand tu es avec des amis qui ont des goûts différents et que tu ne veux pas trop dépenser!! 

Belle grande terrasse devant!"}
{"text":"Recently I've come back here twice in two weeks. Once was for a group supper, the other was for lunch. I do find that zibo is expensive but I can attest to excellent quality meals on both occasions. If you have lunch here it's easily $20+. If you add wine consider it $30+. Dinner is easily in the $30+ range and if you add wine consider it $40+ or $50+ per person. 

Dinner review: for my dinner I had selected the fried zucchini and we also chose an order of calamari. The zucchini was nice, light and crispy. It didn't have much salt on it but was a nice touch with tzatikii. The calamari was just the tubes (no tentacles) lightly fried but with an aioli sauce. 

For my main course I had the bavette de boeuf. Now bavette (hanger steak) can be a tougher chewy cut of beef. I ordered it rare, it came out more medium rare was was delicately tender with a nice sauce and actually one of the better hanger steaks I've had. It came we potatoes and veg. Serving size was smaller but I really didn't feel like a huge meal that night as we were eating late. 

Lunch review: coming here for lunch I was a bit surprised looking at the menu. They only had a 1/2 pizza- salad special $14 and Mac n cheese $14. Otherwise most everything else for lunch was $17-$25 a plate. They did have a table d'hôte menu that includes soup and coffee (the best bang for your buck). So I had selected the pasta special which was pancetta  tomatoes, onion, cheese, asparagus in a pesto sauce. It was $16. Serving size was just perfect for lunch and to my surprise it was deliciously good! Very fresh tasting with the perfect amount of fresh vegetables a chewy salty taste of the pancetta with s perfect amount of pesto. Really I was not expecting it to be that good! 

Service was friendly, efficient and polite. 

Understand is is a more upscale restaurant and you do get a very good dining experience but it's not for those who want an economical lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting this restaurant.Nice decor and friendly staff. It is a bit crowded so calling ahead to make reservations would be suggested to guarantee your place. I started with a \" Calmar frit avec mayonnaise chipotle \" for entrees and took the \"Poulet au lait de noix de coco\" as the main course. There's many different options to choose from (Entrees, salads, pasta, burgers, chicken, different types of fish). The service was good and we we're pleased with our plates. On the other hand, It's a bit on the pricey side and the portions are not that big. Overall, It's a good place to try if you're in Brossard but it's not the best. During the summer, the terasse should be open"}
{"text":"Crispy shrimp pogos was great. Zibo! Salmon Tartar was just ok.
Good selection of cocktails and beers with good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I usually go to Zibo! on Friday at lunch with some colleagues from work. It's convenient because you can eat quickly. Their lunch menu is affordable, however the portions are very average. Their regular menu is good and diversified. 

The service is not always consistent with some experiences better than others"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant.
Ok for a drink and an appetizer but for the rest, there are so many great restaurants in Montreal, please try another one, an authentic one that makes homemade food.

Came here a few times, tried different things on the menu, always ok but never great..."}
{"text":"What a difference service makes!  The first night we ate here we had a waitress that had just started at the restaurant.  She was very attentive, took our drink order right away and let us set the pace for when our other courses came out (I hate it when the main course comes out while you're still having your appetizer).    
We liked it so much that we came back a second night.  What a let down.  Service was slow and impersonal, as a matter of fact we had to get up and ask our waitress' boss if we could please place our order.  I saw our waitress across the room carrying an armload of menus, so it appears management isn't watching too closely the workload they are putting on their staff.
Oh - the food?  Really good with a nice variety to choose from."}
{"text":"Mauvais!  Formule midi= pizza pas cuite et salade à la laitue brune et fanée! En plus il a fallu attendre 20 mins avant d'être servi dans ce temple de la gastronomie.  Dommage j'avais aimé un souper pris dans la succursale du Griffintown..."}
{"text":"what an awful experience. we walked in to the sound of crashing plates in the back. when we were seated (near the door which was cold) our waitress dropped the wine glass on the floor next to us, shattering. When I received my steak sandwich it tasted old and \"reheated\" (microwave possibly?), and my friend said her pasta tasted like nothing. Then at the end when I got my bill the waitress forgot to give me a bill to my change, so if I hadn't have noticed her tip would have been 40%. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Across the street from my hotel.   I was craving poutines and didn't feel like walking far.   
Unfortunately while waiting for the food bartender told me they ran out of Poutine gravy.  
It was an hour before closing but would think you never run out of that.  
I'll try another time.  
Bartender was nice she felt bad and always offers me free fries but I was craving poutine!"}
{"text":"Anciennement le Vertigo, l'établissement est donc devenu le Zibo avec le même propriétaire, mais un menu totalement différent. Le restaurant n'a pas changé au niveau de l'ambiance et du décor, que j'aimais déjà à l'époque. De belles couleurs sombres, idéal pour les têtes à têtes mais aussi pour les rendez-vous d'affaires comme l'espace est très grand et qu'ils possèdent un 2e étage pouvant être privatisé. Je suis familière avec la chaîne Zibo et mon choix de plat a été facilel: la salade orientale. Je dois dire que je ne prends jamais de salade au restaurant, personnellement je ne veux pas payer plus de 15$ pour de la laitue. Mais dans ce cas ci, elle est délicieuse et fidèle à mes souvenirs. Du poulet tendre et bien assaisonné, je crois cuit avec de la sauce soya, des nouilles croustillantes ainsi qu'une grande diversité de légumes coupés finement en juliennes (salade, carottes, poivrons rouges et jaunes...). La sauce est excellente et la portion très généreuse, je n'ai pas pu la finir!!! Mon copain quant à lui a pris une bavette de boeuf accompagné de frites. Son plat était également très bon. En fait, j'aime la plupart de leurs plats, en particulier le tartare de saumon et leurs desserts sont succulents j'ai testé leur cheesecake WOW !!! Le service a cette succursale est nettement meilleur qu'aux autres que j'ai testé. Excellent emplacement dans le centre-ville et les personnes séjournant à l'hôtel Renaissance ont 15% de rabais YOUHOU!!"}
{"text":"A business lunch brought me here and I went with their Mediterranean chicken salad. The salad was average, with little dressing to work it. Chicken was good. We ordered some appetizers and I felt the calamari was very mediocre and way too gummy to be of any enjoyment. I enjoyed the fried eggplant however.

The resto is very pretty with a service that didn't really stand out for me. I'd come here to impress a date who's into pretty restos as well for drinks but for those of you who're into resto for the quality of the meals, I'd abstain.

Price tag is high."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, bartender was to busy talking to 2 guys and didn't acknowledge us for 10 minutes. She didn't know the fish of the day had to get informed and didn't know how to say it in English. We ordered a bottle of wine which we served ourself. Food was pretty crappy too artichoke feta pasta that had no flavor. And when we paid she didn't even say thank you. That was saturday march 12. And no plce was not busy!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!! All kinds of foods to choose from. I've been here many times and I never regretted any dish I ordered. It is a bit expensive, but the food is so good that the price is worth paying ! If you have not been , it is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a rather windy and rainy Saturday. The food and the atmosphere itself was really 3-star worthy, but our waiter was outstanding, so I gave an extra star. He even spoke in English to us, which was very appreciated! (Everyone in our party thought his name was something different - so unfortunately, I cannot give a shout out by name.) All of the staff were very helpful and friendly, I appreciated that I could tell the waiter was familiar with the menu and was very passionate about food. It all came out quickly and was warm-  they forgot bacon on a burger and their vegetarian selection was pretty limited. But the food was good quality and we left full and still with some Canadian dollars in our pocket."}
{"text":"Trendy, modern looking restaurant with very good selection of asian/american/italian fusion.

Lots of salads, pastas, grill meats and burgers. I opted for a simple cocktail and chicken ceasar salad, something light for the afternoon. Chicken was nicely seasoned and moist, it was a generous portion but for 17$ I expected something that tasted a bit more gourmet. The dressing was bland, I've had better out of a bottle.

Looking at their other menu options, everything sounds quite appetizing, but on the expensive side. All their pastas are between 15 to 25$, grilled steaks in the 30 to 40$ price range. They do have a children's menu though.
I would recommend checking out their website for promos, women get a 50% off discount on certain days.

Service was prompt and friendly for a quiet afternoon, I can't say how this place looks in the evening but I'm not against trying it once more."}
{"text":"Really the most popular restaurant in DIX30 not located in the Square. A lot of great choices from contemporary cuisine to Asian influenced meals.

On a nice summer Saturday evening, this place is hopping and there are waiting times to be seated outside which we were at. (20 minute wait. Hey walk over to Indigo a cross the street and they will call you). To eat inside the restaurant, there are two seatings @6:30pm and 8:30pm) you would need to reserve in advance without exception.

We opted for our favorite appetizers of calamari! No disappointment here. We then went through our main meals as shown on the photos. All great choices. 

The saumon was seared just right and the grilled vegetables worked. The saumon Tartar was simple and filling while the Bangkok chicken mimicked Asian restaurant servings. $$-$__

The service was great and on a crowded night it was understandable that it may take a bit longer to get to your table."}
{"text":"Great place to go out with friends to eat! Their menu offers a variety of different choices even for kids. Cool drinks and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to Zibo with a friend quite late in the evening and the waiter looked a bit impatient since my friend only arrived after 40min. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite nice, good vibes and modern interior decor. Located right in downtown, the place is quite pricey but still successful amongst locals and tourists.

The waiter recommended a fruity white wine from Quebec and it was quite nice. My friend ordered their mango chicken and I tried their salmon tartar. Despite the high price, I wasn't flattered by the food and I think that I had much better ones elsewhere paying the same price. They have big portions and I had a hard time finishing my dish. Otherwise it was a relaxing spot to chill with friends and enjoy a good glass of wine."}
{"text":"Service was ok but not great; food was basically over-hyped chain restaurant food and was just so-so.  I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was half decent service was as good and prices aren't worth the quality of food you get"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Please ignore all the bad reviews. This place is great. Order beef carpaccio it will change your life. Service was great and so was the food. I would recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"I was looking for a funky restaurant in Dix30 to take my mom for lunch on Mother's Day after shopping and decided on this place given the reviews I had read. 

It was a Sunday afternoon, so I took a chance by not making a reservation; thank goodness it was pretty quiet! As mentioned, my brother and I had taken my mom out shopping followed by lunch as our Mother's Day present to her. The place is nicely decorated, very sleek and modern. We were seated in a booth and pondered the menu. I liked the diversity in choices with the Asian influence. I'm a big fan of Asian and Asian fusion cuisine, so I opted for the Oriental Salad because I wanted to keep it on the light side. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient. Mom ordered the Thai Beef salad and little brother ordered the Dijon chicken. We didn't wait too long for our food, which was nice seeing as how we worked up a good appetite shopping and all. I thought it quite funny once our plates came out;  the salad portions were quite large, whereas brother's chicken was small and simple. I have had Oriental salads elsewhere and was hoping for something along the same lines. Suffice to say, I wasn't disappointed. Dressing was light but full of flavour, the chicken was tender and the sauce glazed over it offered a nice balance to the dressing in the salad itself. And the crispy noodles offered a contrasting texture. All in all, a very good salad that was just the right portion size. Both mom and brother were also quite satisfied with their meals. 

I will definitely be coming back; I want to try more on their menu!

Would make a great start to a date night or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Most amazing restaurant! Food and atmosphere are so fun. Took my daughter here for her birthday and they were so accommodating. If you go ask for Francesca. She is the best waitress we've ever had. Also being grainfree there were tons of options on the menu!"}
