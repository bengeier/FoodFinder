{"text":"I've lived in Kent for the last 4 years and have an affinity for barbecue. I've had a personal goal to eat every pulled pork sandwich in the Kent area. Rays is a solid sandwich, but this is, by far, the best barbecue place I've ever been to.   You can truly taste the love and time that goes into each item on their menu, and limited quantities mean you're getting only the best things to eat. I would eat here everyday if I could.   Although I love pulled pork, I truly think their brisket is superior to any brisket I've ever eaten. For sides I recommend collard greens or their mac & cheese. Also if you're going to try sauces I recommend you try them all even mix them together if you want. Their pickles are delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious, you're-gonna-need-a-napkin barbecue, this is the place for you. You can taste the love that goes into every bite...from the amazing ribs and burnt ends to the house-made pickles that compliment the perfectly seasoned and smoked meats. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue- wish they didn't okay so much blues music. Foods good I got the pulled pork."}
{"text":"First time here and loved the service and the food was amazing. Had the brisket and potato salad. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm attending Kent State in the fall, so when I was visiting during the summer, I wanted to find s place with good barbecue because I absolutely love barbecue food. So I found Burnside Barbecue here on Yelp, read the reviews and absolutely had to try it. I love pulled pork, so I of course went for that. The pulled pork wasn't the best I've ever had, but I can tell you that it definitely was not the worst. It could use more seasoning, but it definitely has that good, classic, Smokey taste that every pulled pork sandwich should have. I also enjoyed that there's more than one option for coleslaw. There's vinegary and creamy. I'm super picky about my coleslaw and love it creamy, so that's what I got and it was perfect! I even put it on my sandwich. As for the service, it was great. The two owners were very nice and it was great service - fast too!  I would definitely recommend this place to any tourists or new Kent State students. Give it a shot, and have the sweet tea while you're at it!"}
{"text":"Phil Mango is the man, great food, decent prices and a great environment to eat some food. Would go at least once a week"}
{"text":"Gotta check them out! Wonderful brisket and sides. Also have delicious ice cream in awesome Southern flavors like Arnold Palmer and Sweet Potato casserole! Friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok... where should I begin... Let's start with the decor of the (I wouldn't call this place a restaurant). They have a mural of African American jazz musicians on the wall. Of course the notable ones ( Louis Armstrong for example ) was on the wall. Do they associate African Americans with BBQ? To make matters worse, they were playing blues music when we walked in. Have some originality.   Now let's talk about the food. I ordered the brisket meal. It is supposed to come with 2 sides. I ordered the cornbread as my side. The portioning was terrible. I received two small slivers of brisket and a piece of very dry, tasteless cornbread. Just horrible. The other person ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. The pork needed to be doused in barbecue sauce to make it somewhat edible, the mac and cheese was a lost cause as it was incredibly dry and flavorless. Both of our meals were a disappointment and i wish i had never stepped foot into this so called \"barbecue restaurant\" we were starving after our meals and luckily twisted meltz was across the way and they always provide us with delicious food.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. BRING BACK PITA PIT!!!"}
{"text":"I'd read so many good things about Burnside Barbecue that I had to try it. It has kind of been the talk of the town. It's located in Acorn Alley, where Pita Pit used to be, and has a really cool bluesy southern feel to it. They did a great job with the space.   I hate having to pick one thing to try, and was so happy they had a 3 meat sampler to choose. It was $13 and you can pick 3 meats. I chose burnt ends, brisket and pulled pork.   The burnt ends were probably the best meat I've ever tasted. They straight up melt in your mouth, but also have a fantastic crust. I could try making meat at home for 200 years and I'd never figure out a way to pack that much flavor into something. When (not if) I come back, I'm ordering these. They are unlike anything my taste buds have come into contact with.  The brisket and pulled pork were both awesome too. I loved the thick crust of the brisket. Neither meat was over-seasoned, which is good because it just takes away from the natural flavors.   I'm usually a big sauce guy. They had 3-4 different states signature sauces to use, and all were good, but the meat is so tasty that I don't think it needs to be drowned in sauce.   I wanted to try the mac and cheese or cornbread, but went with the slightly healthier collared greens, which I liked.   I think they have a good chance of becoming a Kent staple. They also do Sunday brunch and late night sliders if either of those are your jam.   *UPDATE: I liked the burnt ends so much for lunch that I just went back 5 hours later for dinner. And the burnt ends are still really good. I also tried the Mac and cheese + cornbread with jalapeño bacon butter (see pic)."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich in the area! Their sides are also tasty, and everything is very filling. Try the cheddar jalapeño sausage; so much flavor! Clean restaurant and friendly staff as well. Only down side is the bread for sandwiches is a little dry... but a lot of sauce can fix that."}
{"text":"The burnt ends are amazing. And the one person who left one star can suck a fat one. This is one of the best bbq places around."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm so glad we stopped by, the smells from Acorn Alley were incredible! The honey butter that comes with the cornbread was to die for, and I'll be going home trying to figure out the recipe! I'm so glad there's something to replace Pita Pit, this is what Kent needs!"}
{"text":"Newer BBQ spot has very good BBQ.  Get brisket, pulled pork, or hot or cold chicken salad sandwiches.  Sides include Mac/ch, delicious collard greens, vinegar or creamy coleslaw. Lots of sauces to try.  And pickles! There are cookies with chocolate chips and port rinds!!  Several nice big tables are inside or sit at the small round tables outside.  Located in Acorn Alley.  Hungry?  Check this out.  Really delicious."}
{"text":"0% recommend. Been there twice... decided to give it a try after the first time wasn't that good. I come from the South so this joint was all I wanted in Kent, and it's a total let down. Who in the hell serves VEGAN GREENS?! Mac and cheese was gritty and these people need to learn how to properly season food. Little to no flavor in any of the sides. High prices, small portions. Will NEVER go back. This is a sad, hipster excuse for barbecue."}
