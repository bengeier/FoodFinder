{"text":"This is a very nice place for dinner. I like to go with my parents because then they pay for it. It's a little out of my range for casual dining, but good for special occasions. The food is always delicious and it's a nice, cozy atmosphere. There is also a side room with a fire place where you can sit and have drinks - I guess that's more appealing in the winter. 

I have heard that the owners (who came out of retirement to run Cross Keys) are going to sell the restaurant soon. I'm not sure if they will continue in the Cross Keys tradition or do something else."}
{"text":"The Cross Keys is a 19th century coaching inn, and its old-fashioned ambience is a large part of its charm. Service is friendly and the food is well-cooked. 
Downside is that it seems rather expensive for what they offer, and the wine is especially pricey."}
{"text":"Food 3. Service 1. Ambiance 4. Very cute place - historic and rustic feeling. Food isn't all that creative or edgy but okay. I had the salmon which was fairly good. My mom had the snapper which was dry although the noodles were pretty tasty. Service was bad- long wait for the bill and they never bright the food we asked them to wrap up."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and great ambience - for dinner or just for drinks. Colonial country inn style, with combination of open and private dining rooms"}
{"text":"In an area of Pittsburgh lacking in restaurants, this former brothel turned inn turned restaurant turned spa turned restaurant is a nice hideaway for quiet meal.  Yes, you'll most likely have to cross a bridge to get there, but sometimes good food is worth a river crossing.

The menu is rather standard fare, but the atmosphere is wonderful and the place is a nice break from restaurants in Shadyside or the Strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had a very pleasurable dinner at the Cross Keys Inn.  It has a great bar with a sitting room right across from it with a real wood-burning fireplace.  If you have a little extra time before dinner it would be a great place to relax and have a cocktail.

Everything was very good.  The appetizers were large so we didn't have enough room for dessert.  Nothing on the menu is particularly imaginative, but it is solidly good.  I had lamb chops that were cooked perfectly.  My wife's scallops were excellent as well.

The restaurant was very crowded on a Friday night which is always a good sign.  There is no question the Cross Keys draws an older crowd.  This would be a great place to bring your parents.  We'll definitely be back."}
