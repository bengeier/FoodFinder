{"text":"The annual Christmas brunch at the Ranchman's Club (not to be confused with the Ranchman's bar!) was once again a hit.

Everything you'd expect from a 5 star operation was present, along with some additional nice touches:  

-- Imported cured (Serrano?)  from Spain, that's like a fine wine in terms of aging   & preparation to reach this point of serving.  It's history proudly relayed to you by the chef as he expertly carves  your cuts. . . . which made it a lot more interesting than, well, the chunk of meat I was eyeing up before he started telling me about it!   
 
-- More crab claws and other seafood than guests could even eat .... no sense going \"buzzard\" over the good stuff, they ordered enough for all.  

-- A bartender pouring champagne and OJ (or whatever else) non-stop..  It's five o'clock somewhere!

-- A kid's buffet spread that's about knee height for an adult.  This allows the kiddies to serve themselves the assorted sliders, chicken fingers, and other kid-craving fare.  Fun for them, less work for adults.

-- Santa on site with age-matched gifts and photos for all the little ones

-- Very attentive service on the plates and refills!


Beyond this particular occasion -- the Ranchman's itself is pretty unique in Calgary.  Outside the building, you wouldn't even know it existed.  Inside, it's a multi-floored establishment with history dating back to the 1890's.  The photos on the walls reflect those links to the past.

Food & drinks are all top shelf.  Private rooms are there for group dining or special occasions.  

Afterwards?  How bout some cocktails and snooker.   This place rocks the biggest pool tables I have seen!"}
{"text":"A dining experience that was flawless!  You do have to belong to the club or one of its affiliates to go here but it's well worth the membership.  The building and dining room itself is very elegant.  The waiter and maitre'd were very attentive without being intrusive.   We found the portions to be just right.   The Digby scallop appetizer was excellent as was the beet salad.  I decided to have beef because we are in Alberta so it's my twice a year treat.  I was not disappointed.  The filet was cooked to medium-rare perfection.  It had very little seasoning and was accompanied with just the right amount vegetables.  My diner partner had the halibut and the sauce with morels was light and fresh.  Again cooked to perfection.  
Wine selection is good and not over priced.  Our final bill for two with two cocktails, two appetizers, three glasses of wine, two mains, a dessert, and a tea was just over $200 including tax and service.  We paid almost that much at Model Milk recently with half the food and drink and without the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Omg tried there pastry at the pastry chef showcase 2016 event. It was amazing. I definitely will be coming to the restaurant. The apple caramel tower was a bite of heaven. Perfect amount of sweet and tartness! 


Update: Didn't know this at the time but you need membership to dine here."}
