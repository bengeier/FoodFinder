{"text":"The could serve nothing but their chicken wings and stay in business!  The food is good and you get a alot!  If it was just the entree's i would give 3 stars.  If it was the wings only, it's 5!!!"}
{"text":"I love Best Wok II.  I think about the Triple Delight often.  Get the dinner special, which includes 2 crab rangoon and fried rice.  My husband likes the sesame beef.  It's so good!"}
{"text":"The lunch portions are really big, great priced and most importantly tastes really good!! I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've ever had!! And I've had a lot.... I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese, but this place is definitely worth the 20 mile drive! I won't eat any other Chinese place!! Their sweet & sour and sesame chicken is the bomb. Best egg rolls and the BEST fried rice."}
{"text":"Ordered Veg Lo-mein, it had earwig bug inside. I got my refund and never going back to this place ever. ZeroStar."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  The sesame chicken was seasoned just right, tender and well portioned.  Veggies were fresh and tasty.  Will go back again."}
{"text":"It's really good Chinese food with really fast delivery. One of the few places that if you say that you don't want veggies with your entre, they will just give you more of the chicken/beef/pork. The fried rice is hit and miss. When it's good it's really good, and when it misses, it's still alright, just a little bit like food court fried rice.  If you want chinese food delivered, buddy up with someone and call in an order. It has to be over $25 before they will send it out, but it's the best quality delivery in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad. We had a good experience here. The Garlic Chicken, General Tso's, and the chicken wings were all very good."}
{"text":"a hidden gem.  This place has some of the best chinese food in the area ... have to drive to Great Wall in Pineville to get better.  Don't knwo what others are complaining about ... have NOT had a bad experience here in years of frequenting it. Recommended."}
{"text":"Started going to the original Best Wok about 20 years ago on Sardis. I love this one. It's closer to home and the food is always fresh, ready when promised, and a good value. We love eating here, the kids love it, and it's convenient.   The owner is so friendly and always remembers exactly how we like our food. Spicy, no MSG, and chopsticks for me. :)"}
{"text":"Per the menu, ask for \"no MSG\" before ordering.  Food isn't anything great but isn't terrible either. Be careful when sitting in or getting out of the booths as they're not secured to the floor.   The employees are very nice and bring your food to your table for you. The fountain drinks are limited in selection (Pepsi products) but they do sell other options in bottles."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. I got the chicken and broccoli, it had way to much sauce on it and let me tell ya there was a bone in my chicken. I aslo got the teriyaki chicken on a stick and it was gross really salty it was deep fried with some nasty seasoning on it. If I could I would give this place no stars I would. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"This is my very favorite quick Chinese restaurant in the area. I love the Sa Cha Chicken but everything I have ever ordered has been good.  They are closed on Sunday and Monday and they do not deliver - take out or dine in only."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food , I had the pineapple chicken and it was yummy , and the won tone soup was good as well ."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for a to-go place. Prices adequate, wide variety to choose from. Wish they had delivery, but continue to visit when craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, this and the other location of Best Wok are the best chinese in town. Absolutely nothing is bad, sesame chicken, pepper steak, cashew chicken, lo mein, all is fantastic!  The crispiest chicken wings, i really dont know how they do it."}
{"text":"So overpriced for the smallest portions.. food was not that great. The food seemed pre made since it came out within 2 min of ordering.. not fresh at all"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, and although I did not have one of their reasonably priced lunch specials, what I did have was pretty darn good!  I had the General Chicken (their version of General Tso that was not spicy at all, but had some tang and a little bit of sweet, which was what I was looking for) w/lo mein noodles (I like that they let you sub instead of rice, a lot of places I have been to will not), a side order of crab rangoons, and hot and sour soup.  The chicken was good, the lo mein noodles as well, but the crab rangoons were a little lacking (sorry to say, I have had better). I did not care for the egg roll that came w/my meal, but then I am super picky about my egg rolls. The rest of the members, especially the kiddos, seemed to love them.   The standout to me here was the hot and sour soup! I am very picky about my hot & sour and this one was superb! Fantastic ingredients, just enough spicy heat to clear the sinuses and a wonderful array of mushrooms! Honestly, I could have had just the soup and noodles and been happily satiated.  As a family of 6 we still had 3 boxes of leftovers to take home in the end, so needless to say, the portions here are pretty huge!  The seating area is pretty small and there are more booths than tables, but thankfully there wasn't a lot of people there, so we were able to combine 3 of the 2 seater tables to accommodate our party."}
{"text":"Visited Best Wok II for the first time this week for some take out lunch. I was impressed with how clean this place was. They have plenty of clean tables and chairs to sit at if you wantes to dine in. The women taking orders at the frony was very friendly. When I got home with the oder, the food was hot amd fresh, it had lots of flavor...some of the best I've had! I ordered for my grandmother too and she really enjoyed it; she only wished for some more wantons in her wanton soup. It was good and I recommend a stopping in and trying some for yourself!"}
{"text":"OK this take out place just earned a new review!!  We will be ordering again, to start their crab Rangoons are delicious, wings crispy and fresh in general most of the food we ordered was very good, I was just not too crazy about their shrimp and broccoli, portions pretty fair.Service was polite and their location looked clean, the only reason I am not giving one more star is because they don't deliver, other than that highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Poor quality food of inconsistent flavors - rice was bland while chicken and brocolli was overly garlicy."}
{"text":"I took the recommendation of the Sesame Beef and Best Wok delivered. I wasn't thrilled by the dumplings but I'll give hem another try fried. The Lo Meir and General Tso's were good with sizable portions. I give this place four stars because it is exactly what I was looking for, a solid local Chinese takeout. The owner was also nice and friendly as can be with my order ready to go in just 10 minutes."}
