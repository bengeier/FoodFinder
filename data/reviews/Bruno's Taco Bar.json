{"text":"So good!!! I loved the chicken tacos. My husband loved the chorizo tacos. The guacamole was delicious. Loved the salsa sampler they gave us. The staff was so friendly and welcoming. We will be back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow! Best tacos I've had in town. The grilled steak with Chimichurri followed by the baja fish taco were my favorites. The salsa sampler  is great. From mild to hot, you can add the flavors that you like best. Space is super clean and service is friendly and prompt. Can't wait for them to open for lunch!"}
{"text":"I found them on  instagram & was excited to try.  1st their address on the gram was wrong. Took me a while to find. Once there, I notice it was pretty empty, the cashier area was a little messy, kind of a red flag. Anyhow, ordered horchata it was SUPER thick, & tasted like super sweet whole milk. I order the chicken pastor tacos, eh, I also order a fish taco. It was ok. Here's where I was really dissatisfied. The churros were sooooo stale!!! Not even my 3 year old daughter ate them. I paid $6! For two. Yikes. Food looks pretty & good on the gram, but I don't think I would go back. Sorry, I really wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Oh my god.

Ever since I moved into this area I have been looking for a decent Mexican place, with no real luck. I was excited to try Bruno's because of the great reviews, and it exceeded expectations.

It's a new place, and they've started with a small menu, as they probably should. Several kinds of tacos, chips with guacamole, and not much else. Great! Taco me.

These tacos are no joke. The guacamole is no joke. As good as it gets.

And here's the thing: if you're with that one annoying friend who needs vegetarian options, they've got you covered. It's not just one vegetarian taco and that's what you get; no, here, all of the various taco varieties have unique vegetarian options! If, as in my case, your one annoying friend happens to be your girlfriend, you will be delighted to have found this place.

They give you four different salsas, ranging from mild to hot, and unlike other places, ALL of them are amazing. The hottest one is a revelation. I just love it.

It's cheap. You order at the counter and they give you a number and bring your food out to your table. The people are really nice and friendly. This place is perfect. If you don't go here you are really missing out."}
{"text":"This place is actually really good! I got a fish taco with their passion fruit margarita and... man it doesn't look like much but the flavors are so bomb! And to top that the customer service is great. They bring out, like, an array of salsas hahaha and they explain them to you. Very on point for a little \"hole in the way\" (understatement). Thanks you guys for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"I had a baja fish taco, potato chorizo taco, short ribs taco, and fruity pebble churros that left me so full and satisfied. I also had the vanilla latte with a dragon design which was so cool. Wish I had more room in my stomach to order more, everything sounded great! The staff was also very friendly. Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Found this while scrolling through Instagram. It is definitely is an Instagram kind of place. They offer lattes w/ just about any picture you want placed on top of it. You download their app and select what you like from their options. There are 100s of options. If you don't like any you can submit a photo of yourself too! 

When you walk in you can see that it is a VERY clean place. Not just because it's still pretty new of a few months, but you'll know what I mean when I walk in. There is about 6 tables and 2 family style table tops. So you could get about 40 people in this place comfortably. 

The excitement to come here was pretty high. I had a friend that came in and told me about their bacon guacamole. This has bacon, not just on top, but INSIDE. Bacon in every bite! So then there were the options of all the tacos. They have 7 options and the option to go vegetarian. They bring you a flight of 4 hot sauces. 

Chicken - SO tender
Cauliflower - it doesn't taste like it though, more like pineapple
Baja fish - LOTS of cabbage, like waaaaaaaaay too much
Steak - Very well marinated 
Short Rib - OMG! 
Carnitas - spot on

I saw that they brought out green shelled tacos. No one told us about this as it was St. Patrick's day. Not only that, but we weren't offered ice cream to go on top of our churros. We were overwhelmed w/ all the goodness it would've been nice to have a little hand holding w/ these two things. 

This place is right up the road from my house, so when I'm home I may just have a new taco spot to frequent."}
{"text":"nice! love the simple ambiance. service is cool.
baja fish taco was delish, sauces were not too salty, not too heavy. I finally found a taco spot near home."}
{"text":"Went here today because I found them on IG. I didn't eat any tacos but I had the hazelnut latte and chocolate almond churros.. so bomb! I'm excited to go back for actual food, and bring my friends when they come to visit. There was free WiFi and the staff was very nice and quick. I hung out and did my homework there. Super chill place. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice,pleasant,quick Mex meal! Friendly,clean reasonably priced......going to try it again soon in order to find a glitch but not holding out hope to accomplish that as I truly think this place has it figured out! Gracias!"}
{"text":"I found a new favorite taco place. The flavors are refreshing and delicious. From the pineapple jalape√±o margarita, chicken al pastor to the fruity pebble churros. Everything is so good. The service is amazing. And the vibe is chill and fun. Perfect for taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Simple space, friendly service and some of the greatest tacos in the valley!  

We started with the Bacon Guac which came with a salsa sampler... fresh and delicious.  Then came the tacos... wow.  The skirt steak taco was so perfect... steak was amazing and the chimichurri was the perfect topper.  I could eat these all day.  All the tacos were incredible!

Melissa the owner is awesome... she has a real winner on her hands!"}
{"text":"Came here here to pick up lunch for my friend and myself on a Wednesday around noon. We had been wanting to come here for a while, hoping in person, but was busy lately. The one day we wanted it, it was closed. 

Located across from Southern Hills Hospital, it sits in a shopping complex just west of the hospital on Fort Apache, just north of Sunset. 

The restaurant is very open and bright with lots of high bar tables and chairs and tables around.

----------------

We had ordered two tacos each and I decided to get some churros as a surprise dessert as well ! She had wanted the 'Potato Chorizo Taco' and 'Carnitas Taco' whereas I had gotten the 'Grilled Skirt Steak Taco' and 'Baja Fish Taco'. Originally cashier had mentioned a pork belly taco that was the taco of the week, but apparently on Wednesdays, that's when they change it and was still in the midst of R&D. I had gotten the 'Chocolate & Coconut' churros for us to have as a nice sweet dessert as well ! 

You have the choice of picking either flour tortillas, corn tortillas, or lettuce, or lettuce wrap. I chose flour tortillas for all as I was curious on theirs. 

You also have the choice of hot sauce, ranging from 1 to 4. I asked for mild and hot but got all 4 anyway. 1 was like a jalapeno tomatillo? whereas the 4 was like a mango habenero

Their flour tortillas are fairly big. Maybe about 2x the size of a normal taco tortilla. 

The 'Grilled Skirt Steak Taco' had a lot of against-the-grain cut skirt steak topped with a yummy chimichurri sauce. Skirt steak was tender and flavorful. Due to the size of the flour tortilla, it made it seem like there wasn't much meat but there was a good amount. Unlike the other tacos, there is more toppings. The skirt steak doesn't have much. 

The 'Baja Fish Taco' was the larger of the two. Topped with cabbage slaw and pickled onions, using the number 4 hot sauce made it really yummy. Large battered fish filet spanning the length of the flour tortilla topped with a nice light slaw and pickled onions was quite yummy. It's been a long while since I've had fish tacos and this one fit the spot quite well. 

The Chocolate and Coconut churros were decent. Freshly made in house made the churro more crispy than chewy. I think there's a bit too much cinnamon sugar but the drizzled chocolate and coconut flakes were nice. Could probably knock off half the sugar though. 

The pricing may seem a bit more than other places but their tacos are definitely larger. You pay around 2.50 - 3 bux each for street tacos but you have a much smaller double corn tortilla'ed taco with a few pieces of meat. They load it up here for less than double the price. They box each taco individually (not sure if its cuz we had 4 different tacos) 

I saw a plate of the guacamole come out while I was waiting and you get a ton of chips on a plate with a bowl of the guacamole in the middle. 

Overall, not bad. Yeah mildly pricier but probably the best quality tacos I've had so far in vegas. Too bad no beef tongue though. Would definitely come back but not definitely for dinner. Im pretty sure id go broke if i did"}
{"text":"Decided to go here for Valentine's day. Best decision ever ! Skirt steak tacos were bomb ! Fish tacos were nice and crispy . Passion fruit margarita was so yummy ! Customer service was great !  Give them a try , you wont regret it ! Till next time Bruno's !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but it just didn't hit the spot for me. The service was great but the food wasn't all that impressive. We ordered flank steak, fish, and carnitas tacos as well as chips & guac and 2 lattes. My kids enjoyed their steak. My husband said his carnitas was good but nothing impressive. The first initial bite of my fish tacos were good but the batter was a bit much and became soggy rather quickly. The portioning was way off too. Same with the chips & guacamole.. the guacamole to chips ratio was way off. The lattes were good and fun since we got to personalize it. The variety of salsa was good too, though the pico de gallo looked more like water with some onion and tomato in it."}
{"text":"Great new place. The food is good and service was get. They have some interesting flavors that we quite enjoyed.  They also have some great vegetarian options.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I went here tonight for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! Each delicious meat taco has an equally delicious vegetarian option, which is hard to find. I got the beer battered cauliflower taco and was not disappointed! Their tortillas are all fresh and homemade daily. I'm usually a flour tortilla kind of girl, but I'm converting to their corn! Delicious! On top of great tacos, they have a great craft beer selection-something my husband and I seek out in a restaurant. The owners were super friendly and accommodating to a small child as well. We asked for a high chair, and they grabbed one for us immediately. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very long wait...no really, table of five, two have been served in 45 min.  Three people haven't received food in over an hour now.  Never will be back.  Rest of party at this point is getting refunded."}
{"text":"First of all, I just yelled at the waitress for 3 minutes about how good the salsas are. They don't sell them by the bottle either which I can understand but at the same time, can't understand. The tomato jalape√±o has such a unique flavor, the Pico is made with green tomatoes which is a cool twist to traditional pico, the tomatillo was hotter than I expected but still smokey and delicious, and then there's the passion fruit habanero which sent my tastebuds to actual hell in the best way possible.

Chips and poblano guac really set the tone. Lots of places get chips and guac right and Bruno's was no exception. 

I ordered the carnitas, chicken al pastor, and short rib tacos all on corn. The tacos weren't overdressed with topping or sauce which I liked. It allowed me to appreciate the flavor of the meat which really held its own. The short rib was melty and flaky, so it's good quality meat that's cooked properly. The chicken was charred and juicy. The carnitas were your standard carnitas but with a chicharron on top, still absolutely worth a try. 

Also had the Chile mango margarita. Speaks for itself, really. 

Finished off with the chocolate almond churro, no ice cream because I needed to leave with at least some dignity. Churro was crispy on the outside but oh so soft and gooey on the inside (much like myself). Had some chocolate drizzle with like 6,000 almonds on top which actually might have been too many almonds for this churro but I'm not complaining, because almonds are tight, and I fuck with almonds. 

The service was great! Very friendly and helpful staff. It's a well lit and spaced out dining room. So many beer options which is unique for a walk-up style restaurant. 

Y'hungry? 'Mere."}
{"text":"OMG!  So good!  And the salsa has some heat.  Highly recommend.  I had the skirt steak and chorizo tacos.  So tasty and fine to mix with the different salsa."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was good, but not worth the experience of the rest.

This is essentially a tapas restuarant. Over-priced tiny plates & drinks. If you like over-paying, this is the spot for you.

I arrived around 5:45pm and was greeted abd ordered a couple drinks. Too expensive, but I was there to meet up with friends and have a good time. $60 personally in food & drinks +tips (plus what the 5 other people in my party had eventually ordered) later, they ran out of the beer we were drinking and refused to substitute 2 bottles when I placed the next order of 5.

Overall, I spent almost $100 here in food, drinks, and tip (then add what the rest of my party spent...). The quality of the food was great but not worth the price of the quantity and then add in the disservice. I have friends whove come here for the last few weeks that Ill be immediately discussing finding a replacement. 

If youre looking for a taco shop with some varying recipes that serves beer definitely consider Fuzzys on Rainbow & 215. The menu is a bit different but the tacos are less expensive and the beera are much larger for much less. If youre looking for Authentic street tacos check out Pepes on Rainbow & Flamingo. 
Unless you want to overspend, do not bother coming here."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos, best staff and a wonderful owner! I'll be back cause I live down the street! I suggest if you're looking for a great taco place. I tried the Grilled Skirt Taco the Baja Fish Taco and finally the Potato Chorizo Taco \"yes I'm a pig\" and they were all excellent!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food but not enough of it!!! The cauliflower tacos were unbelievable!!! Come here just to try the fresh food!!"}
{"text":"What initially drew me in about this place is the amazing coffee/latte art. Though, they really don't advertise it, you can chose almost any image to put on your coffee. They have a variety of flavors to chose from and the tacos are delicious. It was my first time trying a chicken adobada taco and I wasn't disappointed. I came here for the first time about a week ago with a friend, and we both agreed we had to come back the next day. The interior is very modern and instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Amazing food even more enjoyable staff. Authentic Mexican, flavorful tacos and alcoholic drinks. I tried the short rib taco and it was amazing. This will definitely be a spot I will frequent in the future."}
{"text":"Bruno's is so gewwwddd. Skirt steak is the the best taco- Fish taco is my second favorite. The cocktails are hit or miss..."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Carne tacos are cooked to perfection and guac and specialty salsa's are awesome.  

Expensive for what you get but like always, you get what you pay for.  My go to is two carne tacos and a side of guac that cone with 4 specialty salsas and chips."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure why they have such great reviews on Yelp. Food, service and overall experience is a solid C+.

We waited about 20 minutes after placing our order to receive our chips and guac. It was another few minutes for half of our order and about 10 minutes after that for the rest. I had to ask about an agua fresca I ordered, only to be told it was sold out. My husband's latte took about 40 minutes.

It seems their concept is quick casual, but it's anything but quick. After that wait, my expectation is the food should be phenomenal. Again, it was not.

The portabello mushroom taco was drenched in liquid (it wasn't the chimichurri) and the flavor was just okay. The chicken al pastor was also bordering on good, but didn't blow me away.

The guac was great and I really enjoyed the salsa assortment they provide. This was the best part of our dining experience.

Overall, if the service had been better, it could've compensated for the food, and vice versa, if the food had been outstanding, it could've compensated for the service. But it was a double whammy of disappointment."}
{"text":"One word:  Incredible!    You cannot go wrong with any taco on their menu. We had the Skirt Steak, Braised Short Rib, Chicken Al Pastor and the Fish Tacos.  Try the salsas as they were all delicious.   Will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"Aside from the Walgreen's and Top Shelf Wine & Spirits, the plaza that Bruno's occupies has always been weirdly vacant. I hoped since moving here a few years ago that, one day, the plaza would start to see an influx of local food choices. 

That day has come and it happened, seemingly, under the radar. 

Fun fact: Had it not been for my husband asking if I were aware that a new taco spot opened down the street from us, tonight's dinner (and this review) would not have happened. 

Anyway... 

The space is bright and inviting with an ample selection of high and low-level seating. Ordering is done at the counter, where a nicely-sized and easy-to-read-menu is posted. Oh, and the lighting is pro-food porn. 

Once your order is taken, you're given a number and, well, you know the drill...

The menu itself is well-balanced. There are two beef options (skirt steak and braised short rib), one chicken option (pastor), two pork options (chorizo & potato and carnitas with chicharron and guacamole), one fish option (baja-style), one veg, and one taco of the month. BUT - AND IT'S A BIG BUT - for each of the meat options I listed, THERE IS A VEGETARIAN OPTION.  Carnivores and vegetarians can now sit at the table and enjoy a carnitas taco or, its equivalent, a shredded jackfruit taco. Game changer, friends. Game. Changer. As far as the tacos went, I tried all of the options except for the vegetarian alternatives, and they were all good. My ranking keeps changing but, for now, I'd say: 1. chorizo and potato (which is never the case), 2. chicken pastor (also never the case because I don't count chicken as a legitimate taco meat choice), 3. baja fish (nice crunch and beer batter flavor), 4. carnitas, 5. guajillo short rib, 6. skirt steak (beautiful slices of meat), and 7. calabacitas (my carnivorous colors come through, again, but still good!). 

My husband and I chose all corn tortillas despite the ability to select those, flour, or lettuce wrap. The corn tortillas were a surprise treat. They were warm and soft, thanks to being handmade on-site. We were able to try the flour tortilla, which was equally warm and soft, with a flour feel that can only come from being super duper freshly made. 

We also ordered the classic guacamole, which comes with those thick, crunchy tortilla chips that cause me to black out and wake up finding that I inhaled enough chips to have turned myself into a literal dough of masa. The guacamole was bright and crisp (though I may have liked more salt). There are three other options that I'll need to try again soon (tropical, bacon, and poblano/queso fresco). 

Our meal was served with a salsa sampler that was plated in order of heat. I didn't find anything to be particularly spicy (I prefer heat). However, the salsas were clearly fresh and all had good flavor. 

BONUS POINTS: Alcohol available. I had the pineapple jalapeno margarita. I mentioned later that I felt the drink could use more heat. For those like me, I'm told this can be requested when ordering. I will definitely do this next time. 

SUPER BONUS POINTS: My husband ordered the horchata. His reaction upon sipping, \"YO! This might be the best horchata I've had.\" Skeptical, I took a sip. Mind you, I never order horchata. I usually will take a sip of my husband's and am reminded why I never order it because it's usually bland, too strong, or too watery. This one was nicely flavored and creamy AF. It makes me actually interested in having an horchata latte from the coffee menu (yes, there's coffee, too!). 

SUPER DUPER BONUS POINTS: Though not listed, one can absolutely order a michelada. And that's important because we all deserve a michelada every now and again. 

By the end of our meal, we were too full for dessert. Hopefully, I can keep some space available next time to venture on to the churros menu (6 flavors, all with the option to add ice cream!). 

Currently, they are only open during evening hours. Lunch hours are on the horizon after the holidays, as well as happy hour specials. 

Oh, and the folks there were gracious and welcoming. Service was on point."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little gem while waiting for my boyfriend to get his haircut next door. We ordered a guacamole to share - poblano and queso fresco guacamole #bomb and short rib tacos, skirt steak, and fish tacos...OMG soooooooo good!!!! Can't decide which one is my favorite. The tortillas are all handmade and you can definitely taste the difference YUMMMM We will definitely be coming back :) thanks Bruno"}
{"text":"The tacos here are so good! Staff is always friendly when we go and it's right around the corner from our house so we come often. The fish tacos and churros are to die for!"}
{"text":"Bruno's tacos are the bomb!!  Had two fish tacos and a shrimp taco of the week and all of them where sooooo good. Found my new taco spot for lunch or dinner. Great food and great service!!  Polished it off with some churros and those where great too."}
{"text":"Walking in I was reminded of a Chipotle or a Zabas. All open and you walk up to the counter and order like at a deli. But they actually bring the food and drinks out to where you are sitting which I thought was a step up above the rest. Somewhere in between a restaurant and a Chipotle. 

The food: I tried the chorizo/potato taco and the vegetarian friendly zucchini ribbon taco. The chorizo taco was full of flavor on a corn tortilla. It ad delicious flavor but could have used a bit more potato. The drizzled sauce was delicious. The zucchini taco had great flavor for a veggie taco but the water content in the zucchini made it a little soggy. 

The lady who brought our food out gave us a sample of four different salsas which went from a tomatillo salsa to a chipotle passionfruit. They were delicious.

The final note on Bruno's is the beer selection. They have an impressive selection of craft beers which I thought really took it to another level. Tacos and beer, couldn't ask for anything more! I will come back with a friend."}
{"text":"The grilled skirt steak taco on a corn tortilla is BOMB! Simple and satisfying! Love the simplicity of the menu and the decor. Love the sauces! The beer menu is much larger than the food menu. I want to try everything here but must pace ourselves. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"All you need in life is TACOS! 

Small little joint with GOOD food and great customer service. I like how their menu is simple with just a few items categorized into tacos, guacamole, churros, and drinks. It made it easy for me to make up my mind on what to eat haha. 

As for the food I got-
Braised Short Rib Taco $4.25 each : this was my favorite. The meat was tender, juicy, and melts in your mouth. 
Chicken Al Pastor $3.95 each: I loved the pineapple pico that it comes with it.
Classic guac $5.00 : simple, came with chips.
Chocolate almond churro with vanilla ice cream $7.50 : OhhEmmGee yummm.
They have vegetarian options. With the tacos, you can get them on flour/corn tortillas or lettuce. Your table will also get 4 samples of salsa. It goes from mild to hot. I was able to do the hot salsa....which means it's not that spicy. The place was packed on a Friday evening. None of us tried any of their drinks, but I really want to try their Horchata Latte andd whatever drink that is with 2pac on it!!! Saw it in one of the pictures haha. I'll be back since its just down the street from my house."}
{"text":"So glad this Taco Bar opened around the corner from home. The ladies behind the counter are super helpful and accommodating. We stopped by because we noticed they do lettuce wraps as an option for tortillas. They also have vegan options for all the selections. The place is simple, nothing fancy. But you get your order fairly quickly. The Skirt steak was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Originally I We tried this place cuz of the name. I'm a Bruno after all. Then it wasn't an Italian place, so that was an attraction too. (Been there, ate that). 
There were 4 of us, so we tried nearly all the food. 
EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL!! 
The vegetarian options were great and the food was marvelous and well worth the wait while everything (really everything!) is made from scratch.  If this place sold t shirts, I'd buy one. 
The owner and staff were friendly and pleasant, the atmosphere was  bright and open, everything was wonderfully clean, and the details like the marble table tops and cool geometric paints were unusual and fun. 
The drinks were excellent, the guacamole was superb and in a town full of great choices, I  can see myself returning here  often if only to try the weekly specials.  Thanks for a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"Really good tacos made with excellent ingredients. A variety of vegetarian options too that can be prepared vegan. They also use separate oils and batter to prepare the vegetarian/vegan options. December is a soft opening month. So the hours are a bit odd - open after 3pm"}
{"text":"Great food! My favorite taco was the Potato Chorizo. Cool environment and awesome salsa boat to sample. Give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish they had 6 stars i could hit on this thing. I really enjoyed this place, it was very fresh and clean and the staff is very friendly.  The food is outstanding and i can tell its all made from scratch from the drinks to the salsas tortillas and even how they season and marinate the meats.  I was impressed and it's only been open since dec so i want to help spread the word for these guys and hopefully more will open up because they deserve to grow. I will be back and i don't care if I'm 30 min away or not it will be worth it.  Way to go brunos taco bar keep it up."}
{"text":"Ok, I saw this place in Dec when they were doing events and trainings and I was excited to try it. Then I saw that most of their special tacos, had vegetarian substitutions for the meat. I stoped by the other nite and it wasn't too busy, which was perfect bc I wanted to ask a bunch of questions!  the girl working was amazing and helpful and I was asking how each one could be vegan. So she went through everything with me and I went with her favorite, the Baja Fish Tacos. Mine had beer battered cauliflower for a sub. They also left off the slaw that contained crema, but kinda wilted some fresh cabbage up so is still got that component. Then topped with pickled onions! They also give you salsas to try and I loooooved the tomatillo pico de gallo! The place was decent priced and they had a bunch of different guacamole's and some darn good beers, including drafts. I will for sure be back!!!! Thanks guys for offering non meat options!"}
{"text":"My husband and I randomly stumbled upon this goldmine when going to get him a bottle of wine from next door. I saw the magical word \"Churro\" and decided that I just had to stop in. From the jump we were welcomed with warmness which is rather rare here in Vegas.

I ordered my churros and ice cream and when the super friendly girl behind the counter (I didn't catch her name) told me about their $2.00 draft special I knew it was something my husband would appreciate. 

My husband ordered his beer and had a potato and chorizo taco.

Now what caught my eye were two things: they have Tecate AND they have a salsa sampler. I'm from SoCal and can appreciate an ice cold Tecate and as a Latina i definitely appreciate my salsa.

The taco was great, the churros were yummy and the ice cream was a nice touch. 

Good tacos are hard to find here so my husband and I are excited to try everything on the menu. 

Did I mention the freshly made tortillas??? Yup, FRESH and so so good.

We will be back and after I pop out this little girl (yup I'm pregnant) I will definitely partake in the Micheladas, Margaritas and their beer specials.  

Thank you Melissa for the experience, it was a pleasure meeting both of you ladies and we shall be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Vegas. The food is always made fresh. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is well accommodating. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and each time has been better than the previous time. My favorite is the fish taco, sooooooo good!!! Every order comes with a salsa tray of 4 different salsas that range from mild to spicy and all 4 are so good. My brother got a fish and a chorizo and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Steak and short rib are also a must eat! Yum! Next time I'm going to try the churros"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things in life is tacos. I like to think of myself as a \"taco connoisseur.\" So when I tell you to get your butt to Bruno's and enjoy yourself some deliciousness, I am not messing around!!! I randomly found out about them on IG (and yes I'm very disappointed that I didn't know about them or come across them sooner but they haven't been open for that long, so phew...), I grabbed my taco partner aka best friend and demanded we try them out. It didn't hurt that one of the pics on IG also showed they have mango chili margaritas (our favorite flavor and well TEQUILA!!). Not only is the place clean and cute but the menu is  a great mix of meaty and veggie tacos (also can be served on lettuce instead of tortillas for us carb watchers). I ordered a skirt steak, chicken and a short rib taco and each one was filled with their own distinct flavor and yummy goodness. Oh and I cannot forget the bacon guacamole served with perfectly salted chips! Crunchy bacon throughout the entire bowl of guacamole not just sprinkled on top which is a big thumbs up. Another nice touch is a \"flight\" of salsas that they bring to the table, each so flavorful and fresh from mild-medium-hot for all of your tastebuds to rejoice. With my tummy happy and in a taco/chip coma we realized we had to make room for a fruity pebbles churro with vanilla ice cream, I mean how can you not! (3 of us shared an order and it was just perfect) So if you are a taco lover make your way down to Bruno's, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! 

This was my first time here and all 3 ladies in the front were happy to assist and go into detail about everything on the menu. Tacos were good, a little on the salty side (potato & chorizo/ Baja fish) but overall pretty tasty. The short rib is a must!!!

Will be back....with more pictures for my latte ."}
{"text":"Awesome little taco bar!  Good drinks, great dessert and friendly staff! Tacos are tasty and unique, but a bit on the pricey side...  Nevertheless, I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"I had the best Horchata ever. The Tacos were amazing the grilled skirt steak and the Carnitas 2 of my favorite. Even the Fish taco is great and I'm not a big fish/seafood fan. The salsa tray they bring out is great. And the drinks are not watered down. The Sangria was on point."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food. I
The 3 of us ordered nachos and street tacos. This was a great deal for the money and the food was outstanding. I'll definitely be coming back here and have already told a few friends about it. I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because the restroom was fairly dirty. Other than that I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Anyone who can put Pablo Escobar on your coffee is amazing! Tacos were delicious, bacon guac, good service. Pretty badass place. Don't copy my coffee"}
{"text":"Chorizo potato burrito is killer here! We had fun with the latte machine that printed designs on top of our drink too. The churros were really tasty, I got the one with caramel drizzle and my boyfriend got the fruity pebble churro. Both redonk tasty! The only reason I'm rating 4 stars is because the service was a bit slow. They were all really friendly but we had to wait about a half hour for our churros and latte. Worth it, but if we had been in a rush it would have been problematic. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass steak tacos! Like seriously the best flavor ever! I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"If there was a standard for street tacos, this is not the place. It is at least notches above the standard. The chips, salsas, and dip are a requirement to start or you will miss out. The sirloin steak taco made me drool from the first bite. The chicken made me stop and savor every delicious bite. If you are in the Southwest and hungry for tacos this place is place to go."}
{"text":"I reluctantly gotta give 3 Stars. Mostly due to lack of preparedness. I'm hopeful that this will be a 5 Star taco shop due to the friendly staff and excellent tasting tacos, although i was very limited in what i was able to try.  They shop seems to not be prepared to be busy. On our first visit, half the menu was Sold out. Half of the taco menu was sold out, all of the guacamole was sold out and all the tables and service counters were filthy. It appears they didn't have time to clean. Their work area was filthy and the trash beneath their hand sink was overflowing with trash. The employee finally had time to wipe all the tables in the diner, and simply wiped all the food on the floor. Hopefully they are able to get prepared better for business.  Oh and if you order one of the daily \"Agua Fresca\", get ice on the side or you will be thirsty. Overpriced for a cup for of ice with little \"Agua Fresca\"."}
{"text":"Heard about Bruno's from a friend and decided to give it a try. Absolutely delicious. Super clean place, good music, excellent service and the food was amazing. Simple but amazing with so much flavor. Definitely going again especially since it's close to my work. Ha!"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have had in Vegas. Brought my family, all foodies, here while they were in town for the holidays and taking a risk as it was my first time here, it did not disappoint! Super friendly staff- Melissa is extremely nice and struck up a conversation....next thing we knew there were more tacos at our table and even a fruit pebble churro- MUST TRY!! We tried the guacamole and chips(freshly made)chicken, potatoes & chorizo, short rib, carnitas, and the Baja fish tacos. All were great- the homemade salsa assortment they bring the the table is fresh and tasty as well. Give them a try...."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable. Great menu selection and friendly, courteous staff. Long tables with barstools make the place a great hangout for big groups."}
{"text":"Two visits and I'm sold. Best tacos in Vegas. The flavors are big and bold. Great beer selection also."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come hang out, have tacos, and drink beer! I stumbled in here after one of our agents at our office told us about their soft opening after he had gotten them their lease for the building. Let's discuss the food shall we?

The Baja Fish Taco - by far my favorite! The fish is battered and fried to perfection! Upon subsequent trips here, I definitely expect to be ordering more of these in the future. The Carnitas, The Chicken Pastor, and the Grilled Skirt Steak Taco among some of the others that I also tried, great tacos!

There is also a number of drinks to try; we opted for the Jalopeno Lime Margarita, and the Passion Fruit Margarita. Both great choices! Although I might warn that the Jalopeno Margarita is a little on the spicy side. There are also a number of craft beers on tap to choose from. I decided to go with a pale ale from San Diego.

I also noticed that as the night grew a little older, more people started to come in to check the place out and gave the place a really nice vibe. I anticipate that this will definitely be a successful business!"}
{"text":"Such a good place to have horchata latte with a nice photo of my niece and nephew. Won't post it cause she won't let me. But it didn't cost extra or anything. It cost $5. for that drink. We also ordered a mango aqua Fresca which was delish! We wanted to try the tacos but it was pricey so we just bought two. One was al pastor and the other was potato chorizo. Both were good but not for that price. The churro chocolate with almonds was really good but also pricey. I guess I would go back but just for the coffee. 

The staff was friendly which is always a plus. Parking in a plaza type. So you sharing it."}
{"text":"So glad I got to try Bruno's. Ladies behind the counter were super friendly. Plus I got to meet the owner. Loved how their menu was simple and flavorful. The skirt steak was to die for!! I love that you can choose from flour, corn, or lettuce wraps. The salsa sample were all good. Be careful for the mango one. It's spicy!! But that's how I like it. I believe they are the only place in town that customizes your latte with a picture. Download the app ripple coffee and get your image for your latte. Definitely coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan so I'll jump right in -
¬∑ Chips + Guac - 
Tasted fresh & homemade. The guacamole was super good mixed w/ the passionfruit habanero sauce. Both needed a hit of salt & w/out the sauces, guac needed some acid. 4/5 
¬∑ Potato Chorizo Taco - 
Not very pretty as it arrives to the table, but fold that sucker over & dive in. SO GOOD. It is one note on texture, but it's yummy enough not to worry about it. Ordered this one on the fresh homemade flour tortillas, would do that every time! 4.5/5
¬∑ Skirt Steak Taco - 
I was skeptical, from fellow yelper's photos, I noticed it lacks toppings (I love toppings!). Thinking it could be dry & low on flavor. Nope! I was impressed, it didn't need to hide-behind-a-thing. It's like, \"That's right, I am literally just meat. In a tortilla. What?!\" Not very photogenic but the meat was so juicy, cooked perfectly pink. Steak tastes like it's marinated for a couple of days, packed with garlic-y & bright chimichurri. Paired really great with the warm corn tortilla, too. Hubby mentioned how good the combo of corn/meat were. I agree, the flavors pair like Scooby & Shaggy. 5/5
¬∑ Salsas:
4 sauces arrive w/ your meal, mild to hot. My favorite by far was the hottest, the habanero passion fruit. Bottle that, I would buy it. My second favorite was the pico, more of a Pico de Gallo Verde. The sourness of the tomatillos made it an interesting & tart twist on pico. The 2 mixed were fire: tart, sweet, hot.
¬∑ Pineapple Jalapeno Margarita - Ordered it extra spicy. The lovely lady mixing drinks added a chili powdered rim to up the spice, which was my favorite detail because it made it interesting, otherwise it was very sweet. Mine had 3 jalape√±os; I was still looking for some heat & tequila flavor. The pineapple wipes out a lot of that. Next time, I'll give the chili mango a try, which they recommended to me originally. 3/5
¬∑ Fruity Pebbles Churro - 
Yes! It's a little dangerous that these are available close to home. 5/5

Service was welcoming. It's a fast casual set up, where you order at the register and orders arrived at the table. The ladies were great at explaining what each dish was, gave some recommendations - like upping the heat on the drink for me. They waited for our mains to be done before bringing out piping hot churros. Much appreciated as they were fresh and warm instead of sitting out while we ate our dinners 1st. They can tweak a couple of things, but overall the simple menu, the flavorful & filling tacos, their vegetarian and lo-carb options, their beer menu is awesome and service is warm & on point- it's a 4.75 from me so let's round up :)

...oh yeah, don't forget to ask them about their quesadillas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We had ordered the horchata latte and wow I've never had that before i would come every morning for that if i could. And to top it off you can get it customized Design how dope! We had ordered the fruity pebble churros and the churros are really fresh and soft and crispy at the same time. My mother loved there vegan taco and she was just in love so don't forget to stop by guys this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with a group of friends the other day but I've been wanting to eat here for months now! 

They are closed on Sundays and Mondays. Parking is so easy. This restaurant is in a complex with a variety of other establishments and this area doesn't get crowded often (at least it wasn't crowded when we went). 

It was very clean upon entering, and they were playing 90s R&B music! YASSS! Apparently the playlist changes depending on who's working and they decide what plays on Pandora, but PLEASE KEEP THE 90s R&B! We love it! 

The food portions are kind of big, definitely worth it. We were also given some sauces to try with our tacos. There's also a few items on their secret menu, check their Instagram to see what it is or check out my photos to see what I ordered!! And also be sure to ask what their taco of the week is! They even have a Horchata Latte. SO GEWD!

This is a conveniently close and cool spot for tacos. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Last week Saturday, I needed to get my nails done and thought the new nail salon was in the area as Bruno's.  Before getting my nails done, I needed lunch. As I looked around in the plaza, at first I was going to get a personal pan pizza, but the pizza restaurant didn't appear they had any seats available. I then decided on Bruno's and I'm so glad that I did.

My lunch order consisted of beer battered fish taco and the potato chorizo taco. Almost forgot, I also got the watermelon drink. I did ask if they had any sides as I do like Spanish rice and beans with my Mexican dish, but unfortunately they don't offer any.

To keep this as short and sweet as possible, everything I ordered was super YUMMY!

Watermelon drink was so good and refreshing. It seems like people come in just for the drinks and rightly so.

Tacos are delivered to your table with a flight of sauces. I tried all four of them even the very spicy pineapple Habaneros (sp?) sauce, which wasn't spicy at all.  The sauce on the potato chorizo taco was spicier.

I enjoyed the potato chorizo and I'm looking forward to my next visit to try out the potato and soyrizo, the vegetarian option.

And for the beer battered fish taco -  Please Bruno's Taco Bar, make a fish and chips version!! The beer battered fish is just too good to keep it in tacos.

I stopped drinking because of my obnoxious alter-ego, but if you can handle your liquor, Bruno's serves up beers and margaritas.

The only thing keeping this review from being 5-stars, is the price and the lack of sides. My fish taco was over $4.25 while my chorizo taco was over $3.65 and my drink $3. So for two tacos and a drink, my total came out to over $11.

Great food, great service, great atmosphere, and clean gets Bruno's 4-stars!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! I love this place already! Let's start with what I ordered:
Skirt steak taco on lettuce wrap.
Potato chorizo taco on flour tortilla 
Fruity pebble churro 
Tecate beer.

Both tacos were DELICIOUS! The skirt steak on lettuce was perfect, although I will say it seemed a little skimpy on the chimichurri. 
Chorizo potato was filling and the spicy crema was delicious! Not too spicy either.
The fruity pebble churro was very good, I recommend you split it with someone. I wouldn't be able to eat the two pieces by itself.
The beer prices seem fair and decent.
It's brand new so it's very clean.

More importantly the customer service was amazing. 
The staff remembered our names when we went up to order dessert, they seemed happy and pleasant.
I'll be back! 
Please open your restaurant for more hours though, I keep recommending your place to friends but the times and days of being open don't work for some people."}
{"text":"Is impossible not to like this place. Every taco they have is so good. The employees have not always been at their best but most of the time I have been happy with the service. A must to try for anyone that is looking for good tacos."}
{"text":"These are some pretty bomb tacos. They are slightly bigger then normal street tacos and there's no complaints about that here. The tortillas are made hand fresh and you can taste the quality. I had the skirt steak and short rib tacos and both were excellently prepared. The chips and guac was delicious. They definitely don't short you on the guac it's a perfect size portion. They have a flight of salsas that come out with the food which gives you plenty of options on how spicy you want to make your food. The churros are fresh and great. This place has only been open for a week but they are definitely doing it right. You won't regret coming here for food but you might regret leaving here without buying something to take home. Keep up the great work and great customer service!"}
{"text":"We were going to come for dinner, but opted for just dessert after seeing the taco prices. We ordered the fruity pebbles churro with ice cream and it was delish. Also ordered the horchata latte, it was yummy, and the latte art is free! They also offered to do any image which is pretty cool! Ordered to go, but next time I will definitely stay and try a margarita or drink a beer."}
{"text":"Chorizo potato taco on homemade yellow corn tortilla and skirt steak taco yum  chai latte almond milk hot or cold your choice. Bravo I will return, lovely fresh salsas"}
{"text":"Really good. Beware the passion fruit habenero salsa. Is hot! Chicken pastor was really good as was the fish tacos. Coming back for them churros"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Southwest Vegas! We tried me gusta tacos down the street, and it was good, but the tacos were small. Bruno's offers a bigger portion for around the same price. Also, they give you four different salsa cups ranging in heat. The habanero one is delicious! So far, my favorite taco is the chicken Al pastor. They also have a Taco of the Week, and it never disappoints. Looks like they have a full bar, but for those who like spice, try the pineapple jalapeno margarita. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"So good! Best tacos on the southwest of vegas! We are from California and the menu here made me feel at home again! Salsa selections yummy too!!!"}
{"text":"This place felt kind of odd the moment I ordered my food, but before I ordered my food, I was accompanied by a dirty bathroom. I ordered my food (the carnitas taco) and it was very plain when I got it. The only thing on it was pork and guacamole. Not to mention we only got one taco, with no side at all. I had to spend extra money to get chips and guacamole, which was pretty stupid. The orders also came out one at a time, which meant that since the portions were incredibly small, I was finished with my food before the rest of my family even got theirs. The only good thing I could take away from this restaurant is it was relatively clean, minus the bathrooms. It would have been nicer if they had rice and beans or something as a side, but no. We got one small taco for a meal. The food was pretty average and plain and it didn't have a lot of flavor. With just carnitas and guacamole on my taco it was hard to enjoy it. I would not recommend ever going to Bruno's Taco Bar."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, another dream find in the Vegas vicinity! I'm moving to the area (from California) in 3 months and this spot just made me even more excited about it!

When I saw the hilarious, high-quality latte art they produce at Bruno's on Instagram, I knew I had to check this place out. And when I saw that they have vegetarian substitutes for ALL of their tacos, I knew I was destined to be a regular customer. (By the way, their latte art is machine-based, so you can even submit your own vector image to them and they'll make you a custom latte with your picture.)

On a whim, we ordered lattes with Tupac and Big E. They turned out great! Although I've never had a horchata latte before - I guess I assumed it would be like a matcha latte and not contain coffee? I was wrong, and that's my bad. I only had a few sips before handing it off to my husband so he can have an extreme caffeine high. It seemed good though! 

I tried the soyrizo and jackfruit tacos - and both were really good and pretty large for street tacos. They also gave us a huge assortment of salsas to try while we ate there. Everything was really good and the servers were really nice. I couldn't have asked for more!"}
{"text":"If you charge $5 for a taco, no sides, it had better be amazing. It wasn't. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for it."}
{"text":"It is pricy for tacos but they are really good. They different types of salsas that are all very good and the deserts are very nice"}
{"text":"It's my first time and the food is amazing! Service is amazing!! Can't wait to come back!! I recommend the potato chorizo taco and the carnitas taco!  and don't forget the Horchata!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came across this Taco place by accident but we'll definitely be back the tacos were delicious we got the chorizo and potato they were amazing and the carnitas were tasty, the tortillas are homemade and you get a salsa sampler to go with your tacos. The service was awesome very friendly didn't get the girl that helped us name but she was great she gave us a short rib Taco to sample wich was basically a Birria Taco it was tasty as well. These are not street tacos they are on a normal size tortilla. I'm glad we found this place and so close to home no more driving around for a Taco place!"}
{"text":"Came across this restaurant on Yelp! Was looking for a healthier option and I noticed that this restaurant offers lettuce wraps and vegan options. I decided to check this place out and boy I was so glad I did! The flavor is definitely there and the ambience is cute! You can even have your coffee customized with a picture! LOL You just have to download an app and upload a picture  that you want on your coffee. Make sure to check in. You will get a free small horchata. It is creamy and really delicious! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"ARE YOU READY TO HAVE YOUR TASTE BUDS DO A LIL VICTORY DANCE WITH EVERY BITE? If yes, then definitely proceed!

For starters, customer service is great! They are all so nice and polite and just a breath of fresh air for something that's a little more fast paced.

Secondly the ambience is equally as amazing. Nice and clean, very modern little taco shop. It has a less authentic taco place kind of feel for it, but the flavor of the tacos and how well they season it definitely makes up for it. 

So now the tacos. The tacos make me excited just writing this review! I had the fish taco and their taco of the week, which was sriracha shrimp, and my boyfriend had their short rib taco and grilled skirt steak and we shared a portobello taco. I am on some sort of flexidiet where I eat primarily pescatarian but I will have bites here and there of meat. And trying my boyfriends tacos made me want to devour the whole thing! (A very rare rare desire) the tenderness of both meats were unreal. The short rib was a little too salty for my tasting, but that did not make it any less delicious. The skirt steak was cooked at just the right temperature, flavored with just the right seasonings. Now my tacos. Lol. A tad less excited for, but they did an amazing job having vegetarian options available as well as fish. Their fish taco has an enormous beer battered fish on it! I had to put some of their salsa on it (WHICH BY THE WAY, ARE ALL SO SO SO GOOD) The sriracha shrimp one was the better one out of the two. It was battered as well, perfectly crispy and saucy and just amazing. And lastly, the least exciting of them all - the mushroom taco. I had tried a mushroom taco elsewhere and fell in love it, this one not so much. It is the vegetarian option for the skirt steak, but I loved everything about the skirt steak and not too much about the mushroom one. I felt like it needed more mushrooms or sauce bc I tasted a lot more of the tortilla than anything else. 

So there ya have it! Definitely make this one of your taco Tuesday spots to try out!! So good!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. It seems this place is more bar than taco. The taco menu only had 7 tacos. There was a \"taco of the week\", but they were \"out\"? The beer and liquor menu was huge though. They also have a guacamole menu, churro menu, and coffee menu. I was only interested in a simple lunch; tacos and a soda.

I ordered the steak taco, fish taco, and a pork taco. These tacos were really delicious; however, they are about $4/ each and only √† la carte. They also don't have fountain drinks, but instead, mexican coke. So after 3 tacos and a soda, my lunch was almost $18. One thing I did really enjoy is that they bring you out a flight of salsa. The salsas really help put the tacos over the edge. 

I would love to come back to try some of the guac, but coffee and tacos doesn't sound appetizing, and beer during a work day lunch isn't going to happen. I'll probably have to wait for a weekend when I can get the full effect."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! I loved the grilled Skirt Steak, my buddy likes the Carnitas the most. If you enjoy Guacamole get the Tropical, it has a vibrant flavor with a refreshing finish."}
{"text":"So excited about this place. The Pastor Chicken tacos, \"tropical guacamole\" and the queso guacamole (my 2 year olds favorite) were all delicious. The customer service was amazing and they were so genuine and sweet when they saw my two girls 8 months and 2 years old. They brought the food out quick and waited towards the end to bring the lattes and churros which were by far everyone's favorite. The custom latte art made it such a unique touch. I saw they had a full bar with sangria, pineapple jalape√±o margaritas and SO much more. I wasn't able to enjoy that menu but I will Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!  These tacos are awesome. Nice, clean, well lit place with awesome customer service. I ordered the chili mango margarita, man was it good. I was afraid it was going to be sweet but it wasn't at all, perfect compliment to the tequila with a Tajin lined rim. I ordered the short rib taco and a carnitas taco both on corn tortilla. I thought the menu seemed over priced but it definitely isn't. You get what you pay for. Short rib taco was so flavorful dripping with juices, topped with radish. Definitely ordering again. Carnitas taco had a slight spice, again very flavorful topped with chicharron and guacamole.  Boyfriend got the chorizo and potato taco, wow!  Loved it. A little more spice than the carnitas not greasy what so ever. I never had non greasy chorizo it was awesome, definitely ordering again. They do have a few draft beers, and other drinks like horchata. Next time I'll try the churros. Tacos were huge!  I could only eat 2"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in, we felt so welcome at Bruno's.  We love the clean look of the restaurant.  When deciding which tacos to order, they explained everything in delicious detail.  You can tell that they have pride in their restaurant.  We order the skirt steak, carnitas and short rib tacos.
The grilled marinated skirt steak with Mexican chimichurri sauce was so tender. Not fatty, but juicy with so much flavor.    The braised short rib taco was out of this world good.  The salsas ranged from mild to sweat on my temples hot.  Even with the heat, I couldn't resist their flavor.  I had chai tea latte with shot of espresso with almond milk.  Not too sweet and yummy.  :-)  My BF had the Saint Archer white ale.  They have a good selection of draft and bottles.  I can't wait to try their margaritas!
We took the Cinnamon sugar churros to go (school night)  They were still delicious when we got home.
We will be back!

UPDATE:
Next visit, I tried my tacos with lettuce.  Each served on a piece of butter lettuce, I tried the fish, chicken adobo and skirt steak (again).  The fish was fried in a light crunchy coating - awesome!  The chicken al pastor had a delicious salsa!  They remembered us from our first visit. They are the nicest!  Still waiting for the margaritas - maybe this weekend."}
{"text":"I got 3 tacos Baja fish but cauliflower instead of fish - Very good but alittle salty Potato chorizo with soy chorizo - my favorite one.  And the carnitas taco with jackfruit. Very salty and I wish it had a sauce to cover up the sweat jackfruit taste but overall they were all good.   The agua Fresca was amazing today's flavor was watermelon cucumber"}
{"text":"Wow this place is excellent! I didn't expect much till I tried their tacos. Pricy but so good and yummy! 
Braised beef and skirt steak taco are just the best.
Chicken and chorizo was okay too. But not as good.
Best gourmet tacos I've had in a long time. Taco are $5 each, but worthy of the high price. 
I'll keep going here."}
{"text":"The perfect casual taco spot! I'd be here regularly if this was closer to my home. Bruno's was easy to find, not far off of the 215 and across the street from Southern Hills Hospital.

The inside of the restaurant is clean simply decorated. There were large tables, small tables, and some bar style seating for solo diners. They had more seating than restaurants like this usually have which is nice. 

Food is ordered and paid for at the counter and then brought to the table. The food came out quickly and the employee serving our food explained the different salsas. Salsa types are also on a list on the table, they range from mild to hot. When we ordered the woman at the counter offered to bring our churros later in the meal so they'd be warm. This worked out well and the server remembered to bring them without us having to return and check on them. 

We ordered a variety of items and loved almost everything we ordered.
Passion fruit Margarita- yum, the passion fruit puree tasted fresh and it was the perfect balance of the sweet fruit and the alcohol
Salsas- four ranging from mild to hot, loved all them, but my favorite was passion fruit habanero 
Bacon Guacamole- topped with plenty of crispy bacon and the guacamole itself had a great flavor and texture, chips were good
Chicken Al Pastor Taco- delicious, tender and well seasoned meat
Grilled Skirt Steak Taco- great flavor and tender meat, loved the chimichurri sauce, my favorite of the tacos
Baja Fish Taco- my least favorite of the tacos, good flavor, but the breading was too thick on the fish and a bit on the soggy side
Guajillo Braised Short Rib- great flavor, but a little saucy and not my favorite of the tacos
Potato Chorizo Taco- awesome, loved the flavor, crispy potatoes made this taco
Cinnnamon Sugar Churros- warm, crispy yet soft inside, delicious

Everything we ordered came to around $45 which didn't seem outrageous for five tacos, guacamole, a margarita, and an order of churros. Individual tacos may seem a bit pricey, but the tacos are larger than street tacos so the pricing made sense to me."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm missing something, but this place was weird. 
First of all, it's only tacos. Most of them are $4 or more each. One single taco. They do have chips & guacamole, but no rice & beans. They do not have iced tea. 
We ordered the following:
1 carnitas -mediocre, carnitas with guacamole on top, nothing else. 
1 chicken al pastor- bland
1 skirt steak- just an average marinated steak taco with zero toppings 
1 cauliflower al pastor- tasty but lukewarm and nothing super special. The pineapple salsa was the best part. 
Four of us went together. The tacos came out one at a time. It took about five minutes to eat a taco, so by the time I got my taco (last) everyone else was done eating theirs. Mine took about fifteen minutes to arrive to the table.  
I'm giving it two stars rather than one because I like the concept. I think they need to add rice & beans/combo plates. They're cheap & a good filler. They need to make the food come out at once so everyone in a group is eating at the same time. 
This was like an appetizer. If you get several tacos it'll be like $15/person not including drinks. 
I guess I just don't get it. We went home & ate dinner after eating at Bruno's."}
{"text":"Tacos are portioned a little bit bigger than your normal street taco. The baja fish and carnitas were both fantastic  My wife is a vegetarian and loved the soyrizo and cauliflower substitutes. 

This place has only been open for 5 days and it looks like they're off to a great start. 

Make sure you try the Chili Mango margarita!!"}
{"text":"I am in love! I could've easily orders three or four tacos, but I stuck to ordering two. I had the carnitas taco, and the guajillo braised short rib taco! I also ordered churros, and with one order you get two churros! I ordered the fruity pebble churro, and the cinnamon churro. It was so good, I had to hold back from ordering another two...my friend ordered the latte and that was surprisingly really good too! I wasn't disappointed with anything we ordered off the menu! The girl who cashed us out was very friendly helpful! Especially with all the questions we had regarding the latte, and how to get a design on the latte! Definitely will be going back here!"}
{"text":"Almost 11 years in vegas and I can finally say I found Mexican food I love. Looking forward to coming back and I haven't finished my first meal yet."}
{"text":"Best Horchata in town!! It was my first time checking it out and it was amazing. The tacos were excellent and loved the homemade guacamole! Will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious tacos coupled with original and flavorful salsa options! The flour tortillas are awesome.  The staff are super friendly and proud of their place! Great experience.  I just want to try all of the other menu items now!"}
{"text":"New favorite taco bar. Excellent customer service. They are the only taco bar I know of that offers lettuce wraps instead of tortillas. Recommend skirt steak taco but everything is good."}
{"text":"Bruno's is AMAZING. We stumbled across this place while we were in Las Vegas and are so happy we did. We tried the fish taco, the chicken, the short rib and the skirt steak. The skirt steak was PHENOMENAL. By far the best taco I've ever had. The home made flour tortilla alone is worth the 3 hour drive back. Would love for them to franchise so we could bring this to Lake Havasu."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The chicken al pastor taco was so delicious & comes with four different salsa choices!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed checking out Bruno's Taco Bar. I ordered the chicken taco and the pineapple salsa on it was amazing. Service was great. Plenty of tables and chair. Would definitely come here again. A++"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner. We ordered the 2 steaks, 1 carnitas, 2 chicken al pastor, 1 braised pork tacos, guac and chips, and 2 margarita drinks (passion fruit and Chile mango). Each taco cost around $3.95 -$5. Out of all that tacos, the only thing that impressed me was the steak and the margaritas drinks. Everything else was ok and a little salty. I'm not sure if u would come back again for more tacos but definitely for drinks tho.

It's a nice local area and the ambient is nice as well... service were friendly.. So if u just wanna check it out this new local place, just order the steak tacos and the drinks, you won't be disappoint. :)"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try  this place out today, so far it was ok their taco portion was actually enough to fill me up. I tried 3 of their tacos. Out of the 3 that I tried :chicken al pastor, braised short rib and carnitas w/ guacamole & chicharron. The Chicken Al Pastor had more flavors, the other 2 not so much.  Their guacamole w/bacon and chips was a bit plain. But I did very much enjoyed their Chili Mango Margarita & their Almond Chocolate Churro.  I have yet to try their coffee with a
Personalized picture.  My phone died so I'll save it for my next trip and try something diff."}
{"text":"My first visit I actually came for the coffee/latte because you can actually get a photo \"printed\" on your latte. Call me a sucker but I love things like that, haha. Anyway, I came and ordered a latte. I had to download an app where I upload the picture I want in my latte. Simple enough. Boom 5 minutes my latte was complete with my family picture sitting pretty right on top. I didn't even wanna drink it, haha, but I did and the latte was delicious! I did come back another time for the tacos and I won't be returning for the tacos, seems a little overpriced for mediocre tacos. But I will be back for more latte picture fun!"}
{"text":"My friends and I try to go here as a \"treat yo'self\" type of indulgence, because it's so good! I don't know about the authenticity of the food, but what I will say is that it is delicious regardless, with about 7 taco options ranging from $3-4. You have the choice of flour, corn, or lettuce, and they have a complimentary sampler of hot sauces. What sets this place apart from others is the sheer trendiness of it all; the walls and overall decor are begging to be put on social media, they have (surprisingly delicious) lattes that have completely customizable artwork on it-which is how I originally found out about this place, churros with unconventional flavors such as fruity pebbles, etc. I love going here, and I highly suggest trying  it out!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday

My friend girl & I stopped by for tacos and of course their irresistible hip-hop latte art!

(5) Tacos
-The coconut shrimp \"taco of the week\" was decent; no exceptional flavors to rave about.
-Baja Fish Taco $4.25 was okay; breading a bit excessive though
-Carnitas Taco $3.85 The jack fruit was pretty bland but the guac was great. 
My best-friend really enjoyed her carnivore tacos.

(2) Horchata Lattes- I legit enjoyed every sip of my Drizzy lyrics! I could drink these all day long just because. 
(1) Chocolate & Coconut Churro $7- No Bueno! 
(1) Caramel Churro $5 (+1.50 for ice cream) Definitely recommend with the ice cream if your about that sugar life!

$45+ Tip that added up real quick! Unsure if I'll be back for tacos but I'm certain I'll return for a creative latte YOLO!!"}
{"text":"Super Super Good place . The staff was super friendly, they make customized cappuccino foam designs, super cool the flavors of the food Great!"}
{"text":"Cute simple  bar.. yes only tacos here..no burritos. Simple easy menu..Vegetarian option as well.Good tacos,good salsa and cheap beer..red beers and margaritas as well.. friendly staff a plus."}
{"text":"First time here and the Ladies were was and inviting. Great day to go since it's Cinco De Mayo! Had 2 tacos, skirt steak and a veggie one, zucchini ribbon, corn and cheese. Also had chips and guacamole and red sangria. Veggie taco was great flavor but wasn't crazy about it. Steak was great, lots of meat! Great flavors as well. Chips and guacamole was YUMMY! The sangria was THE BIZ! Yummy!! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went mostly for the art printed latte but the tacos were delicious and the service was great! Don't forget to check in to get a free horchata. Latte and horchata wasn't my favorite though; thought it was too sweet. But they had great selection of beers which is a big plus. Decor is simple and clean but the table tops were dirty. Eating tacos get messy so I think they should clean the tables well and more often. Otherwise, I'll be going back for more tacos."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and it won't be my last! Lol These are some of the best tacos I have eaten at an establishment in a very long time. The staff is super friendly and extremely hospitable. I enjoy the various salsas they offer... you have to try their tortilla chips. Everything here is BOMB!!! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If Bruno's Taco Bar was a women personified, I would eat her ass everyday. This is what Bruno's Taco Bar is to me: a guilty pleasure that feels so dirty yet so good. Churros, beers, and tacos. What more can a man ask for? Would eat ass everyday. 5/5"}
{"text":"Finally a real family own real Mexican restaurant. Great amazing food and especially the drinks. The people there are so friendly and very welcoming. I especially like how they cater to patrons allergies and likes and dislikes. They have 4 great homemade style  salsa for diffent for taste. I'm diffently coming back for seconds..."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place, driven by it a few times and finally went in for some tacos & churros.

They have a good amount of tacos on the menu & I love that they have a few options to make the tacos vegetarian. I was going to give this a 3 star review but settled on 4 after writing this and I'll tell you why.

Let's start with the iffy:
- It could have been because they were short staffed but I felt the service was a bit slow for a \"quick\" taco spot
- The tacos came out one by one, slowly... I'm not sure if that is what they were going for in concept, but I would have liked to have all my tacos come out at once. 
- Lacking in salt for me.. which made all of the tacos taste very one note. 

The better:
- The options of salsa, the tomatillo & habanaro were my favorite & helped to add flavor to the tacos 
- The guac & chips.. probably the best chips I've had in awhile. They didn't feel one bit greasy & were light in texture.
- The chicken pastor taco. It was my favorite out of the 3 I ordered. 
- The churros. I'll leave it at that, they know what they are doing when it come to them. If I hadn't tried them, this review would be sitting at a 3.

I'm thinking they had an off night, with the lack of salt, so I may give the tacos another shot. But right now, if I were to return it would probably be just for the churros & coffee"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Between my boyfriend and I, we ate the skirt steak, al pastor, short ribs, and carnitas and they were all amazing. The bacon guacamole and salsa bar were also great. And we definitely couldn't pass up the caramel churros before we left. Staff was friendly as well. 

My only gripe would be that the tortillas got cold too quickly, but I'm a slow eater too ? Also, the single \"$\" here on Yelp is deceiving because the tacos are definitely pricey, but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The wait is killer. Too long. My food hasn't even come yet and I don't plan on coming here again. There's another taco place at warm springs/Durango that we will hit before we come back here again."}
{"text":"We love the fruity pebble churros!!! Check it out! Staff is so friendly and helpful. They can also print an image on your coffee foam! That's is so cool! #YabbaDabbaDelicious"}
{"text":"Fire food with great textures and flavors and friendly staff  It's great to have an amazing taco place on the SW side 

We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I love the minimalist design of this restaurant from its marble tables to the chevron designed walls. You order at the bar and seat yourself. Upon walking in, we were immediately greeted. The menu is pretty simple: there are seven types of tacos with the option of substituting the meat with cauliflower. There's also a variety of churros, drinks, and guacamole with chips included. I ordered a fish taco and the chicken al pastor taco, and my boyfriend ordered the potato chorizo and a steak taco. You have the option of choosing flour or corn for the tortilla. The tacos are about six inches long, which is larger than your typical tacos at other eateries. What really stood out to me was the avocado cream that was used on the chicken al pastor. It was so, so flavorful. In addition, the battered fish taco tasted fresh and light. The breading wasn't too heavy either! The food is brought out with a sauce tray with four different spice levels. We also ordered the watermlon agua fresca which was a refreshing addition to the meal. Honestly, it was pricier than other taco joints but I would definitely return for the avocado cream and to try the printed lattes."}
{"text":"This place was so cute they have a super friendly staff and the food was pretty good no complaints I just think they need to season there food little more and make the tacos with more guacamole I pay $4.00 for a taco and I got very very little guacamole that was kinda funny , but love there churros and there lates are so cute they make them with a cute logo of your choice very cute. They need to keep their bathrooms little more clean but cute place"}
{"text":"Yelp to the rescue again! We wanted something new for date night & the pictures our fellow Yelp reviewers posted looked awesome! Small place, clean, good seating, very bright! The music is a little loud, but other than that it's a nice little find. 
The staff were friendly and the food came out fairly quickly! They were busy, but we waited longer in line than we did in waiting for our food! 

We started with bacon guacamole and salsa bar. The chips are fresh and crispy! The bacon guacamole was freaking amazing!!! I want to have gallons of it at home! They have 4 salsa in their tray. The first is mild and refreshing. They go in order from hot there. The second was \"mild\" but definitely had a kick! I couldn't try third or fourth, but hubby did and he said that he felt his tongue burning  

We ordered the steak taco and carnitas taco. The steak is so good! Tender, flavorful, and the chimi sauce was fresh! They should serve it with huevos rancheros for breakfast! #steakandeggs ! The carnitas were cooked well; tender and great flavor! I couldn't finish mine because there was a ton of meat considering! 

We finished off our delicious dinner with churros! Do not skip the churros!!!! We got an original and a fruity pebbles. I am in love with the fruity pebbles! Hubby loved the original! We didn't try the drinks, but the margaritas looked delicious and they have a wide selection of beer too! 

Small and tucked away in a corner, but definitely worth trying! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It was as delicious as I hoped it would be. Bacon guacamole! Honestly though the corn tortillas were delicious and the taco sizes and meat quality were totally generous. Grabbed a coffee on the way out and was amazed that even their brews were good too!!!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Taco Place ever!!! 10/10 recommend!! So cute.. staff is very friendly and the food is AMAZING! We were trying to be a little healthy so tried all the tacos on lettuce wraps instead and they were all great!!"}
{"text":"Super flavorul. Tried the steak tacos and the al pastor! Guacamole was bomb. Fruity pebble churros were good if you're not too full."}
{"text":"I started this review before even trying the tacos because of how amazing the front girl was! I didn't get her name but she was incredibly helpful and just had a great attitude. She suggested options and even labeled all the tacos for me (to go order).

In addition to great service, the tacos were delicious! I had the skirt steak and the taco of the day which was a Thai inspired taco. 

Overall really great atmosphere, clean restaurant, friendly staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"Really yummy tacos. Not the usual ones either--they try to innovate and produce tacos that while more expensive than your usual tacos are also interesting and more flavorful. I had three: the skirt steak, chicken pastor, and short rib. The first two were the standouts, with a nice complex flavor. The shirt ribs one was ok but not quite as good. Definitely would like to return."}
{"text":"Second time visit and not disappointed.  We've had the skirt steak, portabella mushroom, chicken al pastor, Baja fish taco and carnitas tocos so far; and  they are all delicious.  Great summertime dinner with a passion fruit margarita.  The churros and ice cream are a perfect finale for a trifecta of yum mines."}
{"text":"Loved it. Bummed that they were out of some items. Guess we will have to go earlier. 
I got the fish tacos, al pastor and the Chile margarita. Everything was delicious, can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. No joke. I'm a taco connoisseur and I've tried most popular and trendy taco shops in Vegas. This is by far the best. Clean restaurant, modern design, super friendly staff. I had 4 tacos - fish, short rib, carnitas and bul go gi (Korean beef, taco of the week). I ended with a fruity pebbles churro and a horchata latte. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian options - the soyrizo potato tacos are my favorite, and their guacamole is delicious! Chill environment, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything from the aqua Fresca (watermelon/cucumber), the homemade guacamole, horchata lattes (yessssss), and street tacos (that look simple, but are delicious!) This place is amazing!!!! Everything we tried was so good! And i absolutely love that they have a vegetarian substitution for every taco! 

The battered fish taco was my favorite! I also was able to try the vegetarian cauliflower option and it was just as good!! 

Only downfall is they are closed on Sundays/Monday's

FYI the cool latte art you see in all the photos you have to download 2 separate apps on your phone and one of the apps sends the image to their machine. Sounded like a great idea but kind of a hassle"}
{"text":"OMG this place is fantastic!  Their lattes are amazing and I tried both the beef and chicken tacos and loved them both.  They give a nice assortment of salsa with the chips for those of you braver than me to try the hot stuff.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected prices are too high especially for the amount of food given could of been a bit better"}
