{"text":"Sometimes I have a great time at RPM's and sometimes it's yuck.

They have a great outside tiki bar and allot of places to sit

I usually only go here during the summer when it's warm"}
{"text":"Stopped in twice a few weeks ago.
Great place if you like AWFUL SMOKE
and scum kitchen workers and bar staff trying
to sell DRUGS. ?
What happened to the Irish guy.?
We won't be back too many Thugs."}
{"text":"It's now 31 Sports Bar - Grille.

I don't understand how so many places get away with the smoking. We didn't even bother to sit down, since it smelled like smoke so much. If they ever clean the place out and stop allowing smoking, I'd be willing to try it, but until then I see no reason to go anywhere near it again."}
{"text":"Better than average bar food and exceptional wings. The reason my review is so low is due to the excessive amount of smoking going on in this bar and restaurant. It's the worst I've ever experienced in my life and I'm surprised they allow it. Business would likely be much better if they moved smoking to the outside."}
{"text":"Bike nights on Wednesday with $0.25 wings. I'd come back on a bike night."}
{"text":"This past Saturday night, my lovely ladyfriend took me to RPM's to witness the aural metallic majesty of...Powerslave, an Iron Maiden tribute band.

Yeah, I'm a metal fan. Deal. 

RPM's seems to specialize in cover bands and the occasional real act from the distant past that decided to put out a new record and hit the road. I saw solicits for a Who tribute band and an Ozzy/Black Sabbath group called Black Sunday. Chi-town doom metal legends Trouble played there last year with local power/prog upstarts Icarus Witch. White Lion (!) was supposed to play there in November but cancelled. 

They do serve food, and it's typical bar munchies 'n  grub. I got a cheeseburger which was ok with homemade potato chips which were excellent.

There are games, a dartboard, and a pool table.

You'd never expect to find such a place buried in the suburbs of Bridgeville amongst the big box stores and strip malls. I kept forgetting that I wasn't in Lawrenceville, Mt. Washington, or my native Brookline. 

So go and stomp your feet, thrash, and punch air to a bunch of regular guys with day jobs pretending to be your idols, and have a gas along with 'em. Make sure you take an old friend too, one who likes the same back-in-the-day stuff you do.

P.S. They really need to fix the door on the stall in the gent's bathroom."}
{"text":"The wings are good, better than most.  The outside bar can be fun.  Thursday Bikers night with $.25 wings.

The inside allows smoking....YUK!

The sign outside changed a while back and has the name 31 Sports Bar - Grill."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited on bike night. Only 4 bikes there. Now wings are free with a bucket of beer and otherwise .25 per wing. This was no big deal, until the bartender wanted me to go inside to order a certain beer. I thought I was the customer?. She then proceeded to tell another customer that she didn't know where the waitress was at and she really didn't like serving food. I went back to the bar to order only to not get waited on and when my husband went to the bar, he was waited on within 5 minutes. The wings were only lightly covered with sauce and not as good as last summer. The last straw was when we got to see  both the bartender and cook smoking cigarettes behind the bar while serving food and drinks. The actual was very friendly, but had to leave the inside bar to get our bill because, guess what? the bartender would not wait on me, a female customer, again! We decided that we would not return and will find another place for wing night. Hope the new penguin owner helps this place out."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service quality was poor for example we sat for a half an hour waiting for our server to clean off our empty plates much less give us our bill."}
{"text":"I've been here for several shows and I like the room with the stage except for the pole in the middle which is really annoying.
Parking is limited and several times I've had to park across the street and walk over. The parking lot is really awkward to get in and out of too up a steep hill.
They charge $3.75 for a Bud Light which is a little pricy in my opinion....other bars in the area charge $2.75.
Smoking is permitted in here and the ventilation is terrible so you will leave smelling like an ashtray."}
