{"text":"For the limited Chinese food option in Newmarket this places offers on par, decent Canadianized Chinese food. Whenever I can't be bothered to drive down to aurora/Richmond hill for real Chinese food I'd come here. Strongly recommend their homemade fried rice vermicelli.   I do wish that they use less/no MSG in their food."}
{"text":"I have been on a mission to find the best Chinese food in Newmarket. I've tried just about every restaurant. Hundred Taste is good, especially their fried rice (which I always enjoy so I order it every time). Sadly, they only have spring rolls, not egg rolls (which we prefer). I uploaded a picture of my plate which features BBQ pork fried rice, Singapore noodles and beef with broccoli. Everything was hot and fresh and the service was friendly and helpful. I will definitely order from Hundred Taste again."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place yesterday and the food definitely fulfilled my Chinese food craving. Ordered the house fried rice, which come with shrimp, chicken, and beef, salt and pepper pork and shrimp, and fried shrimp wontons. If you ever come by here the salt and pepper pork chops and shrimps are a most have. They were perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. The guy who took our order was also super friendly and attentive. A+ for customer service. He packaged our food really nicely, as it was a to go order and he also threw in 2 free spring rolls. Kinda wished they gave more hot sauce but overall it was a positive experience and since i don't live too far, this will definitely be my go to place for Chinese food"}
