{"text":"The pizza sauce needs a good improvement, sauce to spicy. The subs are ok."}
{"text":"Honestly I live like 5 minutes away from this place and other restaurants and come here because the food is actually good. The subs are really good and is my most reccommended food. Poutine is the runner up to the submarine. Server is a little slow but generally it's good!"}
{"text":"So I went there to order a small sub. The food was good but the service was really so-so.

SERVICE:

 I wanted a pepperoni sub with peppers and mushrooms. On the menu they didn't have that specific sub, but anyways all their subs are the same price. The waitress asks me what I want, and I describe the ingredients I wanted. She sighs impatiently and asks me which NUMBER I wanted (so basically, I was stuck choosing one of their specific sub). So I tell her this number but with mushrooms. She says, ok but there will be an extra charged for the mushrooms. So I change the number (there was one sub with all kind of ingredients on it) and tell her: this sub but without this, without that, and without that, so I wouldn't be charged extra. See? made no sense!! All their subs are the same price, and it's not like I wanted extra meat or cheese!

During the meal, on two occasions the waitress pointed out that I wasn't eating a lot, which I thought was very rude, and made me feel uncomfortable. In the end I felt forced to tell her it was because I had a stomach surgery. 


FOOD:

The sub was great, the ingredients are fresh. They serve it with a special mayo that tastes great. I also took a lemonade, which they make fresh  from scratch with real lemons (I was told so by the waitress), and it was really good, not too sweet.

PRICE:

It cost me 7,95$ for a 7 inch sub. The lemonade was 2,25$. During lunch hour, they have specials for 10$ you have a soup, a meal (when I went you had choice between steak with peppers, small pizza with ceasar salad, or lasagna au gratin), a desert and a coffee or tea. 

CONCLUSION:

I would still go back but simply ignore the waitress ;-)"}
{"text":"Good pizza but Hollywood Pizzeria is a little better. Al's subs on pizza dough are amazing and I go with that before the pizza."}
{"text":"La pire place au monde. Faut vraiment avoir son cerveau détruit et être proche de mourir de faim pour mettre les pieds dans ce taudis pour pecnos. L'accueil est répulsif. La vieille truie qui sert à la caisse fait tout pour repousser le client. Le sous-marin 7 pouces est ridiculement cher (10 pièces), servi comme une grosse merde avec du pain cheap et de la salade au rabais. Pas mauvais mais pour moins cher et pour cette qualité, mieux vaut aller chez double pizza."}
