{"text":"Great selection of gelato and very friendly staff! Usually get a medium cup with two flavors and it's great everytime! The espresso hasn't been burnt yet the few times we got it!"}
{"text":"HELLO GELATO! I love shopping and a close second to shopping is gelato. So when I looked up gelato and saw one was at vaughan mills, it was the best of both worlds. This gelato shop is located nearby Bass pro shop (it's more of a booth in the centre), and it's a perfect place to go when you want to take a break from walking that circular mall.

They serve not only gelato, but also paninis, coffee and desserts. There's also a small seating area. We tried a bunch of their gelato, and I loved how each flavour came with a verbal description of the ingredients. I eventually settled on the pistachio gelato which was the best Pistachio gelato I think I've ever had- Made from fresh pistachios. There's about 15 flavours to choose from. One scoop is $3.99, two scoops for $4.99, and three for $5.99. You can get it in a cup (comes with a little water) or get it in a cone for $0.50. The cone is so delicious and crispy, tasted so fresh just like their gelato.

Next time I'm in this mall and want to treat myself, I'm definitely coming back to have their gelato."}
{"text":"I'm so happy i tried this gelato shop and it's so awesome it's easily located in vaughan mills! I'm gonna base my review on the two flavours I tried which were the cappuccino and hazelnut. I must say that I tried the hazelnut first and it was just pure amazing. They won't even need to label it for me to know it's hazelnut flavoured. After trying the hazelnut, I tried the cappuccino...  it was just hard to beat the hazelnut. I could barely tell it was cappuccino. It just tasted sweet to me. When I go back, I will try hazelnut and chocolate just like suggested by the shop. Also, I would recommend the dark chocolate for those who love dark chocolate. It was very rich, cocoa-y, and sweet at the same time."}
{"text":"Love it! Amazing selection incredible flavours!
Not the cheapest dessert but since it's all natural, pure ice cream and not air, or fat and sugar...
The amazing flavours and selections impress us every time! 
Love it!"}
{"text":"Every time when I shop at Vaughan Mills, there is one place that I need to drop by, which is this gelato place. This place has one of the best gelato in town.  I recommend tiramisu,coffee and mango flavour.  Try it and you won't feel regard."}
{"text":"Great service but fell short on the scoop. I ordered their cookies gelato on a cone. The struggle was real getting that scoop on my cone. And that's where my cone fell short of gelato. I was done eating it by the time I payed for it. I really liked the flavors. It wasn't too sweet, and balanced with cookie and chocolate crumbs. 

Next time I will fight for that scoop. It probably would have been better in the cup."}
{"text":"So this came as a surprise to me as I was walking around Vaughn Mills. It was settled in a booth in the middle close to the Bass Pro Mills Shop. They had a variety of flavours to choose from and give you small samples to test out their different gelato flavours. We got a scoop of the Hazelnut and a double scoop of the Stracciatella and Hazelnut flavour mixed together in a cup. Liked how they added a small wafer to the ice cream you can enjoy as well. Both cost about $10 and were pretty good but found it to be a lot sweeter than other gelatos we have had. They offer cones, coffees, paninis etc. Nice place to check out before or after a tiring day of shopping : )"}
{"text":"This is located bear the bass pro shop in Vaughn Mills shopping center. The gelato here was pretty good! Wanted to try pistachio, but was disappointed that they ran out. You can pick more flavors the larger the size you order. Gelato came with a cute little cookie too!"}
{"text":"I finally found an authentic gelateria - grazie gelato gods! They have several other locations (Niagara on the Lake, Niagara Falls, Florence Italy, etc) and I'm so glad this one opened up recently since it's a much closer drive.

This is real authentic gelato people! Actual Italians are running this joint. This isn't your its-actually-ice-cream-but-we'll-call-it-gelato-for-fun nonsense. You know how hard it is finding actual gelato? You know the pain my taste buds have had to go through to find gelato this good? The struggles.

My favourite flavours have got to be chocolate (super rich and flavourful, really comparable to the dark chocolate flavour from Grom in Italy), and amaretto. The texture is perfect and if you get it in a cup, always comes with a nice wafer slice.

They also have mini cones, chocolate dipped popcicles, cakes, coffee, and the sorts. I think the only thing they're missing are granitas - that would be perfect on a hot summer day! 

It's located at the large booth in the center aisle near the Bass Pro Shop at Vaughan Mills. They recently added a few table seating nearby too which is perfect when you can't walk around devouring their cakes.

This place has quickly become one of my favourite gelato shops in the GTA. So, if you're looking for a little pick me up while shopping, there's no better choice you can make than to visit this stall!"}
