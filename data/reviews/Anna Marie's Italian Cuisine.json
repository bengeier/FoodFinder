{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time with my family- we had the grandmas pie. Being from the east coast, and an Italian, I know both pizza and Italian food. For being located in a strip mall, I was SHOCKED by both the ambiance and the quality of food. The bread was also delicious! We look forward to coming back next time and trying a pasta dish! The pizza was incredible (I was extra delighted that they had broccoli as a topping, i find many pizza places don't have that as a topping) and he price was right. Our waiter (I THINK his name was bj?) was delightful and the manager was so sweet and even took time to come compliment on the good behavior of our two year old:) We will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"Katie is so awesome! She runs the bar, and I often swing by just to enjoy a splendid drink and fine company. I don't think I would enjoy this restaurant as much if Katie wasn't there. By the way, the food is great!"}
{"text":"We ordered 7 Grandma pizzas for my husbands retirement party- some with pepperoni or sausage, some veg.  They were a big hit.  Anna Marie's did a great job all the way from helping me place my order to the right-on-time pickup.  We won't hesitate to use them again for in home parties."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Unbelievably great food for every course and amazing wine selection. I wi definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"I had a truly amazing meal.  The server was extremely  friendly and very knowledgeable. The food was delicious and very well priced... The owners of the restaurant took time to come over to my table and make sure everything was perfect.  I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it..."}
{"text":"Arrived a little after 9pm.  Thought it was closed. I guess windows are tinted due to the afternoon sun but, to our surprise, we walked into a very beautiful establishment where we were greeted immediately and seated.  It has casual seating (booths, tables and of course a very nice bar area).   They have a very extensive Italian menu selection including pizza. Very reasonable pricing and the portions were very large.  Baked clams were excellent including the Seafood combo.  Ziti, antipasto ....excellent!   Compliments to the chef.  Will definitely return. Excellent service also!"}
{"text":"What a great casual place to be to venture off the Strip. Food was superb. Garlic Knots are awesome along with the Baked Penne and the Shrimp Scampi over pasta. Nice wine list, open kitchen, staff was very friendly. We would go again!"}
{"text":"It's the menu and it's the people that make this restaurant the multigenerational hit that it's become. Convenient-Quality-Service. They nailed it. Thank you and will repeat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and so glad that there is an authentic Italian restaurant! Everything we have tried at your restaurant was Delicious!!!From the calamari, chicken parm, pasta, pizza and the awesome ricotta cheese cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Ok I never write reviews but I feel like I must. First the server was great but still took over an hour for our food then when it did come out one of our meals was missing it took about twenty minutes for our last meal to come out by that time most of the party was done eating. The server was very apologetic and offered us free desert let's just say the tiramisu was amazing but the rest of the food was less then desirable. Long wait for not great food will probably never eat here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I  Enjoyed coming to eat here.  The place in the atmosphere are just perfect. We were greeted right away and sat down within a few seconds. Everyone was so nice. The place was decorated beautifully. We  Had appetizers And made our own pizza. The food was so delicious we weren't able to finish all of our pizza. The Sangria was off the hook. Our server, Jason, told us a little bit about how the food is made And how the Sangria was infused to Give it that extra flavor.  This is a must try place whether you're a little hungry or very hungry  And of course you have to try their drinks. We will definitely come back and maybe even for their happy hour."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here.  Service was great, food was great, prices were great, and the ambiance.  I literally just went to Carbone last night which is an upscale italian restaurant inside of Aria and Anna Marie's is better, and a third of the price.  I had the chicken saltimboca with a side of ziti pasta/vodka sauce. So much food for $15.  My husband had the chicken parmesan, he loved it.   Wine was a little pricey, but amazing Chanti.  Garlic knots were good, but the bread they bring you was better.  We really had a great experience.  I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is Nora's-lite. Lots of positive reviews and I was hoping  Anna Marie's would satisfy. The bar and restaurant are clean and pleasant. Staff is friendly and efficient. Maybe its best use is Happy Hour at the bar.   The calamari tasted pasty and bland. The rings were chewy and rubbery. My jaw was tired. I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni and noticed that the chicken was cut into small squares like chiclets (yes, the gum). This made the dish seem like a processed meal rather than a classic recipe. The portion was very generous, but the food is a bit off the mark. Perhaps I'll try their pizza if I return."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out. When I went to pick it up, nobody seemed to know it was a carry out order and staff engaged in an awkward debate over who was at fault. Food was mediocre at best. Stuffed shells were dry, salty and overall unappetizing. We didn't eat it. Eggplant parm was also not very good. Mushy and lacking flavor. We ended up sharing the side of spaghetti with sausage. It was basic, nothing special. Unfortunately we paid $40 for a blah meal that mostly ended up in the trash. We had high hopes that this place since they first put their sign up. Hopefully they make a turn around but their food needs to be better than something I can make at home for pennies with a box of dried pasta and a store bought sauce. Since it was the first week, we may give it a try in the future."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood Italian restaurant with quality food. Bartender Bart super nice and personable. I ordered the Ravioli and my husband had the Veal, both delicious dishes. Cesar salad with a hint of sardines the way we like it. Highly recommend this place, by 6:30 pm on a Tuesday night the restaurant was 80% full. Nice full bar set up and a great happy hour, although we ordered off the main menu. Will be back for the pizza next time. Love the decor, music and ambiance."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Our large table seemed to wait a long time for our food but the server was so apologetic and gave us free cannolis! Our waiter was the best FYI. The atmosphere is very modern and felt very luxurious. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food which sounded amazing. Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers who walked by and got themselves drinks instead or the person on the phone who saw us and didn't acknowledge us either. There was also a customer wandering around trying to pay her bill with no one coming to help.  Perhaps if they fix the wait staff we will try again. If this was a problem in an almost empty restaurant I can't imagine what it's like when it's crowded."}
{"text":"Written a previous review on their takeout pizza 5 stars. Tonight we went there and had dinner- absolutely wonderful!! DJ was our server, he was great, seeing to any request. Love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our second time here for dinner, and what a disappointment it was!! Our entrees literally came out 3-minutes after our appetizers (not to mention that the customer who showed up after us, received his appetizer before us - how inappropriate!).   More annoying factors after the poor timing element - my Chicken Marsala was overcooked & the sauce didn't have an ounce of Marsala wine (really?!!). The whole entree tasted HORRIBLE! The only reason why I didn't rate this place two-stars is because the staff were amicable."}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday dinner and I loved it!!! Penne ala vodka was amazing and also the house salad with red wine vinegar !!! Bravo"}
{"text":"Awesome place with authentic regional food. You can't wrong with anything from the menu. Service is also very good with friendly and attentive staff. Don't forget their homemade deserts; to die for."}
{"text":"A great Italian Restaurant/Bar with a beautiful ambiance!! Not your average red and white checkered table cloth establishment.  Its only been open a little over a month and already my favorite place.  Try the Chicken Francese. I wanted to lick my plate.  The dinner salads are amazing and the Shrimp Scampi  are HUGE!! Been there 7 times since their opening and always have had delicious food and stellar service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and Justin was great! Big portions and great cannoli! Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner with my mom we shared a Caprese salad and the chicken rigatoni both were delicious the chicken rigatoni was in a Marsala cream sauce with chicken and caramelized onions and it was to die for definitely will be back"}
{"text":"My wife found this on Yelp after I was working all day and knew we needed a nice dinner afterwards. We were not dissappointed. The service was excellent. Our waiter, Justin I believe, was a fellow New Yorker and very knowledgeable about the menu.  The menu itself was pretty substantial with a good variety of items across the board. We split large salad which was very good. I enjoyed the Pasta Fagaloi while my wife enjoyed the minestrone. For a main course I had something different and ordered the Chicken Sorrentino which was very tasty and brown sause was excellent but a little salty.   Definately recommend this restaurant if you are in the mood for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to say that I cannot go back to Anna Marie's because I did enjoy the food. But the service and the backlog in the kitchen has become intolerable. The wait to get served has become ridiculous. The hostess cannot seat you because the kitchen is backed up. Finally you do get seated but that does not make any difference. You still have a long wait of minimally 45 minutes to over an hour; because the kitchen is still backed up. The staff keeps repeating over and over again it will be soon. Everybody is running around and nothing is getting accomplished. This kitchen is completely disorganized with no order to the way food gets delivered. The person who cooks may prepare food well, but he is not a restaurant chef and does not seem to know how to run his kitchen.  I was a pretty regular customer coming 1 to 2 times a week. Now I will not be coming back. I brought friends and family and we celebrated birthdays there. It's just not worth the wait. The food is not worth this kind of aggravation. For the next group dinner we have already chosen a different venue.  Apparently the owners are not concerned and feel the bad service and disorganized kitchen is not their problem. It's been this way for months and nothing is changing."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Way better than I would've expected. We had the calamari, cheese ravioli, rigatoni alla vodka w/ chicken, meat lovers pizza, a kids cheese pizza, and the cheesecake. Everything was exceptional. The sauces are what made the dishes. So fresh and just perfect flavor! Our server, Justin I think his name was (I'm horrible with names), told us they make it fresh with every order and not beforehand. And he was also very exceptional! The only complaint I have, if any, would be that the cheesecake didn't have a crust on it, which is usually my favorite part to eat."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time. Excellent food, great service and beautiful decor. This is a real neighborhood find that shouldn't be missed. Food quality is superb, portions are plentiful, and prices are more than reasonable along with a great wine list. We had a large group, so we got a chance to try a big variety. Pizza was the best in Vegas I've ever had. Pasta was terrific and their homemade bread is to die for, not to mention the chicken Was perfectly done. If you still have room, they make a homemade cheesecake that's amazing. We have been to most fine restaurants in Vegas, but none has the quality, value, and great atmosphere that this one has. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place. We had friends that highly recommended Anna Marie's and we were not disappointed. Pizza was magnificent and the seafood pasta looked very nice. Price was very very resonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is LOVE at first sight! My first visit here and I already can't wait to go back! It is located on the corner of Tropicana and hualapai next to the famous handel's ice cream. They have happy hour every day from 3pm-6pm and from 9 pm to close. Pretty easy to get in if you go for happy hour but after 6 pm, it gets full, even on a Monday evening. HH wines are $7 by the glass and well cocktails are $5. Very good selection and they do have small bites for happy hour. Pic posted. Their homemade bread is to die for, includes garlic and regular.  Entree pastas are very good portions, can easily share. Their penne ala vodka is one of the best I ever had and so is their lasagna. We also tried the Alla pescatore and wood fired bianca pizza. Even the small size is HUGE and absolutely delicious. We were so full on appetizers and pasta that had no room for dessert. Can't wait to go back and try dessert. Our server Justin was excellent, friendly and efficient. The bartender even came and checked on us and suggested this awesome martini, can't remember the name but it's infused with pineapple. It was on the happy hour special for $7."}
{"text":"I almost gave this new restaurant 4 stars, but I'm choosing three based on hostess and her attitude and poor service. Anna Marie's just opened up close to where I live, and my family was so stoked to have a close Italian food restaurant. We first went (well, attempted to go) a couple weeks ago. My husband, teenage son and I walked in and turned to the host station and said to the man standing behind it that we were a party of three, to which he said, \"oh, I'm not the host, I'm just holding her place until she comes back.\" (?) She came very soon after and with a slight attitude said that it was full, but we could wait on a two person bench inches behind the host desk, where we would have been seated right at the level of someone's rear end. We declined and walked out the door. Fast forward to last night. It being a Wednesday, the hubs and I thought we would give it another try, hoping that it wouldn't be too busy at 6. We walked in, waited a few moments until the hostess came (same one) and asked us how many. There were a few tables available at the moment, one round 6 person, a booth for four, and a two person right at the entrance, I mean like 12 inches from the door, so every time a door opened, someone would literally be there eating along with you! Not to mention it would also be a hot draft from outside. She tried to seat us there! I took one look at her and said nope, we will take the booth. She then walked us there with attitude, waited for us to sit, threw the menus on the table and walked away while saying our server would be there soon. She seemed stressed to say the least.  We waited about 10 minutes until someone came to take our drinks order (their version of a cosmo called a Sofia Loren was AMAZING) We also ordered an appetizer, the hot antipasto plate (again, wonderful!). After about 20 more minutes those came and the waiter finally took our order. I ordered the fettuccine alla vodka, and he ordered the meat lovers pizza. Both were incredible when they finally arrived. The very best thing I ate was for dessert. ORDER THE LIMONCELLO CAKE! superb! Marvellous! Moist, creamy, lemony but not tangy and perfectly sweetened!  This place tastes amazing, but service sucks so far. Hopefully they will improve with time!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing we just take it off Yelp from seeing the stars and so glad we did we came in the environment is fantastic the food was delicious and the service was spot on definitely I recommend coming here everything and anything on the men years as good"}
{"text":"Good locals place - tried lots of items. Service and decor top marks Rolls/bread very good Marinara sauce a bit too acidic Meatballs not meaty enough Bread crumbs used in lots of dishes a bit on the dark side - personal preference but it got old fast. Will come back again but will avoid all items prepared with the bread crumbs - cold antipasto and shrimp scampi looked good and wood fired pizzas looked good."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed by this restaurant. First of all, it was 9 dollars for a plate of penne with tomato sauce. Nothing else. No salad, no bread, nothing. That seemed very high to get nothing with it. Same with the meatball sandwich. Nine dollars for just a sandwich. Nothing else. Then, they brought our children and my husband's food out, but not mine. Fifteen minutes later, my stromboli arrived. My kids were done eating, so we had to take mine to go because you wouldn't want my kids sitting there watching me eat. I wasn't offered anything for having my food take so long, not offered anything to eat while I sat there and waited. We were definitely soured on coming back again."}
{"text":"I ate there last night with my mother we really enjoyed it the service was great I had the muscles I definitely will be back and bring my friends and family this will be my new hangout"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Husband and I love Italian food, we wanted to come for happy hour but did not make it, so we ordered carryout. The deep dish pizza was the best I have had in a long time, and a great price! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Anna Marie's with 2 other couple's last night. Service was a little slow maybe the waitress was having an off night, she seemed a little nervous as though it was her first night. But other couple said she's been here for a while. Getting our food was slow but on top of that we wanted Belvedere vodka and they ran out of it. You would think somebody would run out and get a couple bottles until the regular delivery came. I ordered baked clams and lasagna.I was disappointed, some of the claims were under cook hard and rubbery. Also, I'm accustomed to my lasagna to be two to three layers high, this was one flat long piece! It tasted alright, the sauce was good but too rich. I suffered later. I hit the trifecta on this one, mediocre service, long time to get food and no Belvedere! The couple who invited us raved about this restaurant. I didn't have the heart to tell them how disappointed we were. I told him everything was good to spare their feelings. Won't be going back, and won't recommend."}
{"text":"Charming new restaurant on hualapai at tropicana. Sleek, clean and modern design. Classic Italian menu with salad, pizza, pasta and entrees. They have a full bar and take out available. My server Eddie was friendly and enthusiastic. Portions were generous and price was very reasonable. Perfect spot for date night or family dinner. Owners were there and stopped by the table to make sure everything was perfect. We tried the appetizer platter -the eggplant rolatini was delicious! Chicken Parmesan was on point and the red sauce was excellent! Hubby tried the white wine mussels and loved them. Can't wait to go back and try some more menu items. A welcome addition to  my spring valley/ summerlin neighborhood ! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Came in a few days ago to support our local business, and the ambient atmosphere was quite a nice surprise. We were seated and promptly ordered the lemon chicken and a pepperoni pizza. The chicken came with either salad or something else...I forgot what. Well apparently I should have paid more attention because my chicken came and while it was delicious it came all by it's lonesome.  The dish needed some veggies or something to keep its flavors. Maybe consider adding a veggie or some other starch to enhance the dish.  Our host/waiter was handling 2 other tables...which the restaurant only had 3 tables total at the time. She was asked twice to get a drink and finally some other waiter brought me my drink.  All in all I think I'll have to go back and see how the second visit goes. Food quality was good but there was something off about the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for eight people. When we got there the new hostess had filled all the tables and none were available for us.  She blamed it being busy and being new to the job. After a half hour they pushed a table against a booth for us.  We were told by her and the manager and server  that they \"would take care of us.\"  Their idea of taking care of us was to give us a bottle of we didn't even want.  When some of our party asked for a red wine they were assured it was not a problem as if it would be complimentary, then later billed for the wine. The food was fair at best. Service was slow and we were there 2 1/2 hours with only entree's. When members of our group later complained to the manager and said they would not be back they were told \"that's fine.\"  Learn from our experience."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good before I break into why I didn't give a full five stars.  The food was absolutely amazing. Hands down. I am always a little weary ordering Marsala being that every chef has  different idea of how it should taste, but it definitely was up there on my list of top favorites. So hats off to you chef.  However, I was very disappointed about the gaps in waiting for anything for that matter. Whether it was waiting for food to come out or the check. Still took a very large chunk of time. About 40 minutes to get the food, and about another 20 to get the check. It is one thing If I'm in the loop about being short staffed or whatever the case had been, but waiting almost an hour for my entree. By that point I was so disappointed and didn't even want to take my left overs home.  I'll stick to ordering to go from now on.   But might I suggest you guys offer bread to start for those who might be exceptionally hungry, especially if they have to wait so long for the main course.  Again though, hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"Actually this was my third visit to this place. Was not impressed with my broccoli with garlic and oil the first time since I like a lot of sauce, but my second visit I ordered the pepper and egg sandwich for lunch and was blown away! Perfect amount of pepper to egg ratio but the bun it was served on was the star. The crispy crust and the soft interior made it the best bun I have had in 16 years living here. Tonight I had baked clams which were terrific, the Cesar Salad was so good! Tried the ravioli and tasted the eggplant parm, to die for! This restaurant is the real deal folks! Loved our server Sierra or Ciara? Can't wait to try their wood fired pizza's next. Great place, beautiful decor, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is an amazing new gem here in town. First of all.. THE STAFF is so open and inviting full of the Italian familia energy. Second of all the interior esthetics is to die for... beautiful tone and geometric patterns gorgeously different. Third... THE FOOD!! I had the shrimp Parmesan which just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Thank you all for a adding a new addition to our #favoritedatespots."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience. The food was truly great and the service was top notch. I typically am a hard sell with environment and this place was great. I hope and pray that this place continues to grow and be blessed for blessing us with a great meal, service, and environment!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! Amazing food and a beautiful atmosphere! All the employees are super nice and know what they serve! Every question I had was answered and the description of my food was exact! He was not kidding when he said my dish was awesome! This is my new favorite spot close to home! Loved their garlic broccoli pasta and my husband ordered the Alfredo pasta, both amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding service, food and prices.  We were a party of six and we were astounded how great everything was.   The server patiently helped us open two old bottles of Cabernet and offered to decant it for us.  Pizza was great and pastas were excellent.  Will definitely return.  Perhaps the can team with Handels next door and offer their ice cream in-house."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful.  Location is a little bit of a secret.  Great lasagna, incredible wine and the service was exceptional!!  You need to try this place."}
{"text":"The decor is chic avant garde with hints of sportsbook. I dig it. The fried mozzarella was off the chain and the tiramisu which I use as a measuring stick for all Italian restaurant, was simply divine. Best I ever had. But zucchini sticks blow"}
{"text":"Disregard the bad review cause of slow service.  We didn't find that during our visit.  Only thing is when you enter- there are two doors the left one is one the restaurant side and the right one for the bar. There is no hostess table to check in.    The food we order were great.  The calamari was breaded nicely.  The pizza reminds me of the New York style pizza.  I've been looking for a great penne Alla vodka for awhile now- their version was spot on- added meatballs.    Highly recommend the place. The owners were very nice and greeted us on our table. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and will continue to go back to try other dishes on the menu. Everything we have ordered has been delicious. Starters - Arancini Rice Ball and Fried Smoked Mozzerella. Pizzas - meat lovers, Quattro Stagiono, and Grandma's Pie with meatball slices and cherry peppers - yum"}
{"text":"Ok locals! Love this place. If you can remember spots like Rosemary's on Sahara, or Ferraro's  on Flamingo or Grape Street on Lake Mead your going to love the neighborhood feel of this new gem. Their that good. Food amazing, bar on point, perfect date night. Perfection of wonderful ingredients takes longer than a microwave, come relax enjoy. Well worth it. Great value. Happy hour.  \"For get a bout it \""}
{"text":"Went in for lunch last week. The lunch menu is great. Priced well and will definitely full you up! The Garlic knots are amazing, fresh pizza, and the spaghetti with meatball was well worth the money. We will definitely be going back.  Love the contemporary decor, and they had 4 TV's over the bar for those looking to watch the game when you are having lunch!"}
{"text":"What happens when you take a takeout pizza place and give it a dining room and a bar? You have Anna Marie's.  The ambiance is reminiscent of an airport restaurant, with creepy Italian love songs in the background. Thanks to the magic of pandora, we were able to listen to two versions of the Andre Bocelli classic 'Por Ti Volare' back-to-back; that was a first for me.    Dining was equally confusing. With \"chicken fingers\" on the appetizer menu, I was ashamed that I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir prior to investigating their culinary offerings. We attempted to order the Arancini (stuffed rice balls) as an appetizer. It seemed like a no brainer at $5 an order. We were immediately informed that they had run out, so we proceeded to order the fried smoked mozzarella and a Caesar salad. Approximately 5 minutes later, we were then informed that there were more arancini made and asked if we would like an order. Of course we said yes, but we were told that we could not cancel any other food ordered. Fool me once Anna Marie, shame on you.   Our salad arrived, appearing as a typical pizza delivery salad. Although the fried anchovies were a nice touch, they were brutally betrayed by soggy croutons. The mozzarella was a winner, with the smoke not overpowering - at six per order they are a sizable choice. The arancini came out the size of a softball, sawed in half and covered in cheese. While we were attempting to balance the deluge of food, complimentary garlic knots were brought to the table. I was beginning to resent our server at this point, both for the arancini deception and for a lack of warning regarding the cruelty of portion sizes.   We also tried a pizza, pasta and an entree. The entree was a solid pick, and I'm assuming based on our order that they're all legit awesome. The Pasta was perfectly al dente, served properly after finishing in the sauce. The pizza crust had a nice chew, good flavor (especially for Las Vegas), and correctly portioned toppings. The sauce was a little lost, as was the defined cheese flavor. Overall, I feel it's a decent pick - but be careful that your eyes are not bigger than your stomach.  Anna Marie's is a new place, still going through some growing pains. They staff were generally pretty nice, the food was all decent. There is something really charming about new places, not only the ice cubes tasting like they came from a garden hose (in the best possible way), but more so the idea that this place could become a fixture in the neighborhood. I recommend to eat here sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food Happy Hour 3 to 6 everyday. Great garlic knots. Love the staff. Found a nice place"}
{"text":"Great new spot! Had the eggplant parmigiana and fried smoked mozzarella, both were awesome.  Tasted like home cooking.  Also, great wine."}
{"text":"It was okay.  If i lived closer I would probably be more of a regular and try things at the bar.  The calamari was just okay and the veal Parmesan was decent but slathered in too much cheese and sauce - like they were hiding it."}
{"text":"Excellent local gem. Great food and ambiance. Bart was an excellent bartender with a good knowledge of the menu. Doc and Lynn, owners, were extremely friendly and welcoming. A must try."}
{"text":"I really liked it here! The owners(?) were very kind and we ordered the starter arancini riceball, expecting one. There were two huge ones and so it was such a treat! We then got the thin crust pineapple pizza and it was really good but we got full from the rice balls alone and the free bread at the beginning which was actually one of the best things here as well! Me and my boyfriend fought for the last pieces. When we couldn't finish our pizza, our severer gladly gave us a pizza box to take it with us so our money wasn't wasted. We accidentally tipped $12 instead of $6 because he put $6 (which they took from his card) and I left $6 in cash on the table but it's okay. Maybe next time we come we'll just leave a smaller tip."}
{"text":"Really tasty food!  We are so happy to have a wonderful Italian Restaurant so close to our home.  The menu is extensive and priced right.  The wine list is nice.  Our service was impeccable.  They just opened and I only anticipate this restaurant will get to be quite popular very fast.  We shared a wood fired pizza and chicken parmigiana.  We truly enjoyed this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm really glad there is a local restaurant near us! The decor of the space  is very beautiful and clean.  There is a full bar and a very nice wine list. Affordable and realistic pricing. They have a well rounded food menu of traditional Italian dishes. We'll definitely be back! I only gave three stars because the server was rough around he edges. I'll assume that it is because it is a new restaurant and they are just getting on their feet. Excited to go back and try again!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm a huge calzone fan!! They stuffed it with cheese meatballs and cherry peppers for my spice!!  Chicken Parmesan with the alla vodka geez so good my friend also had the eggplant rollitini stuffed with ricotta cheese and pomadora sauce... if you wanna eat well fantasia Italian this family has it in order!!"}
{"text":"Used to go to their Bambinos location and loved the food. Was so sad when they moved on, but am so happy I found them again. If you want authentic, like off the boat, Italian, give them a try. This is my second visit in just over a week. I assure you, whatever you try will be delish. My favorite so far is a some penne pasta with sausage and marinara."}
{"text":"Anna Marie's is one of the few authentic Italian restaurants in Vegas. They use the freshest ingredients for their food. The modern design on the inside is very chic! The service is great as well! If you're looking for extremely fresh and delicious food, great service, and an overall amazing dining experience I would recommend trying Anna Marie's  The owners are the most kind, down to earth people who have a true talent for cooking delicious Italian cuisine.  They offer pastas, pizza, veal, chicken, eggplant, a full bar, homemade cheesecake, tiramisu, cannoli's.  They undoubtedly have the best pizza in town by the way. If you haven't already, try the grandma pizza (My favorite). They also offer wood-fired pizzas."}
{"text":"We ate at Anna Marie's on Christmas Eve.  The food was outstanding and the service was very friendly.  Unfortunately, the kitchen was backed up, and we were left waiting for over an hour and a half for our entrees.  With two small children, the wait became unbearable so we asked to cancel our order.  At first they seemed okay with canceling the order and understood that we needed to leave.  Then our food started to come out, and we again explained to them that we had to leave so they boxed it up.  The food was absolutely delicious, and we will certainly be back.  The kitchen, however, appears to need to work on getting orders out in a reasonable time.  An hour and a half for pasta dishes is simply unacceptable.  I'm hoping this was a one off, and I am looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon for a birthday lunch. Ordered the Neapolitan pizza, house salad & mussels. Justin was our waiter & he did a terrific job explaining the menu & was very attentive. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine & overall would recommend highly. We will return to try other items that looked great!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo good! They give complimentary bread and it was delicious. The service is so friendly and he answered all of our questions.   We ordered the fried mozzarella as appetizers and they were tasty and good portions. My bf ordered the lasagna and he devoured it. I didn't get to try any so I guess it was really good.  I had the rigatoni and that was also delicious unlike my bf I didn't finish my food as the portions are pretty big but that's a good thing. However later on my bf also killed the rest of my leftovers. So safe to say he's a big fan of this place. The ambience was really nice and it looks like it would be a great date night spot."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Have been looking for one for 2 years.  Food is good, service can be slow even when the restaurant isn't busy.  The only drawback is they don't take reservations.  Hasn't been a problem so far, but could be in the future.  Will keep going back."}
{"text":"I was hosting a party of 10 to celebrate my daughter's high school graduation.  This was the first visit for any of us.  My 12 year old son and I both ordered pizzas, while the rest of the group order various other items. After the food arrived for other people, my son and I were told our pizzas would be right out.  We were visited 4 more times, and told we'd have our food in \"just a minute or two\".  It took over 30 minutes after the others guests had their food before my sons pizza arrived.  The problem was...what the server was telling us was a lie.  She either never put our items in, or the kitchen missed them, in fact I watched the server and the chef arguing over rushing them. To be told several times the food would be right out, when it hadn't even been put in the oven, is unacceptable.  If an error was made, just tell me that and I'd completely understand.   Very poor service experience."}
{"text":"I like Anna Marie's ! It was a Thursday night the place was pretty full with only a couple tables open. We were sat right away in perfect view  of the TVs which had the football game on so that was a plus for me.   Our Server came by about 5/8 mins later which was fine again it was really busy and keep in mind we were sat immediately. He was really cool the service was 5 Stars and the food was delicious I finished every bite. I've been told from some people this place was just ok but maybe it was what I ordered. Which was the chicken Frances and the spaghetti marinara. I'll be back to try some other entrees. My mom ordered the shrimp scampi which was pretty tasty. I can see how ordering the right thing can be important as if I would have ordered the scampi it might have been to much for me as I would have only wanted 5 or 6 bites after getting tired of the dish even though it was good! I ordered a pizza for take out a couple nights before and it was damn good."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Great service, excellent prices, good portions and plenty of choice on the menu. Our new go to for dinner! Also, the cheesecake is as close to the real deal for NYC I've tasted here in 40 years!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the finest Italian food I have had the pleasure of eating since I've moved to Las Vegas. It's not very easy to find good food out here, but this place nailed it! They're vodka sauce or amazing. They're violas indescribably perfect. Even their garlic knots were very very good. The pizza looked delicious I will have to try it next time. You definitely get what you pay for in this place. The decor is some sort of modern. The lighting is interesting to put it politely haha. The staff was great. I think our server's name was DJ....good guy. This place has proudly earned a spot in my bookmarks."}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing. I enjoyed the grandmas pie. It was so delicious from the pepperoni to the sauce. I think this is my favorite pizza. Also not only is the food good but customer service is terrific. The people are so friendly and helpful. It takes alot of work to run a restaurant and it shows that the business is run with so much passion and heart."}
{"text":"If you have not tried Anna Marie's you are missing out!!! Don't let the outside fool you, this place is a gem in Las Vegas. The decor is not only stunning but the ambience is so inviting. The staff know you by name, and the bar is spectacular. EVERY dish is hand made from scratch, nothing frozen or canned here. I was blown away not only by the quality but the thought the chef puts even into his presentation of the food. It taste amazing and looks beautiful. Don't pass this place up!   I tried the Alfredo with prosciutto and peas, as well as the cannoli's. It was delicious !!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place..their staffs are so nice.. Justin is awesome!!! Yummy food!! Been 4x n we will definitely comeback!! The bartender is nice he even check back on us if we like the drink he made!!!"}
{"text":"Could be our new favorite local spot; must come back with the husband for the final review. Place is cute, staff friendly, food hot & delicious."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I ordered the seafood pasta. Overall, the food tasted good but it had too much calamari. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, great value - huge portions!  Terrific service and great atmosphere - comfy and relaxing.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This has got to be my new favorite Italian restaurant. I love the contemporary decor and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I went here for my grandpa's birthday and they treated us like royalty. Everyone was super sweet and attentive. I knew I would love this place when I heard the jazzy background music. The bread was delicious and so was the New York style neapolitan pizza. Drinks were refilled without asking and the food came fairly quickly. They have a vegan menu as well. We had cannolis for dessert, which were very good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Although we felt ripped off on the sausage my husband ordered to go with his spaghetti.  The side order lists 2 sausages, instead he got 9 slices of sausage tossed into his meat sauce for $5.  The aranacini was perfect & I loved the serving fish.  My chicken Marsala (second choice, since they were out of the chicken rollatini) was yummy!  I would have liked some bread to clean the amazing sauce off the plate. Our service was bad.  We were ignored, for the most part.  We were never offered Parmesan for our entrees, although I saw everyone around us getting freshly grated cheese on their meals, when I asked for Parmesan I got a cold shaker of grated cheese."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago right after it opened. Everything was pretty good and the pizza was solid. There are some kinks but it's new, I will give it another try and hopefully everything is worked out."}
{"text":"One of the Best Italian Restaurants in Las Vegas Hands down. Great service with real homemade food."}
{"text":"Decided to give a new place a try and they did not disappoint! The staff was wonderful especially our host. I will tell everyone I know to eat here. The menu said everything is made to order which caused a bit of a wait, but the food was well worth the wait! Incredible! Even the decor was lovely. Anna Marie has created a truly exceptional dining experience!"}
{"text":"Promptly greeted and sat at a table in front of the pizza oven. The lighting on our table was super bright since it was right next to that area, but I didn't bother to ask for a new table. The decor in the restaurant is contemporary and chic, but it's a little disconnected from what I think of when eating at an authentic Italian restaurant. Anyways, onto the important stuff....  Our server Justin was great- very friendly and just the right amount of attentiveness without being too overbearing. We ordered a bottle of pinot noir (the only bottle of that grape on the menu), and they were out. We were offered another bottle for the same price and it was great. We started off by ordering the hot antipasto platter. It was okay, but I think it sounded a bit better than it tasted. It consisted of eggplant rolatini (the best part), shrimp oreganato (tasty after squeezing some lemon over them), clams oreganato (the bread crumbs were overdone/burnt/dry- couldn't taste the clam at all), and zucchini fries (which were pretty bland but much better after we asked for some marinara sauce on the side). We also ordered the homemade meatballs and sausage sides. The sausage had great flavor (although seemed boiled; would've liked it to be fried I think), and the meatballs were so-so. The pomodoro sauce that they came in was really fresh and delicious.  My father-in-law ordered the veal parm with a side of spinach, and he loved both things. I ordered the chicken sorrentino which I think was the star of the dinner....absolutely fantastic. I chose the garden salad for my side which was simple, but great, and came with a light housemade (I think) Italian dressing.  We finished off the meal with the ricotta cheesecake which was awesome- light and fluffy just how I like it :) The \"Happy B-Day\" on the dessert plate looked like it was written by a 3 yr old which was pretty funny and made us laugh!  All in all, I would definitely say check this place out. We'll be back in the near future to try the pizza and other menu items."}
{"text":"Right by the house, the pizza was fantastic, we had a regular pep pie with a couple of apps. After going over the menu the grandma's pie looks great. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This is NOT a fine dining establishment yet their pricing is comparable to eating on the strip. Their cheapest red wine by the glass is $14 and a vodka and cranberry cost me $9. When they first opened their meals came with a dinner salad and now they are extra. What a disappointment. They also hired a new manager Samantha, who walks around very unpleasantly and is extremely rude. The place is not that big and we were standing in the bar area talking while waiting for our table and instead of saying, excuse me, Samantha just walked right in the middle of us and said nothing but had that facial expression that she was annoyed with us being in her way. Later, she came to our table without introducing herself and asked, \"Tell me about your dinner\". Am I supposed to explain what's in it? I will definitely stick with Nora's Cuisine. You can never go wrong with their food."}
{"text":"Went for a family dinner and left disappointed. The service was fine but the food was meh. The kids shared a pizza and it did come out hot and fresh, but there were large puddles of grease. I thought the pizza had tasty toppings but was undercooked and doughy. The stuffed shells were bland. The chicken parm seemed tough and almost like it was frozen. The egg plant parm was slimey/super mushy. The tiramisu and chocolate cake were tasty but seemed like prefrozen out of a box, as they were still a bit crunchy. Friendly service and we were seated quickly, no complaints about environment, staff, or cleanliness."}
{"text":"I have heard about this restaurant and wanted to go and I finally got there with my family. First let me say my husband is italian so he is picky!The restaurant looks very nice when you walk in and the staff is very friendly. The bread happens to be delicious. So that was a good start. We had the chicken parmigiana vodka, spaghetti with meatballs , eggplant and a pepperoni pizza and everything tasted Great! The pizza was thin and well done, but not too well done. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable. The only bad thing I can say is they should get another high chair or booster seat because it is kid friendly. I would Definately recommend this restaurant, they even offer take out."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it opened and I finally got a chance. I have to say that their pizza is highly suggested and their red sauce is so on point.  Ever since I went to vinnys in Long Island I've been comparing sauces and NOTHING in Las Vegas comes close. Although, after eating here I found my spot. After speaking with the waiter he tells me that the owners are from LI. Check this place out ... I'm sure you'll like it!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza hands down in vegas. There is nothing else to say. If u think u have a better place in vegas i will simply not believe it. Its unreal"}
{"text":"We were recently there on a Saturday night. It was busy but we were seated immediately. The decor is modern with some nice contemporary details, interesting lighting in gold tones, a mirrored accent wall, a textured accent wall, cool floor tiling, and beautiful ceramic tile work on the pizza oven. There are several high resolution large screen TVs as well and a FULL bar. Food was amazing! Bread was hot, buttery, and delicious! Food was so good with enormous portions. One of us had the \"small\" pizza that was HUGE and so good. The other had the ziti which was very flavorful and full of rich tomato sauce and gooey cheese. Highly recommended! Best part was the bill; $40 for both of us and we took 80 percent of the pizza home for dinner the next night!"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it!!! Everything was very fresh and tasted great!!! Quality of food and service was a 10! We had a fresh garden salad, calzone, pizza and pasta and we had no complaints. We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest the food is not good. If you like real Italian food you'll be very disappointed. The one thing that was ok was the rice balls, but they had hardly any meat in them. Service was fair at best."}
{"text":"My first time here I ordered the grandma pizza with sausage and I must say it was delicious I will go back and try something else the pizza had so much flavor"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to check out this place. We went on a Saturday night - walked right in and were seated. Our waiter (DJ) was extremely nice and attentive. Weren't a fan of the bread; all cold and hard pieces.  I kinda felt like they threw the leftovers in the basket. DJ recommended the Italian Style chicken wings and OMG they were delicious! If you order wings, skip the same ole hot wings or BBQ. These are the ones to get. I also ordered a small Caesar salad which was a little dry on dressing, so I asked for a small side. Tasted much better. As soon as we got our apps, they brought both our meals to the table. NO. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. We had them take our food back until we ate our apps without shoving them down our throats. My husband ordered the chicken parmigiana, which he loved. It came with a bowl of spaghetti as well. I ordered the Chef's Special, which consisted of two flattened chicken breasts,l sautéed in olive oil and garlic. Served with garlic spinach. Spinach was perfect. Sautéed in tons of frsh garlic. The chicken? Not so much. Very dry and no where near enough olive oil & garlic on the chicken or the plate. It definitely fell short of an A rating. My husband had the same kind of chicken, and his was perfect."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Italian food I loved when I lived in NY. Great beers on tap at the bar. Portions are massive and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to go to Anna Marie's for dinner and it was amazing! The seafood combo w linguine and marinara sauce is to die for. The bread and calamari was on point as well. Our waitress Marissa was very helpful and provided great customer service. All the employees were very friendly and wanted to make sure you were taken care of. Very clean and cozy! This little place packs a punch. Give it a try. Will be back soon for some pizza!"}
{"text":"Anna Marie's has fantastic, homemade food. I've talked with the chef and been impressed that he makes his own mozzarella, bread, sauce, and pizza dough, among many other delicious things. He uses the highest quality ingredients, and it shows. Don't miss the Caesar salad or salmon livornese!  The staff is welcoming and efficient. I am a happy regular!"}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. Seems more fit for upscale drinks after a day at the office or a quiet dinner for a couple. We took out 2yo and felt a little out of place. Servers were all very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I went to Anna Marie's when they first opened. My group and I enjoyed the food and ambiance very much. Just left there and was very disappointed because they have raised their prices. A glass of wine is $12 - which for an off strip restaurant and an ordinary glass of wine is too much. We decided to order a bottle which was $30. They did not have that bottle and tried to upsell us to a bottle for $50. Really? In all fairness they did offer us another bottle at the $30 cost. Also previously with the entrees you could have either a salad or pasta. Now only pasta. Additionally I ordered a small  house salad to go with my pizza which  was $6 for the smallest salad I have ever been served. Needless to say I will not be back and the others in my party agreed."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today.  This place is awesome! We were greeted by friendly staff as soon as we entered.  We were promptly seated and given the drink selection.  We ordered Calamari as an appetizer.  It was perfect and served in an attractive serving platter with slightly spicy marinara.  MMMM.  I had the calzone with spinach and garlic.  It was the best calzone I have had.  The spinach and garlic were perfectly done and the outside was crispy.  She ordered the Italian sub.  She was quiet the entire time she was eating which is a rarity .  All in all this was a top shelf dining experience and a place I will definitely be back to."}
{"text":"We just recently discovered this little gem and what a treat!  The entrees are delicious, home style Italian.  But, the real extra treat is their pizzas are great too!!  In this city, you go to one restaurant for Italian food and another for pizza.  It is so nice that you can go to one restaurant for both.  Make sure you make reservations as I am not the only one who loves this little restaurant."}
{"text":"I kept driving by this place coming home from work. Told myself a bunch of times to check it out and I finally did. Hip little spot. From the outside I was expecting a dim old school Italian restaurant but the vibe inside was much cooler. The design inside is very modern.   My waitress was great and helped me pick a great Italian red. I was unfamiliar with the choices but was very happy. I went with a classic and for the chicken parm. I was not disappointed. Thinking I need to make another stop and catch a game at the bar."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this new restaurant that's down the street from our home. Walked in at 9:10 PM and the manager walked over to us without greeting us and said, \"folks our kitchen is closed for the night.\" Why have a 10 PM close time on the door? What if we wanted to just get a drink at the bar? He didn't even ask. We won't be back again and won't be surprised if this place shits down within a year."}
{"text":"Sierra is an excellent server,great personality, makes you feel right at home. Pizza is one of the best I've ever had, my friend ordered the Chicken Rigatoni and it was excellent. However the Cheesecake we were not fond of, the management was gracious in exchanging our dessert to Tiramisu which was eaten to the last bite. Atmosphere is relaxed and old Vegas ambiance. Highly recommend coming in."}
{"text":"Anna Maries is a recent addition to the dining scene at the entrance to Summerlin. The restaurant has a family friendly atmosphere. Upon entering we received a warm welcome and directed to choose any table or booth. Background music is the old standards and at the perfect volume to make it conversation friendly. The decor is contemporary and the seating has booths along the walls and tables in the center of the room. The open concept allows views of the bar area as well as the pizza kitchen. Our server Kevin helped us navigate the menu. The menu choices are vast and the potions equally large. Service was friendly and efficient . Water glasses were refilled without asking and dishes removed promptly.   We arrived for an early dinner which happened to coincide with the start of happy hour. The happy hour menu has several choices for food and drinks. Being on the early side the dining room was not very busy but more people arrived while we dined.   We started with wine by the glass and an order of meatballs from the HH menu. The order consisted of two large meatballs in a bowl of marinara sauce. These were very tender and the rich tomato flavor worked well. The remaining sauce complemented the dinner rolls.   Our entrees came with a choice of pasta or a garden salad. Our large salads consisted of fresh greens, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, black and green olives and mushrooms with a choice of dressing. Our choice was Italian served on the side.   The entrees were Chicken Sorrentino, two large breasts topped with eggplant, prosciutto and mozzarella in a light brown sauce with onions. Just a melt in your mouth dish.   Chicken Francese, pieces of chicken breasts sautéed in white wine and lemon butter. The moist and tender chicken combined with the sauce was a perfect balance.     The  leftover chicken and salad was enough for a take home meal. The sauce is made to order. We requested some extra white wine and lemon butter sauce to take home. The chef was accommodating and made some for us.    We had the opportunity to talk to  Doc, one of the owners and Chef Raffaele and provided them with comments of our excellent dining experience.  Also Anna Marie's has a selection of pizza's for eat in or carry out. We will be ordering pizza to take home in the near term and returning for another dinner."}
{"text":"First time here, definitely will not be the last! The service was excellent and the food was even better. The vodka sauce was amazing, as was the ricotta cheesecake."}
{"text":"FRIST VISIT:  Dine -In The restaurant itself is nice & clean with modern decor The bar is right in the front as soon as you walk in the door. We waited to be seated than the Server pointed at a table & told us to seat ourselves. Server acted rushed & busy. But the restaurant was only half full. We ordered GARDEN SALAD (Very Good), HOT ANTIPASTO PLATTER (Fair), PENNE WITH BROCCOLI (Fair), Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini (Excellent) & TIRAMISU(Excellent).  We were ignored, for the most part. We were never offered Parmesan cheese even though I did see another table getting grated cheese. Since our Server who was nowhere to be found, we just eat our dinner without cheese.  SECOND VISIT: To Go Order Since the food was good and the service leave a lot to be desired. I thought I try To Go Order The person whom took my order over the phone was rude & acted like he was in a rush to get off the phone. I went to pick-up my order. Waited 5 minutes at the door and was never acknowledged by the three servers. Finally a nice older lady asked me what she can help me with. Told her I'm picking up an order To Go. She pointed to the left back corner of the restaurant.  Order pick-up is at the back where the kitchen is . There is a cash register & a tip jar back there. I order BAKED CLAMS & Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini. I got linguine instead of capellini. Even though some of the sauces was leaking through the bag. Both dishes still tasted excellent.    THIRD TRY: Delivery  I ordered online Capellini with Marinara Sauce, Chicken Rigatoni & Clams White Sauce Pasta with Capellini.  After about 30 minutes I called the restaurant to make sure they got the correct delivery address. The person that answer the phone was rude. He told me that they don't have anything to do with the Delivery service. And he did not know who picked-up the food to be deliver. I just hang up the phone. I just have had it with the terrible service at this restaurant.  With no help from the restaurant my order was Delivered on time. The food was excellent and well packed.  But I am not going to put up with the bad service and will not order from them again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I loved the meatballs! The luncheon specials are a great deal, lots of food!! Service was very good, they paid attention to use. Great atmosphere everything was new and beautiful.  The potty was great too, ULTRA MODERN Sanitary devices!"}
{"text":"This place was very good ! My daughters loved the spaghetti and the pizza was delicious ! Great atmosphere and very friendly staff . I will definitely come back ! Everything about this place is amazing ."}
{"text":"The best Italian cuisine I've had in Vegas. Away from the strip not to busy and the food was amazing with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Anna Marie's and I wasn't impressed at all. I got Chicken Alfredo pasta and my chicken was under cooked. It took my sever awhile to come over were the rest of my table was almost done with their food. The sever finally came over and said we will get you a new one and they just handed us the check after and that was it. Being a local I wasn't impressed nor looked to go back."}
{"text":"Had a lovely time here last night with my girlfriend. The inside interior is very cool and modern- a good retreat from the heat of Vegas. We ordered the mussels, Quattro Stagianno pizza, and the Alla Vodka Pasta with meatballs. Everything was very fresh and flavorful, but favorite was the alla vodka pasta!! It was so yummy we even forgot to take a picture of it. Recommend getting this for sure. We also got the house made cheesecake- really yummy and different. It's like if you mix a cannoli with a cheesecake.  Overall- authentic, great date spot, comfort food, and top notch service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Wood oven pizza is spectacular. We had several at our table and all were 5 star."}
{"text":"Terrible. They advertise wood fired  pizza but say it's only the 12\" . The 14\" I ordered was not wood fired, soggy and not flavorful. I asked about the chicken wings and was told that the hot was real hot and medium would be good. They were not good at all. I would never recommend this place and will never eat there again.  Disappointing bc it's close to my home"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3x and ordered different things..always comes out delicious. Dinner time gets pretty busy, but if you arrive before or by 6pm wait time for table isn't too bad. Service is great and the staff-very friendly."}
{"text":"We may have gone on a bad kitchen night. The wait was pretty long, but the food was worth the wait. I think we'll plan ahead of time next time to make certain we're not in any sort of a rush, just in case the wait is the \"norm\", but would have no problems going back given we had that time. The ambiance is great, the host was great, the waitress was great, the bartender was great. Can't say anything bad about the place, minus the extra long wait for food (which I am writing off as an anomaly). I'll update the review again if we end up experiencing another extraordinary long wait for food."}
{"text":"My family had dinner on Monday. The restaurant was pack with customers ordering their dinner. They have a nice selection of menu, pizza, pasta and meat dishes are offer to the customers. The decor was warm and inviting. The servers are acknowledging and attentive. The foods came out on a timely manner. My family definitely will go back again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"everything was delicious!!!! bread,  fettuccine Alfredo,  calamari, garlic bread & knots,  ravioli, chicken marsala!!! ambiance lovely!!! decor gorgeous!!! def going back again.... waitress was personable"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza! This place looks unassuming from the outside, but when you walk in, it's gorgeous Vegas, yet comfortable. The pizza is so delicious with a tender crust and bright marinara. We ordered the meatballs during happy hour and the meatballs are tender and tasty.  Great new Italian in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My son and I went for dinner tonight.  Everything was very good from the special watermelon martini to the garlic knots and our entrees!!  Service was a little slow due to how busy they were but not crazy slow.  Portions are very good especially for the price!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Charming, elegant dining experience. We were immediately greeted by the host and hostess. It was a very busy Sunday night and the waiters were very busy and appeared a little disorganized. The food was excellent and the staff was very accommodating of my 9 month old grand daughter. The tables are a little close together but the noise level was decent. We enjoyed our delicious appetizers, salads and entrees. The host and hostess stopped by our table to ensure we were enjoying our choices and were very gracious and thanked us for coming. We all look forward to our next dinner at Anna Marie's."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great pizza. Great garlic knots. Amazing cheesecake. Save room for all the courses :)  a little hidden off Tropicana, but it's just behind Handel's"}
{"text":"First time there.  I had a chicken parm  Stromboli!   Never saw that before.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Italian ever!!  Justin our server was super attentive to our excess Parmesan situation and fresh cracked pepper. Nora's was our go to until this place opened by our house. Our bartender was great too..Pinot noir was FAB!! SALUT!!!"}
{"text":"Great new place near Summerlin.  Food is excellent and service is good!  Food coming out of kitchen is a bit slow but probably because they have not been open long.  But staff and food makeup for that!  Worth waiting as Lasagna and Pizza are delicious.  Also Meatballs"}
{"text":"Upon walking into Anna Marie's for lunch today (this was our first time trying the restaurant out), it was confusion at first step. There is no hostess stand, so we walked in and stood in the bar area for about 3 minutes before we ask the bartender (mind you who saw us standing there but no greeting or acknowledgement of our arrival) who we should ask to help us. He waves us off and says a server will handle. Ummm... ok. So a lady grabs some menus (says NOTHING TO US) and starts for a table. We reluctantly follow, she drops the menus and leaves us to our own devices. Our server showed up promptly and stayed to answer our questions. Our server was nice and knowledgeable (Romanian). The non alcoholic drinks came in good time, but it took 10 minutes to get a beer. After sitting for just over ten minutes, I ask the same bartender who waved us off in the beginning and mind you had ZERO customers at his bar, walked by our table, to see if we can get some bread for the table. He's carrying a case of beer, and when asking this question, I didn't expect him to drop everything for us. Let me make that perfectly clear!  He rudely says yeah you can get your server to do that for you. In the 30 plus years my husband has been in the restaurant business, the ten years I was, I was completely put off by his attitude towards customers and complete negligence in understanding how the front of the house operates. I tell him maybe he can act like he's part of a team and tell me (nicely) he's going to drop his beer off at the bar and he will find someone to help us out. It's very simple and the basics in customer service!!! Especially if you are just opening a new restaurant in a neighborhood, not a great start. Immediately the manager Kevin shows, grabs the chair in front of me with both his hands (squeezing) and squares his shoulders (it's called posturing in the restaurant industry) and defends his bartender in saying he has beer in his hands. He asks what is going on, I explain that his team member was rude. He comes to his defense with a rude attitude and says he will get the bread. He walks away..... I ask him his name (bc I didn't see it on his name tag), he comes back, squares his shoulders again and gives me the stare down. Completely unnecessary and tried to intimidate me. At this point, my husband gets aggravated and I say let's go. Too many Italian restaurants in this town to be treated as we were. Not only by a front of the house person, but the manager. I don't have a review of the food, I'm sorry. It could be great, it could be like their service, I have no idea! But, from knowing how restaurants operate on and off the strip in this town, they need to get it together. The manager was especially unprofessional and I'm not sure this should be his place of work. Don't go in this restaurant with even Mediocre expectations for how you should be treated. Go down the road to salute at red rock or Ferraro's. Hell, go to Applebee's. These guys won't make it."}
{"text":"Update to owners response below: the picture attached shows the owners response after he initially sent me a message saying he would \"help us\" the next time we visit. My family and I visit this restaurant twice a week. We celebrate birthdays here, bring friends and family from out of town here and recommend the food to others. I am in shock the owner would send a follow up message telling me and my family to not return.if you read more of the reviews from others you can clearly see this restaurant has a problem with their service and not necessarily their food. Their reviews dating back to last year have been in a decline. It's unfortunate the owner won't take responsibility for his staff but rather tell a customer that spends a lot of money here to not come back to a \"neighborhood\" restaurant.  _______________________________________________________________________________"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Anna Marie's from a friend and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  It's a rather small place.  If you like wine, they appear to have a good selection!  I was seated at a four top.  I hated taking up the room of such a large table for a solo diner but it was not a problem as the flow during the time I was there made it OK.  Asking my server, Justin, several questions about appetizers, I learned they're all meant to be shared.  I really wanted the fried calamari but instead opted for the zucchini sticks.  I went brain dead.  I never thought of ordering a cup/small bowl of soup.  The zucchini sticks arrived and there were 10--5 on each side of the dish with marinara in the center for dipping.  The zucchini was very good, the marinara quite tasty, but just too much food.  I stopped after eating five and Justin packed the other 5 for takeout.  For the main course, I ordered chicken Sorrentino--Chicken breast topped with eggplant, prosciutto, and mozzarella, in a light brown sauce with onions.  With your meal, you get a choice of pasta, broccoli, spinach, and one other thing I can't remember.  I went with the pasta, choosing rigatoni with their red sauce.  I could have gotten it with the same sauce as the chicken but I wanted to taste their red sauce.  The chicken dish was excellent.  The brown sauce was so very rich I was somewhat wishing I'd gotten it on my rigatoni.  The red sauce on the rigatoni was good.  It is a LOT of food.  Still there was room for dessert.  After all, I had them box 5 zucchini sticks!  A special dessert yesterday was Nutella cheesecake with Oreo cookie crumb crust.  It was excellent!!  Service was exceptional.  The entire staff worked as a team.  I know they probably had assigned tables but any person walking by would remove a dirty plate.  My iced tea was refilled several times, and the ice brought in a glass in the beginning proved to be very useful!  One intangible thing about Anna Maria's.  Everyone seemed genuinely pleased to have you as a customer.  Every person I interacted with was pleasant, welcoming, and friendly.  Since Anna Maria's is only about two miles from my house, I'll be back!  Well deserved four stars!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and I love the decor! The staff was very friendly and the food was pretty good! The hubby ordered the ravioli and I had the chicken dish with eggplant and prosciutto. We also ordered the caprese to start with, which was very fresh. They give you garlic knots for the table which are also very good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update- I have gotten take out pizza twice. Delicious it was almost ready at the time I was told to pick it up so not too bad.   We returned to dine in again. We were the ONLY table in the restaurant. It still took forever! My son fell asleep at the table. No lie. Don't go if you need a timely experience. Still delicious though. However, my hubby did send his clams back because they were inedibly sandy. Bummer."}
{"text":"Being a holiday I called around 3. Asked if they were open. They said yes. Gentleman asked when I would be coming in. Said around 6 for 4 people. He said no problem and would see us then. I already knew they didn't take reservations but from conversation didn't think it was going to be that busy. Walked in at 6 and the place was packed. Was greeted by a wonderful host who apologized and said there was no room for us to be seated. Mentioned that I called and he said that many people said the same thing and a meeting with management is needed. UM yes!!!! Or they need to start taking reservations. Place was cute but small. Decided to do take out... but wait was very long. They obviously still have some work to do. Food was great. Staff was friendly. Kitchen time and organization still needs some work. Will try it again, but not right away."}
{"text":"Went to Ana Marie's for cocktails and appetizers, great atmosphere, food was delicious, and solid cocktails! Bart the bartender was very friendly! We had a great time, we will be back soon! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Got in amazingly at the last minute for Mother's Day. We had an absolutely wonderful meal. Super excited to have found this little neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Great decor but experience was definitely questionable.   Walked in and waited about 2 mins for acknowledgement. A blonde female said sit for a few mins and I'll clear a booth for you. She sat us and put menus down but kind of \"dropped us off\" and walked away immediately. She didn't say \"welcome\" or \"someone will be with you shortly\" she just walked away. Thought she'd walk right back but we didn't hear from her again.   Next man comes up with waters he asks \"how are you today?\" We said \"we're doing well, how are you?\" And he said \"Um, I'm okay, I'll be back\" walked away and never returned. It was odd.   Server came up and she was super friendly. We ordered drinks, she said she'd order bread service for us... she walked away and we got our drinks and never got bread service until we asked again after our dinner came.    Went to the bathroom and waited 5 mins but a woman finally came out and said the toilet was clogged. Used the men's restroom which I assume was the same as the female. Instead of just having toilet seat covers they have the plastic that rotates when you push a button.. it freaked me out. Not a fan.   Ordered 2 glasses of wine..  1 ASAP for my husband and 1 for me with dinner. Husbands wine came. Then they delivered me a pasta that was in a small bowl and said my husbands meal will be out soon. I waited for about 7 mins bc I didn't want to eat without him and nothing came. Finally someone came and took my small pasta and said this is the wrong order, they're sorry and they'll bring my pasta entree in a minute. So finally we got our 2 entrees together and I had to ask again for my wine and our bread.   The food was fine but I've had better and unfortunately we probably won't be back. I'd rather go to Maggianos. Probably age discrimination - we didn't look like we'd spend a lot but unfortunately we did. Our bad...."}
{"text":"The best Italian food made with the best ingredients ! If you're from NY and looking for a Italian restaurant comparable to back home then Anna Marie's is definitely the spot... make sure to order a gma pie"}
{"text":"My new favorite local Italian restaurant! First time and we will be back! The sauce is superb, garlic knots excellent- eggplant dish excellent!!! Everyone enjoyed there atmosphere and the staff were all so friendly!! See you next time! Local gem!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Great menu options and very good prices. Ordered the calamari, pasta e fagioli, capellini and spaghetti and meatballs. All were outstanding! And the garlic knots...addictive! Will definitely be back, very soon!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I read the reviews on Yelp and we just had to try it.  Everything is great- we had spaghetti and meatballs and a small pepperoni pizza. This place is a hidden gem and it has only been in existence for 8 months. Family owned and managed. The family works there too so everything was perfect. The restaurant has happy hour prices too, so if you have the time, go early for happy hour."}
{"text":"We ordered Grandmas pie and it was awesome. Buttery crunchy crust not to thick. The cheese was the good stretchy mozzarella and it was topped with fresh basil and fresh blobs of chunky tomato sauce. It wasn't greasy or too salty. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner this evening with my boyfriend and we shared the calamari appetizer, stuffed shells and finished with the cannoli (which are to die for). Great atmosphere and service. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic find. The service is friendly and helpful, the food is fresh and wonderful, the dining room is comfortable and clean. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and the food was very tasty and filling. The one thing that really stood out was the outstanding service received from Justin. Nothing like enjoying your NY style thin crust pizza and having your waiter provide his NY style service!! Justin was quite enthusiastic about the food and service and just all around wonderful."}
{"text":"Loved my food can't wait to go back!! Got the chicken picatta was so good even the spaghetti with red sauce was so yummy. Garlic bread is also the best!!"}
{"text":"As a pizza enthusiast, I always love visiting new restaurants to see if they can top my previous favorite pizza place. After visiting Anna Maria's, I think I finally found the winner! Pizza was excellently crafted - the sauce and crust, the two most important components of the pizza, was perfect. The cheese and basil complemented them well, and the bread I got with it was a great addition. My girlfriend let me finish her fettuccini Alfredo (she loved it but got too full), and it was thick, creamy, and delicious.  Phew. That was just the food. The service...oh my gosh. The people were so nice and concerned about our orders coming out perfectly, you would have thought we were VIPs. And this wasn't even a very expensive restaurant! Just $$ out of $$$$.  Lastly, the atmosphere was cool and fit the feel of nighttime Vegas very well. Really not surprised this place won best Italian Restaurant of Vegas. Will return!"}
{"text":"Nice and comfortable locals spot with great pizza and yummy garlic knots. Service is consistently good. Always a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Omg food and staff were so awesome. So much food we had to take home . Sammy was a awesome waitress and the bus boys had my daughter niece and mother amused the whole time.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We waited for 30 minutes to be seated. The appetizer was served 1h after we placed our order. Not even bread was offered while we were patiently waiting for our order. When the food came out, the mussels in white wine was so salty but the mussels quality was good. The Grandmas pie was decent overall but we ended up bringing home half of it and the rest of our orders to go since waiting in a restaurant for 2.5 h for food just isn't worth it! Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I love when there's a new restaurant to try out and it's not a chain.. if you like authentic Italian food, you'll like this. It's kind of in a weird location - the side of a mini strip mall.. parking can be limited, but shouldn't be a huge deal. I've been here twice and have had the eggplant the first time then the lasagna. Both were most delish! We've ordered the riceball during happy hour..it was gigantic and only $5..so good and filling. I couldn't even eat half of my meal after that..lol! Be sure to ask for fresh bread, don't miss out on that! Both visits I have sat at the bar for dinner and received great service. As most like restaurants, the cocktails are pretty pricy. I wish places would offer more drink specials. At my last visit, a couple sitting next to us raved about their pizza....I may have to try that out next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered a take out Caesar salad with grilled shrimp. A little pricey for what you get. (3 shrimp) But, the shrimps were very large and cooked to perfection. The ceasar dressing is heavy with garlic, which is fine with me. I love garlic. Would be nice if they would throw in a few pieces of bread. Some of the food being brought out to other customers as I waited looked delicious, will be back to try some other dishes. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of things about this place. So I just had to try it.   Our server never introduced himself to us, we didn't get his name. Not quite sure if it's the servers fault or the kitchen but we got our first appetizer around 8mins, which was good since they were filling up when we sat. But the other two appetizer took almost another 15mins till they came out. The cold anti-pasto was okay but I would have liked it if the server would have explained what all the different meats and cheeses were especially since it was our first time here. We had also ordered the hot anti-pasto,  the shrimp were really good. The next appetizer was mussels in red sauce. Honestly the marinara tasted burnt and we ended up not eating the dish.   Soon after we got the rest of our appetizers, the pizza we had ordered to go with our entreés arrived. We had to flag a busser down to get us some bigger plates to eat the pizza. About another 10 minutes goes by and another one of our entreés come out, it was the lasagna, it was okay. You could still taste the burnt sauce flavor of the marinara but not nearly as bad as the mussels. By now I think the kitchen finally has their timing down because the seafood combo came out shortly after that. The presentation could have been a little bit better than something just dumped into a bowl. The seafood was good, again the shrimp were awesome.  Just a couple things to note: My friend who came with me has been a bartender for many years, he had ordered one of the signature drink. He later tells me that the bartender ended up using the wrong liquor than what was described on the menu.   Overall the food was a let down and service lack, I understand they've been only open for 5 weeks and they probably working out all the kinks. I'll try this place again in a couple months, hopefully they'll have everything worked by then."}
{"text":"Great example of great food with top notch customer service. By far one of the best pizza spots in Summerlin or Las Vegas for that matter. I highly recommend going for any occasion. I look forward to trying the other menu items."}
{"text":"We ordered mussels which were good with the gravy that they served. We ordered baked clams and they were little neck clams so the breading overpowered the clam.  Took 35 minutes to get the appetizers. Then I ordered ravioli which came half hour later and the sauce was like a jar sauce of Ragu. My friend had chicken français and she said the sauce was like Jelly. The service sucked too. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Well I could not wait to return home and write a review. Coming from an Italian family right off the boat it's hard to go to an Italian restaurant because it's just not like home ! WoW this place is pretty darn close.......all around yummy ! Having been transplanted from back East to Vegas for work I have been in search of some good Italian. After trying several places I must say.... here it is !     First off it was really nice to walk in and find some nice décor and not the usual red and white table cloths and cheesy pizza parlor look. There are two happy hours.....3-5 and a later one. The nice thing about the happy hour is that it's the entire place .....no need to sit at the bar only. The items for happy hour were of good size and selection. We tried several and all were good as well as the price. We were full from happy hour alone but didn't want to stop so we ordered the baked ziti and shared it, and again very good.    About the pizza.......if your looking for the usual junked up pie look elsewhere....but ....if you know a NYC pie.....here you go !!!!!! The crust was right on as well as the overall taste. The sauce, both on the pizza as well as the pasta was very good.....perhaps the best I've tasted here in Vegas ! All in all we had .....baked clams....calamari....margherita pizza....arancini ...baked ziti. For desert we split the cheesecake and a cannoli......Bravo to a perfect ending as far as the food goes......    The one very nice positive here is the wait staff, all were fantastic and the owners were over the top wonderful. I will say that I think the key here is to go early...we went at 4 to work happy hour into our dinner.....this was perfect to enjoy our meal at a nice pace.    All in my party are looking forward to our next visit !!!!!!! Thank you for opening !!!"}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood Italian eaterie with a super hip decor, and a laid back and service-oriented vibe. Come here dressed up or dressed down, and you'll for right in. The staff is superb and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"If this was based on the service, I would give them 5 stars! Very, very friendly and charming people and the only reason this is not a 1 star review.. Unfortunately my date and I agreed that we have had better Italian food from the frozen aisle at the grocery store.. Very bland and without that fresh kick that sets good food off.. We couldn't help but overhear others complaints as well.. Sorry guys, I know you're trying."}
{"text":"When there for the first time with my family & everything from the wings, bread & pizza were remarkable ! Absolutely amazing in every single way ! Hands down best Italian I've had on this side of town !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Th service was just ok. Justin S left our appetizer dishes for long past the time we finished while talking with bar staff   The sauce on my rigatoni was so overpowering you couldn't taste the pasta. I ordered a sausage for $5.00 but it was all sliced. Not what I expected.  My husbands lasagne was too chewey. 2nd time here. Not too sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I can't say I agree with the stars the place has gotten, but if I am wrong, please stay away from the calamari. It is the worst fried calamari I've ever tasted. And I've eaten many of them over the years. The batter was awful, thick and clumpy. I ordered the house lasagna, and the wings too... sad  to say I just took them all straight to the trash can."}
{"text":"Really great music and atmosphere. The layout makes it both cozy and modern. The food is delicious, and the staff is exceptionally friendly and competent."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try Anna Marie's last night. We loved the fact that you could taste the quality and care they put into each of their dishes. Justin, our server, was informative and friendly. We will definitely be back to try more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"New restaurant on the west side of town. Tasty food, but service is going though growing pains. Hope they get to stay."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Great menu, amazing food, very attentive personal service.   Great prices  and very crisp clean decor    Well done. My new favorite Italian Restaurant in the South Summerlin Area. Probably vegas."}
{"text":"What is there to say about this place other than, have you tried the grandma pie? Pizza is to die for. Chicken parm is bigger than you can finish and so tender you can cut it with a fork. I always look forward to going to Anna Maries, and you will, too!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a relaxed and enjoyable evening do not go to Anna Marie's. After a long week of hard work I was looking forward to a nice relaxing evening with friends and a great meal. Well, I had a great meal and definitely great friends and family but the the relaxing part was short lived. I was very disappointed that I was not even done with my meal when they were bringing to go boxes for my son and husband and they were asking my friend if he wanted dessert. Are you kidding me? Also, my friend was still eating his meal when his tray was being taken away. The food was good, atmosphere was great, but very rude, no manners. Note to owners: DON'T RUSH YOUR GUESTS, let them enjoy their meal!"}
{"text":"Took the family to Anna Marie's for NYE. This was our send time dinning there. We had to go back for NYE after we tried the rigatoni with meat sauce and meatballs. The meal was fantastic. On NYE, my daughter and I ordered the Chicken Parmesan. It was great and can't wait to go back and order again. My wife had the Eggplant Park and loved it. The portions are very generous, prices very reasonable and the staff is great. This is our new favorite Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered to go for the first time. Was surprised by the decor inside as it's really nice. The staff was great answering my questions too. When I got home, food was delicious. The grandma pie, amazing. Stuffed shells, awesome. We also had a salad which was fresh and crisp. Overall a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Everyone is friendly, great service, AMAZING food, perfect music, and a great host! So warm and welcoming! I will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. We've seen this restaurant new to the neighborhood. So we finally stopped in. Surprised by the modern elegant atmosphere. We were greeted and spoke to by the beautiful owner. That was nice. Justin was our server and he was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the meat lovers pizza and lasagna. WOW! doesn't even describe it. Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh. The Sicilian crust on the pizza was thick yet crispy. And the lasagna was to die for. And lastly, the ricotta cheesecake. Made fresh everyday. Perfection! Yes, we will be back. Great place for family but hip enough to enjoy with friends for cocktails."}
{"text":"I had the angel hair and tomato basil dish and it was amazing! Beautifully prepared. It tasted very fresh and authentic. The atmosphere of the place is unique, elegant, intimate, and casual all at once. Service is friendly. The bar seems like a nice place to have a drink and watch some sports. In short, it seems like a nice place for a date, family dinner, or even a happy hour drink after work. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We came about a week after the opening so expected there to be some kinks. The restaurant was full from the moment we arrived to the time we left. Clearly there is a demand for a nice sit-down option in this area of town. We ordered appetizers and pizzas. The appetizers were very slow to arrive and came separately with a lot of time between for something so simple...fried mozzarella and garlic knots. While they were delicious after they did arrive, the timing was just so off. We expected the pizza to come after the apps, however we waited and waited what seemed like forever. There were other tables that arrived, ordered and ate their dinner in the time we were waiting for our pizzas. We seemed to be the only table with this issue though, as other patrons appeared to get their food in a much more timely manner. We aren't sure whether it was a waiter issue or kitchen issue but no one seemed to acknowledge our extremely long wait. When the pizza did finally arrive, it was fresh and delicious and we did enjoy it. We won't hurry back as we'll let them work the kinks out but hopefully in a couple months time this will be a great option in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"We ate here last night. The atmosphere and decor are amazing. As for the food....DELICIOUS! Some of the best home made Italian cooking I have ever eaten. I will most certainly return. Also don't forget to try the home made cheesecake. I can't rave about the food quality enough!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7, so we were able to sample and share many dishes. We decided to start with pizza as an appetizer - great choice. It was crisp and delicious. Definitely fresh cheese and the perfectly seasoned sauce. Although you'll be tempted to fill up on the fresh bread and garlic knots, leave room for the main course. We ordered spaghetti with meat sauce, meatballs, eggplant rollitini, chicken caprese, chicken rigatoni and veal Marsala. You have a choice of salad or pasta as a side dish. My salad was amazing. Fresh mushrooms, cucumbers, olives and fresh greens. Conversation definitely slowed when the main course arrived. We were too busy eating to talk. We had no complaints at all. We saved a little room for dessert so that we could try the cannoli, cheesecake and tiramisu. They bake everything on premises, so each dessert was fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is legit. NY Style. Best that I've found in the Southwest. Cocktails are delish as well! Great bar and TVs! Football season will be awesome here."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious and authentic! Bread is fresh and homemade! Wood fired pizza was fantastic! Happy hour specialties are reasonably priced. The caramel martini was out of this world. Beautifully decorated in a very modern style! The atmosphere is sophisticated and elegant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a pizza and the chicken parmigiana  both were delicious we are definitely going to come me back and try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place started out as an Italian Pizzeria Restaurant, and the food better than average, and prices also.Success seems to have gone to their heads. They no longer offer a salad with many of their dishes, it is now extra, and, what a measly salad it is.Wine is 12.00 a glass, and, this is not a 12.00 establishment. The wine is mediocre for that price. And the food, the lasagna is just ok, and topped ,not by mozzarella, but, lousy pizza cheese. You need to decide  what kind  of establishment you are, and, price accordingly."}
{"text":"We were here before, and both times the service was horrible. But this time it was noteworthy. Each time we had a group of 7 to 8 people. It was an hour after ordering our entrée and still no food. We asked the server 3 times and she said that it was on the way. The final time she said 10 more minutes. Couples that arrived after us were served. We told her that we were leaving; which we did, and  Never to return."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with some close friends and they accommodated our party of 15 very nicely!   What made me excited to try this place out was their vegan menu! It has a variety of dishes which was great for both me and my non-vegan friends could enjoy. I easily made the reservation over the phone and they were even nice enough to let me bring my own cake for my guests.   The ambiance is very nice - it has a modern and upscale vibe with dark interior that makes it perfect for a romantic date night or dinner with friends but also casual enough for a family dinner.   They sat us at the high tops which fit us all perfectly and was right next to the bar. Our server was super friendly (I think her name was Hannah?) and really made sure the dinner went smoothly. It did take a while for our food to come out (felt like almost an hour) but that's understandable with the amount in our party.   My bf & I ordered the spinach with marinara and penne with primavera which were both just okay (3/5). We had to ask to add marinara to the penne for it was seriously just vegetables and pasta without any flavor. This made it a bit better but we weren't very satisfied. On the other hand, my friends really enjoyed their meals which ranged from the lasagna, rigatoni, fettuccine, and pizzas. They were also able to split our checks with no issue!  They also have a wide range of cocktails and wines that can pair nicely with your entrees. Happy Hour is everyday from 3-5pm and 9pm-close.   Definitely a nice new addition to the area and I'll definitely give the other vegan dishes a try next time."}
{"text":"If you like Pizza Hut, you will love this place,  If you know real Italian food, stay away. We had their chicken special, chicken with broccoli.  The chicken was sliced amazingly thin, was dried out or frozen, and had the texture of shoe leather.  We had the eggplant parmigiana.  Small piece of eggplant with a piece of cheese on a plate covered in red sauce.  The eggplant and cheese were tasteless and the sauce was runny and salty.  We had linguini with red sauce.  The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was indeterminate.  Lastly, we had a side order of broccoli with garlic.  The broccolis was burnt and swimming in oil.  Service was good or else the restaurant deserve on stars. Ugh! The funny thing is that the owner's other restaurant, Bambino's on Durango, a small local restaurant, has good food."}
{"text":"We have gone here twice now the food is reasonable not the best I have ever had but also not the worst. The biggest complaint is that I had to ask for bread then he brought the bread but what about oil and vinegar or butter again after asking he brought it. Once he brought our meals never did he come around to see if we were satisfied. The food is a little pricey for what it is I would rather go to maggions for about the same price or a little more. Overall not the best experience. I will try them again after they have been open a while."}
{"text":"The service was great! Friendly and quick! The food was amazing.  We had linguini Alfredo with prosciutto and peas. It was delicious with it being so creamy! We also had the lasagna and it was delectable! The sauce was perfect! Lastly, we had a pizza and again the sauce was perfection! We'll definitely be back soon! Also, the environment was perfect, not too loud nor too quiet."}
{"text":"Our new \"go to\" for pizza and all dishes Italian.  The family is amazing and always take amazing care."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner tonight at Anna Marie's and I'd just like to say I'm very impressed. We pulled up to the restaurant and didn't know if it was open or not by its so dark, we checked and I'm glad we did. It was so beautiful as you walked in , the color scheme was exquisite. Now for the most important part The Food! I ordered the meat lasagna which was good not to extremely special but good. My husband ordered the chicken masala, now that was  you could taste the wine in it which is always good. My kids ordered pizzas which I must say were up there with some of the best I've had in Vegas no joke! The pasta Fagiol was very tasty aside from the beans being undercooked. Service was great   is definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"We went today for lunch, our first time here.  Ordered the Grandma pizza for the two of us.  Oh my!  Delicious.  Perfect crust, perfect flavor, just perfect.  So glad we have a great Italian restaurant so close by.  This is going to be our go-to favorite, I can already tell.  Very pleasant atmosphere, very friendly service, very nice lunch.  :)"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food.  Great ambience  and excellent service can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter, Ed was excellent! The food was delicious! I had the mussels over spaghetti (added shrimp) my husband had the chicken rigatoni (added sausage) my two youngest had 10 inch pepperoni pizzas and my oldest son had the house made ravioli (added sausage). Everything was great! Ambiance, decor everything!"}
{"text":"Not a normal reviewer but super disappointing. Got take out and took forever and the food was weird. Odd marinara sauce for sure. I'll give them another chance on the pizza sometime and see if it goes better"}
{"text":"I ordered a standard pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the dinner salad. Pizza was delicious. Great tasting crust. The salad was very nice with lots of assorted greens and 2 different variety of olives. I would definitely eat here or order pick up again. The restaurant is small but the decor is cool....kinda dark but very updated and some old school, cool music (Nat King Cole when I was picking up my order) I would describe it as modern Godfather. Great that they have a full bar. Happy to have this place so close to my neighborhood ."}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood Italian family restaurant in the shopping strip with Smiths facing Hualapai at Tropicana.   The owners greet you at the door.  The other owner is the chef.     The chicken parmigiana was very tasty and with a large portion.  The meatballs are homemade and also delicious.  They have a full service bar as well  For pizzas, they have both a wood fired oven and a regular pizza oven.  They also offer calzones and Stromboli.   The couple Dining next to us split a Hawaiian pizza and loved it.   They also offer takeout   Everything is prepared fresh so expect to wait a little bit.   Everyone is friendly and they bring you fresh bread while you wait.  Definitely worth the wait, but don't expect a  quick turnaround if you are on a tight schedule  The owner decorated the interior and it is really nice.   You can dress up or go casual  Best of luck!   I know we will be regular customers"}
{"text":"I went to Anna Marie's for dinner with some close friends tonight. I'll start with commenting on the atmosphere, which was lovely. It was not your typical white tablecloth Italian with old pictures on the walls. The small space was coated in dark colors and very modern, which was a nice change. The garlic knot bread was delicious. It was buttery and robust. I had pepperoni pizza and a garden salad and was very pleased with both. The pizza had just enough cheese and that delicious crispy crust. The staff was kind enough to give us cannellonis for dessert on the house! It was a fabulous place and I will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tremendous food and service! Dining here is a must. I especially liked the Grandma's Pizza and the Veal Park. But really everything on their menu is a hit. I will definitely be coming back soon"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this incredible restaurant by one of the owners, Noel. After chatting with him I knew I had to try it! I took my dad for his birthday dinner, we were both extremely impressed. If you are looking for authentic Italian food in Las Vegas, this is a MUST try! It's a very casual but modern dine in with carryout available! The staff was so friendly, food delicious and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing! THANK YOU NOEL!!! And thank you Anna Marie's staff for a great evening out!!! Hands down, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd review. My girlfriend did a positive one a few months ago after our first visit and I did a negative one that was deleted from the site. Probably, because of the comments about the old blonde female bartender. Well, we went back again, twice in fact. Here's the good stuff......The red sauce is really good, the pizzas have all been excellent, the restaurant itself is nice except it always looks like its closed and the bar stools are the worst in town. It's also very bright and the music is never loud enough, it's always at that annoying level where you know there is music on , but, can't really make out the words. On one visit the server was awesome, Justin, the other time the server looked pissed off the whole night. We were told there is no manager that works on the floor....HUH? Also, it seemed like there was a bunch of pissed off people at front door bitching about a reservation. I was told they don't take reservations.......  On the negative side, they are always out of several menu items, it's ridiculous. They didn't have beers and wines on list and were out of a few food items. The baked clams were tiny dry things with a good sauce on the plate. We also noticed that the bartender, Bart or Bart the bartender is no longer there. Too bad, he was great, the main reason we came in. I won't make any comments about the female bartenders for fear of deletion again. The desserts all tasted like frozen crap. When I asked Mr. Happy, the server, about the desserts, he mumbled and stumbled about something that made us think we were correct about the desserts.   Anyways, order pizza and red sauce to go, you won't be disappointed. Do it quick, they won't be around long."}
{"text":"Went here on a friends suggestion. His words were if you dont like the food I will pay for your check. Well that never happened because we LOVED the food! My husband and I have been several times and each time the food, the staff, the drinks all PERFECT!  Food is made to order nothing is frozen. And I must mention the pizza, coming from this born and raised New Yorker I can say the pies here are close to home!! Best pizza in las vegas hands down!  A tip: get the white pizza it is da bomb!  Also the staff are welcoming and knowledgable, everytime I walk in I feel at home.  I also have to give an honorable mention to the deserts, the tiramisu is INCREDIBLE!  this place is a must vist for any new york transplant looking for some great italian eats that are just like home!"}
{"text":"Justin was amazing. Happy Hour was generous. Food was very tasty. Baked ziti, pizza, and meatballs were great! Nice local gem. Would come here again and I live in Henderson.  Will have to try some entrees next time and order a bottle of tignanello."}
{"text":"This is a good place that opened up if you live on the southwest part of town. We came here on a Saturday which luckily it was also happy hour (3-5pm every day).  We started with the happy hour meatballs which were good $5 for 2 meatballs (4/5) rating. Their house wine is $7 which is decent. As an entree we had the chicken sorrentino, which is covered with zucchini,prosciutto and a brown sauce I would rate 4/5. It is very tasty but also very rich. Half of it was good for left overs.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich was good but nothing about it stood out. As for the bread basket, very soft and warm which they serve with butter.  I will definitely be returning here again for happy hour and to try their pizza which looked delicious."}
{"text":"Anna Marie was so welcoming and sweet. The entire staff was great and engaging. The cold antipasto plate - perfection. It was beautifully presented. I would definitely recommend the house dressing. I ordered the chicken Marsala and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Parmesan. Both were delicious. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Nice local Italian place with great staff and friendly service. The food was good but the chicken Marsala taste like it had too much wine in it. The chefs chicken, Caesar salads were excellent. Would recommend this spot."}
{"text":"First time trying Anna Marie's and i enjoyed the bread they bring out. There's seating and a bar area. The place is a mix feel between elegant and casual. The server and staff were very tentative and made sure to keep checking on the table. Could have had 1 or 2 less check ups but they were all very nice guys.   I went with the Chicken Parmesan and my mom got the Penne with vodka sauce. The vodka sauce was AMAZING. But the chicken Parm was a-little tough to eat. I'm sure it was just the piece we had but it was hard to cut into and some pieces were chewy.  Next time I probably would just go with the vodka sauce or a different dish."}
{"text":"I was really hoping the food would be great here.  Unfortunately, since they opened, the quality has declined.   I had to return a salad this evening because it tasted like it had been sitting out for a few hours.  The chicken parm tastes like they used chicken that was fried a few days ago--spongy and weird.  It was certainly not cooked to order.  As far as I'm concerned the pizza is the only thing worth ordering."}
{"text":"Very Good Service! Very Good Food! Very good decent prices! Very classy ambience and decor! Very accessible and great for groups! Now this is 5 stars in my book definitely! Everything we order was delicious! From the garlic knots, to the garlic cheesy bread, pizza, pasta.... my fave was the spaghetti carbonara with prosciutto and my least fave was the spaghetti with meatballs in like the vodka sauce- that was the only thing that wasn't to my palate... The chef is authentic Italian, and I can tell that they take great pride in preparing their food and use only quality ingredients this place is locally owned and I love the friendly and welcoming atmosphere! I will definitely come back and highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great service. Am on their WiFi so hope my review isn't filtered out. Came as my son wanted pizza and we are literally living in hell right now with our dogs at our pet sitter, us in a hotel and insurance-well there as always (insert sarcasm).  So we found this place and surprisingly for family friendly it is very good Italian food (even 0 Carb 0 Sugar me found enough to eat).   Btw DJ was an outstanding waiter and all the staff were extremely attentive."}
