{"text":"Food was great, service was quick and friendly. Lots of options on the menu and prices are reasonable. Best Mexican food we've had in a long time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Love it!! The chicken enchiladas with grilled chicken are amazing!! And the waitresses are super friendly and genuinely nice people. It has a cozy atmosphere with great lighting. My new favorite Mexican place for sure. I've been 3 times already since it opened"}
{"text":"Lots of choices and staff was fine. the problem is the food is bland. There is no flavor, the salsa was watery. I asked for Pico and charged $4 for an over salted easy to make at home salsa. I only wanted it in hopes to make the watery salsa i received to be better. 

I felt like all three dishes the family received were over salted and lacked any flavor, as if they received the food from restaurant depot and reheated everything. 

I could be too critical because I have had Mexican food from Texas to California and i would rather eat at Taco Bell then waste my money here. 
The 2 star rating is for the staff. No stars for the food."}
{"text":"Five Star Mexican Restaurant in Indian Land!  The food is exactly like i remember in Mexico. Gorditas are a must in the menu!  One thing we need is Margaritas!!  Owner is very nice and he makes sure that everybody is being taken care!"}
{"text":"The menu is VERY extensive and exciting.
A lot of staff for good service.
Good lunch crowd
Fajitas were outstanding.
Prices a little on the high side for the atmosphere which is authentic Mexican or sparse.
Staff appears to be all Mexican, which presented problems communicating.  Dishes were not always as ordered.  We were overcharged and could not communicate to staff.
I asked if the owner was there, waiter said yes, I asked to see him,I am still waiting."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and go at least once every week or so. My favorite thing so far is definitely the Tacos Al Pastor. Spiced Pork with Pineapple. YUM. and the price is great too. My son loves the rice and grilled chicken, so that's another win. The salsa is good also, and the chips are made on site if I am remembering correctly.

The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is that it can take some time to get your food. This is, of course, painful with younger children."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times the food was outstanding. Drive past all the others and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Gross,  filthy.  Can't believe I was eating the salsa and chips and a long swirly hair was hanging off of my chip. I showed the waitress and told her. I'm going leave. She understood.  Didn't want anything else from there. I left a couple bucks for the server and we spilt."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my parents for dinner, and like other reviews, was confronted with a vast menu. We decided to eat on the cheap so ordered ala carte. At $2 each we tried the al pastor, carnitas and skirt steak on corn tacos, enchiladas and gorditas. So good! And a side of rice and refried beans (worthy of no further mention).
Service was OK, you have to be more proactive with requesting your check. But maybe that was because we were there at the height of dinner rush hour.
We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"First review...just had dinner there Saturday night with my wife.  Something good is happening with the former Freebird restaurant location. Right off the bat, the interior has lost much of the former owner's cave-like atmosphere.  A bar has been added and the table arrangement is closer which makes you feel a bit more cozy than the spread out former arrangement.

We were amazed at the menu.  It is LOADED with options, mostly around the more commonly found Mexican courses, like burritos, tacos, chalupas.  The emphasis is on chicken cooked and served in a variety of ways.  Pork and beef are there, but you have to search for them.

Service was what one would expect from a start-up, so let it be said that they are trying and over time it will be smooth and orderly.

Beverages are limited to beer and wine and soft drinks.  They are awaiting approval of their liquor license, so margaritas are on the way.

The food is, in our opinion pretty blah.  If you are from the mid-west or upper east coast and pronounce taco as \"take-oh\" you will be just fine.

The basket of corn chips is presented along with a red and a green salsa.  The red is very mild but has far more flavor than the red sauce poured over your entree.  More on that later.  The green salsa will light you up.  It is deceivingly hot, but manageable.  A surprise as it is a thin salsa with bits of garlic and onion in it.  Is good to flavor your entree.

As to the food, wife and I ordered different combos so as to cover a number of items.  She had a taco, chili rellano and chalupa.  I had a burrito, chili rellano and enchilada.  Not much flavor at all.  The taco was what you could make at home, nothing special.  The chili rellanos were good as they were not breaded and fried, but the small poblano peppers stuffed with cheese were either lightly fried or baked.  The rellanos were the best of our selection.

The chalupa came in second place as it was lettuce, cheese and fresh avocado.  Yes, it was fresh avocado with little bits, onion and garlic in it.  It was not the pureed stuff some restaurants serve, but the real thing.

The burrito was ground hamburger, same with the enchilada.  I had asked for pork in the burrito but the answer was it came only in beef.  So both enchilada and burrito were pretty much the same thing, covered with a weak, watery red sauce that added nothing but moisture to the meal.

And where was the cheese?  Especially on the enchiladas!  Three things sitting in a weak red sauce would have benefited from a bunch of melted cheese.  At least then you would be distracted from the blah entrees.

I asked for salsa picante, hot sauce, and we were given squirt containers, one red and the other green.  Different, for sure from the salsas with chips.  The red picante was hot and the flavor was of an intense roasted ancho pepper.  Neither of us are fans of this type of sauce, but thought it really added to the entrees.  The green salsa was fantastic.  Really hot and flavorful, so it REALLY did perk up the entrees.  Just go slow with a few little drops to start with.  Adjust to your taste.

I think El Manhattan has a lot of upward potential. My hope is the the owners will take in this feedback and that other Yelpers will chime in to help them improve.

Prices are reasonable and the staff are trying hard to make it come together.  Just be patient."}
{"text":"I almost hate to leave a well deserved 5 star review because the place will start getting more crowded!  We've been here twice.  One time we waited by the bar for a table, the second time we were seated right away. The chips and salsa are very good and we got them and our drinks immediately. The guacamole dip is Amazing. They must have been out of it the first time we went. Thankfully, they had it last night. YUM!  I ordered the shrimp tacos and my husband got Canadiens al Diablo. Both were excellent! They came with rice, beans, and salad. My tacos came with this wonderful pink sauce on the side. We both adored it and I really wish I had asked for the recipe because it would be a great addition to many different meals. There are other Mexican places around but this one is definitly more authentic.  The staff is friendly and really helpful. We cant wait to fo back."}
{"text":"Delicious New Mexican Restaurant in IndianLand,SC. Good food and friendly service at very reasonable prices. Our new neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"We enjoy Mexican food and it's our 1st time dining here.
 The restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and the menu  is quite extensive.
 Chips  brought to the table with 2 types of dipping sauces one was  tomato based, the
other a green sauce, both tasty.
 The expansive  menu features a large variety of combination plates, fajitas, chalupas, tacos  enchiladas, burritos,  platilles,etc. soups, salads, appetizers, main entrees of seafood, pork chicken and beef. Drinks, desserts, a kids menu and even burgers.
The prices moderate.
 I ordered a taco salad and waitress asked if I wanted the lunch or dinner size just a small difference in price so I opted for the dinner size.
 My dining mate ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans.
 I considered my salad very small for the dinner size, the taco shell was filled with tasty but soupy ground beef, creating a soggy , watery base, with only a smattering of lettuce and a 1/2 slice of a tomato. I also asked for extra sour cream but didn't think it was extra. I would not reorder this again.
 I mentioned this fact to the waitress that it was very soupy, hardly any lettuce and she looked at me and nodded and that was that.
My dining mate enjoyed all of his meal, said it was tasty.
Dining mates food plated nicely, didn't think my salad was.
We would eat here again and order something different.
Update 6/2018
shell found in meager guac salad, returned and comped.
I again ordered taco salad thinking last time I ordered it , a fluke .  Chicken taco salad was tasty but still not filled adequately, needed more lettuce and tomatoes in my opinion, otherwise all other food seemed portioned adequately for my dining mate .
Will not order taco salad here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here the other week.  The food was excellent, the beer was tasty, and the prices were very reasonable.

My only complaint is that they need a better system for handling people waiting for tables."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Food was good but I don't think I would come back, other places in the area that are a lot better."}
{"text":"Place was very busy so we had difficulty getting service.  Food was very average without spice to the salsa or food.  We will try again to see if we caught them on a bad day and update my review if needed."}
{"text":"Food was great, entrees averaged $11. Got 4 entrees bill was $43. I ordered thr fish tacos and to my shock there were big shrimp not fried yay. Either pan seared or grilled. Absolutely delicious. Everyone loved the food which included fajitas, a grilled chicken/veg entree called something Manhattan, and arroz con pollo. Looking fwd to going back. They even had a small section for vegetatians like spinach enhiladas."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican.  Loved the food and the service was awesome.  Good beer selection and great use of space.  Love how the restaurant is configured.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"Today we tried this location for the first time. We ordered two of the fajitas for two.  My husband and I shared one n my kids shared the other. It was way more food than we could eat. Very pleased with the portions of food for our money.  The food was delicious.  The service was great.  This will be our new go to for Mexican food close to home. We will definitely be coming back.  Thank you for a great lunch and a great dining experience.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My favorite type of food is Mexican and this place was pretty average. Nothing exceptional about their salsa or queso. The meat was slightly rubbery. Refills took a while to get. Not a bad restaurant but would not highly recommend. Very open and spacious layout adding to a nice and clean environment."}
{"text":"This the best Mexican food I have had in the Carolinas. The freshly made avocado salsa is different and delicious. The service is friendly and present. It is worth a trip to Indian Land,SC."}
{"text":"D E A.liscious!!! From our first time eating Enchilada Poblano platter to the amazing postre Churros relleno w vanilla ice cream. Food comes out hot and good portions. Wait staff very attentive and informative on dishes.

Would give it 5. Menu way too many items to choose (30 per page, uff) & no music. Soccer games on tv.

Can't wait to try the Mexican Flan!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, atmosphere blah but the worst thing - no liquor license: no margarita."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome prices, great and fast service.  The ambiance is lacking and the inside is pretty basic, but yum yum yum!"}
