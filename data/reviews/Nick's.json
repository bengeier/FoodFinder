{"text":"Definitely nothing to write home about. Generic Italian food.  Pizza crust wasn't bad, but the pastas we had were on the gummy side.  Also the Mozzarella Carrozza appetizer was nothing more than deep fried grilled cheese sandwich. Tomato sauce tasted like canned tomatoes heated up. Lame."}
{"text":"Prefer crusty breads at other Italian restaurants. Would have liked to have been forewarned about the $2.95 charge for substituting one sauce over another."}
{"text":"What an amazing Italian food!!
Yesterday me and my girlfriend were visiting Phoenix and felt like having Italian food, so happy Yelp sent us to Nick's
The service was amazing, Jason the bartender was so polite helpful and generous but above all was the quality of food
We both ordered salads to start with, a Cesar and a grilled veggie salad, outstanding 
And we both had halibuts, it was great
Nick the owner came to check that everything is ok and invited us for coffee and the delicious dessert
I hope to come and visit again soon
Ciao"}
{"text":"Nick's has great lunch specials! I ordered the Chicken Piccata & got enough of a serving for 2 meals at a fabulously affordable price. Service was awesome, it was also very quiet and not too busy. Don't judge a book by its cover, this place definitely has a \"hole in the wall\" appearance from the front, but it's gourmet in the back guys!"}
{"text":"Pretty middle-of-the-road, food-wise. I don't think you'll be disappointed if you're looking for standard Italian fare, but it's the kind of stuff you can make yourself pretty easily at home.

We kinda pigged out here, as we bought the $20 for $40 Groupon; I got a calzone, the lady got a pizza, and we shared a plate of gnocchi. Again, it all was good but not spectacular or anything. As dumb as it sounds, I wish they had a Groupon option of $20 for $10 or something; if you're only eating for two, $40 of food is a lot of food here. If you don't have the Groupon, you're still paying about $20 for two entrees, so either it's pay that or gorge with the $40 Groupon- kinda lose-lose (but not really, because we're fat Americans).

Anyway, waiter was great and the atmosphere's all right- dark-lit Italian restaurant and all'a that. Everything seemed clean, et cetera."}
{"text":"The good first.  I ordered the crab ravioli and the hubs ordered a wedge salad.  Both meals were delicious.  They brought out a basket of various breads including garlic knots.  That was a definite plus, I love variety not to mention the offerings were delectable.  I also ordered a tiramisu to-go.  The tiramisu was okay.  I prefer it with chocolate liqueur sauce but they use cocoa powder as a garnish instead.  

Now the bad.  The wait.  I understand they were moderately busy and the place is quite small but waiting for 15 minutes after receiving our drinks just to order is a bit on the ridiculous side.  If they were staffed properly this would not be an issue as I saw only one server running around the entire restaurant and she was quite rushed with everything.  They really should have a backup server during busy times.  Or at the very least have who I suspected was the bartender help out rather than stand around and watch the dining room.  

One thing that I found humorously interesting is when the server took my drink order.  I ordered a Mr. Pibb after seeing it on the website's menu.  She comes back with the hubs drink but quickly tells me that they don't have Mr. Pibb and hands me the beer menu asking me to choose another drink.  I quickly ordered a root beer instead which she hastily obliged.  The hubs and I couldn't help but giggle that she didn't realize that Mr. Pibb is a soda, not a beer.  

So in conclusion, the food is good but they need to be staffed properly."}
{"text":"this place is awesome,i like the atmosphere there, and the decor is not bad either, the price is very reasonable too. especially lunch. and they offer different kinds of fresh fish all the time."}
{"text":"Ate there twice. Which means we chose to come back. 4 of the 5 of us grew up on Italian food ( mothers are Italian) and we gave it an authentic thumbs up. We will go back again"}
{"text":"Well, reading these reviews it seems like there are 2 totally separate Nick's in the same place!
We went, the first time, on a groupon, we had the seafood linguini with white garlic sauce and I thought I was in Italy or Sicily.  It was amazing, tasted home made and real!   Service.... Well it seemed the \"other servers\" were taking better care of their customers than ours.   To get 5 stars all has to be fabulous!
2nd time, wonderful food (I ordered the same thing, just can't get over how good that was) and the service was worse, including mistakes on the bill.   Nick is a great host and, when I get to know him better, I might talk about the friendly, but sub par service.  Something is just miss there.
The place is crowded which attests to the excellent food.  In my NSH opinion, this is real Italian!  How you can compare Olive Garden to ANY real Italian place is beyond me.  Obviously, you belong in Olive Garden if that is your \"standard\" that you compare Italian food to.  I'll take Nicks!   Now I want the cannoli.... After reading about them here!

I've never been to happy hour, but my son says it's pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The nice thing about Nicks is you can take your time over your meal or eat and run.  They will adapt without saying a word. It's casual and you get value. Always good food."}
{"text":"Been a patron for years. Eat- In and Carry-Out, never a tab below $50. Disappointed again last night for the last time. Food was inedible, we joked that we should feed it to our dog, but we really love our dog, threw it away. Shrimp Emperial, $18.95, Shrimp was clearly frozen too long and tainted the whole watery, bland dish with bad fish smell. Baked Ziti, $10.95, watery, bland, have had better from a can. Biggest disappointment... Antipasto Misto, $10.95 for Oscar Meyer and Rubbery Caprese. Really sad because it used to be a great neighborhood restaurant, now its perfect if you're from out of town, don't like good Italian, and will never be back."}
{"text":"With so many Italian restaurants competing with each other around north Scottsdale, you'd think each one would be trying pretty hard to get your business. This place wasn't. 

The food and service started out OK. The bread was good. The grilled vegetable salad was pretty good, although the zucchini could have been cooked a little more.

Then the meal went downhill. First, we lost our waiter to his girlfriend and her family that came in to eat at the next table. Then our food came. My calzone was composed mostly of  tasteless cheese and hardly any of the spinach, mushrooms or artichoke hearts that I added on at $1 a piece! It was bland. The side of marinara sauce was also, as was my husband's Pizza Salsa Cruda. The toppings were pretty scarce there too.

I wasn't looking for a super authentic-wow-my-socks-off Italian restaurant. I was just looking for a casual sit-down close to home, not expecting too much more than Olive Garden; but this place was a total waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Great psata, clean wonderful resturant.   Live Nick, adds real appeal to the ambiance"}
{"text":"The prices are about 2 bucks more than their website.  Their sauce had a lot of sugar, not unlike ChefBoyArDee. The bread seemed like it included cornmeal, not tasty.  The service was just okay."}
{"text":"We love to come here for a casual date night. I always order the Pasta Primavera with gluten free penne and cream sauce. It's not too heavy and tastes fresh. I love and respect that they offer a gluten free pasta. I would love to see them expand the options, or at least offer gluten free bread :)"}
{"text":"Best Local Italian Food, Best Staff and Ambient in North Scottsdale.  Nick is always constant  in food and flavor and service.  

Our most favorite local hot spot for sure."}
{"text":"Our family had been excited to try Nick's, as it received strong reviews. Alas, we found our experience lacking on many levels. The space is tiny, crowded, and sparsely decorated with rudimentary tables and chairs. The service was tepid. After waiting 30 minutes, our food hadn't arrived, and they still hadn't even brought a bread basket. They had run out of rolls. When the bread did arrive, it was the spitting image of grocery store French bread. Disappointing. When the food finally arrived, it was merely mediocre: globby messes of pasta and sauce where everything tasted the same. All that being said, I think we must have caught them on a particularly busy night. However, if you want to keep up with the chain restaurants such as Maggiano's and Carraba's, you need to do better than this, Nick."}
{"text":"I could eat pasta all day long and so living across the street from the place is torture (torture because I *shouldn't* eat pasta all day long). Anyway I might be exaggerating but this place is really good. It can be a little spendy but I find that the portion sizes are generous. My dish is the baked ziti with bolognese sauce & that runs about $12, I can eat the whole thing in one sitting but I do sometimes force myself to stop and take half of it home. The menu is HUGE though, I just stick to what I like. The atmosphere is nice, better for small groups rather than large but I think they can be accomodated when necessary. I've wanted to sit at the bar but haven't done it yet. Nice patio as well. It is in a strip mall next to a beauty supply store but what's new in this town? Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Our group of five went the day after Thanksgiving. Delicious dinner. We all tried a different entree and everyone was happy(pasta, chicken, pizza). I'm sorry I don't remember her name but our waitress was outstanding. She didn't write down our orders and everything came out perfectly.   Whether we eat in or take out the food from Nick's has been consistently good"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Phoenix I'd been looking for a good little italian place with some authenticity, like a place I loved in my hometown.  

Nicks totally fits the bill, the food is good and the staff is friendly.  

One of my favorite foods is Caprese, and I especially love finding places that make it well, which Nick's does.  The Mozzarella en Carozza is very good too, though I'll admit it wasn't quite what I was expecting.

I can't remark on the pasta because I don't eat pasta these days, but it looks and smells amazing. 

It is a little pricey for my tastes, but so was the place in my hometown, so no surprise there."}
{"text":"The best red sauce in town! I highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I order something that must be specially prepared without some ingredients and the staff is always very accommodating."}
{"text":"I ate here with four of my co-workers and everything we ordered was some of the best food we've had at an Italian restaurant.  The service and staff are wonderful.   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yes, each time we have gone to Nick's it has slipped a little. We have stopped going there because there is no one in the place and they sit someone next to you.  Then the other side of you. There is no reason for it except it is easier for the servers. The food is so so now.  The owner only talks to the chosen few...not going table to table to make you feel welcome.  After explaining we wanted to enjoy a glass of wine before ordering for about the 20th. visit, It finally got through her head not to rush us...there are other restaurants in Scottsdale who value your business."}
{"text":"great place for a romantic dinner...I dont go there everyday a bit pricie for my pocket but for special occasions thats where I go"}
{"text":"Decided to gamble on a groupon to Nicks, overall it was okay. Started with the garlic cheesy bread which was awful. Next was the baked ziti which was a little dry but decent. Tried some lasagna which was good. The best item was the pizza which was similar to Red Devils pizza. Service was fast and the plates were scolding hot which was perfect for me. Price was just right for the portions just wish everything tasted as good as the pizza."}
{"text":"Love this casual, family friendly place.  The food is always spot on, and the service has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"We were looking for an Italian place in our new neighborhood and were so glad that we came here. The service was impeccable, our food was amazing, and the price was great. My son absolutely loved his pasta and we were pleased with our entrees. We have since ordered pizza to go and were blown away. Simply delicious. We are so happy we found this place and will be back at least once a week. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"We have had lunch here 2 times and loved it both times.  First time we each had a sandwich.  The focaccia bread tasted fresh baked and was delicious.  Second time I tried a dish with the homemade linguine with chicken, sundried tomatoes, and eggplant.  It was fantastic.  Service was great, atmosphere is casual and appealing.  Will definitely try dinner and if as good as lunch I'll give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to Nicks because of a groupon.. and was very surprised with the great service, classy yet modern feel to the interior, and the best part was ALL the gluten free options. They can make any pasta or pizza (except ravioli) gluten free- and they are actually knowledgeable on the process! would DEFINITELY go back and recommend people to give it a try."}
{"text":"Had a party of 4, got to nicks at about 7p on a Saturday. Since they don't take reservations, we knew there would be some type of a wait. A quick quote of 45 mins, we headed the bar. Good top self, good beer, good wine. I had a martini - expertly made, right water dilution. Our table was called about 15mjns later. Menu was filled with typical Italian favorites. I chose chicken Marsala, others at the table chose minestrone soup, bruschetta, linguini with puntenesca. Yumm!

Great service, reasonable prices, good atmosphere. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I was originally going to dine at another place...then I saw \"Nicks\"

I am a sucker for Italian food and try to visit every one I see and try the alfredo sauce....the best I have ever had is at some place in the Bellagio in Las Vegas...

I walked in and was greeted and seated very quickly.....drink order very fast.
Service was top notch...every time my ice tea got nearly drained...it was picked up...any questions answered...

This place should really be a rated a $$$....my entree was $15 my girl's was $16 and her glass of wine was $9...mix that with salads...it came out to $57...

So....with that much cash this alfredo must be outstanding right?
Not even close....it was greasy and had lots of garlic, was not creamy and in my opinion didn't even taste like alfredo should....even olive gardens alfredo is better...Brios' sauce slaps it in the mouth! XD

I ordered a side of the alfredo as my entree came with \"pink\" sauce.....which was a mix of red and white....they should have left the red alone...

I also like my bread warm....this was not....oh well

If the service had not been good...I would have knocked another star off.

First visit...and most likely the last."}
{"text":"OMG!  I just wrote how the food wasn't very good at Nick's, and one of the people in my party heated up leftovers (they hate to throw food out even if it's not good!), and there was a paper clip in the pasta!

Don't eat here!!!!!  I want to call the health department!"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's always a gamble when you go to any restaurant, even the tried and true.  We were so pleased with the quality of device me food the other night. Anthony made his dirty martini and it didn't disappoint. The antipasto was perfect and our service was spot on. Thank you Nick's for a fantastic meal and evening."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Italian food fan, while I enjoy some good ole spaghetti every now and then, when given the choice, you are more likely to find me munching on some chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  But with that being said, when I do get a sudden craving for Italian, Nick's is my number one choice.

I really like the quaint atmosphere....but it is the food that keeps me coming back.  I hadn't been to Nick's in probably over a year, but it is by my parent's house, so we went for a quick dinner the other night.  They always have really enticing specials, like Seafood Risotto or Manicotti.  The menu is HUGE, spanning from pasta, to filled pastas , chicken and veal dishes and even pizza.  They make a good pizza, and I especially adore their gnocchi in the vodka sauce, but my favorite thing to get is the Chicken Parmesan.  This version is not breaded at all; it is just sauteed and then topped with an amazing red sauce and mozzarella cheese.  It is not what you would expect, but it is delicious!  You get your choice of either a side of pasta or vegetables, I usually get the sauteed veggies because they are so good; a nice combination of broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots.  They are cooked perfect and even better when dipped in the extra sauce.

Oh, I almost forgot, they also give you this delicious focaccia bread and olive oil for dipping when you sit down, it is so fresh it just melts in your mouth!

So if you are willing to pass on the all you can eat salad at the Olive Garden....you should give Nick's a try!"}
{"text":"should of gone elsewhere. we thought we were taking our friends to something different and unique, but what we had was mediocre bread and salad. horribly salty entrees, and incredibly slow service."}
{"text":"Very good! Probably best to get there early, it's a small establishment and can get quite busy. The calamari and bruschetta were excellent! I had Chicken Marsala which was very tasty, but a humongous portion! I had a taste of the marinara sauce and Italian ice cream and both were quite good. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked through the door.  I thought it was going to be a bit cheesy, but it was great.  The menu was something you might find in Hoboken, NJ.  Lots of pastas, pizzas, seafood and salad dishes.  My pasta was great.  It had farfalle, chicken, shrimp, feta, and sun-dried tomatoes.  They serve very reasonably priced glasses of wine (and full bar).  Overall, it was a great meal, with fairly large portions.... The lack of a final star was because of the burnt coffee......."}
{"text":"Food's awesome, but after going there for years, I still never get acknowledged by the owner- unfriendly to some, friendly to others. East coast here, so used to getting a hello, etc from the owner..."}
{"text":"LOVE! I love this place the greek salad is so addicting I could eat it everyday.  I always get the spaghetti with tomato sauce its pretty basic but the sauce it very sweet and delish!  It is a neighborhood place where you go in and you will know someone! Overall Excellent!"}
{"text":"Wow!  A new favorite!  A friend recently recommended Nick's and I was so happy that she did!  WONDERFUL food - I had the crab ravioli and it was fantastic!  Will definitely be back - it's a gem!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Nicks for years and its still my favorite place. I keep coming back for the Chicken Parm and cannolis!! This place is a staple in Scottsdale, best Italian food around for miles. I dream about their food. Authentic, classic, innovative - they have it all."}
{"text":"The bread and oil is fantastic, as well as the Caesar salad and penne marinara. Service is mainly great but a little slow. Dine here often and always get dinner to go and always satisfied. Hard to mess the order up and always happy with the food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the chicken pancetta. I rated it down a bit because of the overall food/ambiance. I dont feel it matched the prices they charged. It was $80 for dinner & wine for 2ppl. You aren't paying for atmosphere, so I'm not sure why the up charge. I think it should have been more in the $50 range."}
{"text":"Great little Italian place.  Very small dining area, so a long wait.  The food was good.  The arrabiatta was actually spicy which is rare here since most places dumb it down for the general population.  Service was good.  A solid 4 star place."}
{"text":"In days gone by we would eat here once a week. Food was fresh and service was good. Never bothered with the groupons that were frequently offered. 

But over the past several months our restaurant visits have been dwindling. Our favorite waitress is barely there and service is less than great. On two occasions and for two of the last visits there was no follow up to see if we needed anything. But you can often find the wait staff huddling in the south - east corner of the dining area with hands in pockets. 

We are great tippers (NY thing) and think nothing of leaving 20-25 dollars for a 30 dollar bill. But when I am there almost choking and find myself asking the hostess for water or a Coke well then! And more specifically if I have gotten desperate enough that I am waiving/begging for the attention of the wait staff and they just keep walking by since obviously there peripheral vision is compromised - just very disappointed in a place I have fondly loved and looked forward to going to. 

I think our love for Nicks is definitely over. Yesterday the food / sauce was so sweet I could barely eat it. I have to have gluten free which is new to me and asked several times to verify but after my ordeal last night thinking I may have been duped. 

Sorry but tips well over the 20% are graciously giving for attentive service. And although it is too late to change my thoughts - why all the sugar in the sauce? 
I keep my great memories but feel like I have lost on that one special night a week.

Just an update. I questioned the 'gluten free' but after a night in the ladies and spouse about something else my daughter just called to apologize over missing our plans today. She has been extremely nauseous all morning with things only getting worse and do not need to further enumerate. 

What in the world???"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Definitely coming back again. Nice to have a restaurant in the neighborhood with such good food. Had the Chicken Piccata - delicious."}
{"text":"Love their Chicken Parmison. The sauce is very good. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juice on the inside."}
{"text":"A typical American Italian place: plain mediocre food that is overwhelmingly seasoned with tomato sauce to conceal it's lack of freshness and taste. Never again even if it's free."}
{"text":"Nick's is a favorite neighborhood restaurant. The decor is minimalist and the vibe is laid back. The menu has some great dishes that are invariably well prepared. My wife ordered a pasta dish and requested bell peppers and onions in the sauce -- no problem.My favorite is the baked zitti with sausage. Try it, but avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"Italy! It survived 30 years of domination under the corrupt Borgia family, Mussolini, wars, murder and bloodshed. But they've also produced the some of the greatest art and music in the world. And food. You know there's nothing like Italian food. The wide variety and nuances from the various regions offer something for everyone. If you think it's all watery, overly sweet red sauce, you've been ruined by cans of Chef Boyardee and jars of awful Ragú. 

Nick's restaurants have been a staple on the Valley restaurant scene for nearly 20 years, developing a loyal and devoted following. So much so, that he has three successful restaurants. Nick made his livelihood as a hair stylist in the Big Apple. Tired of the winters, he emigrated from New York City to Phoenix. Disappointed with Italian fare he found, he borrowed his family's recipes from his brother and opened his own restaurant. Nick's is warm, casual, intimate and inviting. And delicious, of course. 

\"I want you walk through my door and enjoy every minute you're here 'til you leave,\" Nick hopes. 

We visited Nick's Paradise Valley location, starting off with his amazing Bruschetta. Fresh bread, baked on the premises every morning, topped with tomatoes, olives, basic, garlic, capers, onions and herbs. Only $5. Other appetizer choices include grilled or fried calamari, mussels in red or white sauce, grilled shrimp and others. Nine fabulous salads are also available as well as Minestrone and Stracciatella soup. 

You wanna talk pasta? Nick's pasta is all housemade. All 16 varieties, with everything from Angel Hair to Ziti. Whole wheat and/or gluten free are both available from $10 for the Marinara to $19 for the succulent Lobster Ravioli. Nick creates his sauces in small batches every day or two for freshness and maximum flavor. 

Eight different chicken dishes grace the menu. Each is served with a side of pasta or steamed vegetables. The Chicken Marsala ($16) is the most popular. The Chicken Parmesan is a traditional, solid choice. A generous, pounded breast covered with Nick's irresistible, bold, thick Marinara sauce, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses and baked. If you like, you can have it à la Milanese--dredged in flour for a light coating, flash fried and then baked. 

In the mood for \"frutti di mare\"? Nick's extensive seafood entrées with eleven choices give you plenty. Our recommendation: you get a little bit of everything with the heavenly Cioppino. Originating in San Francisco, this now \"traditional\" Italian dish includes tender mussels, chopped clams, calamari and shrimp served over linguini, not necessarily as the stew you might usually expect. Suggestion: Try Nick's Cioppino with Garlic White Wine Sauce to experience the most delicate flavors of the seafood, although you can also get it with the spicy arrabbiata sauce or with marina sauce. $21. The calamari pleased us with its perfect tenderness and sweet flavor. Hard, rubbery calamari is always a looming threat for even accomplished chefs. No worries here. 

Feel daring? Nick offers five different veal dishes. We can't wait to try his his Ossobuco, a Milanese specialty of braised veal shanks. (Shhh! We won't tell if you won't!)

Nick also has specialty and create-your-own pizza and calzones.

For a real treat, finish the meal with one of Nick's large Chocolate Chip Cannoli. It's even better if you're being served by Nick's young cousin, the handsome and built, built, built Jason. He can make me an offer I can't refuse anytime. 

For a great value, try Nick's Lunch Specials with a wide variety of choices, including Hero sandwiches. This menu is available Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.

You'll never forget the time you spend at Nick's."}
{"text":"************Like Eating In The Back Seat Of A Yugo***********

The servers can't even maneuver between tables.
YOU WILL rub elbows with the neighboring table.

***********Use To Be A Top Notch Italian Restaurant*********

It seems they went on an aggressive expansion plan......about 5 years ago.
The food quality slipped.......BIG TIME.
Prices rose.......BIG TIME.

Now its kinda of..........an over priced Olive Garden.
.......and in my opinion Olive Garden is DRECK ."}
{"text":"COME HERE IF YOU WANT THE WORST SERVICE!  MCDONALD'S has better service.  Not kidding.  This place exists ONLY due to overflow traffic from O.H.S.O.  People are starving so they end up eating here by default. That's what happened to us.  How bad could it be?  Simply put, it gets 100 stars for Horrible service.  The wait staff is incredibly crude and rough.  Bread THROWN onto the table by the water boy as he is holding 5 other dirty dishes.  Wait staff is untrained, incompetent and apathetic.  Not a single iota of basic manner nor common sense. It felt like being inside an insane asylum where patients are forced to play roles of waiters.  I was in disbelief a place this badly run actually stays in business. Miracles do happen."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in north Scottsdale for the money.  If you know of another one, let me know.  Their antipasto misto is the best I've had in AZ. Linguini with clams is to die for :) Very friendly service.  I'll never go back to Macaroni Grill!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mother a couple of weeks ago off from a 'Groupon Now' offer. We shared the chicken picatta. The portion was large and the dish was flavorful. We each added on a side salad - it  was a typical salad for a restaurant, mixed greens with one slice of tomato; per usual, disappointing. However, I got the greek dressing and really liked it. 
I felt the price was reasonable, but enjoyed it more with the groupon offer. They had a long list of specials that looked good and there were several menu items I would like try. I will check them out again sometime."}
{"text":"We have been to Nick's several times over the past year. We really want to like it but can't. We won't return. Food is simply boring and despite a menu that looks large the choices really are not there. Service is really good but the food is Boring!"}
{"text":"Nick's is a great little neighborhood Italian place. Of which there are not many in Phoenix.  It's small and intimate, the food is consistently good; my husband is always impressed with how fresh the fish and seafood is - we do live in the desert. He grew up on the east coast, lots of good Italian and fresh seafood so the fact that they make him happy says something.  Service is always good, Orlando always knows who we are and takes good care of us. There was a time in the past where service was lacking, and it was something they were aware of which is why they had a \"now hiring servers\" sign up. Shortly after, they had some new people about the place and service was back on point.  I've never had a dish I didn't like here, and I'm the kind of person who likes to try all the menu has to offer; sometimes seafood, sometimes chicken, sometimes veggie - ravioli, linguini etc... It's all good. A favorite of mine is the farfalle salmon, it's a repeat on occasion.  Check out Nick's!"}
{"text":"Just had another incredible meal at this place. I'm a bit of a \"foodie\" so I have tried nearly every Italian restaurant in the area. Hands down, this is still the best.

Part of the charm is that Nick is such a lovely man. And this is evident when you meet the staff- it is clear that they love their working here. Everyone guest who comes in is treated like an old friend, which is probably why we all keep coming back.

5 stars is not enough~"}
{"text":"The food was phenominal. Salads are fresh, bread flavorful, and dishes served hot. Decent wine and beer selection too."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Nick's for over 15 years. Their entire menu and customer service are second to none. I highly recommend the fresh salads, chicken parm and tasty pizzas. Multiple locations make it easy to partake in their delicious dishes."}
{"text":"Well, contrary to the reviews above, I am still waiting to be served - 1.5 hours! The kitchen was overwhelmed to say the least. Ran out of garlic rolls after waiting 1/2 hour. Disappointed in management that they did not come to each of the tables to apologize for the  unacceptable service. There is certainly  not enough wait staff. Will not come back!"}
{"text":"No doubt this is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The pastas are great, my favorite is the gnocchi in a pesto sauce,  for me theirs is the best. Also the antipasto salad is fantastic, better at the Tatum location than I remembered."}
{"text":"OMG you talk about getting lucky when you happen to pop into a new restaurant.  Had never heard of this place - had never seen it before, and we just walked in after shopping near by.

AMAZING!  My wife and I have been there a few times now and every time it just got better.  (Probably because we ditched the kids for some adult time)  Not that you have to... they'll feed them too.

Last time I was there I got the lobster ravioli and it was to die for!  I love italian food and Nick's is my favorite.  I don't know for certain that it's all made from scratch, but it sure looks and tastes that way.

Perfect food.  Great service."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I frequent the location on pinnacle peak and they are wonderful but the location on shea was awful. Couldn't even eat because they won't accommodate a group of 3 for happy hour unless you sit at the bar.  
They only have 2 top tables in the bar and their patio isn't included in happy hour. Which is weird in and of itself! 
Go to the location up north but don't go here. The manager didn't even care how we were treated."}
{"text":"Not sure how many stars to go with here. Food is good, but service is worse than terrible, so this review is for the service only.  This is a very small place (which I will harp on) so there is absolutely no way to miss anyone who has been seated. 

1) Sat and waited for water ( busser looked at us and walked by half a dozen times and never brought any)
2) Completely ignored by the server(3 tables and 1 booth had people).  This place is small enough to be able to talk to anyone from where you are sitting, so there is no way to miss someone has been seated.
3) Finally came over to get our drink order which by this time we knew what we wanted and we're ready to order (by the way, you get bread w/ 2 small plates for the oil and pepper)
4) Didn't take our food order, just the drink order.  Our menus were down and any server worth their money would have known we were ready to order
5) Took way too long to get our drinks - Ice Tea for cripes sake
6) Once the drinks came he wanted to know if we needed any time to look over the menu - really?!
7) Food took so long we were wondering if they were rolling out the dough, waiting for it to rise, roll out again so they could make the noodles
8) Heaven forbid you want a refill on your drink, which we had to get his attention for
9) Checked on us one time
10) Our dirty dishes sat on the table, he or the busser never took the dishes away to make room for our meals, so we had to  squeeze room for him to put down our meal plates.  He didn't want to take them from me
11) Finally  came over and we asked for to-go containers, which took so long to get we were wondering if someone had to run out and buy them
12) Food in the containers, we sit and wait and wait and wait for our bill.

You would think we had ordered something complicated.  A chicken alfredo for my son and a salad for me.  The only reason we stayed is because he likes the food and he was taking his mother to dinner.

The server was so busy talking with the other guy that working wasn't something he or the busser knew how to do.  They are 20 feet away, I'm  trying get his attention, he keeps looking at me and nada.  We had 2 other parties come in 15 minutes after us, get taken care of and were done with their food and out the door before we could get a refill on drinks.

I prefer not to go here because this is not the first time I have had to go with family and had such horrible service, but my son likes the food.  I would suggest doing carryout so you don't have to tip the server for such pathetic service. Told my son I'm not going back here, period.  Really, this place is so small that someone sitting at one of the high top tables in 'bar' would be able to talk to people on the opposite wall.  Busser and server has to walk past every table to get around.

The worst service I have ever had anywhere.  We'd come here to get food and some service, if I had known that I was supposed to get up and do his job, I would have.
We always tip on service and I didn't want to leave this guy a dime, he didn't earn it, but my son left him something anyway.

This should have been 45 minutes tops for dinner, but lasted 1.5 hours.  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for dining in.
For us this is a neighborhood restaurant, only 1mile down the street.  I've waited a few days to write this review because I was so disgusted at the disrespectful service."}
{"text":"I love Nicks!  Casual, consistent, well priced.  Great Osso Bucco, homemade pastas, love the seafood ravioli.  Several locations in the valley but we like the Frank Lloyd Wright one.  Sometimes the service is just ok but lately, seems to have improved.  
Nothing fancy, just good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"have been going for years including the original on Frank Lloyd Wright (after Pappaelli's closed) where you brought your own wine.  Wow! Pinnacle Peak location has really  gone down hill. Food totally mediocre- bread is cold, too much canned seafood on pasta,  service ok, manager arrogant! Should have tighter supervision from ownership. Better off down the road at Spiga or Soul Cafe."}
{"text":"I have recently become addicted to checking reviews to new places to eat before I head out & based on other reviews was pretty optimistic about trying Nick's.  My boyfriend and I got there for an early dinner (around 5ish) and were seated very promptly.  The decor was simple and classy, fresh flowers and cool colors filled the room. The server was prompt and rehearsed spiel-less, which I always find to be a plus.  The busser was quick to refill beverages before half empty and offer more of the delicious bread once we had finished the original.  The bread is a highlight, there were two options, one a common french loaf type and the other a lighter, beautifully seasoned variety.  To dip your bread in there was a nice seasoned olive oil.  

The food took a fairly decent amount of time to arrive considering there were only 6 or so tables, plus the happy hour crowd at the bar top.  Perhaps they were understaffed in the kitchen, who knows, I didn't dock them any stars for that.  The thing that got me to click 3 vs. 4 stars however was the fettuccine alfredo.  The plate arrived to the table and I had dreams of what I was about to dig into (beautiful memories of the sadly closed Pasta Pomedoro came to mind)  However, these dreams were not realized.  The noodles, although lovely and wider fettuccine type, were over cooked and verging on mushy.  And the sauce, while it smelled lovely, lacked any sort of mouthwatering goodness.  We also shared the pizza, which was a fabulous price, but nothing to write home about.

Although we left Nick's not planning to come back as soon as we can, I think based on other reviews that perhaps we just did not find their star dishes, and for the price (2 sodas, pizza, and pasta for $26) I will most likely be willing to give this place a try again.  And after all, I did not have an opportunity to try their tiramisu, (how I truly give Italian eateries the thumbs up or the boot) so I will have to make sure to try that next time..."}
{"text":"We had the worst service tonight!
\"Happy\"( the managers name) was SOOO rude. We had problem after problem all night and when we told him about it, he told us \"that we were rude\"???
No way to treat a customer......great way to LOSE a customer....we won't be back!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!!  Food and service were excellent. Nice neighborhood dining spot. Don't let the strip mall fool you!  Full menu with great specials. Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little neighborhood restaurant, good, but not great.  I've been here a couple times since I live close and have found the food to be well flavored, service quick, and drinks strong ;)

My personal recommendation is the penne alla campagna, a great mixture of pasta, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and chicken in an olive oil based sauce.  Not too heavy, not too light.  I was a little disappointed they only had peach sangria, a nice red one would have hit the spot.  They also have a gluten-free menu.

The staff is very attentive and take a lot of pride in their restaurant, but like a few other Yelpers have noticed, they seem to want to get you out quick.  Our server asked us twice if he wanted us to box up our dinner while we were clearly eating.  I don't want to be rushed on a nice dinner.

For a few more $ and because it's across the street, I have to recommend Rusconi's.  Their service and food is really 5-star."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Italian food in the valley. Gnocchi is fantastic, lasagna awesome, tiramisu is the best, and I hate tiramisu!!!  You have to check it out.  Meatball sub for lunch is so good."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service.  Only drawback is that some of the menu items are slightly overpriced for the portion size.
But they're still worth a visit."}
{"text":"Love this Italian restaurant.  If yo have eaten in restaurants in Italy this is the place to go. The specials were made to perfection and even the chicken parm off the menu melted in your mouth. The wine suggested by our server when perfect with our meal and the tiramisu was as good as advertised. The service was excellent. This restaurant has made it to our list of favorites."}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent food and fantastic service! The Italian chopped salad is outstanding! Had a great lunch there! Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed. Both of our dishes were beyond delish! We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved). I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try. I love all of the seafood options! Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well."}
{"text":"My daughter got sick and vomited after.   Also, I got a headache during the night from way too much salt.  Wouldn't recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"We finally tried this hidden gem earlier this week and where has this place been??? The meal was soooo good!!! There were so many options to choose from and all in our party had a phenomenal meal!! The salad was so fresh! The staff was helpful and accomodating as one of our party was late to join us. We will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I was originally in town for business but then connected with family and ended up celebrating our belated birthdays at Nick's. All I can say is that I wish this place was right around the corner from me. It was SO GOOD!!! I could totally become a regular at this place. It's nothing but high points folks:

1. Authenticity - the waiters are actually, get this, ITALIAN!
2. Service - fast and friendly, which is impressive for such a popular place.
3. Beverages - good selection of affordable wines and specialty drinks. The house Pinot Grigio was great.
4. Seating - though it's small inside and by the looks of it, very popular, we walked in and were seated immediately without a reservation. 
5. Food - 5 stars! FANTASTIC! The bread that comes when you are seated is delish (and a generous selection of a few different breads). We started with the yummy antipasto salad - fresh and delicious. It could only by topped by the entrees - each meal was so good and was a decent portion - Shrimp Scampi, Baked Ziti and Butternut Squash Ravioli (my fave). Though definitely full, I couldn't resist dessert and ordered a cannoli. Oh...my...gosh... delicious. Such a fantastic meal. 

I hope that business or other travel brings me back again."}
{"text":"The best Italian food in phoenix! Recommendations: baked ziti, gnocchi, spinach and cheese ravioli, and of course to end your night the amazing cannoli. The service is the best I've ever had! Charlotte at the bar is the sweetest bartender ever and when she's not there Jason is rocking the bar! Nicki and Linda have also given me some of the best service ever. I've made this almost a weekly thing so it's only right to leave a post on how much I love this place and the people that work there!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Nicks tonight. Great service and the food was superb. Highly recommend.  Staff very attentive and right on que."}
{"text":"I had the butternut squash and it was so full of flavor. Best I've ever had. My husband had the calamari piccata and not a drop was left on his plate. Big stars from us, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"This is a place I would definitely never go back to soon as you walked in the door the server came up to greet us he was kind of acquitting for some reason had an attitude that he didn't want us there as soon as we came in maybe he was on break or something I don't know but now for the food we ordered grilled vegetable salad the chicken marsala and the pesto gnocchi I like the grilled vegetable salad not a whole lot of flavor can't really expect a whole lot of just veggies for flavor-wise but still good now for the chicken marsala the marsala sauce was good not the best I've ever had but the chicken was way over cooked super dry and hard the side of pasta marinara it was really bad literally it taste like tomato paste try my son's pesto gnocchi the pesto sauce was missing something it didn't have that bite that you get from pesto sauce not sure what that was and then gnocchi was was undercooked for me overall bad service bad attitude and through that wasn't that good and it was on the price your side"}
{"text":"I have been to Nick's twice. I waited to write this review until after my second visit. I went with different people on each visit and our reactions are the same. This place is easily overlooked and deservedly so. 

The food: subpar. The free bread they bring you when you sit down is cold, flavorless, and a total waste of stomach space. This would be even more of an offense if the entrees were worthy of stomach space. The dinner salad ($5) is extremely simple- green lettuce with maybe a teaspoon of balsamic with some sliced cucumber and sliced Roma tomato around the plate. The entrees my company and I have ordered are the gnocchi with pink sauce, fettuccine Alfredo, and chicken spinach tortellini. All a waste of stomach space. You have to ask the waiter about which pastas are homemade. The menu says they are all homemade but only the fettuccine, linguini, and gnocchi are homemade. 

The iced tea tonight was rancid. Even our waitron recognized that something was seriously wrong. He didn't charge us for them which was appropriate. 

The service: standard. Enough said. 

Skip dessert. Skip this place altogether. 

Hopefully some day I'll find a nice neighborhood Italian place to go to. This isn't it. Twice was enough- won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was very excited with this place because it has a lot of good reviews online. The place was clean and intimate, crews were friendly and perceptive. 

At first we ordered Fried Calamari and Caesar Salad, the taste was pretty okay, nothing special to it. I always ordered Lasagna everytime I go to an Italian Restaurant, so That's what I did here. I was thrilled when I got my order because it smells so good and the apperance was very appetizing as well.To my surprse, when I had my first taste, it was a little bit salty.I tried the other part however it was the same.

I might want to try here again but not too soon."}
{"text":"This place gets a big \"EH\" when it comea to food and service. The bread is clearly NOT fresh. It is cold to room temp at best and the texture gives away the fact it is not far from stale. I ordered the eggplant parm. The breading was too heavy, the sauce bland. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. My side of steames veggies....cold. I am sure they sat for a long time before my eggplant was plated. My husbands mushroom ravioli in pink sauce was alright, but again the raviolis were clearly not housemade. The food took almost an hour to come out. The prices here are too high for what you get but other than that...I would not return or recommend. The place was busy though, so people must love subpar italian food."}
{"text":"Love that this is a locally owned neighborhood restaurant! Tucked away behind a Circle K, it's somewhat unassuming. Still, I have enjoyed all the pasta dishes I've orders here! But mostly I like that there are so many regular patrons and it really feels like a comfortable spot to hang just down the block from your house."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday evening. Was seated right away and provided a basket of bread. Ordered a red wine and Penne Pesto with chicken. Excellent meal and excellent wine. The pasta was properly cooked and the pesto sauce was the perfect temp and consistency.  Service was quick. I will go back on my next trip to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First, the food is good but nothing special. It is served hot and promptly. The complimentary bread is not worth being on the table. Menu choices are good and varied. I had cioppino and it was a lot of pasta, a few shrimp a few small mussels and little else, not worth the price. Cobb salad was great and another chicken entree looked good. My downgrade is because of their happy hour policy, only available at the bar and you can not transfer your bill to the table. If you are going to have a happy hour, make it customer friendly. There is no difference in a pour at the bar or a pour at the table. A general feeling about waitstaff and bar staff is that although they are prompt, the attitudes are surly and don't seem too happy about being there.  With the bar tab confusion and attitude, the tip dropped to 15%. I would not go there again since there are a lot more strip mall type restaurants that have better food and more welcoming service, not to mention better cioppino. Next time try Roma Gardens."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in North Scottsdale. Great food and the staff is always friendly and welcoming. Menu specializes in Italian cuisine, and is expansive. Casual but classy... Great wine list at reasonable prices, including entry level to Rombaurer Chard and Caymus Cab."}
{"text":"I had a calzone and wedge salad...both we're ok. The calzone was stuffed with too much ricotta cheese and not enough mozzarella  resulting in a kind of dried out  interior. The marinara sauce is sweet like you'd typically find on pizza,  off pizza something less sweet is preferred. All in all it was ok. Will probably check out other places before going back"}
{"text":"Where has this place been hiding. Took my wonderfully beautiful girlfriend here on a surprise date after we saw a movies. This is one of her favorite restaurants and I wanted to try it out. Plus take her out for a nice dinner.
Everything was very nice. Very unassuming little place in a nondescript strip mall. Everyone inside was very friendly. The food was amazing. Some of the best Americanized Italian food I have ever had. Of course if you want authentic Italian food you have to go to Italy or make it yourself. I got the risotto and my girlfriend got the gnocchi. We shared. Trying bites of each others dishes. I couldn't decide which one I like more. They were both so good. The gnocchi was very tender and fresh but the risotto was no slouch either. It was a great meal. Even the bread they brought out was very good. The price was very reasonable too. Not as expensive as I was thinking it was going to be.
We will definitely be back. I really want to try a pasta dish because I am told they use fresh homemade pasta. I think if I didn't like this place my girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot."}
{"text":"Decent food and prices. Seemed like the simpler dishes were better. Great staff. I'm sure I'll  go there again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. The kids ad pizza and liked it. I had veal parm and it was pretty good. My wife had a seafood pasta special with shrimp and she said it was tasteless all together. The prices seem to be reasonable in regards tithe pizza, but the veal and special were a little expensive for the quantity of veal I got and for the flavorless shrimp pasta combo. The atmosphere is nothing to speak of, almost cafeteria feeling with little or no decor at all. I would go back to try it again I think, but my wife would need more convincing. Overall, not a bad place, but fits in there with your average Scottsdale meal."}
{"text":"Ok.  Who put all that sugar in the red sauce (marinara)?  With all those NY themed posters on the restaurant's walls how can they serve a sweet red sauce when the essence of East Coast red sauce is not sweet.  I don't remember it being that sweet in the past or I would have noted it having eaten at some of the best italian restaurants in New York where the sauces are beyond the beyond.  
I had the eggplant parmigiana which came with angel hair pasta with marinara sauce.  The angel hair pasta was clumped which means that the chef didn't bother to move the pasta around in the water.  Pasta will clump if unattended.  And of course, the overly sweet sauce was difficult to eat.  I am sure there are fans of sweet red sauce but this is not NY style which is the epitome of great sauce.  
Nice bread basket with a variety of breads but no butter unless you ask for it.  Twice. The olive oil on the table was low grade stuff but at least they provided some.  
Service was perfunctory.
If you like sweet sauce, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"little neighborhood italian gem. About everything on the menu is great, and the staff is nice. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. Wish we had more like this in the PV 'hood."}
{"text":"We love Nick's!! We are huge fans of Italian food so when we moved into the area we decided to try out Nick's. The food is amazing! Every pasta is hand made and the sauces are delicious! We also love the atmosphere. Not a large place and can get a little busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"This place was super yummy. I loved how you could get a side of veggies instead of the pasta. Great service too."}
{"text":"I judge italian food by \"Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work.\"  I was raised making italian food and even make pasta from scratch on occasion. I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way. About Nick's...I can't even make italian food this good! 

Everything about the food here exceeded my expectations. The appetizer antipasto combo was an amazing combination of italian meets, cheese, and bruschetta. Each item was fresh and delicious. For the main courses we had the gnocci with meat sauce and baked zitti with sausage. Both were perfect. Great sauce, fresh homemade gnocci and pasta, fabulous!!! For dessert we brought home two cannoli's because we were stuffed. Well that night we got to relive the whole expereince! The canollis are fantastic. Fresh, tasty...I really can't say enough about how good the food was. 

The atmosphere is great, restaurant is nice and clean, service great...I never have to cook again!!! This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine! Conceited...I know :)"}
{"text":"Never again! We get there and there is a 5 minute wait with us being the 1st on the list. 10 minutes go by and a party of 2 walk in and are immediately sat, they had no reservation/call ahead. I asked the hostess why we were not sat before them and she said I don't know... Then we are sat the server was rude, never told us the specials but told every table after us. I thought ok the food will make up for this service. No not sure how this is called authentic/traditional italian because it is not. Never going back and will alert others to not waste their money. Horrible"}
{"text":"I really like Nicks but every time I eat here I get cramps later on. I still go though, I think it's because their sauces are super rich and cheesy. I love the bread they bring out before the meal with olive oil. Very large pour on the happy hour martinis. My favorite dish here is the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken."}
{"text":"The Veal Marsala deserves 5 Stars.
Service was good, but the appetizer came out just a couple minutes before our entrees.  Plus, we weren't able to make a reservation, and even though we called ahead, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  
At least they gave us some water while we waited.
My girlfriend thought her pizza was \"just OK,\" but it was definitely a good value.

I would come back just to have the Veal Marsala again. 
Overall though: ALMOST excellent."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service. Pleasantly surprised at what a great dinner we were served. Our waiter guided our selection, very helpful for newbies."}
{"text":"Nick's is our favorite Italian restaurant in the valley.  The Baked Ziti is the best.  We frequent Nick's once a month.  Great happy hour specials and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband & I have been eating here for many years -- I think almost 10 years.   We LOVE their food & LOVE that we are supporting a LOCAL BUSINESS. 

Orlando is our favorite waiter!!  Miguel is always very helpful too!!

I went Gluten Free 5 years ago and was SOOO happy, when I found out that Nick's had GF pasta back then!:-)

Some of my family's favorite dishes are:  chicken Marsala, chicken Parmesan, Alfredo sauce with pasta side dish, Lamb chop special, seafood Ciopino, clams with linguini, veal Marsala.  

They have amazing specials that change daily.  

WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND NICK's!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food here, and the service was good. It was really quiet inside, and the dinner menu is a tad pricey, but the food was fresh and tasty. They have bread and olive oil on the tables too, which I always love. Penne pesto pasta was really good (a little much on the butter), and the salmon pesto sandwich was to die for (lunch only). Definitely worth a try, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Some of the best, if not the best, Italian food in PHX. A bit on the pricey side, but portions are generous and Nick's has a great variety."}
{"text":"Very nice, non descript looking Italian restaurant in North Scottsdale. Pleasant service.
Food was good. Reasonable prices. Antipasto misto was somewhat mediocre, but the Veal Marsala made up for it and was excellent. Would go back."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by stating my mother is FROM ITALY. Finally ordered from here after hearing countless good reviews about this place from multiple sources.  Ordered takeout on a Friday night as the wait was for over an hour.  I ordered the baked ziti, the bf ordered the lasagna. This place is legit.  It's fantastic.  Absolutely great food, quality ingrediants and made me really feel like I was eating in Italy.  

The people are super nice and very polite, which is always nice.  The only downside is this place is packed all of the time and it is really very small.  The parking location is next to a Circle K, which always carries a very interesting aroma.  Aside from that this will be a repeat establishment."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood italian restaurant with solid menu and great service. Just wish they were open for lunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Best chicken parm out there.  You can cut the chicken with your fork.  Big portion.  Our go to N Scottsdale Italian place."}
{"text":"For an appropriate metaphor to Nick's restaurant, one need only look to the chicken section of their menu.

Piccata? Yes, quite.

Marsala? Ahh, of course, a staple.

Parmesana? Why certai-- wait. What? What the fuck is Parmesana? I get what Parmesan (Parmigiano) is: it's a dry, hard granular cheese. I'm also familiar with Parmigiana (which means \"from Parma,\" Northern Italy): it's usually used to denote a particular breaded meat/eggplant dish that is bathed in sauce and cheese. Parmesana, on the other hand, isn't a word. One could write it off as a simple spelling error, but they repeat that exact mode in the following veal section.

So, there it is. Nick's is essentially a generic place that doesn't quite know its identity, and it does it extremely well without anyone ever noticing.

Nick's is a restaurant for people that are afraid of change; afraid of diversity; afraid of trying something new. While I can't say there's anything wrong with ordering Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti and Meatballs every time you go out to dinner, it's not for me. After all, Nick's would be ridiculed amongst the pretentious diners of NYC, and I feel similarly. Every time my parents take me there (it is my father's favorite restaurant, which is very telling of his tastes in food) I can't find anything on the menu that sounds interesting enough to pop off the page. When I eat the food, I can't find anything about it that is exceptional enough to remain in my memory.

But, it is perfectly palatable, freakishly fresh food. I can't help but play devil's advocate and offer the argument that this is a great restaurant for people who like generic American-Italian food and are tired of (or too good for) Olive Garden. You know who you are. Just don't expect any breadsticks at Nick's."}
{"text":"Nick's never fails to deliver.  As a person who frequents Phoenix this place is hands down one of my favorite stops.
Jason is always willing to make it how you want it and remembers it for next time.

They welcome you as family.  

We had them cater an event for us and again hit a home run, customizing their menu to accommodate all of our requests.

If there were more stars I would have rated them higher than 5!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I love going to Nicks and getting their baked ziti! I have gone there for years and always get the same thing :)"}
{"text":"Had no expectations, just looking for a nice place to eat lunch after doing business next door at My Sisters Attic.  We had 1/2 sandwich & soup; sandwiches were on focaccia bread and looked like a full size sandwich, minestrone soup was wonderful - what a lovely place to eat lunch, music was lounge type volume just right for talking.  We're going back for a nice Italian dinner soon !  Sign outside doesn't say it's a restaurant, or what type.......Nick's  is Italian food, also have gluten-free"}
{"text":"Another strip mall joint, this place has pretty good pizza, but their entree items are better. Have had some good lasagna there, and eggplant Parmesan. I just don't like the atmosphere... I feel like I'm dining in a storefront ... Oops, I am!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating at Nick's for years. The food is consistent and all items we have tried are terrific. Last night, we ordered the grilled vegetables and fried calamari as appetizers. The calamari was very fresh and perfectly fried. The sauce was a bit spicy, but really complimented the flavor well. The grilled vegetables were perfect! My only complaint was an abundance of carrots. We wished they would have added additional eggplant and zucchini. 

As a main dish, I ordered chicken florentine without mushrooms. The flavor was great! I loved the garlic and cream sauce. I wish they had additional spinach, but will certainly order again.

The restaurant is small. It is always busy, and last night was no exception. The service was spot on. Orlando goes above and beyond and has a great attitude."}
{"text":"We keep going back to Nick's Italian hoping it will improve and last night we sat at the bar and had food off the happy hour menu which is what we usually do: the Caesar salad was less than mediocre and I had ordered the spaghetti and meatball dinner off the happy hour menu: the meatballs were burnt and hard and the red sauce seemed like it was nothing more a can tomato soup mixed in with the spaghetti; The sauce had absolutely no flavor or seasoning; we will never return."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place at all. Crab ravioli tasted like ravioli in a can overdosed with sauce that was not a complement to the pasta. The parmesan used to top off the dish was the powdered kind. Just yuck."}
{"text":"While it's not like the pizza in Chicago, this restaurant has the best pizza in the area. I always order pizza with extra marinara sauce and a Greek salad. I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Nick's is the closest thing to my great grandmother's Italian food. I've been going here for years and have always enjoyed the fresh pastas and marinara. While I too am a vegetarian and would love to try a veggie lasagna, this is not a menu item regularly offered at Nick's. I think Katie D. needs to get her facts straight before making false reviews."}
{"text":"Service was quick. When we ordered he didn't even ask if we wanted a salad or an appetizer. I order the pasta with manilla clams, one of the daily specials.  Pasta was not al dente it was almost raw and a lot of it stuck together. It was not homemade pasta but store bought kind. Sauce was over seasoned and way too salty.  Wanted to try this place because prices were reasonable.   My husband who only knows how to use a microwave said he could make pasta that tasted better then what we had here.  He had the veal parm. Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Talked neighbors into joining us for Happy Hour (per Yelps recommendation) at 5:15. Happy Hour is at the bar only, but there was no room for 4 of us with people sitting with open seats between them. We grudgingly sat at a table nearby and ordered drinks at apps full price while others got HH pricing. Bad start/poor customer relations. Food was ok. Had hoped it was as good as a meal at FLW location awhile ago, but it wasn't. All of us walked away from what we'd hoped would be a fun and new go-to and now won't bother going again."}
{"text":"Received our take out from Nick's and could not even eat this Burnt dry disgusting lasagna. Clearly the cook doesn't care about the quality of their food or have anyone check the order before boxing up. First and last time I will waste my money at this place. One star is too kind."}
{"text":"I love this place!they have amazing chicken parm and I love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar. Not to pricey but a good restaurant. I come here often with my family. Love the small family restaurant. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"2 Things- We came in with an 8 top of indecisive people on New Years Eve. 

It was beyond busy. 

They had reservation after reservation coming in, basically everyone was a regular. Our server was overloaded, but kept us attended to- the food was phenomenal, the wine was delicious, we even had fun poppers with games in them and were joking around at the table. The ambiance was lovely. It was a place that would make you want to come back simply because the people around you were enjoying themselves. 

I had the lasagna, a friend had the fettucine, boyfriend had the bolognese, dad had the veal, boyfriends dad had the piccata and everyone was satisfied. Would recommend ten fold."}
{"text":"EASILY the best fra diavolo cioppino in the Valley!! I eat there often, and the Groupons never hurt either!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here -- good-sized standard Italian dinners at reasonable prices in a family atmosphere. They have a handful of basic sauces that they put on a wide variety of dishes, ranging from fish to chicken to meat, as well as their homemade pasta.

A standout is the grilled vegetable salad. Sounds pretty ordinary on its face, but they do a great job with a healthy mix of carrots, zucchini and peppers. 

The eggplant parm was solid -- several slices of eggplant smothered in mozzarella. Another diner at our table had the housemade sausages (sweet) with homemade fettucine, which also got good reviews. 

The wine list is short (with a shortage of Italian wines with the except of three Chianti's) but well priced.

Our waitress said she'd been there with Nicks for 15 years, so she knew the menu inside out and winked when we ordered things she hinted were good. Gotta like that."}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience. Service was exceptional, food was very well priced (especially for the area) and good. My wife and I both had pasta that was slightly undercooked (I'm Italian and very picky) but everything else was great."}
{"text":"If you were looking for good homemade Italian food this is the place. I have been here several times and it never seems to disappoint."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible today! To same entrées completely different one had barely any chicken the other was loaded with mushrooms completely on evenly distributed. Salami in the anti-Posto was dark and looked old. There's no way a true Italian restaurant would serve the horrible meatballs that I had today dry tested processed and mass produced."}
{"text":"Baked Ziti was over cooked, meatballs were dried out, wife's food was cold, will not eat there again, not the first time the food was poor"}
{"text":"A favorite of my wife's. It is not a bad place but nothing exciting it is ok. So when my wife wants to go I usually take her. You know a happy wife makes for a happy me"}
{"text":"Second time trying the restaurant.  Offered me water but no bread for 40 minutes. Service was poor. Had their wedding soup but it was super salty and not edible.  My shrimp scampi was also extremely salty. The noodles were almost uncooked.  Very disappointed.  My friend spoke so highly"}
{"text":"I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it tastes way too sweet and oily. it's like way too sugary tasting :( I order it thru Uber eats which is great but the ravioli itself is just not good whatsoever.. and the portion wasn't very good either and it's regular price is 12.95+ tax!"}
{"text":"Nick's offers great Italian comfort food with a pleasant but no-frills ambiance. The eggplant appetizer is tasty, as are the bruschetta and antipasti starters. For mains, they typically have a halibut \"special\" that is worth a try. For the traditionalists,  you can't go wrong with the eggplant or chicken parmigiana (both good indicators of a solid Italian restaurant) and the lemon chicken is tasty.  As tempting as it sounds, steer clear of the  butternut squash ravioli...it's just too sweet!"}
{"text":"First off-- service was outstanding. Ate at the bar -- bartender was quick with attention, friendly, and had good recommendations. There is a reason why she seemed to have many regulars at coming in and out. 

Was offered bread immediately upon sitting, but declined-- did hear others in the restaurant raving. 

Food was good. Had the calamari with linguini in white wine sauce. The calamari was tender and well cooked (grilled) linguini was cooked to perfectly. I likely would have tried the red wine sauce next time-- the white wine sauce was \"lacking\" something. I'm a \"bigger\" guy and the serving size was MORE than enough and they didn't skimp on the calamari. 

Salad was fresh and the right size. Oil and vinegar was seasoned well. Add blue cheese crumbles to the salad, it is worth it. 

Chianti was good, liquor was strong selection for a smaller bar set up. 

Food price was below what I would have guessed. Wine was a little pricier -- scotch (Oban) at 14$ a pour is a bit much ($55-60 a bottle)

Quiet restaurant..."}
{"text":"Great food. Our server Arielle was great as well. Highly recommended!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nick's is awesome!  Food never disappoints and service is excellent. We've dined in and have gotten take out. Get takeout pizza frequently and it's always ready when I arrive. The food is real old school Italian, very authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"Why: 
Nick's saved me from Olive Garden!  I'm not bashing the ol' Garden, but it isn't fun, unique, or original- nor does it have great ambiance.  This area is full of chains and I came up empty with suggestions when my friends and I decided to meet up for an Italian dinner.  

Inside:
Small and cozy.  I really enjoyed the ambiance.  It's nothing fancy, but it's also not too laid back- dimly lit with tables snuggled in close to each other.  Great date place. 

The Food:
I had spaghetti with Alfredo, mushroom, chicken, and I believe one other ingredient that I can't recall.  It was pretty tasty.  Not my favorite all time pasta dish, but definitely worth getting again and better than plenty of places I've dined before.  Everyone seemed to be satisfied.  

Bottom Line:
If you are looking for Italian in this area, I can wholeheartedly recommend Nick's... at least over Olive Garden.  Also, I was the first to arrive and the bar was a welcome place to wait and have a glass of wine.  Not bad Nick, not bad!"}
{"text":"September 

Had dinner there Friday night. Service was friendly and welcoming 
 Upon seating water was quickly supplied along with bread.  The bread was sad. There were a mixture of rolls. To much garlic on the small knots and all the bread was soft. I would have liked to have had some of the bread with a nice crust 

Chicken cacciatore was generous in portion size. The chicken was tender and the flavour excellent 

The chicken piccata was exceptionally tasty. The lemon sauce was just right. The steamed vegetables were fresh and not soggy. 






Living in North Scottsdale there is a distinct lack of good pizza places so on a recommendation of a stranger we ordered here

The chicken BBQ was pretty good. The rest of the family loved the pizza crust. I found the sauce a little overwhelming   The size was incredible and much larger than I expected

We also ordered the  nicks montebello. Totally loaded pizza. Really tasty"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian food, in a cozy and well-run establishment. The servers and wait-staff are experienced and pleasant, and the ambiance is calming and welcoming. I highly recommend this restaurant, and will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome restaurant. I love so many things I couldn't begin to list, I'm a picky eater so that's big for me. They have amazing customer service, great food and strong drinks. Highly recommend this restaurant for a date night, you'll end up a regular!"}
{"text":"Hot dang diggity dawg, this is as good as it gets!

In all seriousness, throw any of your plans for tonight out the window and go to Nick's. Their pizza is superb, their bread is binge-worthy, and the wait is short. Even their plain cheese pizza has a similar taste to my various fantasies of feasts in the heavenly afterlife.

They also have a variety of pasta dishes and other fancy Italian things. Whatever. I just love the pizza."}
{"text":"Great veal cutlet parm wonderful homemade fettuccini.  Theyve actually got a 20% off check in here."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best cioppino in the Valley!! Do yourself a favor and have it for lunch. I prefer the fra diavolo, but regular marinara also available. I have had it at all 3 of their locations-equally good at all!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years and after tonight I won't be back for a long time if ever.  I ordered take-out and they gave me the completely wrong order.  I had to drive back and the manager offered for me to wait for the other customer to bring back my food....  Last time I checked that's not sanitary.   I had them make my food over.  The manager offered to give me a beer while I waited but no discount off the order they screwed up on.  He proceeded to give me a coupon for next time I come in for a free appetizer if I buy 2 entrees.   Not!   Don't order take out."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this Nick's location, on and off for ten years now. 

The food is very good and they excel at both Fish and  Bolognese Lasagna. 

We stopped in last evening around six and they were three quarters full. That it amazing, since on the weekend this place can easily have a forty-five minute wait. Been there, done that as they say. 

We started with a glass of Pinot for $8, a delicious Santa Margherita Chianti for $13 and their house Antipasti $10.00. All were good and our server Tony didn't rush us, even though things started hopping around six-thirty. 

For our entrées, we ordered the baked Lasagna and Angel Hair/Capellini in an Arrabbiata sauce, served with Meatballs and sliced Sausage.  (I've never understood why they slice them).  Both were tasty, and memorable. See photos. 

On previous visits, I have tried their Fish and thought it to be very good at around $26. I would skip the Chicken Parmigiana though.  We found it be dry and clearly wasn't soaked in buttermilk. Sorry. 

Our tab came to a very fair $61 before taxes and gratuities. You should know, that Nick's has a pretty good wine selection, both by the bottle, or the glass. 

So enjoy. Mangia!  Four Stars, up from Three, up from Two."}
{"text":"The food was not good!  Gluten free pizza was a disappointment to say the least.  The regular pepperoni pizza we ordered was supposed to come out extra crispy.  First of all the waiter came to our table and told us they had to remake the pizza because it was dropped.  When it did come out it was not crispy but gooey!  When the waiter was told about this all he said was that he was sorry!  The salads were just thrown on a plate.  Nothing great!  The waiter seemed uninterested in our table when he realized only one of us was ordering alcohol.  This place in general was a real disappointment!  We won't be back!  There are too many other choices in Phoenix.....don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Consistently great food and the service is fantastic!  Don't think we have ever had a bad meal. Been going there for many years and you'll find Nick roaming and greeting the guests most nights. I know they have 3 locations, but the one off FLW is in my neighborhood and it's nice place to go on any given night. We take out of town guests there because the staff treats you like family and the food is great!  Reasonably priced and the portions are generous. The pesto with chicken and the chicken piccata  are my favorites. Glad Nick's is in my neighborhood ."}
{"text":"This place was the bomb!! Started with an antipasto sampler, which was awesome!! Entree was chicken giardino... it was amazing! Service and atmosphere was fantastic! This has become my fav Italian restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Not good. For instance, deep fried mozzarella is really deep fried bread with a little cheese inside. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What a lovely modern Italian place hiding in a strip mall in Scottsdale! Visited family recently and they took us out to dinner, practically off the plane. A nice, quiet interior, tastefully decorated and with very good service - solicitous without being pushy, a rarity these days. The food was very well prepared, in reasonable portions and served with flair. And best of all, it was exactly what the menu described! I would have given it 5 stars, but there were just too many table crammed into the rather small space. This is the one establishment I would happily return to on our next visit."}
{"text":"Good, consistent food in a nice setting with good service.  This is not stand out Italian food, but still worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Nick's is a small local chain that does a lot of things right. The portions and service are just right, and there's a lot of variety on the menu. 

Nick's has a bunch of home made pastas, along with pizza, salads, and appetizers. They have a soup that sort of like a Chinese egg drop combined with minestrone. Try it! 

I'd recommend this spot for lunch or dinner, business or pleasure. Don't forget to check the board for the specials and try something new."}
{"text":"Wanted to share again how much we love Nick's! Yes, Orlando is the best...just enough attention and is so happy his customers enjoy the food and service. The linguine and clam sauce was devoured by my husband. He loved it! Not being a clam person, I did not share but tasted a tiny bite and it was tasty and not fishy, just fresh! I always get the chicken piccata and it is really the best I've had in Phoenix. I tried a nice white blend to go with the chicken and it was cold and slightly dry.....perfect pairing!"}
{"text":"I read all the hype on this place and was hoping for some great food and instead left wishing we had just eaten fast food. 

I tried the old staple of chicken parmesan as it seemed a popular choice and I will never go there again.  It tasted like a frozen chicken patty with canned tomato sauce.  It came with spaghetti on the side and that too was not only overcooked, but just gross.

My girlfriend had the gnocchi with pink sauce and again it underwhelmed.  I know finding good gnocchi is difficult but to me, the sauce again fell flat.  It all tasted store bought and out of cans or jars.

When I go out somewhere I want to eat something that I can't fix at home myself.  Not only could I have made it but I could have made it MUCH better.  The only redeeming thing I liked about the food was the bread at the start.  

As for the ambience, it is small and had a quiet feel to it but looking around, all the artwork (most of) are pictures you buy from Target...And there wasnt much other decor around to give you that Italian feel to it other than the waiter's accent which to me seemed very over the top whether he is authentic or not.  Sometimes I couldn't even understand him. 

Either way, for the price I know you can get better Italian food.  Try Cucina Tagliani.  I felt Nick's was overpriced, underwhelming, and not worth me ever going back.  It wasn't the worst food in the world but it wasn't anything memorable by any means."}
{"text":"For a local place, not too far from home, Nicks Italian works. I love their salads, especially for lunch. Pizza deal is great too. I have to be honest though, the past few times we called for \"to go\" orders, they never say THANK YOU and or a GOODBYE just the phone hanging up on us. I mean, come on! We're spending OUR money at your business and you can't even treat us with some gratitude when we place an order to go, especially when there are other restaurants competing for business???

O.k., there is my rant.

I'll come back for lunch but I am saying goodbye to \"orders to go\" only because you all are not very pleasant on the phone.

I really do hope a manager reads this and fixes this problem, STAT."}
{"text":"I've been back many times. This is a solid, great Italian restaurant with reasonable prices and large portions. We go back frequently."}
{"text":"Took the family for a birthday dinner, 
Bread was the starter and olive oil this was the best part of dinner. 

Started with blue cheese wedge - average at best only a couple red onion slices and two tomato slices - no cucumber no bacon, no crotons.

Other order was eggplant with pasta it was again average at best - egg plant was paper thin not recommended. The other dinners were chicken parmigiana  and veal  were  better choices but still subpar dishes--, they are really cutting corners with quality ---maybe there trying to attract tourists but not locals- I give over under in 2 years.. 

As I checked in I received a 20% off for one entrée and the waitress had to take my phone and track down the manager to verify my $4.00 discount- LOL--How funny and very unprofessional is that- chasing the manager through the kitchen with my personal phone thinking I was trying to get over for $4.00--unreal!! Just think average plate is 25 plus if I was worried about money I would of chosen a chain restaurant ( Olive Garden is a better choice and quality is better) try  Michelinas, Guidos, or Giuseppe , Maggianos , Tutti Santi by Nina's , North Restaurants all in Scottsdale /North Phoenix are all close by. 
I've eaten here before and this establishment is going downhill- there are many better choices than Nicks - and I will never return--don't waste your money or time!! 

The  good news was the waitress Toni was attentive and polite but so are most professionals. I don't think that the company has long term plans ."}
{"text":"If you like calamari get the Di Mare salad.   It is served with a house vinaigrette dressing, nice & light! and loaded with grilled calamari & shrimps.  As I allergic to shrimps, I get it with extra calamari and it is so delicious, perfect for a low carb diet! The servers here are so friendly and helpful, I frequent this establishment especially for lunch that they k ow ,e and being a creature of habit, I always order the same item, the Di Mare salad, \"sin camarones\"!"}
{"text":"I do not give one star ratings. I was tempted to do it this time as I realized that after a subpar dinner in a noisy restaurant with bland food was twice as expensive as it should have been for the caliber of meal we received. I feel swindled. Just because you are a small non-chain restaurant doesn't mean you can overcharge for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting at Nick's. The food is an excellent mix of  savory italian and american fusion tastes. Very good!
The service was very nice and helpful. They were always ready to serve w/first class service.
The atmosphere is quaint and small town, which gives you a comfortable relaxing feeling during your meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous little Italian joint with a couple other Valley locations. I went here for a friend's birthday, had some drinks, bruschetta and the Chicken Parmesan. The bruschetta was fabulous - the bread was toasty and there were just the right amount of tomatoes. The Chicken Parmesan was mouth-watering. I am a big fan of this dish in general and Nick's did not disappoint!

An overall great atmosphere, good portions and a friendly staff will definitely bring me back to Nick's again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Nick's since it opened. The staff is always very attentive. Let's talk about the cocktails!  Jason makes one of the best Manhattans in town!  Very knowledgeable about the wine list as well!  Would have given 5 stars but no imagination on the specials. The same every week. The kitchen needs to get a little more creative. But solid food and great cocktails!!"}
{"text":"We have been planning to try this place for a few months since we moved to the area in May. The grilled shrimp appetizer was delicious!! My husband had the chicken fettuccini alfredo and it was the best either of us had tasted. The fettuccini was wider than usual, there's was lots of chicken throughout but the sauce...omg, I don't know what made it exceptional, but we'll be back for this!! I had the chicken piccata and it tasted great, but I like my piccata sauce a little more lemony. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable and the interior is really nice. We will definitely be back. Our new favorite Italian place!"}
{"text":"Dined here several  times & have always had a good experience. Staff has mostly been accommodating of special requests (no sauce, no cheese). Food has been good. It is a bit expensive and therefore is not part of our regular dining rotation."}
{"text":"The food is good, but, if your having a party, go somewhere else!
We had my son's graduation party here, and planned the menu from the menu pricing listed on the menu, which was done with the catering person, and then when the bill arrived it was a whole different price. Nick, the owner, changed all the pricing, without asking, charging us double for the food we ordered and would not change or correct the pricing. WOW, what a rip-off. How would you like to pay double just to do your party here? I think NOT!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I've eaten in EVER.  I shared Farfalle Imperial was amazing, perhaps the best thing I've ever tasted,  the Chicken Marsala was the best ever, and inexpensive, the Arrabiata Penne was fantastic, al dented like it's suppose to be,very friendly staff, they helped us navigate the menu and made recommendations that did not disappoint.  First of many visits for sure"}
{"text":"I've been going to Nick's with my family for over 10 years. We were so disappointed when the Grayhawk location closed but we still made the trip out to the Tatum location for the great food. I was so excited to see their menu on Postmates and I made an order. Minutes after, my order was cancelled by Nick's. I called to ask why and their only response was our owner doesn't like Postmates. Well, that's great to know. I guess he doesn't appreciate loyal customers either. Food is good but so disappointed in the service today."}
{"text":"We frequent this place quite a bit since we live close by. It's a quintessential neighborhood restaurant. The food is consistently good. We love the arriabiata sauce (although sometimes it is spicier than other times - mostly good & spicy.) The pizzas are good, and so are their specials. I've had the halibut special several times and it is always tender & flaky, not overcooked. The steamed veggies aren't soft but have a nice crunch to them

Great happy hour offers, too :-) - if you can find a place in the bar area! They are usually packed."}
{"text":"My fiance and I were really feeling like good Italian food and decided to choose nicks because it was the closest and decently priced.

ordered the lasagna,pesto penne, and gnocchi for takeout and told 15mins (wow that seems really fast.)

first the lasagna looked like a hot mess..tasted alittle bitter and that it was Microwaved. 

pesto penne was really really bad in my opinion..couldn't get over how much pesto was in it..i get its suppose to have alot but it just didnt taste right

now the gnocchi was ok but tasted bland and the marinara was like they went to food city and bought faux marinara..also microwaved it seems

i usually try any place twice but nope not this one.

overall olive garden or even oreganos beats this place out of the water. SHOOT i could do a better job in my kitchen"}
{"text":"Real authentic Italian food made to perfection. Great service and decent prices for the quality. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"No. Just no. Not worth it. I left hungry. Didn't even want to finish my meal who new you could mess up baked ziti. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about this place... got take out pizza.... great, if u like under cooked doughy pizza...no bueno!"}
{"text":"We frequently travel to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and often find ourselves at Nick's to get some Italian food to take back to the hotel (it's only a short distance from where we stay). This particular Nick's is near the intersection of N Tatum and E Shea. It's on the small side and dimly lit, but provides a nice, intimate atmosphere. There is some bar seating, which is great if you're just looking to grab a couple drinks there and dinner to go.

The food has been hit and miss for me. Their lasagna is fantastic, as are some of their other dishes. That said, the last time we went I was very disappointed with their calamari fettuccine (I got it with the white sauce). Given that the sauce was being paired with seafood, I expected a light, but flavorful sauce. Although light, this sauce was far from flavorful. It was essentially a bland, light cream sauce--no garlic, wine, or any other hint of flavor to be found. The calamari itself was tender enough, but overall, I was not very satisfied with the dish.

The service can be hot and cold as well. A couple trips ago, we came in about half an hour before closing, and we were constantly reminded that the kitchen would be closing soon and we needed to hurry up and make up our minds. This past time, we sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely charming and attentive. It just depends on the day you catch them, I guess.

We may stop into Nick's again in the future, but given our mix of experiences, we'll be trying out some new Italian places in the area to see if we can find a new regular place to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food. It's usually pretty busy but I've never waited long to get my order. My family has been coming here for years and it is always a great experience."}
{"text":"This place has what I'd call good pizza, but the lasagna was just awful so skip that completely."}
{"text":"This is a simple-looking Italian restaurant in a small strip shopping center, but don't let the looks deceive you.  The menu is varied, and every dish I've tried has been fantastic.  The Calzone is stuffed full of excellent cheese and whatever ingredients you choose to add.  It's sized as a meal for two.  The lobster raviolis are excellent, with lots of real lobster chunks.  No fake fillers or small quantities here.  Even the salads are exceptionally prepared and great.

It's a little ways from the more commercial parts of the city, but worth driving out to."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment!!!  Ordered the pancetta stuffed chicken. It was stuffed with raw rubbery pancetta. The sauce looked and tasted like water!! My husband's linguine puttanesca tasted like watery Campbell soup. The anchovies were all dried up!  The best part of the dinner was the bread. But it should have been served warm. And to top off terrible food--we never saw our server after he took our order. After waiting 10 minutes for the check---we learned he left!!!  What a waste of money!!"}
{"text":"Our first time to this place. Its pretty cute inside, the staff is very friendly. I was very pleasantly surprised to see gluten free options on the menu, I ordered a pizza.  The crust was thin and crunchy which was nice, however it tasted like a not-so-well-done frozen pizza.  I ate it and enjoyed it because who doesn't love pizza. I would order it again, just not with the montebello toppings. Boyfriend ordered the cioppino and said it was pretty tasty.  Wine list was good as well. I WILL SAY I THINK THEY NEED SOME DAMN MUSIC IN THAT PLACE...IT WILL JAZZ IT UP A BIT!"}
{"text":"My wife and I met some friends here for dinner. We were seated right away at 6:00pm on a Friday night which was nice. 

The bread was good, and the service was very friendly and on top of things. 

I really liked their fried calamari. I had their baked ziti which I saw a few times in other Yelp reviews. I liked the big portion, but it wasn't anything special. My wife had the chicken Parmesan and she said was pretty good.

Nice local place that we will probably check out again."}
{"text":"About half the staff are friendly, but that's not quite enough to overcome the food unfortunately. The olive oil served with the bread is pretty low quality, and the food I've tried was pretty hit or miss. Ordered pizza a couple times, it was pretty greasy and heavy without much flavor. The cioppino was NOT edible, it tasted like canned sea food dumped right on the pasta. I just couldn't get it down, even though I was starving, so the waitress charged me for my glass of wine and I left. I live within walking distance, but I doubt I'll be back. Got the impression they don't really care, and left feeling ripped off. If you want real Italian food, go to Christo's Ristorante."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here because he had a groupon. Normally I don't dig italian but I tried to stay open....

The menu is great and all but, man, SALTY food! My minestrone soup was good, but both my salad (who salts a salad??!!!) and my boyfriend's Chicken parmigiana dish were SO heavily salted you could barely taste any distinct flavors. The service was good, and all else but man, I couldn't drink enough fluid the rest of the night to"}
{"text":"Fabulous. I had the gnocchi and my husband had the veal parm. EXCELLENT. We feel at home here being from Chicago and getting the Italian food we are accustomed to. Pasta was homemade and the cheese on the parm was like butter. We will be back, often ;-)  Great view of the mountains too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Nick's tonight for dinner, we split the chicken marsala with a side of spaghetti arabiatta. The spaghetti was really good as was the marsala. We also had a tiramasu, which was huge, we split it and still had to take half home. All of our dishes were really good, the bill was $24, which was good, considering the quality of ingredients. 
We can't wait to go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been to Nick's a couple of times. The place is always mobbed by couples, groups and families. I don't get it, but I guess I'm in the minority on this one.

The bread is outstanding, the service is ok, but nothing to write home about. The Chicken Parmasean is so so. I only finished one of the two pieces of chicken because it was so meh. And the Linguini with Clams was unspectacular as well."}
{"text":"Just had take out from Nicks. Have to say it was very disappointing. Fettuccine was ordered-but it was large egg noodles. And it had a faint fishy flavor. Probably pasta was boiled in pot that had been used to cook seafood. Penne dish I ordered was flavorless-and watery also. Only reason I gave them 2 stars is Caesar salads were very good. They are off my list for good. If we were dining in we would have sent the dishes back. There are too many better ITALIAN restaurants in this town for anyone to waste their money at Nicks."}
{"text":"Nick's is a small Italian Restaurant that serves up a long list of dinners, pizza and house made pasta. The night I was there a long list of specials were offered and many of them were seafood. You can sit inside or on the dog friendly patio.

As soon as we were seated someone gave us an abundant basket of assorted breads and many condiments. We were told by the other couple we were with that the salads are very large so we should split one so my husband and me split a Greek Salad. Just like they said it was large and worth splitting.

For dinner I had the Salmon and Vegetables. The salmon was fresh tasting and cooked nicely. It was topped with lots of cooked tomatoes and some basil. The vegetables on the side were crisp and fresh.

My husband had the Shrimp Diavolo. He said the shrimp were overcooked but the house made pasta was good.

The other two people really enjoyed their meals and this is one of their favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. 

The service was above average. I thought our server was very accommodating to our table.

The food really was A-OK. This is a positive review. I'd go back."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is amazing. Yes, they're unsuspecting in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. Cute inside, great staff (the owner is even there hanging out and socializing), and INCREDIBLY FRESH food. We didn't order anything over the top - Bruschetta and pepperoni pizza. You know, with pizza, it's all about fresh bread, and the sauce, it was OUTSTANDINGLY perfect. As was the bruschetta. All fresh ingredients. We're just visiting from Vegas, and wish we had more time to go back. They're another little hidden gem! When we come back to AZ, we'll definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood italian eatery.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  Casual and great for dinner any night.  We have tried several items off the menu, and they were wonderful.  The bread basket with three types of bread is great.

This has become our go-to italian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We go for happy hour. Our favorites: Baked Ziti, pizza, ravioli and red wine."}
{"text":"Food is great! Chicken feticini is delicious.  Service is friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nick's has been a pretty popular gathering place for a group of my friends. I have had their pizzas, calzones,  and chicken parmesan. Those dishes have been pretty good. 

Last night I wanted to try something new, so I tried the baked ziti with meatballs. I don't recommend it. The issue was that it was overcooked. The ziti was rubbery and the dish was dry. The ends of the ziti were hard and crunchy. The best thing about the dish was the meatballs. 

Even though my food was not up to par, the service was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Had my hubby pick up food on his way home from work based on the reviews. We both got the baked ziti, unfortunately it was pretty dry. Neither of us cared for it.

Since it's my birthday we also ordered tiramisu (we have a sick kid, so we are stuck at home)...it was decent. I have to say I was so excited to try Nick's out...it was expensive for the quality of food. Maybe the food is better in the restaurant but we won't be coming in. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on our experience."}
{"text":"Nick's Italian Restaurant (13910 N. Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd, Scottsdale, AZ) aims to please with a menu diverse in selection. Tinted windows, location inside a small strip mall on N. Frank Lloyd Wright makes for an unassuming establishment.  Upon entering, you are welcomed into a simple environment with a menu where one can find everything from traditional Italian pasta dishes to dishes with veal or seafood. 

Their traditional garden salad is a generous portion of lettuce, a sprinkle of tomato, and cucumbers served with your choice of ranch, blue cheese or house vinaigrette dressing ($3.95).   You receive a large portion of salad for this unbeatable price.  The house vinaigrette in particular, is light and coats every inch of the salad with taste.

For the main course, the \"chicken parmesana\" ($14.95) as spelled on their menu, takes a different twist.  Instead of a coated breaded chicken breast, theirs is simply a grilled chicken breast covered with a thick covering of mozzarella and mild marinara sauce.  Along with this dish, a serving of spaghetti with marinara sauce give the pasta compliment to this dish.  There is no lack of mozzarella cheese on this dish; every bite brings a delicious taste to any cheese lover. 

For dessert, their homemade chocolate chip cannoli ($5.95) is not to be missed.  A savory pastry shell is filled with traditional cannoli style cream, topped with many chocolate chips.  It is a most filling dessert; their cannoli can easily be split between two individuals.

With a simple atmosphere, Nick's simply focuses on what is most important - the food.  With a menu with many selections to choose from and delectable dishes, you can find a hearty Italian specialty easily at Nick's Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"This may be the most over rated place ever!  OMG the stuff is so absolutely average at best. The staff when you walk in remixed me of an episode of restaurant stakeout. I tried it but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Solid food and execution.  While my experience varies a bit as I make my way through the menu, their hits ensure that this is a regular part of the rotation.  They execute a halibut dish that is both easy on the palate and light on the calorie counter.
Their bread is among the best.  Truly great Italian American food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been living in ax for 20 years. Nicks is our favorite. Weekly we are there enjoying happy hour to eggplant parmigiana, and chicken Marsala and salmon at dinner time. Happy hour has \"good food instead of fried food floating in oil like most other restaurants\". Personally I enjoy his tomatoe sauce, simple spices and delicious, the staff is always professional and courteous even in their busiest times"}
{"text":"Fheir seafood is fantastic. Best scallops I have had in years. The pink sauce is amazing! Wine selectiona is great, a little pricey but very good. Chicken pasta was also adelicious. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Nick's is always a stopping point for us when we are in Scottsdale.  We have been going to Nick's for years.  Great Italian food at very affordable prices.  Nick is almost always there when we go so it is always nice to say hello.  Staff is great but we do miss our favorite server, Terry, as she has retired.  Weekends can be pretty busy, especially in season so go early to avoid a wait.  They will take reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  Looking forward to many more years to come at Nick's!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, the atmosphere was inviting and welcoming- the food was outstanding. We just spent the day traveling from Washington DC and we wanted to sit, relax and have a good meal. We will go back!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good service, good pasta. We have always driven by this place and finally stopped in the other night. We both enjoyed the pasta dishes we ordered (with plenty for left overs the next day). Our server was very good, she was attentive but not overbearing. The restaurant was small so tables were a little close together, but we sat in a corner so it wasn't too bad. The only thing we didn't really like was the mozzarella carrozza- it tasted like someone deep fried a grilled cheese mozzarella sandwich, not much flavor. Overall, a nice neighborhood restaurant. Leftovers were still delicious when reheated. :)"}
{"text":"(See my posted business photo for reference.)  I had an excellent first time experience here at Nick's for dinner. We were very pleased with the service from our Host/Waiter: Orlando and the entire staff.  I have to RAVE about my dish, the linguini seafood cioppino with garlic wine sauce and their homemade tiramisu!  IF you LOVE seafood you MUST order this, for $20 I was extremely impressed with the Quantity and Quality.  It comes with jumbo tiger prawn shrimp and muscles in a 1/2 shell, I want to say there were about (4) each and an ABUNDANCE of clams and tender squid. It was so wonderfully balanced with the seafood and the light garlicky wine sauce I was in heaven and enjoying every bite.  There was so much of it that I only ate half and had the other for another serving the next night.  Their tiramisu is very smooth and is perfection.  I loved this smaller restaurant, the decor, food and the customer service is great! 

Other patrons were enjoying themselves and their food. It was nice to see the variety of dishes being served and the happy faces that enjoyed the flavors and the same Host: Orlando.

I was reluctant in trying this place due to the average reviews on Yelp were MEH, but I am so happy I finally tried this grand place. It's now my new favorite place aside from Ocean Trail at Talking Stick.  I will be back 100% and awaiting for a great deal to come by since I also passed that up too when it was offered on Groupon.  

Thank you Nick's and Staff for a perfect dining experience! :)"}
{"text":"If I could give them a ZERO I would.  The service I received was, and has always been, HORRIBLE!   I make the mistake of ordering from there once every six to nine months hoping it will be different.  Just like when I think it would be a good idea once in a while to order a Big Mac and fries only to remember how disgusting it is.  They constantly forget things.  The service is inconsistent and the servers are rude.  They have a bunch of clueless, unprofessional high school kids running the front taking orders.  EVERY SINGLE take out order I have had they have screwed up.  This most recent incident, I called in a take out order and they said it would take 45 minutes.   Two small salads, a small cheese pizza, two chicken Parms and 2 canollis.  I showed up there 35 minutes later thinking, \"How could it really take 45 minutes?\"  I showed up to pay and they looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language.  They accused me of ordering from the wrong location so I showed them the number I have programmed in my phone and they agreed it was them.  They said, \"Oh we forgot to put your order in.  The girls at the front started arguing and blaming each other.\"  I was irritated and told them that on my last order they forgot to give me the pizza I ordered.  The manager came up and said, \"I remember that we forgot your cheese pizza last time (because he called me and told me the night he forgot it), so we will comp you the pizza this time.\"  I was like, \"That's it?  And now I have to sit here and wait another 45 minutes?\"  The girl at the front said, \"It will be more like 30 minutes\".  So to make this right, for screwing up my dinner and inconveniencing me, he was going to not charge me for a pizza he already owed me.  Their food sucks as well.  It really does.  It isn't even good Italian food.  The only reason I go to Nick's is because it is close.  But the service, the food, the sneaky behavior....l will NEVER go back there.  I am going to tell everyone I know to stay as far away from that crappy place as possible.  There are much better choices for Italian in the valley.  I am still in shock over what happened tonight.  I have never seen such a greedy disregard for the customer's satisfaction in my life.   If you want really good Italian Food go to Uncle Sal's on Hayden and Osborn. 

Here is another story, if the above story isn't convincing enough, I took a friend of mine  there to celebrate a promotion she got.  It was hectic and all of the tables were dirty so we said we would take the first available.  All of their tables are tiny and uncomfortable.  When they finally sat us, we waited 40 minutes to get our drink order.  People were leaving from the poor service and we were sitting next to the hostess station.  The owner, was swearing his head off at the hostess and 2 of the servers dropping the F Bomb repeatedly.  It was a horrible experience and that was the last time I swore I would never dine in there again.  Now they will not get my take out business either.  

To summarize:
1.  Crappy food
2.  Crappy service
3.  Crappy atmosphere
4.  Rude staff
5.  Foul mouthed owner
6.  Ridiculous take out service and cashiers who can't take orders properly.
7.  Marinara sauce is bland
9.  Tiny tables which are all pushed up against each other like a school 
        cafeteria.
10.  Consistently disappointing

RUN FAR AWAY!  Go to Uncle Sal's.

We ended up going to Uncle Sal's after this fiasco and it was incredible!  I was so grateful for the awesome service and amazing food at Uncle Sal's I tipped the server $100 on a $50 bill because, and I told our server this,  the service was the only thing better than the food.  True story."}
{"text":"The food and service here were fantastic.  Best grilled and fried calamari I've had in a long time. Chicken piccata was also excellent."}
{"text":"We love Nick's!  The food is consistently excellent and the menu is varied.  There are a variety of choices including pasta, veal, chicken, and other Italian favorites!  The wine list and bar are high quality (great pour on Scotch).  Leah, our server is exceptional!  She 
always takes excellent care of us.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really like eateries that are high-energy and bustling, especially ones that have their dining area set up as one big room. So it is with Nick's Italian in Paradise Valley (there are two more locations in the Valley). The upbeat, high-energy restaurant makes you sort of feel like you're in someone's home, since the seating quarters are close.

The food is all handmade, and I really enjoyed my meal, too. My pal and I grabbed a seat at one of the bar high-top tables, and we started off with the Caprese salad ($7.95). It wasn't huge of anything, but the mozarella was high-quality, the tomatoes were juicy, and the basil was ample.

For my entree, I got the Portobello Mushroom Ravioli ($15.95). The pasta was filled with delicious mushrooms, which I really enjoyed. I liked the pink sauce the ravioli was served with, but I wish it would have had fresh tomatoes in it. Also, I felt like the portion could have been a little more generous.

Here is my pal's Veal Parmesan ($17.95), which he said was pretty darn awesome because the veal was tender and the sauce was tasty.

The meal-ender, the tiramisu ($6), was a great deal, really delicious and perfect to share. The mascarpone cream was mouth-watering, and the ladyfingers melted in my mouth. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, and that was definitely my favorite part of the meal.

While I enjoyed Nick's Italian, and I did appreciate the twinkly lit patio, I would choose Arrivederci over Nick's if you're in the area, based on the service alone. We were in a busy area near the bar, but servers should still strive to make you feel welcomed and relaxed no matter how buzzy the place is, and I didn't really get that vibe from our server. If you do go, try to get a table in the main dining area or patio-maybe things would feel a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years with my family and it had always been one of our favorites but not anymore.  After several disappointing visits, last night will be our last.  The quality of the food has just gone down - dry, tough, overcooked chicken; pasta was too al dente; pizza undercooked.  Its really all too bad because this really was our favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband located this place and wanted to try it because they had gnocchi on the menu and that's the only thing he likes in the world of Italian food.  They make their own pasta here and I have to say the pasta was very good.  I had chicken fettucine alfedo.  The fettucine was good, the chicken was good... the sauce, not so much.  Bland and boring!  My husband had a lemon chicken dish with gnocchi on the side.  I did not like the pink sauce on the gnocchi one bit and when I tried his chicken I didn't taste lemon, I tasted wine.  Yuck.  I like that they make their own pasta but they really need better sauces to go with it.  Very limited indoor seating as well, and when it's 108 degrees, sitting outside is NOT appealing."}
{"text":"We have gone to this restaurant several times but tonight the service fell to an all time low. It took 50 minutes to get our food without an acknowledgment that they were running late. We finally asked if our order had been processed. No apology when it was delivered. Not sure we will give this place another try when there are so many options in Scottsdale. Consider your options before you choose your dinner location."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  STAY AWAY!!!

Last week I placed an order in person for catering for about $150 and pre-paid in FULL. I went to pick it up and they said it I had not paid.  After some phone calls and negotiating, they admitted it was their mistake and they were NOT friendly about their own error.  Then I get home and there is no dressing for the salad.  It's not like I have salad dressing in the fridge for 20 people!  They said I could come and get it.  I asked if Nick would deliver it, as he was there when I picked up the order.  The girl said, \"That's not gonna happen\"."}
{"text":"It's like I have to psych myself up to go to Nick's every time, because I forget how much I love it but last night, I had to personally thank the owner for serving quality food at a fair price (you can get a glass of wine for $7 and an entree for $13-$15)... it's a bonus that it is close to home! So, even though, for some reason, I keep forgetting that I actually REALLY LIKE the food here, I'm a BIG fan of Nick's. I especially recommend the arrabiata, the gnocchi, and the stracciatella."}
{"text":"You cannot beat Nick's for great Italian food. We had loved Nick's when we lived in Scottsdale and having returned there, found it to be every bit as great as we remembered it.  From veal to pasta to pizza, everything is fresh and flavorful.  In a very casual setting, the staff are very attentive and Nick's menu offers a variety of entrees; all of it under Nick's watchful eye.  In Scottsdale, it is definitely the best there is in Italian dining."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant, and one that we frequent every other month or so . I've never had a bad experience here. Food, drinks, service....all of it is wonderful.  If you are in the mood for Italian food, Nick's is the place to go!"}
{"text":"One of our go to spots for dining in but mostly takeout.  My favorite anti pasta salad anywhere. Great baked ziti and my kids like the pizza. A great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Nicks last January and really enjoyed the meal. Fast forward to June, we are back in Phoenix and decided to return. We started with a Mozzarella in Carrozza. It was lightly fried and very tasty. Then we split an Antipasto salad. The lettuce was crisp and the salad had a nice blend of cheeses, pepperoni, salami, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. I had Baked Ziti with Sausage. The Ziti pasta was excellent and the sausage gave the dish a very flavorful taste. She had Chicken Piccata, a chicken breast in a white wine sauce with lemon and capers. She chose roasted vegetables instead of pasta. the vegetables were crisp and flavorful. Both of us had enough left for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service horrible.  Don't get Orlando as waiter if you want you food to come out in a reasonable time.  Very unprofessional.  They should be ashamed.  Food was good though."}
{"text":"A mainstay in the restaurant rotation while in Scottsdale, Nicks came through once again with a delicious meal. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, even putting up with some less than stellar attempts at humor (and my mother). If you've ever eaten with a person that alters every nuance of a dish, then you've eaten with my mother. The calamari was divine; golden crispness yielding to the savory yet rubbery substance that is octopus.  Amongst our dishes we had spaghetti bolognese with meatballs, some kind of healthy penne spinach dish and a margarita pizza. The only complaint we would have is that the wedge salad was served with enough dressing to satisfy the needs of a small town, but it was still good.  The best measurement of an Italian restaurant is the quality of their meatballs, and these balls didn't disappoint. Well shaped and covered in sauce, these spheres of compact bovine and swine were beyond reproach. Pizza was on point and the healthy dish was fantastique!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food and prices are more than reasonable.  The quality and quantity are above expectations.  The service is great as well.  If you want good Italian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 large pies to take ouut. The pepperoni had exactly 1.5 slices on each slice. REALLY! The other pie had one piece of sausage and one piece of pineapples per slice and some slices were missing onion and mushroom altogether. We were told this was great pie. Totally disappointed after paying over $50.00! You can fool some people but not a pie loving New Yorker. You should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome and erandy was so sweet while getting my to go ready. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"well-done concept of cute, cool fair-priced Italian food, sophisticated enough wine list, and genrally upbeat, fun, not anti-family vibe filling the place.

Food was very good and service spot-on. Excellent value and great save for the dad in-a-pinch for \"no time to make dinner\" or for take-out needs."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable place with good service and mediocre food. Pasta is seemingly cooked ahead and it tastes like it , often mushy and not salvaged. by poor sauce."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Great food and great service. The Stracciatella soup was outstanding  I had the Penne Alla Compagna whic also was outstanding. Nice wine list also. I highly recommend  Nicks for great Italian food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed another good meal with friends.
Nick's is a gem of a neighborhood restaurant. The menu is varied, something for everyone and tasty. Not gourmet, not fancy- but consistent.
Only once was I disappointed in my
Dinner. And that's not bad odds considering we are regular patrons since they opened many years ago."}
{"text":"Always delicious always on point staff. I have been at this location the most (other ones a couple times each).

Ingredients to a nice relaxing atmosphere is what nicks is all about. Thanks Nicks, and evviva!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Nicks at Pinnacle Peak on Friday night and our server was Jake. Jake was great and the manager who came over to ask how everything was was extremely pleasant also. We were given a taste of bruschetta, which was a nice touch, and our salads arrived which were very fresh and very large! My husband ordered the veal chop and grilled vegetables and I ordered chicken breast with cheese, tomatoes garlic...sorry cannot remember the a tubal name of the dish.  My husbands veal chop was perfectly cooked and swimming in a cream, red onion sauce which was delicious!  WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE. The vegetables were perfect and served on the side. Now if you are looking for a dish that is beautifully presented, and garnished in an appealing way....this is not the place.  The great thing about not garnishing is that the food comes out HOT and looks like it is home cooked...a very good upside.  As for my chicken.......disappointing, very bland. A few Italian herbs added at home the next day perked it right up!  The manager said that he found it lacking in flavor too. HHMMMmmmmmm why doesn't he talk to the chef about that? WE WILL GO BACK...best veal chop in town according to my husband."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been going for a few years now and have never been dissatisfied with a dish or service. For starters, they bring out a great assortment of bread. I have tried many of their dishes and they have all been very good. I love to get the grilled vegetable salad with grilled chicken and a side of the arrabiata sauce. I have found it to be the perfect combination. My boyfriend gets the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The fettuccine is amazing. They make the pasta in house and cook it perfectly. Great neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wasn't especially impressed. Found it odd that the staff was busy getting frks to the empty tables rather than customers (us) with food on the table. Note to staff: get utensils to sitting customers first. 

Everywhere I've ever been, when it says Chicken Parmesan on the menu, it means breaded. Theirs wasn't. If you're going to deviate from 95% of the restaurants in the world, maybe you ought to put that fact on the menu? 

Might eat here in an emergency Italian craving, but won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual restaurant for lunch or dinner and you're in the mood for Italian food, Nick's at Paradise Valley (in the Whole Foods shopping center) is an excellent choice!

Whether you're in the mood for pasta, pizza, soup, salad, fish, chicken, or veal, you can find something that you'll be happy with at Nick's.  I've been on several occasions and never been disappointed.  They always start you off with fresh bread and olive oil (a must for any good Italian restaurant)... don't allow yourself to eat the whole basket though; you must save room for what is coming!

Some of my fave things to order are:
-Grilled calamari appetizer (yes, I said grilled!) 
-Grilled eggplant appetizer
-Stracciatella soup
-all of their salads are delicious
-pasta with meatballs 
-salmon or tilapia (picatta style)
-Shrimp Fra Diavolo

I don't think you can go wrong with so many options to choose from!  Portion sizes are generous but not ridiculous.  I recommend saving a little bit of room for the Hazelnut Tartufo for dessert... it's the perfect sweet ending to your meal (and it helps to cover up that garlic breath you probably have from your dinner)!

FYI:  There is waiter service at this location - and the menu is a little different than that at their other Scottsdale locations.  Nick's won't blow you away, but it's a safe bet for a simple Italian meal with consistent service.  Take it for what it is... Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this restaurant and was not impressed.  It was kind of busy and we decided to wait for the 15 or so minuets. A party of four arrived about  10 minutes after us and were seated after about 5 minutes. After about 10 more minutes we were seated at a table in a high traffic area and were continually being bumped. They did have a seating list but were seating people out of order.  The bread was cold and dry and the salad was nothing special ( way over priced for what you got).  Pizza was above average and my wife ordered gnocchi it was not traditional very thick and gummy. We ordered the tiramisu which was pretty good and the service was good. We will probably pass on returning, the place was very chaotic and loud.  Definitely not a place to go if you want to talk unless you like using your outside voice."}
{"text":"We visited after the holiday rush and they still seemed to be busy so we waited 15 minutes. No problem, we had a few drinks at the bar and took in the ambiance. We were served herbed olive oil and bread with our wine which was a nice touch. Prices are pretty reasonable and you receive a lot of food. For $20 I got the lobster ravioli and it was delicious. The pasta was fresh, the ravioli were satisfactorily stuffed, and the cream sauce was tomatoey. 

The service was excellent, I really hate it when waiters hover. For what it is, Nick's is decent Italian fare. You won't exclaim, \"OMG, I am back in Italy!!\" while you are eating but it's fresh, it's tasty, and the variety and servings are great."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken Parmesan with a side of spaghetti. I asked for meatballs and they threw them in for free into the spaghetti. No extra cost through Uber eats!!! I also ordered the chicken Cesar salad. Yum! There was the perfect amount of sauce and cheese for both dishes."}
{"text":"WOW. I love this restaurant!! Been going here since I was a kid and it gets better every time. 5 stars! Excellent!"}
{"text":"dinner is ususally good but last week my wife had a hair on the lemon garnish and the waiter just picked it off with his hands...gross.  WE insisted on another entree.  Nothing was credited or offered."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is a bit disjointed, and they really pack you in like sardines.  It's small but that doesn't mean I want the next table asking me to pass the parm!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch or supper!  They are not afraid of \"special\" requests!  I enjoy the Chicken Marsala especially!  I special order it with fettuccine noodles and Marsala sauce on the side, triple mushrooms everywhere!  Always delicious!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot!  I had heard about Nick's from my sister who loves Italian and gave it a great review.  They were very busy when we got there and it took us 45 minutes just to order!  That  and the lack of flavor in the tiramusu were the only reasons I gave it 4 stars, not 5.  Our server was very friendly and provided great service once it calmed down.  We split a large salad(Spinach Walnut) to start, which was delicious!  I had the shrimp scampi dish with linguini and it was great.  Super garlicky(which I LOVE) and the shrimp were huge!  I will definitely be back to try Nick's again."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place for a while now so I finally went for lunch. I must have got the wrong thing. I ordered the alfredo with chicken. The chicken was ok, lacked seasoning. The alfredo sauce was very thin and watery and totally bland. I did not care for it at all. The fetticcini noddles were ok. They are fresh and big in size. I see lots of good reviews, so they must have something there they do really good. If I do go back ill try the marinara sauce with chicken parm or the  pizza. Staff was very friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I'm finally shocked! No one has reviewed Nick's on FLW? Okay, here goes!

In short I love Nick's 99% of the time. The 1% I don't like it we get stuck eating at one of the \"two  chair\" tables in the middle. Not my favorite. The food on the other hand is great, especially the pizza.

My partner and I have eaten here enough that Nick recognizes us and always sends over an order of Bruschetta. Delicious. We've sampled just about everything on the menu and can't say we've had anything awful. Some of the pasta dishes could be a little better (Penne w/Pesto is one) but all in all the food is very good.

Make sure you save room for dessert. The Chocolate Chip Cannoli is to die for."}
{"text":"Really good Italian good. It's a little pricey but the food is good. Staff has always been friendly and have yet to have a bad experience here. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Got a touch lost one day and happened to drive by Nick's and decided to give it a go for dinner that night.  I had the Fettuccine Alfredo with Grilled Chicken and my fiancee had the Baked Ziti with Sausage.  Get the Ziti if you order either of these two dishes.  

The Fettuccine was very al dente, which some prefer - but it was almost to the point of under-cooked and close to crunchy, not my thing.  The Baked Ziti on the other hand was very good.  The sausage on it was cooked perfectly and the noodles didn't taste nearly as under-cooked.  

If you order only one thing from this place get the Tiramisu!  That dessert definitely put this place back in play for us to return.  It was light, airy, delicious and not too sweet or too mocha-y.  My non-coffee drinking fiancee loved it and my addicted coffee self loved it too!  

Overall: B- (with a huge A+ for the dessert)"}
{"text":"Ordered take home via  Uber Eats 
The Uber Eats service was excellent  
The food from Nick's was very disappointing 
We spent $95.00 for poor quality food
The grilled Calamari was terrible very rubbery and tasteless
The $22 dish ciopinno was terrible
I am upset and want everyone to know this was a joke
Lowered my rating to one star after reviewing our meal of last night and talking to others"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we found the gem in our neighborhood.  The dining room is small, so when it's busy, tables are tough to find.  There are only a few chairs next to the hostess stand and it can get really crowded there during peak hours.

We've ordered the following menu items:

Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, $10.95
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ#T5quiIz0RxafYkagpoC7qQ

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw#U4ODmyuyxB7jSYmpbBIyAw

Baked Ziti, $9.95
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nicks-scottsdale?select=HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg#HHBLkID7bubiO48cia_3Xg

The Gnocchi & Baked Ziti is delish.  They cook the Gnocchi just the way I like it, al dente.  The Better Half enjoys her Baked Ziti with Gorgonzola Cream Sauce and they oblige her with that special order.

The Pizza is very very good.  I love Pizza and they do a great job here.

The service here is good, I wouldn't say excellent.

{"text":"Moving from Chicago - the land of awesome Italian food - I'm so happy I found this place on a groupon. Bruschetta was awesome and flavorful as well and the wine recommended by our server was perfect. The pizza looked awesome ill be sure to try next time, however if you're in the mood for pasta be sure to get the arrabiata sauce. It's packed with flavor and not too spicy!!"}
{"text":"As we drove up, it looked like any old strip mall joint and we weren't very excited about it from the outside. However that all changed when we walked through the door... It was a surprisingly nice decor and atmosphere. It didn't stop there, the food was great, the service was outstanding, the staff was friendly and the spot was extremely family friendly. We have an 18 month old and they looked after all of his needs and made sure he was taken care of as well as the rest of us.

We ordered the fish of the day (halibut), a couple of pizzas, minestrone, the Greek salad and a chicken special that was out of this world..."}
{"text":"Small, inconspicuous, and hidden in a strip mall. But don't let that fool you. The food is excellent, the service great, and the prices are reasonable. Wife and I, and now kids, love this place."}
{"text":"this nicks is the closest to our house there was one closer on scottsdale and grayhawk however they closed it down and moved it more north on pinnacle peak and pima rd. this one is not very big however its never really packed so we are always seated right away. i always get the chicken parmesan with the pasta for a side (spaghetti pasta) and it comes out sizzling hot and the chicken is covered in cheese. soooooo good!! ive tried the veggies as a side before and it just wasnt good. they had this weird flavor on them but the pasta is yummy and my daughter loves to share the pasta so it works out so i don't have to get her her own meal."}
{"text":"used to go to Nicks when they were on Scottsdale road and grayhawk next to Pei Wei before it closed and it was closer but i was so happy when they opened this one a few miles away... the pizza is great but i always get the chicken parmesan with the spaghetti pasta... sooooooo good!!! i get this for lunch and i can eat half of it but its good for eating later :) have been coming to this one for lunch quite a bit i just wish it was open earlier on Sundays and Saturdays for lunch."}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food. And the food was smothered in cheese regardless of the dish. The whole experience seemed like a Kitchen Nightmares episode!"}
{"text":"My experience was really good. Great service and the seafood special was delicious. Hearty portions. Great selection of wines by the glass."}
{"text":"Good consistent Italian food .. not overly expensive .. veal pizziola is very good .. staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Fabulous food fantastic service! We sat at the bar and had impeccable  service! Brian was great! The GM Ryan is such a personable man! Talks to all of the patrons! Go go go!"}
{"text":"LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices.

I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good. 

The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal. 

My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table! 

A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday."}
{"text":"This is my second time dining at Nick's, but my first time at this location. I am again impressed. The food here is always good and interesting. 

My only complaint: I'm not crazy about the GF pasta they have chosen to use, though; the quinoa flavor/texture isn't great, so I hope they will switch to a better brand like Jovial. The gluten-free menu, however, is extensive and the dishes are very good. The staff are always friendly and attentive. 

Tonight my companion had the crab ravioli and said it was delicious! I had Pasta Pollaio. Both were delicious! Although we came in about half an hour before close, staff were completely professional and friendly. The restaurant was very clean, with a nice, intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"I visited Nick's for the first tie a few month's ago. The experience was overall very good. I have one complaint to get out of the way: I wish they would switch to a better brand of gluten-free pasta, because the quinoa blend they are using now isn't the greatest. But otherwise, everything was wonderful.

The gluten-free menu is extensive compared to other restaurants. My first visit, I had the Pasta Campagna as it was recommended by another reviewer, and it was very good. I can't recall what my companion had, but he said it was delicious. We both enjoyed the grilled calamari, which was tender and flavorful. 

The staff were very friendly and attentive, and when we had a brief problem with contamination in y dish, were very concerned. I could tell that they took special dietary needs seriously. 

I will absolutely return to Nick's and I recommend it wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"Much has changed in the two years since my initial review.  Apparently Nick's has decided to toss customer service out the window.  I should have known it would be a problematic visit when it took nearly 15 minutes to be acknowledged to put in our order.  Well, it only got worse.  After nearly 45 minutes of waiting, we realized that our food was never, ever going to arrive.  Ever.  Time to leave, and never come back.  Ever."}
{"text":"1st time to Nick's based off of yelp comments and was not disappointed! The service was great. The prices were wonderful. The food was YUMMY! 

I typically get penne with red sauce and sausage. This was the first time I ran out of pasta prior to running out of sausage! That's what I call loading it up with the good stuff! Also had a house salad which was an extra $4 or so (bummer that not included). A variety of different breads to warm you up. Save room for the tiramisu! Even if no room left, make some. Made fresh in house daily and probably some of the best ever. 

I'm a value guy. If soup or salad was included with the dinner, would have received 5 stars. Not knocking it in any way because it didn't. I'll be going back and see myself becoming a regular.  It was obvious that everyone there was a local!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I love sitting outside here! The seating is very comfortable. The atmosphere is very laid back and elegant. Even though they were busy at the time our waiter was very attentive. I had the Gnocchi soup for the first time. I am sad that I can't find a place that  could compare to that of Nick's Gnocchi. I also had the Caesar salad which was yummy! This is such a nice place for a date or a night out with the family. This is also my grandfathers favorite restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats and it took about 30 minutes to arrive. This was faster than the estimate. First issue was that it arrived with no way to eat it. Not a single piece of silverware or a napkin. Once we were able to find silverware in the hotel lobby we were able to try the food. My wife really enjoyed her Shrimp Scampi. I had the Cioppino which was good but I should have followed my first thought of not getting the Arrabiata sauce since it listed it as spicy. It was way way too spicy to the point I ate about 1/4 of it before having to stop and ending up throwing it away. I like spicy food but this was way over the top to the point of having to take an anti acid."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it was as expected. The staff was Great. Our server, Elijah was very knowledgeable with the meals and particularly the wine selection. He gave us a \"Wine Tasting for Dummies\" crash course. He was pretty Awesome!! My son got the Chicken Parmigiana which was the BEST I've ever had. Compliments to the Chef. I had the Fettuccini Alfredo w/Chicken and Broccoli and it was Perfect!! We'll definitely be going back. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I had big order dinner to go for 10 people, the food was ready on time. The girl that I talked to on the phone was very helpful.

Everyone enjoyed their food except me. I had spaghetti pollaio on cream sauce, it was way to rich and creamy. I ended up couldn't eat it and gave it to my husband instead."}
{"text":"We ordered Vegetarian Lasagna and Fettuccine Alfredo. 

For starters, they served us BEEF Lasagna. My boyfriend who doesn't eat red meat, took a huge bite out of it, only to realize there was meat and spit it out. He said it was disgusting. After a manager responding to this review stated that they don't even offer meatless lasagna, it makes me wonder what they teach their servers and waitstaff since we were directed to \"try it out\".

The Fettuccine noodles tasted either raw or over cooked, I couldn't tell, and I wasn't about to eat more to find out. I realize the noodles are homemade, and normally have a different texture than say, store bought noodles. They were not made or cooked properly. The sauce had little to no flavor, so we couldn't even resort to dipping our bread in it. 

Aside from wasting money on this meal and not having dinner last night, I'll also add that we've been sick for 12 hours with possible food poisoning. As soon as we ate from here, within 30 minutes we became very ill. 

I would not recommend anyone going here, ever."}
{"text":"Last night, I took my family to Nicks for dinner after seeing a show at the Cactus Foothills Fine Arts Center (great show BTW).  The entire family thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  My wife and daughter both ordered the Ciopino and basically licked their plates clean.  I loved the creamy fetucinni alfredo with shrimp.  We all shared a nice piece of cheese cake for dessert.  

Even better than the food, the service was excellent. Aiyo (not sure I got the spelling correct) was both efficient and personable.  Our water glasses were always full and the table was bussed efficiently without ever feeling like we were being rushed.  Just a lovely evening with the family."}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant it wasn't even busy and everyone just looked at us. Had to ask for a table. Brought cold bread and butter after we asked for it - saw others had it. Unless you come here often or are a regular - don't expect great service or great food. I had the lasagna - it wasn't anything special - tasted like a frozen microwaved meal."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss the most since moving away from Arizona is my Sunday night tradition of ordering take-out from Nick's. It simply can't be beat. The minestrone is the best I ever had, the NY style pizza is fantastic and the bolognese sauce over your choice of pasta is outstanding. Even the salads are good (try the Greek). If you want rich, try the gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce. This place is a treasure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some of my favorites are the minestrone soup, Greek salad, spaghetti Bolognese, gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, fettuccine with white clam sauce and much more. Everything here is good. The sausage and meatballs are great, too. This is one of the places I miss the most after moving from the area. Hard to find really good Italian food like this."}
{"text":"Nice place, but small; gets crowded quickly.  They do offer patio seating, so it's perfect for this time of year when it's cooler....the food was good. Our server, Orlando was very friendly and quick to provide service.  Our group order different items each which works out great to try a little of everything: Antipasto Salad, Seafood (Lobster & Crab) Ravioli, Alaskan Salmon w/Balsamic Reduction and Spinach Risotto, Lasagna, Chicken Giardino and Chicken Parmesan"}
{"text":"A night out!

Ciopinno with marinara. Antipasto (without any salad). Minestrone soup. Spinach salad with grilled salmon.

What a spread!

The decor is artsy and tasteful. The service is above average. It's a great starter to evening."}
{"text":"I have only tried the chicken pesto and the chicken parmesan sandwiches. These two are so delicious that I can't break away and try something different. They are only $ 7.95 each for lunch time and these sandwiches are so big I only eat half and take the rest home. Great service and great value."}

Beverages = 3.7 stars
Appetizers = 5.0 stars

{"text":"Authentic Italian food and wine! Service and ambience are amazing and I would recommend Nick's to anyone!"}
{"text":"I order take out from here frequently and it is always delicious and the chicken cacciatore is very healthy. You can even sub steamed veggies instead of pasta. The service is fast and friendly. I think some of the harsher reviews could be attributed to the older wealthier crowd in the neighborhood who have unrealistic expectations or are expecting mastros when this is a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is always superb.  Many choices, very reasonable prices.  One of our favorites. Staff is always friendly, and attentive.  Veal and fish are two of our favorite dishes, along with the daily specials.  Definitely a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I just realized that I have never wrote an actual review on Nick's, my favorite Phoenix spot. Maybe it's the nostalgia? I've been coming here since High School. Maybe it's the casual, family owned atmosphere? No matter which location you visit, you'll most likely see Nick checking up on things. Most importantly, it's the consistency. No matter which location you choose, it all tastes great, every time. 

For me, this is good Italian food, but in the American way. If you're looking for real Italy italian, you may choose another spot, but I find the typical Lasagna, Ravioli, Baked Zitti to be fantastic! I love their Bolognese, and if you notice on my profile, my last meal on earth would be their chicken parmesan with a side of spaghetti bolognese- each entree comes with a huge side of either fresh veggies or pasta. The portions are huge, so I love to eat some, and it's always even better the next day! Here are a few of my favorite dishes:
  
-Di Mare Salad (with grilled calamari like Gabi M says)
- Tilapia Picatta
- Chicken Ravioli (my best friend Natalie always tells me that if you get     the Chicken tortellini, you actually get more!)
-Chicken Parm (note the above)
-Baked Ziti (have them add meatballs)
-Cannoli (I'm pretty sure I could spoon feed the filling like ice cream! Was that too much?) 

Go to any one of their locations for a casual, quick Italian meal- I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow, its time I leave Five stars where it's truly due.  This place has been a staple for lunch, take out and nights out with the family since living off FLW.  Even my father cant shut up about the food, and he is next to impossible to impress(honestly dad) 
Tonight -just another 78 degree Monday night in north Scottsdale, and My hospitality senses are stimulated and amused!  Thank you to all who make it happen."}
{"text":"This location is almost completely different from other NICKS??   I wish the service was more engaging and authentic.  ??Maybe I should just stick to the one i like but it would be great to stop in at any location when I'm out and around town."}
{"text":"1st time here and this is one of my best value dining experiences in Scottsdale.  Quaint, great service, great food and reasonable prices.

Great job Nick's!"}
{"text":"Visit on Friday, 6/22
Our second visit there
Sat at the bar, good Happy Hour specials
Very good Italian food
Good service at the bar
Chicken cacciotore (sp?) is tremendous"}
{"text":"Chicken piccata is excellent.   Lots of capers.  Baked ziti is fantastic and fast friendly to go service!!  Great Italian specials!"}
{"text":"Happy to find an Italian restaurant in North Scottsdale that offers delicious cioppino.  We enjoyed the bread, aniposti misto & garlic with white wine sauce cioppino.  They offered a nice wine selection. The next time we want to try the cioppino with their red sauce.  We checked in on facebook & wanted to recommend to our friends.  Great location, great ambiance & great service.  Allison was the sweetest & helpful hostess!  We will return & continue to recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian food, by far, in the whole valley!   The manager/bartender, Jason, makes THE BEST Cosmos ever!!! (See photo) 
The hostess, Niki, is the sweetest most accommodating employee in the whole restaurant!!  
I recommend this restaurant to everybody I know!! 

Bravo!!"}
{"text":"Do you love extra mozzarella cheese? If you do, this place is exactly what you're looking for. Do you wish you could tell the pizza delivery dispatcher just how much cheese you'd really like on your pizza, but don't because they'd have to charge you for six toppings to get it right? Do you carefully separate the cheese from the pizza crust telling your companions it's the only good part anyway? Is the Mac in your home made Mac 'n Cheese just an afterthought? Are you from Wisconsin?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Nick's at Pinnacle Peak is your dream come true. Have a look at my pictures if you don't believe me. Baked ziti, barely visible under the gooey excellence of all that cheese. Chicken parm which is just an excuse as a flat object to pile on more cheese.

This Nick's is sit-down style with a full bar to whet your whistle with whatever you wish. The service was a bit slow, but entertainment is provided by people picking up furniture self-serve style from the suite next door. I went for lunch so the full-south facing windows without treatments made for a bit of glare, although the extra sun made my gobs of mozzarella glisten. Yeah, baby!

My companion ordered a soup and salad, and was pretty hungry after; the soup cup was small enough to be called demitasse. Not for the Hungry Man in your party.

A very unique experience, one to share with your cheese-lovin' friends."}
{"text":"Nick's is one if my go to Restaurants. Their food is very good and the prices are reasonable. I think, however, they can do better on the portion sizes as they run a bit on the smaller size."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is always outstanding. The service is very good as well. The atmosphere is a little bit cafeteria like but they make up for it with the food and service. Prices are reasonable. There isn't much of a waiting room so if there is a waiting list, you are standing around kind of in the restaurant. The restaurant is small so some of these things are a bit awkward."}
{"text":"Chicken Marsala and alfredo sauce were delicious, but the marinara sauce left little to be desired. I would have preferred the bread that was brought to the table to be warm or at least soft. All in all ok but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Nick's Italian is one of my new favorite little places. I have eaten there about six times. Some of their stuff is just okay, but some of it is great. The items that are great, are great enough to keep coming back. First of all, ANYTHING in the white wine garlic sauce is practically orgasm inducing! Especially the Penne a la Campagna! Penne pasta, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes combined with the white wine garlic sauce make for a fantastic combination. The marinara sauce is very tasty, conidering it seems to be very basic. The Cioppino in the WWG sauce is probably my second favorite thing. It seemed like an overwhelming avalanche of multiple sea creatures; Shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari. all over a huge portion of linguini. I also highly reccomend the baked ziti with sausage... Its hot!!!

 Nick's has a great little dinning room. Small, but intimate. Its mildly reminiscent of some of the little restaurants in San Francisco or New York that i've been to. The service is very hit or miss. It seems like the female staff is much more enjoyable, not because of their gender, but because it seems like they know HOW to be friendly and efficient. Most of the servers at Nick's seem to be overworked, as they always rushing and and sometimes it takes longer then it should to be greeted. While there is one male server whos section i refuse to sit in, most of the other servers do a great job."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent menu choices. The restaurant was a little too tightly packed for my taste. For the quality of food they served, I would have expected a nicer restaurant. It was a little small and plain but still a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"Consistently good Italian food. Reasonably priced wine.  Love the antipasto misto."}
{"text":"Very good dinner...the Chicken Alfredo was outstanding and your always in good shape starting with a Moretti"}
{"text":"How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between \"parmesan\" and \"parmagiana,\" so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?)

\"Parmagiana\" is a style of cooking. \"Parmesan\" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti.

God! People can be so stupid."}
{"text":"Saw this on our way home today and decided to stop in - not a lot of stuff in the little strip mall so I assumed it was just a pizza place.

Boy was I wrong. As soon as you walk in the door you see that it's a little more special than 'just another pizza place'. It's clean and cozier than I expected from the outside. My husband ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered Chicken Ravioli. Their pastas are handmade (I didn't review the entire menu close enough to see if they all are, but there was quite a good selection of home made pasta).

The garlic bread is VERY yummy, I had a piece while we waited for dinner and then used a couple more to schmutz around in the pink sauce served with my ravioli.

Our waiter was Anthony - and he looked like he was from New York for sure! He was very polite, he and the other gentleman were very attentive. There was a cute blonde gal working tables, too, she was a little chatty for me - just when I was ready to point out how chatty she was to my husband she started talking about how good the pizza was at some other restaurant.

Then she mentioned that their pesto was better than \"ours\". Um. . . . Really? Then she mentions something about another restaurant to yet another table before we left this evening. I neglected to do my Review from the restaurant, so I forgot what that particular subject was about. Quite annoying to hear the wait staff discuss what they like about another restaurant, over THEIR restaurant..... especially annoying when it's the same food type as the one that they work in.

Nonetheless, we loved Nick's and will be going back. Maybe next time we'll try their pizza, I've ready a couple of reviews about how good it is."}
{"text":"In the 13 years that we've been going to Nick's, every visit has been perfect!  Perfect food, perfect service, perfect atmosphere! By far my favorite Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are obsessed with this place! It is our new \"go-to\" dinner spot when we feel like being a little fancier.

I have to admit that it's always looked on the more expensive side from appearance-sake but when we finally opted in, the price was incredibly reasonable! Most of the pastas and bread are handmade in the restaurant and well worth the extra calories. My favorites thus far are the chicken fettuccini with alfredo sauce and chicken and spinach tortellini in a rose sauce. The tiramisu is also massive!

The staff is super friendly and checked in every time my glass got below 1/4 full. They were also helpful when making recommendations."}
{"text":"The customer service is terrible here! The food was also terrible! We will never go here again and would not recommend you to come either. The manager was very rude."}
{"text":"This place is my all-time favorite Italian food, nothing like the sauteed veggies if you love garlic, and I so do! Service has always been impeccable. Discovered Nick's in the hideaway on Frank Lloyd Wright before they even had a liquor license, a tip from my New York City boss and his wife! That should tell you something about how good the food is. We love the Pima location, a bit more elegant, very relaxed, we just love Nick's!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty, slow service, I've had better food out of a can! And so busy. Obviously we don't get it and or have been spoiled by fresh quality ingredients all over town."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Nicks last night.  We had claims, Lasagna, wine, coffee and tiramisu.  Here is the bad then the good news:

Bad News:

The bread is the worst I have ever had in an Italian Restaurant.

My wife's water tasted like Vinegar.  After complaining to the server, they found that the water had been contaminated by white vinegar.

My wife and I both woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pains, probably due to the clams.

The Good News:

Lasagna was good as was the coffee and tiramisu.  

Thanks to Groupon we saved $40.

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite of ours. For years, they've been consistent with their food and service. Jason, behind the bar, makes our experiences extra special with his attentiveness and charm. Give this place a try when you're passing by. And get the grilled calamari. Just trust me on this."}
{"text":"I went to this place with low expectations and was clearly dissapointed. the staff was nice and the place was fine but at the end of the day the food is what matters. 

We got bread which was a nice touch, something many restaurants have done away with as far as the whole white table cloth setting but the bread here was good. The appetizers were typical but fine but the entrees really dissapointed. 

We ordered the seafood ravioli and it was just a mess. The filling tasted like it had come out of a can that had been in the fridge too long. It was a mush where you couldn't taste any of the seafood but more of a grainy watery filling. 

The kitchen was closed or I would have sent it back. Sorry for the review, nice people but the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"First time coming here for lunch. Its very small, (15 tables?) but comfortable and classy. The service was great and my chicken fettuccine was delicious. My portion size was fantastic for the price. I'm stuffed. I really wanted to try the chocolate chip connoli too, but I'll have to roll outta here.  I'll definitely be coming back for that"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to a Groupon and all I can say is wow!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely delicious. Fresh pastas and ingredients and their pink sauce is soo Good!  We had the mushroom ravioli , the veal parmigian with a side of homemade pasta, a caprese salad and everything was outstanding! The tiramisu is also a must so make room for it! Service was friendly! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and a Groupon brought us in on a busy weekend night.  The place was packed to the gills, the several outdoor \"patio\" tables also full.  We were told 10 minutes wait.  20 minutes later we were still standing (no available chairs to wait in) against the wall.  (If the Groupon wasn't expiring, we would have left.)  Servers were desparately trying to navigate the tables and the crowded entrance to serve the patio area.  I admired the fact that most still continued to smile in the face of such a crowd.  Finally we were seated in a high traffic area, our chairs were continually bumped with each passing waiter or guest.  This was not fun or relaxing.

About the food.  Definitely not worth the wait.  We both had salads (because the pasta dishes do not come with any sides).  The wedge salad was covered with bleu cheese dressing, w/ sliced tomatoes and onions on the side.  House salad had a very nice balsamic dressing but the salad was 1 kind of lettuce & a couple cuke & tomato slices - we were not impressed, esp. for the price.  Penne Alla Campagna sounded good w/ spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms & chicken - but it was somewhat bland, chicken was tough.  Lasagna didn't fare much better on our table.  

I wonder if the experience might have been different on a less busy night.  If they are always this busy, then I guess they won't miss our business.  With all the many choices in Italian, we won't be returning to Nick's."}
{"text":"I visit Nick`s quite frequently for Happy Hour and Dinner. The staff is always very polite and the atmosphere is always very relaxing and welcoming. We usually sit at the bar when we visit, the bar staff is simply AWESOME. The Happy Hour selection Drink and Food is wonderful. If you like Shrimp, the HH Shrimp with Spicy Marinara is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Nick's is a solid Italian restaurant located in the Whole Foods strip mall. I have sought them out for take out several times, but just recently dined in. 

The place is small and cozy and there is a separate bar area and a nice patio. 

The food is good, not amazing, but definitely worth the price.

Things I have tried that I would recommended:
Chicken Tortellini: chicken, spinach, pink sauce (which is a vodka sauce)
Mushroom Ravioli with pink sauce
Butternut Ravioli in a garlic butter
Calamari
Antipasto Salad
They also have a decent wine selection

The servers have always been prompt and attentive

While this isn't a place I would drive and seek out if you live in the neighborhood it is a great weekday \"go to\" and has made it in my rotation when I don't feel like cooking. 3 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually go to Nick's, he instead came to me. I used Nick's for a company catering event today, and ordered 3 things: the meat lasagna, the chicken risotto, and the pasta bolognese. All 3 of them were delicious. The meat lasagna went so fast, we ran out of that before we even got into the second pan of risotto or pasta bolognese! It was meaty and hearty and everything a lasagna should be. We also got the spinach salad that was supposed to have cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon on it, but someone in the kitchen was a bit stingy with the cucumbers, tomatoes and bacon. They also brought sliced french bread that I used to sop up my meat sauce and it was the epitome of comfort food. Overall I really enjoyed the food, and would definitely go there on my own."}
{"text":"Nick's saved the day before baby Jesus's birthday!

We'd had a leisurely xmas eve full of working out, breakfast tacos and going to the movies. Suddenly, it was that late-afternoon/early-evening time (around 4:45-5:00) and we found hanger levels quickly approaching. We had planned for  a Christmas Eve feast at Oregano's like last year, but those assholes decided to give their employees an extra holiday day off. What is this, communist Russia?

So we drove aimlessly and tried to figure out who the heck was open on December 24. As we rounded the bend of FLLW Blvd. I remembered my old coworkers used to love coming to Nick's for their lunch special, and that we were in close proximity of the place. Boyfriend gave them a quick call to see if they would be open and sure enough, they would be until 9:00 p.m. DONE.

We were one of only about three other tables in the place when we got there, but like I said it was a weird \"very early-bird diner\" time. Had we eaten at a regular time, we'd have to wait, as I saw each and every table fill up in our time dining (and a line forming!--make a reservation if you want to eat at a \"normal\" dinner time.)

We split lots of things, because hey, holidays, fat, lazy, etc. We started with the bread basket, using the garlic and rosemary (!!) infused olive oil on the table for dipping. I could have made a meal out of the garlic knots in the basket and that godly oil. Perfection. Next was the bruschetta, because carbs are what baby Jesus wants us to eat. Their version uses tomato, onion, capers, black olives and with a shake of parm and a drizzle of aforementioned EVOO, it was outstanding.

We decided to be bad and each order a pasta dish, plus a small Mediterranean pizza. I KNOW. WHO CARES. I'M WORKING OUT LOTS LATELY. I opted for the penne carciofi, which had an abundant amount of artichoke chunks dispersed throughout the pasta, all covered in a bright, lemony white wine sauce. It was absolutely delicious, and when the sauce was scooped up with the bread? DONE. BF got the fettuccine with homemade sausage that came with peppers, onions and a marinara/wine sauce and said it was outstanding. The Med pizza had all the standards: kalamatas, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, arti's, feta. It was tasty, don't get me wrong--but to be honest, the pasta was the star of the show. We both said that we need to come back to try EVERYTHING on the menu. The only thing I would have liked more was an offer for cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper , but to be honest, we were so busy hoovering our food that we didn't even ask for these...I'm sure they are available.

Service was good. I don't know why but I was absolutely chugging water that evening, which I try not to do in restaurants, but both our server and the busser/food runner were quick with refills. Our server's name was Tony and he looked like a tiny Soprano's extra. Glorious. Like I said, the place was absolutely packed when we left, so Nick's knows what they are doing. We will soon be part of the wait crowd!"}
{"text":"This review is only for Nick's on Tatum Blvd.  This place is real small and very dark.  You will need a flashlight to read the menu if you come in after dark.  We had a groupon so we went to this location and I was very disappointed.  I ordered the Linguine with eggplant and chicken, when they brought it out, it was a very small dish and I thought they made a mistake giving me the lunch portion, but they said no it was a dinner portion.  very very small portion and I was still hungry afterwards.  Also they do not make their cheesecake in house they buy in from someplace else and it was over 50 ingredients in which are all genetically modified.  Cheesecake can be made simply with 4 or less ingredients... The food is just average at this location.  There are many other Italian places in town which are far better."}
{"text":"This review is only for the location on Frank Llyod Wright.  This location is the main one, which the owner frequents most often.  It is open and very light.  Everyone sits at a table, there are no booth and no bar.  The food here is a bit better then the location on Tatum.  The pizza is a great price.  Large cheese pie is less than $13.00...the sauce is  a tad salty but if you ask them to put extra basil on the cheese it lessens the taste of the salt.  The pasta here is better than the other location and the wait staff it good.  There are many other places to eat Italian food in the area, but this place is good with the same crowd coming in day after day.  The meatball subs and seafood pasts dish are pretty tasty.  Great inexpensive place for linch."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was fresh, but nothing to rave about. Way too overpriced for the size of the portions. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Cane here with the gf tonight and had the spaghetti and meatballs. Normally I would never get something so generic, but she wanted to try it lol so I let it happen. I love this place, but I wasn't a huge fan of this dish. I've had a lot of spaghetti in my day, so it's hard to top that many dishes. At any rate, I will be going back to try a signature dish. Who knows, the next time could change this 4 into a 5 star."}
{"text":"My friend Joan was going to meet me at Nourish123 in Scottsdale on Monday, but luckily, we both noticed that it's closed on Monday so we ended up meeting at Nick's at Tatum and Shea.  We go where we have groupons, etc. and she had one to try it out.

I can honestly say that I was quite happy and surprised when I showed up first and saw a sign outside of the restaurant which said they were featuring a gluten free pizza for less than $10!  I was all set to just have a salad but this changed my mind.........since I figured an Italian place would have great pizza!

I entered the restaurant and saw that I had arrived first so the Host greeted me and I told her I was meeting a friend.  She said that she'd bring her over when she got there and seated me.  She asked what I wanted to drink and left to get my Iced Tea.  She came back with the Tea and a bowl of bread, which I asked her to remove until Joan showed up.......too hard to look at something I love and can't have!

Then she informs me that they closed at 2:00 p..m.  I really don't understand why she failed to mention this to me when I sat down!  We might have decided to dine elsewhere....and before I ordered a $3 Iced Tea.  It wouldn't have bothered me to order a $3 Iced Tea if it were good but it tasted like Lipton Tea which had been in the canister for a week............you know, when it tastes like tin?

So Joan arrived and we decided to eat anyway........and I ordered the GF pizza with tomato slices, mushrooms and onion.  Joan got a bowl of soup and salad.  We chatted and waited for our food.  The pizza looked pretty decent with lots of mushrooms and veggies present but upon tasting it I was immediately aware of no spice taste.  It tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and poured it on the pizza. 

Between the pizza and the Iced Tea and them not letting us know that they closed in half an hour, I'd have to say that I would never go back or recommend the place.  When we didn't have a large enough order to even make using the groupon worth while, Joan asked for a dessert to go...and was told that there was nobody present to even prepare it, sorry!  Yeah.  I'll never go back!  That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I ran across Nicks on a whim. We actually ordered takeout. My expectations were not high with Italian takeout but we were starving and wanted delivery. We ordered spinach and chicken tortellini, chicken Alfredo, capers and cheesy garlic bread. Let me say this was the best decision I made all week. Everything was amazing. Pasta was fresh and def tasted homemade. The pink sauce was delicious and Alfredo sauce had a perfect garlic flavor. I can't wait to visit the restaurant and eat in. It's my new fav Italian spot. I do think it was a tiny bit pricey but not too bad. This is a good find. I'll be a regular because I love Italian and it's not always easy to find."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food, I had the pasta/marinara sauce with meatballs and sausage, and salad. I enjoyed it very much. Service was good too"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner at Nick's with friends.  My wife had the grilled tilapia, which was prepared nicely.  I enjoyed the Chicken Carciofi, which was excellent.  Prices are quite reasonable and the house wines are pretty darn good.  I would certainly recommend Nick's to anyone looking for value and quality in Italian food."}
{"text":"I came here on a date Saturday afternoon and have to say, this place is great!  Holy cow!  Total gem!

This place is suprisingly located in a strip mall of all things.  I walked in and really liked how the place was decorated.  Its not a huge resturant, but has a more fancy feel to it.  Not a place I would walk into with jeans on.  Classy enough to put on a nice outfit for a great experience.  (Im normally not a fancy diner, but for dates, I tend to turn it up a notch.)

I was impressed with the service that I had here.  Menu is loaded with just about any and every dish you could imagine. I like variety, and this place had it.  Our meal started off with a bread basket and some dipping oil which I liked a lot.  Server got our drinks and we took our time reviewin the menu.  I went with the Lasanga.  I think my date had the chicken parm.

Servings were nice and big!  Tasty too!  It was funny, because even though the service was great, the service was kinda funny.  Date took notice and we had a good laugh about it.  I was taking my time with my lasgana, and the server kept asking me all the time if I was done. I kept telling him \"no, I'm just a slow eater.\" Then, he would come back like 5 minutes later and ask the same thing again.  rinse, wash, repeat for the last half hour of the date.  Plus, the mexican bus boy literally stood table side to refill my beverage after I took more then 2 sips.  It was actually hysterical!  Date and I had a great chuckle over this!

Anyways, I really enjoyed my experience at Nicks.  I guess they have several valley locations, and I plan on returning.   Great place for dates, parents, or just something nice!"}
{"text":"Fresh homemade pasta! You can really taste a difference in their sauce and noodles. I was a little concerned going in because of the looks outside, It is in a strip mall and I didn't expect much. Inside was very nice however. The service staff was very friendly and the food was great. The appetizer antipasta platter was the highlight. Fresh meats, peppers, and bruchetta. The canolli's were truly the best I have ever had and they were huge! I think this is now my favorite italian restaurant. The pizza's looked really good and I will be back to try them. My daughter remarked that the capuccino that she had was excellent as well. Portions were good and I had some to bring home."}
{"text":"Wow. I was really shocked at how much I enjoyed Nick's considering it is inside a strip mall! I figured it would be more of a low-key type place, but it was really nice inside and the food was FANTASTIC. 

The only complaint I have is that every time someone opened the front door (which was frequent; the place was PACKED) it was absolutely freezing, but the restaurant was able to move us to an area away from the door and the problem was solved! 

I started with a glass of Riesling, as usual. I was happy that it was only $5 per glass versus the normal $8, and I was not disappointed with the taste. The busser immediately brought us waters and bread with dipping oil. I could have eaten it all day!!! 

I opted for something not even on the menu: Penne pasta with pink sauce (combo of white and red). It was ABSOLUTELY Delicious!!! 

The service was great, and I love that our waiter even had an accent! 

Overall, I really enjoyed Nicks and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside. Nice location. Excellent staff. I dont like leaving negative reviews, but the food was \"edible\" at best. No flavor and everything tasted like it was out of a can. I'm glad we had a groupon that someone bought us or else I would have had a tough time coughing up the $50 for dinner. Maybe it was an off night for them...who knows. Don't think we'll be going back. Try Marco's Italian bistro up the road. Great place."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!

Oh...my...gosh...Nick's Italian is incredible! I have been here 3 times now and each time my taste buds fall in love over and over again. The restaurant itself it small yet warm and inviting. Snag a booth in the back and enjoy the view of the entire restaurant while sipping some wine and eating delicious pasta! Once you sit down you are immediately greeted with warm and soft bread and olive oil; try not to spoil your dinner but it is hard not to. There are lots of great meals to choose from on the menu, but I highly suggest their pizza which has a unique flavor and the perfect amount of fresh cheese and whatever toppings you desire. I also suggest the baked ziti with the cream sauce...actually anything with the cream sauce you cannot go wrong. If you like ravioli you have to try it, the ricotta cheese is quite possibly the best I have ever had. The pasta is fresh and flavorful, the sauces are perfect and they make your food however you want it. Their salads are also very good. 

I have not had the chance to get to Nick's at happy hour, but they have great drink and food deals at the bar if that's your cup of tea. They also have good takeout service which is perfect for those nights you want a good meal but in the comfort of your own home. 

The only knock I have on this place is that due to its small size they have limited staff sometimes and the service can be a little slow....buuuuut relax, enjoy a drink, the ambiance, and have a nice night!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Nick's for years! I love the Greek salad with chicken, grilled calamari and the chicken piccata. They have several locations in the area and they are all awesome! I highly recommend this restaurant. FIVE STARS"}
{"text":"Always a good meal!  We order take out all the time and the food is always delicious! Love the grilled calamari and Greek Salad with chicken."}
{"text":"My first time here at Nick's. Excellent ambiance! Server Orlando was professional and courteous. We had tiramisu and cannoli. ''Twas awesome!!"}
{"text":"First time here, food and service was excellent. We had the the chicken Marsala and the chicken Parmesan. The chicken was tender cooked perfectly and delicious, we also had their Brussel sprouts that were sautéed in a balsamic vinegar with shaved Parmesan and garlic and it was delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We just enjoyed a delightful dinner at Nick's (Tatum & Shea). I ordered one of their specials, Seafood Rigatoni in a creamy lobster sauce. It was delicious with generous portions of shrimps, scallops, & artichokes. Our dining experience was enhanced by the cheerful, attentive service from Shelby, was was so congenial & accommodating. Her recommendation of the decadent chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream was literally the icing on the cake! A five star experience with a casual ambience!"}
{"text":"I am sorry, but I can NOT understand how this place only has 3 1/2 stars?? Unless the people reviewing think Olive Garden is Italian. I am a New Yorker born and raised, and have been out in AZ since 99, longing for a good Italian restaurant that reminds me of home... This place is it!! I moved into this area of PV in January and have been to Nick's on Tatum more than a handful of times. I can honestly say, they are consistently GREAT! Their homemade pastas are out of this world. And you gotta try their Bolognese... AMAZING. End of story! Hands down the best, most underrated, Italian joint in AZ. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I know this review sounds like I'm laying it on thick, but good food is something New Yorkers take for granted. Annnd, out in AZ, it can be hard to find, especially a place that serves great Italian. Service is great for dine-in or take out. They don't skimp on the portions either. Go to Nick's if you want to enjoy a great Italian meal... they do NOT disappoint. Trust me. Oh, and you're welcome. :)"}
{"text":"Whatever you do ... DO NOT order takeout from Nick's.  We ordered Salad, Breadsticks and Lasagna.  We specifically requested an order size that would feed 12 adults.  $160 bucks later and we had one tray of salad and one tray of lasagna.  And some breadsticks.  Outrageously expensive.  We asked multiple times if they would accommodate the amazingly lacking amount of food (btw I'm 5'9\" 165 so my complaint is reasonable).  Nothing.  Worst money/food ratio I've ever spent.   We won't ever be ordering from Nick's ever again.  The end."}
{"text":"I usually poke fun at Olive Garden as having bland food for people that have no idea what Italian food should really taste like, yet I'd still choose them over Nick's. I've read and respect the other reviews, and perhaps we just caught a bad night, but Nick's was awful. We began with a service issue however that was minor and not worth repeating. That problem would have been easily overlooked if the meal was good. Instead, we got uninspired bland food that seemed like it came right out of the jar or box. The are too many quality choices in the area or not too far from he that are much better. I would not go back to Nick's."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this restaurant and ordered food for pick up. So I'm not rating this experience on dining in. The lasagna was amazing, one of the best I've had from a restaurant. Must try if you love lasagna like I do. We also got the montebello pizza, their version of a supreme pizza on thin crust. That was tasty as well. We would definitely order food from this place again and dine in next time. The food we ordered tonight was delicious and their menu looks really good."}
{"text":"Just got finished eating at this place and what a horrible experience!  The manager was so unprofessional and didn't even try to remedy the situation. I ordered med rare salmon and it was dry and over cooked.  Our waitress Leah was also awful and I'm sorry at 5 you have only two tables.  Not to mention I eat here in a regular basis.  I will be going  to their other locations.  By the way did I mention how unprofessional the manager was, sitting at the bar flirting with a customer."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and very poor service. They don't seem to be able to handle a Saturday night in North Scottsdale. Much better choices out there"}
{"text":"Went to lunch today and had the eggplant parm. Awesome! Such a great sauce, and opted for the steamed veggies as my side. Yummers! Would recommend if you are in the area and craving great Italian food."}
{"text":"Unsure why this place is always packed and why it's Yelp ratings are so high.... We've tried it 3 separate times since it's close to our house, thinking well maybe we're not getting the right thing, but each time the food has just been mediocre. Meats in the pastas are dry/overcooked, overall the flavors are dull, underseasoned.  Dishes are overpriced for what you get. Service has also been mediocre.  Meh. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is ok...ok service, ok food, ok ambience. I have never had anything here to write home about, though it is certainly better than the likes of the Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo. They have all the things you would expect them to have from pizzas to calzones to veal piccata and chicken Parmesan. Lots of options for happy hour that are affordable. 

But nothing is great. I live really close to this location and I still have only gone here  a handful of times because nothing really makes me want to go back.  Right next-door is Iron Chef and if I want to stay local, I typically go there instead, and if I want great Italian I drive a bit further to Tutti Santi."}
{"text":"food is always good and the service is fine, the manager always makes sure we are happy. nice place."}
{"text":"I come here fairly often with my family when we're hungry for good italian food. I've tried a lot of the dishes - specials, pastas, pizzas, etc. though being a simple guy I do end up getting the chicken parm a good percentage of the time. Always tasty, super cheesy, with a nice sauce. The staff is friendly and remembers you, dine in service is nice and they're good about carry-out orders and always make sure you walk out with a side of bread with your order too. My Mom, who uses penne bolognese as her dish standard for comparing italian restaurants likes Nick's the best in the area. A good spot for sure, wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"The best. Lunch and dinner always consistent - pastas cooked perfectly. Favorites include grilled calamari, veal any way, chicken piccata, eggplant parm, clam sauce. Never had anything that was not wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm a New York guy So I know real good Italian food 
And every time I'm in the mood for authentic Italian food this is the one spot I have in mind 
This place is a must go. Great service, fun staff, and amazing food. Check them out!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food at reasonable prices. Had baked ziti with sausage and my wife had eggplant parmigiana. Nice large portions that were very tasty."}
{"text":"tiramisu!!  luckily i ordered a salad and caprase salad so i didn't feel so guity having dessert.  it was very busy when we got there so it must be a fav in the area.  the service was good.  would go back."}
{"text":"While the service was excellent and the ambience was nice, I would never go back here.  The food is HORRIBLE.  My fettuccine noodles were thick and doughy, the chicken was boiled and funky tasting and the sauce was watery and not creamy at all- no butter or cream.  My husband's Bolognese was bland and tasteless and, again, the pasta was doughy.   Olive Garden is way better than this place. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious !!!    I loved the chicken parmesan.   Actually everything is so good
at Nicks.   The salmon is also as good as it gets.   Its a small restaurant and is always
crowded.    Its one of the best chicken parmesan meals that we have ever had."}
{"text":"I love their Marsala Sauce..until tonight. The veal Marsala and chicken Marsala were terrible. The sauce didn't gave a hint of wine, was greasy, and bland. Granted this was a busy night, but if they ran out of Marsala,  then  they shouldn't offer the dish. Never again!!  
Too bad, this used to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place...We went for Happy Hour on a Saturday afternoon..Wine was great, food was delish...we had the mussels in white wine...cooked perfectly, the bread that they serve was delish as well...spaghetti and meatballs was full of flavor.
Service was very good too..
We will be back."}
{"text":"Solid. Italian staple. Low key, good food, good service. This one always has a winning vote amongst our group of friends. 

Specials of the day always recited and always delicious. 

Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Dependable neighborhood Italian fare.  Their veal Marsala is excellent.  Very good red sauce (sweet)."}
{"text":"Seriously? I didn't review this place? Oops!

I've been here twice now and must say there is some good food coming out of their kitchen. The Eggplant Parmesan has some AMAZING sauce with it unlike any I've had before. A lot of red sauces all taste somewhat similar but this is something special.

Both times I've come home with leftovers so portions are on the larger size. Complimentary bread and oil starts your meal off. Service has always been spot on.

My only major gripe about the place is the seating and size of the place. Be warned... this location is SMALL. Both times I went I ended up with ass in my face when someone sat next to me was leaving."}
{"text":"We've eaten there several times, at least once during each of our visits to Scottsdale. It's one of our favorite places to go. The food is excellent, the service is prompt and friendly and the prices are very reasonable. We love it; can't imagine anyone not having a great experience there."}
{"text":"Amazing find. The staff at nicks are all wonderful and really make you feel welcome. Jason is a great bartender as well as super friendly and knew exactly what to recommend for food and wine. The owner really made a point to make sure I had great service and made sure I loved my food :) 100% recommended for anyone looking for amazing Italian food, outstanding service and a true Italian experience."}
{"text":"Nick's is an excellent authentic Italian restaurant with outstanding food for lunch or dinner. I've dined-in numerous times, and ordered take-out repeatedly, and everything has always been consistently well prepared. This casual bistro has indoor and outdoor tables which begin to fill up at around 7p.m. on weeknights, however the professional waiters and staff are as well seasoned as the food, and are attentive and prompt. 
The Chicken Parmesan is always moist and tender, covered in wonderfully melted mozzarella cheese, and comes with a side of pasta or vegetables.  The Fettuccine Alfredo has perfectly balanced creamy Parmesan cheese sauce over wide homemade noodles. The homemade Gnocchi is one of my favorites, as well, and I love the pink sauce. For those who enjoy spicier sauces, the Pasta Arrabiata has a great blend of Italian spices and red pepper.
Absolutely everything on the menu is wonderful, from the Italian Appetizers, Soups & Salads to the Homemade Pasta, Veal, Chicken, Seafood Entrees & Specials. They even have Pizza & Calzones. For lunch, from 11 - 2, Monday-Friday, they offer the same menu, with smaller portions and prices and include hot & cold Hero Sandwiches served on fresh-baked bread.  The prices for dinner are reasonable, as well, especially since most entrees are very large! They make four traditional Italian desserts, and I chose the cannoli, which was filled with sweet Mascarpone and miniature chocolate chips, drizzled with chocolate syrup.
The restaurant is clean, health code adherences observed and evident from all A+ inspection certificates mounted behind the carry-out window. I even observed the host thoroughly cleaning the menus after each use.
They also do catering."}
{"text":"This is mediocre but decent food. Clean enough and decent service. The food lacks spice and presentation is really sloppy. Probably the best thing is the grilled vegetables. The lasagna is decent. The.coffee is insipid. I will say the location is convenient."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. The service is great and the food is consistently delicious.  Even on a night when every table was full and people were lined up out the door waiting for a table, our \"to go\" order was ready when promised and it was fresh and hot. 

If you are looking for a fantastic neighborhood Italian restaurant, this is it!"}
{"text":"Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and just the right portions.  Friendly staff and very accommodating.  I had shrimp and they were cooked perfectly and priced accordingly.  Great appetizers too.  I am going to take my family of 5 there for dinner so we will write another review soon.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I drove past this place and thought man these guys dont look like they'll be busy. I walked in on a Tuesday night at it was Packed! That was nice to see. Seems to be an authentic family and felt like a little Italy. I had the Mediterranean Pizza and the Ziti. The pizza was delicious and I was surprised. The ziti was pretty good as well. Over all I will stop by again."}
{"text":"Nick's has Portobello mushroom ravioli that can be served with their house pink sauce.  It's one of the best things I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Ordered two dishes from here on UberEats.  One of the dishes was not what we ordered.  Contacted Uber and they said we had to contact the restaurant to get a refund.  Sent the restaurant an email via their website and never got a reply.  Tried calling but they didn't answer.  Sent a second email and still no response.  Not sure why you have a \"contact us\" on your website if you're never going to reply to your costumers."}
{"text":"First date with my man here over a year ago. Still great food. Really happy with this place especially since we both are gluten free"}
{"text":"Forgot to check-in Tues 5/23 - The BEST Italian food in AZ!  It's a \"hole in the wall\" kind of place but clean and very nice actually.  This is the original location with the original chef so we love this on plus it's closest to us.  The red sauces are perfect.....the alfredo to die for!  And desserts....ok by far the best tiramisu I've ever had and my family made it often!  Great little place!!  Try it during off season or you'll be waiting lol. This is our Cheers go to local place, we dine here in average 2-4 times a month."}
{"text":"Nicks added a charcuterie and cheese board that is Great!
Paired with their amazing wine selection it hits the spot.
We also tried as appetizer before our meal and it was perfect!
Great job Nick and Jason, we appreciate you listening to you regulars and adding this offering."}
{"text":"I've been dining at Nick's for roughly seven years and I believe it is the best Italian in North Scottsdale. The Pinnacle Peak location is better than the one on FLW - it's just a little quieter and more relaxed crowd with fewer kids and better service. I'm pretty picky about my Italian, but I wholeheartedly recommend Nick's veal picatta and the caesar salad. Also, their table bread is wonderful. Will be back for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Perfect combination. I tried the special sea bass with vegetables and it was some of the best I have ever eaten. The people in our party of 14 had four different versions of their ravioli - off of which I had to sample and all very good. For a relatively small location to take such great care of a larger party line us was impressive. They really couldn't have been much nicer. Highly recommend this little gem."}
{"text":"The place has excellent Italian food and the portions are huge. We got one appetizer and one dish to split and a small salad and we had way too much food. If you are craving heavy Italian food this place will not disappoint. Service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian. Friendly staff, great Chicago style menu, fairly priced. All the people are great but we've always been partial to Orlando."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Jason has a horrible rapport and rushed us through like a herd of cattle.  Food was less than average. Service even worse."}
{"text":"Second time we tried Nick's and it was as good as we remembered.  The lobster ravioli was amazing and the gnocchi with pesto is my favorite.  Service was incredible, too, and not as pricey as some other local Italian places which is nice!"}
{"text":"The baked ziti with sausage is a good choice. Pizza is alright but you have to like a thicker and more toasted crust."}
{"text":"Solid Italian and nice takeaways. Solid service and plenty to choose from the menu. Good place to go for Italian in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Don;t bother...  on attitude alone.  Used to go there for Happy Hour which was a good deal..  and it went until 7 pm...  even better...  went this week and were told happy hour ends in 2 minutes, i mentioned the website says 6:30 and it was not quite 6 pm..  hostess says, we changed it.  I say, the website still says 6:30 pm...   She says, i will mention it to the manager.  With that kind of customer service we went next door to Iron Chef and had an amazing meal with many happy hour discounts and delightful attention.  Save your money and get more respect and better value next door at Iron Chef."}
{"text":"I like Nick's Italian. The portions are very large contrary to reviews that state otherwise. They provide bread and olive oil as a little app & we started with a salad which was large enough to feed 2 people and then take half home. I ordered the Penne Campagna and it was delicious. The Chicken Parmesan is the best and the portion is huge. We were able to eat our meals three times after taking them to go.  A little pricey but still good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude waiter. This used to be good but went downhill."}
{"text":"We are visiting from NC and look for good local restaurants.  We sure found a good one here.  Food was excellent and so was the service!  Portion sizes are big enough to share and that's what we did.  We had a Greek salad and the seafood risotto.  Both were prepared very well.  Our server was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"We used UberEATS for the first time and let me tell you, our excitement did not match our experience. I ordered the chicken alfredo for my hubby and the butternut squash ravioli for myself. It was ok tasting food. Not $40 worth of food. The alfredo is a little too gravy-like for my taste, but if you like that style you'll love it. The chicken was seasoned well. The ravioli was the most disappointing... just about 7- one bite little guys and nothing else. They were soaked in an \"ok\" butter sauce that was just too greasy. They did send the complimentary bread and it was delicious. I thought that was a nice touch despite our entrees. Will most likely try again."}
{"text":"We have been living in the neighborhood and always saw this restaurant, since they were at Grayhawk, but we never tried them. Well let me tell you .... We have been missing out BIG TIME! 
This is a great restaurant, we were seated right away, service was friendly and prompt. Everyone was so friendly and happy to be working there. Good was OUTSTANDING. Our 2 yr old loved the hand rolled fettuccini as we enjoyed other assortments. It is your typical homey Italian food .... With great service and wonderful atmosphere. We can't wait to go back and dine again as a family."}
{"text":"This is a good local place for Italian food at a reasonable price.   Had the cioppino which was more like a pasta dish than a soup, but it was good.   The minestrone soup was delicious and the bread bakery was delicioso!"}
{"text":"Great food! Love coming here at lunch because it's often not busy and you have the server's attention to yourself. Love the lunch server who's wife works at the CVS in the same strip center. He is super nice and always recognizes our family. He's super friendly to our autistic son as well even though sometimes he can be disruptive.

Evening time is often really busy. Often a long wait to be seated. Service much slower. I enjoy the experience at lunch time much more. Still awesome food though!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner. Service was excellent, food was quick and delicious. I got the lasagna... YUMMY! My husband ordered the Veal Ravioli and he loved it too..he is a very picky eater. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in at happy hour and the bartender was extremely rude. The food is mediocre and is well over priced for what you get (hence why i go only for happy hour). The restaurant is under staffed and is not very accommodating. Try Rusconi's across the street much better."}
{"text":"Nice local Italian spot. Nice daily specials. Everything is fresh and very tasty with a nice presentation. I usually stick with the chicken parmesan. The one area they need help is with their bread."}
{"text":"Nick's is local to me and I would have loved to make this a fav as I can walk to it. 
My first visit I sat in the bar after having sushi next door. This was o.k. and I may repeat this. 
However, on my next visit my friend and I tried to enjoy dinner. We were asked to sit at a smaller table outside vs. a larger table for bigger parties. Ok but when some people came in that were repeat customers and they sat at the table we wanted but there were only two, well that was somewhat rude. 
Then the waiter catered to their order and needs over ours. Such as when he did bring our food and asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese. We said yes. He then went to the kitchen and retrieved the food for his favorite customers and then brought the cheese for them and then brought it to us. Maybe they are big tippers but as someone that was looking to be a regular I may have been too. 
The food was good but for gluten free they really do not have many choices. I have been going to another restaurant in the area and they have excellent choices with better service. Unless I am dragged here again I most likely will not return for their food."}
{"text":"Nick's never disappoints!  Best Italian food restaurant in Phoenix.  The chicken and veal Parmesan are always delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm usually very picky about Italian food and I loved this place! From the service to the food and of course the 25% off wine deal (we were there on a Sunday not sure when else they have that) everything was great!  

I ordered lobster ravioli and they were amazing. It's a good thing this place is right around the corner from me because I have a big menu to get through"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with excellent service. When our 15-minute wait stretched to 20 (and beyond) the sweet hostess came over and asked if there was anything we'd like. My husband and I ordered glasses of wine (which were added to our tab). Meanwhile the kids noshed on a complimentary bread basket. The hostess kept checking in on us and letting us know the progress of our table, which we appreciated.

All of the food, though, was very bland.  I kept adding Parmesan cheese from the shaker on the table plus salt and pepper to try to doctor up my pesto pasta. My kids' alfredo was even more bland. Meatballs were terrible and mushy. I appreciate that they offer a gluten-free pasta (just fine) and gluten-free pizza (obviously made from Udi's frozen crust) but they weren't great. 

Despite living close, this was only our second time here due to an underwhelming experience on our first visit. It's just too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Still my favorite place. Can't say enough great things about it. Happy Hour is fantastic ..... it is still a hidden gem. Delicious food and the place is immaculate. If I could give it 20 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Small restaurants without 
Acoustic tile and without a private room 
Should not book large parties!!!!! Ruined my evening -,could not converse with friends 
And left with a terrible headache and a weird urge to buy earmuffs!!  Have visited both locations frequently - good food, 
Friendly and efficient staff but don't know that I  will go back again."}
{"text":"AHHHMAYYYZIIING REAL ITALIAN FOOD! I've had a little bit of everything, and it's all been delicious, it's the real deal. It's a small cute little Italian restaurant and I love the authenticity of it. As soon as you walk in you can tell the food is going to be amazing, the staff is beyond great they will go the extra mile to make sure you have a great experience. It's so close to home it's hard not to stop by."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. 4 stars only because leftovers so caked with butter I was unable to remove leftovers from styrofoam. I had to drain a solid two tablespoons of butter from microwaved leftovers."}
{"text":"hadn't been here in years and was craving italian one night, so i looked at the menu online and saw that they brought back my favorite dish (butternut squash ravioli but with pink sauce)!! i was so sad when they stopped doing it years ago so i'm super glad i happened to look at the menu on a whim that night. it was exactly like i remembered and lived up to all my high expectations, lol! all of our food was incredible and the staff was all amazing. great spot for italian food in the area and i'll definitely be going back!! would highly, highly recommend the butternut squash ravioli"}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice people, and overall good food.  The place is small, and they seem to be busy a lot so the wait times aren't great, but whenever I'm in the area, I always check them out.  I think it's their sauce, but their pizza does have a distinct flavor, which is good.  It can get a little loud in there, but I like the authentic Italian feel that it gives."}
{"text":"Not really moved by the previous negative reviews - this is an EXCELLENT Italian restaurant!  It was packed last night (4/17/15) and we were lucky to get a table immediately.  Great service - delicious  food - excellent wine. One ciopp ino and one linguini puttanesca along with a glass of Orvieto and a glass of Chianti and we were very happy people,  Portions are very large, so there was enough another meal.  All was great and we WILL be back!"}
