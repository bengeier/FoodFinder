{"text":"I used to live right across the street from Rasoee.  It was out of convenience that I ate here numerous times.  The food is mediocre and it was nice to just hop across the street when I needed my Indian fix.

The problem with this place is that it caters to the lunch crowd and therefore closes really early so even my convenient Indian place wasn't too convenient at times.  There is ample cafeteria style seating which is good for a bustling lunch crowd but I never ate at the restaurant.

The service is your typical minimum wage level customer service.  The food is pre-made and can be lukewarm at times.  The naan is delicous though but I've never had a bad piece of naan.  Mmmmm naan."}
{"text":"Went to Rasoee for lunch on July 23, 2009 with a couple of friends, and was expecting some good, hearty Indian food for a decent price.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Wrap, which cost $7.49, and a can of pop, my total came up to $9.88. It was a bit pricey for lunch, but I guess I should be used to it, having eaten downtown quite often.

The food came pretty quick, and it looked real appetizing. I decided to eat it with my hands rather than fork and spoon because it was the easiest way to eat that wrap. It was a delicious wrap, and an overall delicious lunch, but it wasn't very filling for someone who likes to eat a lot.

The service is great, everyone is friendly and courteous and the food comes real quick. If the prices weren't so high, this would be a place I would frequent more often. Cheers."}
{"text":"They're decent, but they are no Gandhi's (north side of Queen, east of Bathurst). If you are looking for lunch in the area I say Gandhi's is likely the more flavourful option. The only problem is you have to call in advance. 

If you can't be bothered, Rasoee is still good. They're quick too."}
