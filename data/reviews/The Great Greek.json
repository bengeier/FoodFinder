{"text":"I agree- Finally a good Greek Restaurant on this side of town!! The Gyros were huge, and delicious! The service was was impeccable; very friendly and definitely pride in ownership. The \"Family Packs\" are a great deal- I can see gyros for dinner once a week...!"}
{"text":"I live many miles away, but I returned today for the third time. Simply delicious. Friendly service. Generous portions. Surprisingly pleasant patio seating, too, given that the restaurant is in a strip mall. Go there. You will love it."}
{"text":"Deserves every star . Hands down the best and freshest Greek food EVER . You gotta try it !!! Try the feta fries . Yum"}
{"text":"Glad  they finally have a location near me . The food is incredibly fresh and great tasting . The BEST gyros in Las Vegas hands down . Prices are very fare when compared . The owner and staff really do care. A must try ."}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was good, the feta fries were the best, end it out with a baklava you have a very good lunch destination. Gets a little crowded around lunch time, but it's your Greek eatery they are normally smaller in size. Try to beat the lunch rush so you don't have to wait for a table or sit outside."}
{"text":"We were greeted by the owners immediately upon arrival. We ordered the bowls one with falafel and the other with shrimp. I saw a tray of spanakopita coming out of the oven and had to try it. Sitting on the patio they brought out the appetizer.  Fantastic!  The bowls came before we could finish. Fresh, Beautiful, Delicious food. The shrimp were large and grilled to perfection.  The wifes falafel was cooked perfectly.  The taziki was amazing the julienned cucumbers made it pop! Too bad this is 2000 miles from home.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never tried something I didn't love here. Delicious food, great staff, large portions!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Henderson after a day at Bryce Canyon. We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn and we quite hungry. Thanks to Yelp I spotted great reviews for this Greek Restaurant which turned out to be across the street. We came to the little restaurant that had some tables inside but chose to sit outside as it was on the cooler side inside. My 2 children ordered the large Greek salads that came with hot, toasted pita wedges. My husband and I each ordered the chicken souvlaki platter that came with small Greek salads, rice pilaf and the pita wedges. The chicken was really flavorful and my picky 17 year old proclaimed, \"that's the best chicken I've ever tasted!\" The salads were delicious and very crisp and fresh! My daughter also ordered a baklava for dessert to eat back at the hotel and it was gobbled up. ( she loved it and normally doesn't like nuts). We loved our meal and wish they were by our home in Phoenix. I also have to add that the woman who took our order was super friendly and cheerful. The food was quickly served nice and hot!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is the best greek food in Henderson, probably Las Vegas as well. I always order the chicken souvlaki; their greek salad is my favorite part. My girlfriend gets the Pastitsio. Both are delicious.   The only downside- there is often a wait for take out, usually takes 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The food at The Great Greek is incredible and the service is even better! Jack has to be one of the best customer service guys I have ever seen. He made sure he greeted everyone as they came in and was always checking on all the customers. Top notch!! This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for the whole family and fabulous service every time I have gone which ends up being about once a week.  Haven't had a bad thing there ever"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh, flavorful Greek food.....look no further. This is without a doubt the best I have ever eaten. There is nothing on the menu that I didn't enjoy. I have been going there since it opened and it pleases me to see they are getting the recognition they deserve. Jerry and his mom Alice are always gracious as well as all of the other counter staff. I return as often as possible."}
{"text":"Before going to The Great Greek I thought I knew what a good gyro was. As it turns out, I didn't know jack.   Their gyros have incredibly moist and tender meat, crisp veggies, yummy tzatziki and blanket soft pita bread. The feta fries are a great mix of crunchy, salty and tangy. Their rice bowls are really good too!   If you come during busy times, you may have trouble finding seats. It can get packed as they only have limited seating inside. They do have an outdoor seating area but it's probably not the best during the summer. You know, Vegas heat.   They have the whole Greek vibe going with the music and decor. You can call in orders for pick up as well. Friendly service every time.   It's probably a good thing that they're not too close to where I live or work, otherwise I'd find myself there three times a week!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place regularly.  They have even catered a couple of events for me.  I have to say that it is the authenticity of the food and the service we get from Gerry that keep us coming back here!  You have to go at least once...You will be hooked!"}
{"text":"Let's just say I could be in trouble as this place is basically right across the street from my house.  So I might be spending a lot more time there soon.    Went there for the first time today for lunch.  I had the chicken souvlaki plate which came with either french fries or rice, Greek salad, Tzatziki sauce and pita bread.  I choose the french fries for my plate.  I love it that I have choices on what sides I want on my plate.    It came with 2 skewers of chicken with like 6 pieces on each. The chicken tasted great and was cooked prefect.  The side Greek salad was real fresh with plenty of veggies and tasted real good.  The french fries were cooked prefect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Tzatziki sauce was fantastic almost as good as my mom's.  The pita bread came out nice and warm and tasted good too.  I asked for extra onions on my salad and on the side which they gladly gave me no extra charge.  The plate cost $12.95 so price was not too expensive for all the food you get.  There was plenty of condiments, napkins and etc on the counter and on the tables. It was enough food to keep me full all day.  The guy that took my order was real nice and answered all my questions.  The food came out pretty quickly and looked nice.  The place was real clean plenty of different seating areas.  I will be back for sure as a matter of fact thinking about going there for lunch tomorrow already."}
{"text":"The feta fries were delicious! The pita was soft and complimented the gyros perfectly."}
{"text":"Was craving the (gyro) sandwich and went here to get the (gyro) plate.Have got the plate before and it was good? This time i went for lunch alone and got the plate to go with extra pita. Got home and the Gyro was plain? (no veggies)  I mean onions or tomatoe? Who makes a Gyro like that ? or do you have to ask for onion and tomatoe..I thought that was part of the sandwich..Very disapointed..I have to say the youg man at counter was polite and opened the carry out box for me to see before leaving , I assumed that the veggies were buired in there some were, so i took it. If the Owner was on top of the Kitchen stsaff (instead of hugging the guest in the dinng room) and making small talk, The food woould be on point all the time ? Not hit and miss  $10 is alot for lunch to get a Partial sandwich. I noticed the other times i came here and the (owner) was in the Kitchen the orders came out correct."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Greek food and this place was great.  I had the Gyro plate and it was too much to eat in one sitting.  My wife enjoyed the Chicken Souvlaki and the kids had chicken skewers.  Nobody left the place hungry.  Get there early though because the restaurant isn't very big but it was packed at 6PM on a Tuesday.  We ordered some baklava to go for later that night and it was awesome.  I really like baklava but am often disappointed at restaurants because the phyllo is soft and mushy because it has been sitting around too long.  The phyllo in this baklava was light and crisp and the filling was so sweet, even maybe too sweet if that's possible.  If you are looking for good food in Henderson you can't go wrong with The Great Greek."}
{"text":"I discovered the Great Greek about 3 months ago and have been back every week since.  Easily the best Greek food I have found in Las Vegas, and possibly even the US.  Every dish is outstanding, and the specials are always great as well. 4 to 5 star presentation and taste and 2 star prices.  Definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very small place but the food was amazing! People were very friendly and service was great. Prices were very good and portions were large."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! I had the hummus and pita bread, which were both perfect. I also had the greek bowl with falafel and it was the best falafel I've had since getting the real deal in Cairo. The bowl was huge, enough for 2 people. I loved the dressing they used, very simple, but great flavor!   The only downside it the lengthy wait to get your food, but for this freshness and quality I will gladly wait! They did bring out the hummus quickly though, so we had something to snack on at least."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek food I've had in the valley, and anywhere else for that matter. I've never been to Greece though. Limited menu compared to most Greek restaurant's, but everything on the menu, and I've tried 98% of it, has amazing flavor! Fresh ingredients, good size portions packed full of meat and not just a salad on a pita. Prices are comparable to any other place, but worth every penny. The staff push this place over the top! You can definitely see and feel in their demeanor and attentiveness that they care about their product and are appreciative of your business. Can get packed during peak hours, but worth the wait. Closed on Sunday's, but I'm cool with that. It's sooo good, I'm salivating writing this review! Make sure you live near by because once you try them, you'll drive completely across town to get your fix, no joke."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, but great find.  Food is always fresh, and the feta fries are amazing!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food. Always busy and the service is exceptional. Fresh vegetables and meat cooked to order. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why it has taken me so long to review The Great Greek, we first ate there probably close to 6 months ago. We were in the process of buying a new car at the nearby auto mall and came here on our \"solo\" test drive. I guess they were really close to closing for the night, but one of the workers saw us at the door and came over to let us in. Once we got our food, it was so delicious! The staff is very nice and helpful and the place is also very clean. I will definitely try this place again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! The owners are really nice and the food is delicous. This is one of my favorite places to go with my husband."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. Great service, even though it gets crowded. Still pretty quick. Food is fresh and delicious. Love the gyro, and the skewers. Oh yeah, get the Feta Fries!!!  Yum!  My GF who never liked Greek food loves it here. Regulars now."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is a clean, well established semi-fast food eatery. The owner and workers are extremely professional and very friendly. The food is always prepped with high standards with top notch, hand-selected produce. I usually get either of beef/lamb Gyro, chicken plate, Salmon plate and their feta fries. One of the biggest things here is consistency and quality. A lot of other stores start lowering their quality once they have established their customer base, but i have been coming to this place for the past 2.5 years and they have always been top notch."}
{"text":"We are happy that we found this place! When my mom in law is in town she likes to eat there. We get the hummus, yummy, gyros. The staff is always great."}
{"text":"A little expensive but the food was good.  I would go to again but would definitely share a plate as the portions will serve two for lunch.  Yes it was my first visit.  My friend took me as I didn't even know you were located there."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way back from Hoover dam. Friendly spot. Generous portions of Greek salad. Tasty gyros. Loved the feta fries!"}
{"text":"Always amazing and always quality.  These guys really care about their business.  They go above and beyond to make sure the food is right, that you get what you want in a very clean and friendly enviroment.  We go all the time and will continue to do so"}
{"text":"Awesome crew! Direct, but friendly. The food was excellent. I got the large Greek salad with two sides of the gyros.   I wish they had more space to hold more tables. Seeing them do so well on Yelp I am sure they will be expanding in the future."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town my family and I drive from Summerlin to this location the staff is friendly and the food is outstanding very busy around lunchtime which proves the great food here will be back very soon."}
{"text":"best place ever. gerry get to class at the pit vegas!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite greek restaurant in Vegas. Easy take out and great service!"}
{"text":"Date night with the kids, they were hungry so we had to stay close to home and it could not be a huge wait... I yelped (thank you yelpsters for all of your continued help!) and found The Great Greek... not the one I keep reading about on your way to Cali that makes me drool just from the descriptions... but there's a NEW ONE here in Henderson on Warm Springs!!  Immediately I begin talking the 8 year old (newly picky eater) into the fabulous foods that await him, and my hubby and I repeat lines back and forth of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' (oh, if only you knew how close this is to our lives!) including \"YOU DON'T EAT NO MEAT! That's okay, I cook lamb for you.\"    We get there and there is not an empty seat in the house, and you can smell the goodies from the kitchen, and they have the desserts right by the cash register to get your saliva flowing!  We ordered the \"Family of 4 Platter\"  (approx $45) and as our luck would go, as we filled our glasses, a table opened up!    Almost immediately the salad showed up, simple with bright flavors that totally complimented one another, that even the 4 year old inhaled (and he is strictly a carbs/sugar kind of kid!)  Then the platters came out, and kept coming!  We had ordered a huge platter of the BEST french fries I think I have ever had, seriously! And then 4 heavenly Gyro's (2 chicken, 2 lamb/beef) on \"MELT IN YOUR MOUTH\" soft pita's, seasoned to perfection and oh so tender, and topped with the best goodies... and HUGE, did I mention how HUGE everything is?  To top it all off we had 4 desserts that came with the platter, so we tried multiple Baklava and Shamali, that with one bite made our eyes roll back and a low \"ummmmm\" sigh release from the adults at the table!  The food was beautiful, and tasted amazing.  What a treasure to have here in our little valley, that I KNOW we will visit often.  My husband is amazing at packing in the food, and even he stopped 3/4 of the way and said he was done, he was so stuffed!   KUDOS to The Great Greek!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek never disappoints. The food is excellent--I recommend the classic greek salad with added chicken kabob--and the employees are always friendly. Never had a bad meal there in the 2+ years I've been going regularly. A must-stop for fans of Greek cuisine, whether you're a local or just stopping by!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mediterranean food, I love to seat on the patio and enjoy the rice bowl with shrimp and falafel. The baklava is to die for..."}
{"text":"Best Greek food, in town. I live on Ft. Apache and Blue Diamond, and I will gladly drive to this place for the best gyro in town. The food couldn't be fresher and the tastier, it is literally perfect. After having married into a Greek family, I can say, without a doubt, this is the best Greek food, I can eat, outside of homemade that meets all the requirements for true, fresh, Greek cuisine. Just writing this, makes me wanna drive down and eat it, again!"}
{"text":"Best place on town.  Everything on this'd u is good. The owner is nice and runs the front counter. Sitting outside right now enjoying the fountains and good food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and normally have had wonderful service and food, but after tonight I don't think I will ever go back.  Three of us walked in and saw an open table and one of us sat down.  We were rudely kicked out of that table to accommodate another party that was ordering right a head of us.  One person of that party  had already sat down at another table and they were in the process of ordering.  Our party was in line to order behind them.  The staff RUDELY told us we couldn't sit there because we hadn't yet ordered (as mentioned our party was in line waiting to order next).  Both parties were 3 people and we were told to sit at a small table for 2 so the other party could have the bigger table.  It was made to be a huge rude deal.  I've never been treated so rudely at any restaurant.  If seating is that important here maybe they should get a hostess to seat you.  We walked out and I doubt we will be back.  What a disappointment.  They just lost the 3 of us and all our friends that have been coming here for years!  I see they are building a new restaurant on the SW side and I was going to recommend it to all my friends over there, but not after tonight!"}
{"text":"I ordered the gyro for $5 (only from 3-5 pm) and it was the most amazing gyro I have ever had. AMAZING. I was so very full afterwards. The price for the quality was absolutely delightful.  There was lots of feta cheese which I loved. Might i mention the feta fries were exceptionally YUMMY. Unfortunately and sadly enough, I was too stuffed to finish them. Doesn't mean I didn't keep trying! So many fries and so delicious. The melted cheese on top was perfect.   Might I mention their service was some of the best. The lady at the front is so sweet. I once called and asked if it was possible to make a gyro bowl in  5 minutes and I don't know how they did it, but THEY DID IT! Love this place!!!!!! I give the gyro 5 stars! I still have yet to try any other dishes. BEST GYRO I'VE EVER HAD."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've had in Vegas (or Henderson). The food does not disappoint. I haven't had anything bad from here. they make the gyro well with good tatziki and perfect gyro meat. Even the side salads are authentically Greek tasting with a kalamata garnish. Worth visiting. The service is usually pretty slow, and it's obviously a family joint, as I always see the mother and son arguing. Other than that, it's a good one!"}
{"text":"finally i found a greek restaurant in town that i can love. the service was excellent. the food, great. i got the gyro combo with fries and side salad! yum!  i ordered a chicken souvlaki (a side for $3.00) and got a small chicken breast instead , dont get me wrong! it was delicious! i just thought it was way too expensive for the size i got. i want to go back soon! oh, and very clean! great job guys!"}
{"text":"The GREAT Greek is worthy of its name would love to have this restaurant near me! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place was filled with huge delicious plates and great customer service!  The gyro plate, the salad and rice bowl, and the gyro wrap were enormous. We were barely able to eat half, but we wish we could have eaten more because it was amazing.  The gyro was well done, sliced thin with no fat, and the pita was light and fluffy. I decided to have the rice pilaf with the gyro plate instead of fries, and I would highly recommend it. The gyro plate and gyro wrap both came with Greek salads which were filled with a lot of veggies, olives and feta.  I have had a lot of Greek salads, but this had to have been one of my favorites.  While we were eating, a gentleman at the table next to us said that the food is always amazing and that he had even had them cater for him.  In addition to the delicious food, the woman we ordered with was extremely friendly and added to our experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I split the gyro and the chicken plate. Everything was amazing and the prices are really reasonable for the amount of food you get. I had a glass of wine with dinner as well and I think we only spent around $25 or $30. We were going to save some for leftovers but ended up eating everything because it was so good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Greek food.  I eat Greek food quite often because I grew up on it so I do know the usual spots on California to go for great Greek food, so The Great Greek was a surprisingly good find for when I'm in Nevada."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is an outstanding choice for anyone who likes great food.  I guess if you're Greek it is just a bonus.  The food is tremendous, their soup is really good, their fries are some of the best in town and I just had their chicken sandwich with feta cheese and spinach and it was very good, and very filling as well.  If you have never been here, you'll want to come back before you leave.  Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I thought the flavors were great the food was very fresh and homemade the Falafel was moist and tasty smooth and not gritty I was very happy and impressed to eat here the only downside I would say what's the price a little on the expensive side for what kind of food you get that's still relatively worth it"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in the area. They have the best Greek salad and I especially like it with steak. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Simply the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas! I tried pretty much everything from the dips to the baklava (dessert)!  But what keeps bringing me back (aside from the outstanding service, is the gyro and my favorite menu item, the rice bowl . The produce is super fresh ,the dishes are so tasty and they are extremely generous with the portions for the price!!  That makes this place one of my top restaurants in town.  What makes a good dinning experience is also the service .The owner is really  sweet, always smiling, running everywhere to make sure every customer is happy.  Great Greek is the way to go!!! Two thumbs up !!!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is a great casual restaurant for a get together with friends. All of their items are super delicious, but my favorite is the gyro platter! I've been coming here since opening day, and any time I'm in Henderson, I'll definitely be back. Their service is a little slow (as in you should probably sit down and eat in) so if you were hoping for a fast in and out joint, this place might disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So are the best gyros and definitely the best feta of fries. The guys behind the counter are great help. There's always an older man an older lady around the dining area every time I go. I think they must be the owners. They walk around asking us how was everything. And is there anything they can do to make our experience better. It's a feel-good place."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service sucks! I ordered two items for to-go during lunch time. A party of 7 people came after me and they got their food first. I ordered the same thing. When I approached the cashier/waiter/busser, the bald guy, he gave me an attitude. I asked what was taking long and his remark was (it's only been 18 minutes). The cooks heard him and looked at me from the window. The other lady worker apologized. I wanted to ask the bald guy how long his lunch break was and if he could scarf down the food in 12 minutes.   Update: I went back 8/3/17 and the service was amazing and dinner was awesome. Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Writing this as I wait for my son to finish up his meal here. I couldn't leave without making sure to say just how fantastic this place is! The menu has a nice variety and makes it easy for vegetarians & vegans with little symbols on their items. Staff were all friendly and knowledgeable. The restaurant is clean & tidy and they have plenty of seating, including an outdoor patio. Our table tried the Greek salad, a falafel pita,the mezze plate (enough for two to share or one as a meal if you want to try a bit of everything vegetarian) and the baklava. We had zero complaints and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Henderson has some pretty stiff competition in a very small area: Kyklos, Greek Bistro and The Great Greek. Personally I prefer Greek Bistro and Great Greek because Kyklos is good and priced around the same as the other two but sits in the Galleria mall so my mindset is fast-food Greek.   Where to start! The hummus and pita was very enjoyable, great flavors and not overpowered with lemon as some other places do. The chicken and steak shewers with rice & salad were incredible. The steak was nice and tender, the rice was perfect and the salad had a perfect blend balsamic vinegar dressing. The chicken gyro was quite tasty but thought it had a tad bit too much tzaziki sauce. I walked away so stuff that I was popping Tums later that night but that experience hasn't prevented me from wanting more. The cashier was incredible, which I'm sure was probably the owner or owner's wife. Oh bring a jacket because I was freezinggggggg while we ate so the food got cold, thus the reason for knockin off a star.  Great place for Greek food but I like how there's the Greek triangle near the Galleria mall. If you don't like this place, try Kyklos in the mall or Greek Bistro by Sunset!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area,been here for about 4 months and have used yelp as a resource for eats. I decided to finally give great Greek a try and I've had Mediterranean food, I never had gourmet Gyro like this before. The lamb beef combo is tasty with the sauce and Greek yogurt,fresh  veggies. Quite the treat for under $13..I will definitely come back to try the lamb chops and hummus."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! And Momma's rice pudding... Good god! Never not get the rice pudding!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! All that I expected from a gyro combo and more. The Greek salad had lots of flavor and generous amounts of veggies & feta. I highly recommend the feta fries. They are delicious! The customer service was excellent & very inviting. We'll def be back for more Greek goodies."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tasty.  We wish they expanded their menu.  The Great Greek should offer Lamb dishes to be authentic."}
{"text":"The Great Greek has gotten \"too great\" and now it's so swarmed with people at lunch that the wait is 20-25 minutes and there's no place to sit when your food is finally ready.  I went in at 1:30 pm thinking I'd miss the \"lunch rush,\" and it was still jammed with people. Don't get me wrong, their food is superb-- the rice bowl is delicious-- and the staff is super. The young man and young lady who wait tables are both very cordial, but it's still a ONE STAR for OVER-CROWDING.  The food doesn't matter when it takes 25 minutes to be served and only a half-hour lunch break."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service from the young man and woman taking orders and waiting tables. Loved it all."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is as good as it gets. The food is amazing. Fresh, perfectly prepared, and huge portions. They also have a nice selection of beverages in addition to the everyday fountain drinks and iced tea. I bring the family often and get the family meal. We are a family of 5 and we always have tons of leftovers. My only complaint would be the small dining area. It's pretty small and there aren't too many options for parties of 3 or more. We have had to leave several times because there was nowhere to sit. Not much they can do about that since a crowd means customers, and they can't exactly make more room. Overall, fantastic food, and great service. I dream about the feta fries."}
{"text":"If you read no further, try the Feta Fries!  Cute and Clean little neighborhood restaurant. Menu is easy to follow and service was pretty good. Even though the manager was visibly stressed due to having to correct the kitchen staff on an order before us, she still greeted us at the register politely and with a smile! Picked our order up to-go and the place was still busy at 7:45pm! The to-go portions are huge, neatly packed, but it would be nice if they had included napkins. I would highly recommend trying the Feta Fries!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place while visiting from Portland, Oregon, after reading some great reviews. We were looking for something quick, delicious, and light since we were in town for a race and didn't want to eat typical \"travel food\". This place did not disappoint. I'm not a Greek food connoisseur but we have some pretty amazing restaurants back home, so I feel like I have enough street cred to say this place was amazing.   We had dolmades, chicken souvlaki, greay gyro, and some baklava. Yum, yum, yum. Moist and tangy dolmas. The chicken was just the right amount of salty/seasoned, and it was moist and tender! The baklava was perfect. Ooey gooey, sweet, and flaky on top. Not rich, just perfect.   Staff was friendly, too! Great service. HUGE servings. We were hungry, and we brought home half our gyro and souvlaki plate. We enjoyed a nice patio seat and relaxed while eating. The place was packed when we arrived and left, so that's always a good sign.   Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"If this place had a drive thru I would eat here every day!  I will not go on and on about the delicious food. because it is delicious.  One thing I really like is the outdoor seating. Not many places as cute as this in Henderson"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've had in a long time!  I got a Gyro Platter, and it comes with a yummy salad and fries - you can actually spend a bit more to have \"Feta Fries\" so I did that, and they were amazing!  No skimping on portions at this place.  The salad was awesome with oil and vinegar and enough to actually coat everything on it!  Gyro meat had a great flavor, pita bread was soft and fresh, and tzatziki sauce was awesome.  Nice staff, too."}
{"text":"I love the soup here. So, I will continue to come back (not sure if hubby will though). I  am always taken a back by the service though. We find  the 2 girls who bring the food out quite  abrasive and to be frank, rude.  We have overheard other diners saying the same while we are there."}
{"text":"I'm in Henderson on business and am so glad I found this place. I've eaten here once for dinner and twice for lunch. They have some vegetarian options that are actually delicious and satisfying. I especially liked the Greek Salad Wrap and the falafel rice bowl. And besides the delicious food, the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"great place to grab lunch the salad's good and gryo's are really good as well"}
{"text":"Thee best Greek food in the state! The Hummus is to die for. Always very fresh food and an awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Sorry, I am GREEK, this will be considered MCDONALD's Greek Version. Save your money, it is mediocre @ best. I did tried twice, just to make sure I was given them the benefit of a cook off day. I guess it is o.k. if you do not know any better. If the owner worked for WYNN, no wonder he does not work there anymore."}
{"text":"One word. BOMB. 1st timer at a Greek mediterranean restaurant all though I had Gyros b4. Found out I been pronouncing it wrong this hole time but let's get to the point. Food was excellent, friendly service, definitely a Henderson crowd favorite. If u want to dine it, it's hard to find a seat during prime lunch hours. But 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food! Its now my new favorite place to eat Greek food. The food is amazing but so are the people who were there. They are so nice and friendly. Also the atmosphere was amazing. You cannot go wrong by eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is always outstanding.  I only tried a handful of items on their menu because it is so hard to try something else when your 'Go-To' item is so delicious. The Greek Salad Wrap is delicious and satisfying without meat and the 'Rice Bowl' with shrimp is a delicious amalgamation of everything delicious-seasoned rice, veggies, shrimp, and a side of tzaziki.  My co-worker and I went here for lunch today because they have the best chicken salad (Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken Breast). The young man that took our order brought us a complimentary side of their amazing feta fries because the kitchen made an extra order- This is the kind of thoughtfulness that makes customers for life!  A variety of options for vegetarians and pescatarians too."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Im from Arizona, cant find nothing similar to it! Best i ever had!!"}
{"text":"Always really fresh and awesome food , I can't help but to order the same thing .... I  CRAVE it! It's the best Greek place ice been to in Vegas !!"}
{"text":"My wife and i were intending to go to jasons deli which is in the same shopping center. Too crowded so we decided to try the Great Greek Im glad we stumbled on this gem   Great food with wonderful service.  Clean.   We both had grilled chix skewers with rice and greek salad.  Very good flavor.  My wife also had the rice pudding which she loved.  Staff attentive and polite. They clearly take pride in their shop, and focus on excellent customer service.  Cant wait to go again."}
{"text":"So good and you can tell the food is made from quality ingredients! Our favorites are the gyros and the feta fries, which are definitely worth the upgrade. The tzatziki sauce is really good, as is their Greek yogurt dip. I love their pita bread, it's so fresh and soft! This is our go-to place when we want Greek food!"}
{"text":"Finally...a \"good\" Greek restaurant on this side of town!!! I met a friend there for lunch today because it was highly recommended. Looking at the menu, I knew I was in trouble and if I liked the food, would probably have to come back at least 20 times.   I ordered the avgolemono soup and the dolmathes. Both were very good. The soup was similar to my dad's, it has the right amount of lemon, not too much chicken and not too watery, not too thick...just right. The dolmathes were tasty and easy to eat. They weren't too vinegary like some places and the grape leaves were nice and fresh where some places are all tough and stringy. I also tried my friend's spanakopita, which was by far much better than other Greek places around here. Not only is the food better, but the prices are also much better than the other Greek places out here. Being Greek, I'm obviously picky about my Greek food. Next time I come here, I'll try the pastitsio, then I'm trying a burger because the Greeks make the best burgers and we need more good burger joints out here.  The service is very good. They are very friendly and yes, when my friend at the table behind me dropped his napkin, the owner was immediately over with a replacement. Now that's service."}
{"text":"Best gyro in the Valley, and the specials are always delicious, especially the pork chops. Beer & wine is very affordable, Deven high quality food for great prices"}
{"text":"They have the best Greek food here, everything we have tried is awesome.  I highly recommend getting the feta fries instead of regular fries if you get a side order.  The only thing is the kitchen seems too small for the amount of orders they get.  I have waited more than 30 minutes for my food on more than one occasion.  Beware, they get very busy.  I suspect that people got tired of waiting for their order and started calling in their order, because the entire time you are waiting you see tons of people coming in to pick up their large phone orders to go.  No matter what, the staff has always given nothing but the best service and the food is always consistently good.  I am going to phone in my order from now on instead of popping in for a quick bite, because that is almost never the case here."}
{"text":"This was the first Greek food I have ever tasted and I must say wow. I may not be an expert in Greek cuisine but I know what good food tastes like.  I got the Great Gyro with lamb and feta fries combo. It was one of the best things I have ever tasted, EVER. It was $11, but worth every penny and then some.  They definitely made a good impression on me, and they have made a new repeat costumer."}
{"text":"Got a lamb plate , it's was good,but  it's was raw in side ,  the rice it's not real and was very very salty . Salad it's was very nice. Next time have to try chicken!!!"}
{"text":"i am a huge fan of mediterranean food.... this place is amazing...great food, super nice staff and great pricing. sorry crazy pita....you lost me to the great greek mediterranean  grill!"}
{"text":"Stopped by around 6pm and ordered The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with chicken.  Unfortunately It took somewhere between 20-25 minutes to get my food!  This would have been okay at a sit down restaurant but at a order at the counter sort of place I feel that 25 minutes is way too long. Seemed a little unorganized between the kitchen and cash register which really shouldn't have been going on considering there were only about 4 tables full and a few to go orders placed.   I was pretty HANGRY (hungry and angry) by the time I got home but after my first bite almost all was forgiven!! Delicious chicken with just the right amount of feta and tzatziki sauce! Probably the best gyro I have ever had so despite how long it took I have to give the Great Greek 4 stars and return again hoping for faster service. During the long hiatus before I got my food I also noticed that they had a great beer selection (Hoegaarden, Guiness, IPA, Stella)  so maybe I will come back for a sit down with a gyro and beer next time."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding.  Well worth the wait! Nonstop customers!"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me of the cultural of Greece - inexpensive, casual, and  running on its own clock (read as SLOW). The food is delicious and worth the wait, just don't expect to be in and out quickly. The baklava is also delicious and heavy on the walnuts which is always good (and the expensive part of baklava)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek  place in Vegas ...100% for food and really good  service. I visited 2 stores Henderson and then new one the same food ...The new one is bigger and more tables and outdoor sits ."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mediterranean food in the area. We usually get the chicken souvlaki plate, but the gyros, soup, and the falafel are all really good. They only thing about this place is that it's small, so seating can be hard to come by. Worth a wait, though."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place. The food is delicious, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the food. We've had the shrimp and the souvlaki, both were tender, juicy, and delicious. The portions were also great. If you love Greek food, affordable prices, and a great atmosphere I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Its Friday.  I'm not too fussy, but Mr M challenges me with the choice of Mediterranean or Cantonese.  A couple of checks on Yelp means we can't find a Cantonese we haven't already tried, so The Great Greek was the target.  Nice little cafe-style casual place, and all the tables except one are full.  Place was super clean, staff were lovely.  Mr M had gyro plate and I got Mezze plate.  Good sized portions, and fresh Greek side salads.  Hummus/Tzatiki (sp??) were pretty nice and pitta bread hot and bendy.  I overheard another family leave and say \"man, that was good, we'll be back\".  I agree."}
{"text":"Wanted something different AND THIS PLACE HIT THE SPOT! Took it home and once my roommates saw my food they drove straight to it to get their own falafel wrap."}
{"text":"Uh-mazing!!!!!! Simply the greatest Greek food in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I loooove Greek food and was very pleased with the efficiency of this establishment. I've been to Greece and the food, especially the Avgolemono soup, was PERFECT. Service was on par and overall the experience was great. Will be back in the future :)"}
{"text":"I had ordered The Great Greek Gyro with Grilled Chicken and Feta Fries. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The best gyros. The lemon soup is killer. The greek salad is so fresh. And the baklava, heaven. They give the best customer service. I wish there was a second location!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times, and love it.the food is excellent and fresh.  And, their service is always top notch.  It is a small place, so seating is sometimes in short supply.  They also appear to do a lot of carry out business.  They offer the best Greek food that we have found in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and great food! Been im here twice in less than 24 hrs."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Greek restaurants in the entire Vegas area. I've never had a bad experience here. The salads are amazing and the Grilled Garlic Shrimp plate is my favorite entree. Go here if you love great food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with a Mom and Pop atmosphere.  Vegas doesn't have enough small chow spots like this.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, minus 2 star for service. They have good food but service is terrible. We are a regular. We use to go there at least 2x or more a week. What disappointed us was they forgot to put in our order, We waited for over an hour. We understand it was very busy at after 7pm and it's a to go order but we waited for over an hour to almost closing and still no food. They did nothing but to rush to make our order right before they close. I am all about second chances. We went back and the same thing happen again. This time, it's not a to go order and not at 7pm. It was early in the evening. We waited for over 30 minute, and all the customer came after us got their food. I asked what happen to our order. They forgot about us again. What the heck. If you don't have enough people in the kitchen, hire more people or don't take any more orders if you can't handle it. We still come here but not as much as before. I don't want to starve us or give someone more business if they can't handle it."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant deserves five stars.  This family deserves all the accolades.  The food, the service, the quality and the cleanliness keep me going back for more."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, clean casual bright restaurant, friendly owner and staff. My favorite Greek restaurant in town. Will not try a different place, no neeed to. I usually order the Beef gyro combo with greek salad but the chicken souvlaki with rice pilaf is also fantastic!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, but our carryout took 30 minute. She needs more help out front. There were 3 people in the back, but how long can it take to get 2 orders of soup and salad?  30 minutes?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek food I have experienced to date! It will be insanely hard to top the freshness and quality that these guys provide."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros!  The staff is very friendly and helpful!  Not only are they friendly but the service is very quick."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time over the weekend. Based on all the other reviews, we tried the lamb-beef gyro, which was really good. I liked the thick slices of meat and that the gyro was packed full. Have had gyros at other places in the past that have such dry meat. The Great Greek knows how it's done! We also grabbed a couple of sides of grilled chicken skewers for our kids, and they shared our fries. The chicken  was buttery, lemony, garlicky good. Wasn't a thing left over. Really want to try their famous rice pudding, as well as their veggie app platter next time."}
{"text":"The Great Greek offers up so much flavor, that Flavor Town has a new capital building.  HANDS DOWN, the best fries in this whole town... Feta Fries. FETA TO THE DOME! The Pita is warm and fresh, the Chicken and Gyro are delicious.  The Salad portions are perfect.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  You will most likely have to wait to find a table, as this place is on the small side, and the secret is out, but defintely worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I wish I would have found it sooner. The chicken gyro is the best. I never had walnut baklava, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it.  Boy am i glad I did. It was delicious. At first I was skeptical, because I hate walnuts. I am glad i tried it. The food was so good I ate there 2 days in a row. I am going to have to control myself, if I don't I will be eating there tomorrow. Normally I would be embarrassed eating in one place so many days in a row, but it's worth it. See ya tomorrow."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and resonabley priced never had greek food before but would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience with the employees or the food. This no doubt the freshes salad you will every eat.  We work close and Alice (owner/cashier) knows who we are by name and what our order will be before we tell her.  Ok we are creatures of habit but when you find what is exceptional why order anything else. The side salad with grilled chicken is huge. The sandwich's are delicious and large portions. If you don't experience the feta fries you are missing out.  Lunch time is very busy which to me is a good thing, it means they serve great food. Just call ahead an order, they open at 11am and we call for a pick up time an it is always ready. They have a nice patio when it is not too hot.  Sorry to hear some people had a poor experience, all I can saw is try them again, you won't be sorry.  Karen"}
{"text":"Greek food is my favorite and I tend to crave it like a pregnant woman almost daily! And the Great Greek always hits the spot, always!! Hands down this is my favorite restaurant in town and the value here is unbelievable.  The ingredients are always fresh and I have tried a variety of options from the menu. The pasticcio, to the gyro, to the salads, to the Mezze plate and the specials are all phenomenal. Usually even when a place impresses, there is always a but involved, but not here. This place is the best! Zack gives great customer service and his smiling face is almost always here!"}
{"text":"I eat regularly at this food. The food is great and the ingredients are good. It is a family owned business with an Old World feel to it. The service and decor are average but the food is excellent. I highly recommend the chicken kabobs and the eggplant appetizer. Definitely a treat for the taste buds"}
{"text":"This place is great! It is small, so sometimes seating is limited. But since we have mostly nice weather year round- out door seating is available. I love this place, I love the staff, and the food has never dissapointed! I haven't been back since I have gone vegan, but I am sure there are options."}
{"text":"Amazing. From the moment you walk in the decor is fresh and slightly urban with an incredibly inviting.  The staff is super polite and helpful.  The food is fantastic. Two can split many of the entrees.   I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter, the owner's son?, is fabulous.  Great disposition.  Part of the experience.  The food was great.  Very tasty.  Had the baklava ice cream.  It is FABULOUS.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My parents are always ordering take out from here on a weekly basis so when I am in town visiting we always stop and grab their Greek Salad which is the best Greek salad I've had.  So good that I had it twice in one week and I almost went here today again lol.    I can't speak on their other dishes but since my parents are always coming here and order more than just the salad I have to believe that this spot is good!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh yeah. This is my kinda place!  As an avid lover of greek food, The Great Greek delivers. On this particular day, I was here with a man friend and we were lucky enough to score the last table. I will say, a place that gets this busy needs more seating. That is a good thing for them, but not so good for the poor business guys that walked in and were desperate for a table.  I get it though. The place is yummy!  I had a gyro and their fries covered in feta and my friend had a plate with gyro meat. The is the real deal. Right off the spit. Doesn't get much better.  Service wise, they were very nice. They have a lot of people working back there but they seem to have it down. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality! I didn't notice the Spanakopita until after I ordered but if they have that next time, MARK ME DOWN!!!!"}
{"text":"I used them to cater my 4 salon's Christmas lunches on all corners of town. Not only was the food delicious, it was hot , they showed up on time with everything that was needed. The staff goes out of thier way to make sure you are very well taken care of from the planning to the delivery.  Thank you Great Greek.  Studio Salons"}
{"text":"This place gets a lot of great reviews which is why I visited, but I have to say the gyro meat was simply too salty.  The hummus, however, was very good.    I will try it again when I am in Vegas, but I will pass on the gyro."}
{"text":"I must admit I'm addicted to gyros.....so of course I love this restaurant! It's a little small (seating only for about 20 or so), but the food is absolutely awesome and extremely affordable.  I was able to feed my family of 4 for under $50. We didn't leave the place hungry, either. In fact, my youngest daughter needed a to-go box."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! What a treat. Beef/lamb gyro was delicious but the feta fries were even more amazing. The owners are so friendly and warm. We felt like family. Don't let the strip mall appearance deceive you. Super-cool for dine in or take out. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll seek this out again."}
{"text":"Good food! I went with bunch of my classmates after an exam and reunion. I ordered the great greek gyro and it was the best!"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick take out or eat in lunch. Gyro's are large and tasty. Greek salad is excellent with lots of feta. The spanokopita was reheated in the microwave so was not the crispy phyllo that it should be. Baklava is classic and tasty. Disappointed that there is no moussaka on the menu. Fast service from nice people. Small inside dining area and nice patio as well."}
{"text":"YUM. Go try this food!!! This is some of the best Greek food I've had, and I've tried a lot! The avgolemono soup was awesome and definitely ranks high up there on some of the best I've tried. The tzatziki was just perfect, and not overly garlicky. The marinated chicken skewers were d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.....tender, juicy, savory, and just delectable. The rice that came with the chicken was also amazing...buttery, flavorful, and so so good.  It looks like a family run place, and they're very service oriented. Very nice ambiance too--casual and modern, but still inviting enough to stay and eat. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food and the service at this cafe. Great portions, great price, great people. Did I mention they have the best baklava EVER! Yum yum yum! I can't wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"Always busy, and there's good reason!  Previous owners of The Fat Greek restaurant off Flaming/Decatur they have experience and heritage backing the booming reputation.   This is a quaint cafe and location with indoor and patio seating. If you're looking for \"affordable, quick, healthy and fresh\" Greek food that is pleasing to the palate, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Love the selection of their foods... their meat is not dry (compare to the other stores) ,all the sides are goid as well... love the interior design as well..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were ready to eat at the Great Greek for lunch. While he was in line to order our food I sat at the only table that was available, then one of the employees came up to the table and told me I could not sit there and that I had to give it up for the people who ordered before me. Is that correct? Can they order people not to sit at a table? In addition to being hungry, we were now upset and walked out. I think this was rude and uncalled for. I've never experienced such a thing at other restaurants. This is unfortunate because we have eaten there before and enjoyed the food but this experience has discouraged us from returning."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious Mediterranean food. Try the classic Greek salad with the add-on chicken or salmon skewer.   Well designed eating area. Outdoor seating also available.   We really needed a good quick easy restaurant choice on this side of town. Right in Blue Diamond.   It truly is great!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite place to each in Henderson.  Their food is extremely fresh."}
{"text":"When we got here, I was worried because of how busy it was. No problem, the staff had everyone happy and taken care of in no time. Apps came faster than it took to wash my hands. Since it was my first time, I got the gyro plate and the meat was as good as I've ever had. (The hummus too for that matter) however, the gold medal went to the baklava ice cream. If you were staying anywhere in Clark county, this little spot is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Love, love ,love this place. In my humble opinion this is the best greek place in Valley. My husband and I go there almost every week (it's a little ambarrasing ) and so far food quality and service has not change. Just excellent as usual.The name Great Greek speeks for itself! Thank YOU!"}
{"text":"So fresh and delish.  My husband and my favorite lunch spot on the weekend.  Closed Sundays :("}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is great, the service is great, the overall atmosphere is really nice! There isn't anything I have had that I didn't like. They have some of the best Hummus and Melizanosalata (roasted eggplant puree) - it is addicting. I always end up ordering the Dolmades with my meal too.   They have a Greek Burger ($7.50), it has lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese and tzaziki - the combination is amazing! If you are craving a burger and are looking for something a little different definitely get this.   You are always greeted with a smile when you go in there. They are very friendly and the service is fast. This a good place to go on a lunch break. You feel like you are part of the family when you are there."}
{"text":"This is 1 of my top 2 Greek places in the Southwestern US.   Good: 1) the portions; 2) price; 3) taste; and 4) service.  Ok: 1) limited seating.  I had the falafel pita (that comes with fries or salad...salad was good), a side of dolmades, and a baklava. Wifey had the gyro plate. They gave us feta fries by accident and it was on the house. The lady at the front of the house was super nice, patient and took the time to explain the menu. It's a little outside LV but definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"We visited The Great Greek based on a recommendation from a friend a few weeks ago. I am so glad we found this place! My husband loved their gyro and I am in love with their chicken kabob plate and their hummus! Everything tasted very fresh and full of flavor. Although it was very busy and we had to sit outside, the service was great and it was worth the wait. I can't wait to go again! We tried to go last weekend and learned that they are closed on Sundays. Hope to revisit again soon."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place dozens of times and never even knew it was there.  Don't make my mistake by passing it by.  We went there on a weekday after work.  Glad we got there early for dinner because by the time we left there wasn't an empty table inside.  But fear not, there's plenty of tables outside.  The owners are fantastic and friendly, and have such an enthusiasm for their food you can't help but want to order everything, and we just about did.  The food was great, service was great, prices were good... we'll definitely be going back and will be regulars."}
{"text":"Iva and Jack did a great food service was delicious the  restaurant deserves more then 5 stars Can't wait to go back and try more of the traditional greek food ."}
{"text":"There are 2 things that set this place apart from the rest. Food - The food is fresh and extremely tasteful. Lots of wonderful flavors. Staff - I think the staff who work counter and tables are also owners or at least they act like it. Super, super, super nice people. Always smiling, asking how are you doing and taking care of the customers. Ambiance - If you want glitter, go some place else. This place seats 35 people and the nose level is just right - Greek level. Lol"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek grub in town   I'm trying to find something to complain about.  Wait I found it.  I'm going to go broke eating here.  Great staff   Quick service. Worst part that's it literally is a 5 minute walk from my house. I might have to chain myself to a chair so I cannot eat there everyday.  15 minutes till they open. Might have to ummmm.  Take a \"stroll\".   Stomach is growling now."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great. I've been there for lunch several times. My But I do avoid going there between noon to 1pm. The restaurant is small and it does get very crowded."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Grilled steak melts in your mouth. The rice is the fluffiest (is that a word?) I've ever had. Yia Yia's Pasticcio is superb!! There are lots of regulars since the staff is on first name basis with everyone. What a great place!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Everyone in my party loved their food. Great prices! $3.95 hummus? Small bowl, but sooo good and they offered an extra pita (warm and melt in your mouth) without us asking. My great Greek rice bowl was the perfect combination of flavors. Yum!"}
{"text":"We've been eating here about once a week! So good! I usually get the chicken or steak skewer plate, and my boyfriend loves the lamb. All 3 are great and come with rice and salad. Tzatziki is good and so is the hummus! We love the Greek cookies and tried the baklava ice cream, which was yummy as well! So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"My go to place for gyros!! I can't find another place that comes close! The gyro meat is so tender and I love how they put the feta cheese on them at no charge. The sauce is very flavorful as well. Greek salad and feta fries are my two favorite sides. I definitely recommend trying this place if you haven't already done so. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Two words... feta fries  I promise you, the photo doesn't do these fries justice. They're out of this world. And honestly, make up for the flavor lacking in everything else. The chicken was dry and the steak was very bland. I would say the meal was entirely subpar, however the fries and cookies are enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great service. It can get packed here but it isn't uncomfortable. They also have a nice patio area which is great when the weather is nice. I've had a lot on their menu. The salad with chicken kabob and their gyros are near perfect. The only thing I have to complain about is that they only give you 4 pieces of pita when you order hummus and pita to go. It makes no sense because they give you a ton of hummus."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Greek place. I usually order the Great Greek chicken gyro combo with fries. The chicken in the gyro is well seasoned and cooked to perfection. It's topped with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and a generous amount of tzatziki. The gyro holds well if you order to go, the fries not so much. The staff is very nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"What we ordered: hummus and tzakiki with pita, shrimp plate with salad and rice and steak plate.  What we got: A MAJOR case of food poisoning. Within hours of eating dinner here, my mother and I both began a violent night in the bathroom. We were the only ones who ate the shrimp so we suspect they were undercooked or laden with toxins. It is five days since the exposure and we are both still having symptoms, which can vary in severity and time to recover based on how much toxic food you ingested.  I am writing this as a public service, and warning, to just say no and avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is a great place for eating with friends. The restaurant may feel a bit cramped when you first walk in, but there's plenty of space for seating. I ordered the gyro plate which came with sliced gyro, pita, and a choice of fries of rice pilaf. The gyro meat is very juicy and flavorful, although if you're watching your sodium intake you may want to pace yourself on the meat. The pita is soft and fresh, and the fries are delicious. Their menu has mostly standard Greek dishes, and my friends always invite me out to eat there. The food is priced in the $10-12 range, but the portions meet expectations.  The staff is very friendly. They would periodically stop by my table to ask if the food was alright and if we'd like anything else. There's no dedicated wait staff, but the service is greatly appreciated.  If you're looking for good Greek food, be sure to check out the Great Greek for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food that tastes amazing! We have yet to dine in here but do call in for takeout. Have not had a bad thing yet. But true to most Greek places you'll be sure to find your salad on top of all of the hot things in your take out bag. That and the price is a little high is the reason for four out of five. You just have to ask them to bag your salad separate. Love that there is a good Greek place on the south west side of town now."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great atmosphere. Great service. The BEST ice cream. My only negative is that I thought it was a tad over priced but it won't stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Falafel pita was delicious!  Great service even though place was packed.  Love their order online option - easy to use.  Will return and recommend for sure."}
{"text":"I rated above 3 stars for being a LONG time customer of restaurant  i rated much higher but now quality of food & customer serve has gone down : we ordered food Tuesday this past week my wife ordered as usual from our car outside we waited 15 mins as informed i went early to pay as it was getting busy as usual ( too busy i guess) as the young lady took our order ny wife told her three time what we wanted and she repeated it back wrong my wife told her again as i picked it up she stated what we ordered but as we got hone it was wrong ( SURPRISE) we got shrimp skiers instead of steak I wish I am allergic to seafood so my wife had to eat both tramps without wanting to she called back to the store and the girl said that first you did and apologized and she did apologize that she missed heard and then she told the manager a whole different story as we asked to speak to the manager the young manager comes on the phone was no help whatsoever he was like didn't know what to do how to fix the problem all he said was come back and wish if we were right next-door would be fine but we lived a ways away and wanted to eat our dinner  (so bottom line we will go ELSE WHERE FOR OUR GREEK FOOD. ( also rice was SALTY) THANKS NICK FOR UR KIND COMMENTS & CONCERN ( i wish the manager was as well he was VERY UNCARING OR HELPFUL."}
{"text":"I usually always get the gyro, feta fries, and my gf gets the chicken souvlaki. Their Greek burger is not the best (had the fatty taste - not very appetizing)."}
{"text":"My absolute go to! These guys are so friendly and the food is delish. The four dips with pita are everything. Their rice pudding is one of the best I've ever had (don't tell my Mom). I've yet to try a dish that doesn't meet or surpass my expectations. Keep doing what you're doing! You guys are awesome.  P.S. Sergio from EBC says 'Hi'! :)"}
{"text":"This place is just as AWESOME as it's sister store on Blue Diamond.  I discovered the one on Blue Diamond about a month ago and fell in love with it.  I was told about the original location in Henderson and business took me to that side of town and I just had to try it.  It was amazingly good, just like the other one.  The Great Greek Gyro is just flat out great.  I have had both the beef/lamb and the chicken one.  I can't pick a favorite.  Do yourself a favor and get the Feta Fries.  Everything is so fresh and tasty.  The staff is super helpful and get the food out to you pretty quickly.  My only complaint is that there are not more of these around Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  I have been waiting for good Greek food to come to the Southwest and it is finally here.  The food is the freshest in Las Vegas.  I had the Great Greek Gyro and it was packed with flavorful beef/lamb meat.  It is clear that they make their own tzatziki sauce because it was just so fresh and tasty.  The cashier talked me into the feta fries and I will be indebted to her forever.  They are a must get every time.  My wife had a salad with a chicken skewer.  She hasn't stopped talking about it.  The veggies were so fresh and the chicken was tender and had great flavor.  Do yourself a favor and save some room for dessert.  The rice pudding and baklava ice cream are both outstanding.    The restaurant is clean and the decor is very tasteful.   The staff is super friendly and helpful and I just absolutely love this place.  Thanks Great Greek for making this my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited recently due to my go to place being closed on Monday's. Was a little smaller than anticipated but was it was packed. Food was good, service was robotic and some items didn't come out (newer operation completely understand). Would visit again, but didn't take the number one place on my list of go tos."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of state and wanted something off the beaten path. The food is fabulous and the best part was the baklava! It is to die for. You won't be disappointed if stop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean with a nice atmosphere. Staff was friendly and the service was fast.  Ordered the Great Greek gyro which was delicious.  Only downfall was it was a little pricey. We usually go to the Greek Bistro in Henderson for our favorite Greek food but this is a close second."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Yero & Yero salad were of the highest quality ingredients, fresh. & tasty. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the Greek salad with a side of hummus it was good the gyro was better and the service was good"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh . The staff is super friendly and helpful . Best gyros in LV hands down . Come get one SUCKA !!!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Some of the best Greek food I've had!!! But they only get 3 stars from me because the staff can be a bit pushy and rude, especially when they are busy. One time they even forgot about my Moms order and we had to argue with them about it for 10 minutes before they realized they were in the wrong. There seems to be a bit of a language barrier with some of the staff as well. However, I am likely to return because the food is just that good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service is awesome!  The baklava is at its very best and I recommend you taste it...you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Order the great gyro with fries sooo good!!!  Very friendly  staff kept everything clean!"}
{"text":"The food here is to die for!! Reasonable and great service!! Thanks to Jak for helping us with the menu. Must try"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in all of Henderson, Las Vegas and Summerlin! Been coming here almost 10 years and can't believe I've never written a review. The best! Always super fresh, cooked perfectly, and very friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Genuinely Friendly and Courteous People Serving Great Greek Food!  Came here on a whim after looking for nearby establishments that maybe I had yet to visit. Don't know how I missed this place in the past. Arrived on a Saturday night close to closing time and was completely expecting some unhappy folks sorry to see me walk in the door. Much to my pleasant surprise I was genuinely greeted with a very pleasant lady whom I later found out was the owner. Spoke with the owner briefly and felt right at home. AT first glance it's easy to see they have good business sense shown by the fact that no corners were cut. The restaurant s done well, super clean and well kept. Even the business cards and brochures were well done, they even have a well made webpage....sorry but these things matter to me.  On to the more important things, the food! Outstanding food for a decent price. I ordered the Yia Yia Pasticcio, a very tasty pasta caserole with a very tasty Bechamel that is served with a side Greek Salad that eats like a meal itself. Also ordered The Athenian Burger that was topped with Feta and Tzaziki that didn't over power the burger but complemented the meat and allowing it to stand on it's own. Our final dish was the Chicken Santorini Sandwhich. The chicken breast used in this sandwhich does not seem to be of the food distribution variety. The Chicken was very moist and tender and was perfectly matched with  the fresh tomatoes and spinach.  Everything was homemade, fresh and made to order. Absolutely would recomend this place to anyone seeking a nice Greek meal kicked up a few notches."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!!!!  This is the hardest working restaurant family helping you get your Great Greek on!!!  I promise you, they will not disappoint!!!!         They are energetic and passionate about their heritage. They certainly show you why the family comes together around food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick service. What more could you want from a fast-food Greek restaurant? My only complaint is that it can be incredibly crowded during busy hours (good for them, bad for people looking for a seat). There is outdoor seating available, but it's way to cold to do that this time of year."}
{"text":"The lamb gyros were excellent and the side of soup was delicious. The prices were reasonable. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. Finally, a good Greek restaurant that's not too far from the house."}
{"text":"The best Greek food on this side of town. My favorite is the rice bowl! It gets very busy during lunch hour, I recommend to go either before or after lunch."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service! We will definitely come back again. The place is small, they definitely need to expand for more tables so people can sit down instead of taking your food to go."}
{"text":"Great food!!  But again had to park to find no seats and a line. Had to eat elsewhere again.  Empty store right next door. Expand please"}
{"text":"When locals are greeted by name, families arrive for a low-key Friday night dinner together you know you come upon a restaurant worth consideration. With  days of three digit heat behind us the patio is definitely welcoming. Carry out is popular here and in the course of an hour to see half a dozen people walk out with three bags full is not uncommon.i've eaten Gryos here before and quite honestly that's why I came tonight. Later, as my mouth filled with the delicious flavors of lemon potatoes, roast leg of lamb and Greek salad I was all that more happy that I'm a flexible person when it comes to such decisions. Suffice it to say I'm one happy Colaneri camper tonight. Normally, I would also order baklava but the Greek cookies looks so fresh I had to give them ago. Now I'm waiting for a pot of coffee to brew and I'll enjoy my second cookie. Definitely worth your time and dining dollars."}
{"text":"My family and I go there probably once a month we love this place we've gone probably as many as 15 times I recommend this restaurant. The staff is very friendly the place is clean and the food is great."}
{"text":"We were traveling from the Bay Area to AZ staying in Henderson along the way.  Great Greek was recommended by yelp and we were very happy with it.  Some of  the best Greek food I've had anywhere (including East and West Coasts) and, as is usually the case, at a very good price.  Various nice touches in well know dishes.  Excellent pastry (filo) on the spanakopita that was a part of my mezze plate.  Kebab chicken (is the yellow from tumeric?) was particularly moist and tasty.  The wife (very discriminating) and son were pleased as well."}
{"text":"My co-worker recommended this place when he was training me on the job, I had only had Daphne's in so cal and had never really had Greek food. I was amazed at how good the beef lamb gyro was. Food is very fresh and the service is well above par. I feel like I am in Greece enjoying a great atmosphere and some good food while on my boat. I have been back several times and will continue to go back.    I highly recommend the feta fries they are very good. The baklava is also amazing."}
{"text":"The salad wrap is kind of amazing. The plates is delicious too. This place is a little busy and I feel uncomfortable eating inside surrounded by so many people, but there is plenty of seating outside."}
{"text":"This place is good for the price. The fries are Not bad, rice always cooked perfect. Gyros are consistently good. I'll go back when I'm near and craving a gyro."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of The Great Greek! It's been so fantastic having a new SW location that's just as great as the Henderson location. The food is always fresh and delicious.. amazing customer service as well!! Thank you Great Greek team!"}
{"text":"Really bummed...I wanna like this place but after trying it 4 times now...I can say \"meh. i've experienced better.\"   Maybe they hate me personally or something, but every time I go there they take FOREVER to bring me my food. First time, I was willing to over look assuming they were behind but this last time it was just ridiculous. They brought out various friends food orders (we were a group of 10) by the time mine came out, they had finished there food and started packing to go. Were talking 30 minutes between their food and mine.   Second thing, I got sick after the last time. I'm talking immediately--which disproves the possibility of me having a simple viral infection or something. Andddd I have a hardy stomach. That never happens to me!  Bummer since it's so close to my house, but we will be looking for a new Greek food place."}
{"text":"Food is great.. never had greek before. My 2nd fave dish after sushi.. i had grilled shrimp with rice. They also have salad with a meal.   One thing i dont like is the cashier and food server is the same person. You hold money then hold people's food, i find it unhygienic and inappropriate. Also she was sorting the utensils after doing cashier. Ugh..   Place is also small so it gets crowded.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"the Great Greek Gyro was very filling (i couldn't finish it)...a little bummed they were all out of chicken, but the lamb was just as satisfying...the gyro was filled with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese and tzatziki sauce...delish!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek food I have ever eaten. You must try the feta fries if you go here! The pasticcio is the best! I have never seen this place without customers they stay very busy due to the good food. Service is good and they have outdoor seating for the days when its nice outside. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome, casual eatery in a modern and bright environment. The food is tasty but not at all greasy. Great portions and fast and friendly service. The gyro platter is great, but the lamb souvlaki takes the medal. Platters are served with a small salad before the entree. They are prompt with take-out orders as well. The price point is amazing! Definitely two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Good and fast! The chicken was perfectly cooked (thoroughly cooked without being dry). The feta fries are a must try! If you're in the area it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant in town! When I go out I usually talk people into trying this place because I know they'll love it! The employees are all friendly and fast and the restaurant is very clean. I definitely recommend ordering their gyros and feta fries!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant in town. The salad wrap is the bomb. The staff is really nice too."}
{"text":"O man, this place is amazingly good. I got the garlic shrimp & we also got the steak souvloki(meat was perfectly cooked) Along with the feta fries! Everything was loaded with feta, cooked & seasoned to perfection. I will definitely hit this place when I'm in Henderson"}
{"text":"Just touched down in LV for a project and was very hungry. Looked up this place and gave it a try and wasn't disappointed.  The most enthusiastic guy took my order at the counter and the Clover machine they had to take my payment was very impressive.  The Gyro I ordered was huge! The fries were super hot and fresh. The Baklava was the size up a piece of cake LOL!  I recommend this place no doubt."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Las Vegas! I say that with confidence because I strongly dislike lamb yet LOVE the way Great Greek serves it's gyros. If you are in town you have to visit this hidden gem outside of the city. The only thing I dislike is that it is closed on Sundays (hahah can't complain much about that though, they are open 6 days a week!). The rice is amazing too I have to have an extra order of rice to go! Overall a great affordable Place to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced Greek food. Love the gyro meat here! The staff are friendly and efficient as well. My biggest complaint is that there needs to be more seating! If you come in during rush hours (like 6-7pm for dinner, be prepared to wait for a table)."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot. I am so happy I found this place as I'm always on the lookout for fresh new lunch places!   We arrived around 1 and the place was packed.  We had to wait for about 10 mins for a table to open up but I'm so glad that we did. The restaurant was very clean despite the crowd.   I ordered the Greek Rice Bowl which had two chicken skewers on a bed of rice covered in lettuce, marinated chickpeas, feta cheese, and kalamata olives.  You can add onion and tomato if that's your thing.  The bowl is deliciously dressed but there is also a side tzatziki sauce which is so good I felt like I could drink it.  At the risk of embarrassing my company, I refrained...in case you were wondering.  The only note I would offer is that the place can be a little pricey (almost $30 for two if us).  There are some dishes on the menu (featuring lamb) that are pushing $18 which seemed high for the super casual atmosphere.   The staff was very accommodating and super friendly. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this new place. The food and service was great and the venue is tastefully decorated. Cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome and you get that family-owned vibe. The food is great as well and I love the baklava ice cream! Good price for what you get! Love the lamb gyros. I try to bring as many people as I can here."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Great food. The ice T is good. Close by. Nice employees,fair pricing never a long wait."}
{"text":"Was there tonight busy.  Was here before lots of times. Left because when I was waiting for table and my family of six where just about to order a older guy came out to clean the table I was waiting for and said I couldn't have the table because they are for the people that have already ordered I said we are just about to he said I don't care  told him we are leaving 6  people that was going to spend $$$ usually 100 or more his loss. So if you want rude employees go there"}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT!! The store is very clean and great atmosphere, and great customer service. Sometimes the food takes awhile like over 20 mins because they are so slammed, and sometimes there's nowhere to sit because it's kind of small and gets easily overcrowded. I wish they had more space and another location on the west side of Henderson. My wife and I love this place and it's probably our favorite food in the whole city. We usually get the bowls with gyro meat. Portions are very generous. Too bad it's always such a long and drawn out event whenever we want to go here. We usually only go if we are in the area and if there's no line out the door."}
{"text":"The BEST Greek food in the area!!! My husband and I have been dining there since we moved to Henderson over 2 years ago and the food never disappoints! The owners are so friendly and they are always busy, which is a good sign that the food is great! We are huge fans of the Rice Bowls and the daily specials are always fantastic!   Also try the Feta Fries, they are awsome! We dine in or take out at least once a week. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for homemade food that is always fresh and delish! I have sent numerous friends there and they agree that it is the best Greek food they have had. What are you waiting for...go try it!!"}
{"text":"Never been to the Henderson location but was ecstatic to find out this new location was opening close to home! Very welcoming and attentive staff, ambiance is very clean and modern with a straightforward menu. I love that it's not a fancy sit down, just order at the cashier, and yet you shall be served! Will most def be coming back as I love Greek food! The guy at the counter was totally right, Baklava ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"Words or pictures can't even describe! I have tried the gyro, souvlaki, garlic shrimp, spanikopita, bakalava, greek salad and my personal favorite FETA FRIES.  I have never left unsatisfied.  The services is always fabulous, they are so friendly. This might not be the fanciest place in town but it is definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Finally did today. Had the traditional Gyro. It was huge & delicious! Got a side of Feta Fries with it. Wow! That's all I can say. I'm not a fan of feta cheese, but sprinkle it generously over some fries & let it melt a bit & you've got something. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual, make sure and try the \"Great Greek Gyro, and the grape leaves!!!!! Boom!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner here on business and am thrilled to be staying across the street. So far I've tried the gyro, feta fries, and lamb chops. All of them have been amazing. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked and served with a delicious side of rice pilaf. The gyro and feta fries were great too. I recommend it all."}
{"text":"Too Expansive for a casual dining fast food restaurant.  We ordered gyro sandwich and chicken kabob plate and gyro was excessively covered with white sauce....can't taste the meat , gross! My husband's dish was nothing to wow about ether, just an average place . Will not return."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service! First time ever eating here and will definitely be my last. This place was highly recommended by a coworker.   We ordered our food on our way there and let them know we would be on a very limited timeframe but would like to eat there and if that would be okay, they said sure no problem! As we entered it was a little busy so we grabbed a table and before we could even sit down this young girl that works in the front came over and said \"you can't sit there you have to order your food first and then you can sit.\" WTH?  First of all, say \"Hello\" and greet your customers with a damn smile not your rude attitude. Secondly, we did order our food! Don't go jumping to conclusions and assume things....after all, you know what they say about assumptions. I'd recommend you learn some manners!   With that being said, we did NOT end up staying (I don't think anyone would after being treated so rude)  we ended up just taking our lunch to go.   The only positive thing I can say is, the salad was not too bad. But I'd rather go to a place with amazing customer service that has mediocre food, than a place that has the best damn food and crappy customer service with rude staff, ANY DAY!!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant in the Henderson/Las Vegas area. The staff are super friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad The Great Greek moved to this new location. I was initially worried that the food might be different or not as good here but I'm so glad they've kept the integrity of the food as the original location. The salmon Great Greek rice bowl along with the hummus and pita is everything your taste buds needs and more."}
{"text":"I've had better. Kabob Express on the East side is Better and not as crowded. I ordered take-out and thank goodness I did because it was Super Noisy and Loud with kids for such a Small place. The Lamb Gyro was a Huge portion but way too much sauce and cheese. Baklava was Large and tasty. My bf didn't care for the Grilled Chicken plate. Flavors weren't there."}
{"text":"The best value at any Greek place in the area. Amazing garlic shrimp and Lamb Gyros! The place is rather small so you may need to get your food to go, but it's worth it! !"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! They have the best Falafels in town and the hummus is great too! The services is great despite it being packed all the time. Seating is limited so I would recommend getting your food to go. I think they should expand!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I found The Great Greek through searching Yelp. Saw the amazing reviews and thought it should be pretty great if everyone else thinks so!  Pulled up and there's a cool patio area for outside seating. The restaurant was busy both inside and out, although a small space overall.   I told the cashier that it was my first time and asked what they are famous for. He recommended me to get the Gyro and showed me the different plate options. I went with the platter which includes the Gyro, rice or feta fries, a Greek salad and a drink.  I decided on the feta fries because...well, why the hell not!!! :). My total was somewhere around $12.00. I felt it was a great deal for all of the food I was getting!   As I was waiting for my food I asked about the baklava and if it was any good. He said that he would give me a free one as he knows I will be back again after I eat their food.  Hmmmmm...ok!  I'll take the bribe!!!   I waited about 7 minutes for my food, despite the busy restaurant, and I took my food to go. I didn't get to my destination for about 40 minutes so my food didn't look pretty enough for a photo but MAN!!!  Flavors were delicious!!!  Feta fries were somehow still warm and my gyro was just so good!  Their Greek salad was generous and the dressing was awesome. I wish the kalamata olives were pitted, probably my only complaint.   The baklava was amazing!  And honestly it really did seal the deal for me. I will be back to The Great Greek and I'm looking forward to it!  Already recommended the place to several friends. Overall, great food, awesome service, and nice spot. I look forward to dining in next time."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I drop by for lunch at least once a week.  My favorite is the Great Greek rice bowl with shrimp!  It's like no other rice bowl that you have ever had - and its fabulous!  I also love their salmon, which is perfectly cooked.  The family that runs it is so great!  I love supporting locally owned services - and these guys really know good, clean, healthy food!"}
{"text":"You will NOT regret trying this place out !! Got the Gyro Combo! Still brought some left overs back ! The service is GREAT ! Food even better ! Walked into my office and recommended this place to everyone ! Next time I need to try the desserts !"}
{"text":"Any dining establishment that caters to my kids is a go-to for me! I love this place!   Atmosphere: family oriented. The place is family-owned and they extend that family feel to their customers. My husband orders a greek salad but he asks them to leave off the tomatoes and cucumbers. The owner acts like this is fine with her while I stand there and laugh! They are awesome!  They have the best rice that I've ever had. My kids beg to go there and eat some rice.  The pita and hummus is just insane delicious. Whenever we are waiting for our food, they pop over with some warm, fresh pita slices for our children.   The chicken souvlaki plate is my staple there. The chicken is marinated to perfection and the rice and salad accompaniment are the perfect meal!  We've tried the falafel and the texture is perfect. The flavors blend well with the sauce, onions and falafel and it tastes heavenly.  The baklava is the BEST I've ever had!   Wish they had more seating (it's almost always full when we go in to eat). We often take the food to go for this reason.  Don't miss the rice pudding!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times in the past month...   My first time I had the gyro plate, with a large portion of gyro meat, rice and salad - the tzatziki is amazing, slightly tart - rich flavor, sooooo yummy I wanted to bathe in it!  I couldn't wait to go back!  I met a girlfriend for lunch last Friday and had the Greek salad with falafel, again, I was so happy with the freshness of the food - the portions are perfect and the service is really good - the entire staff is helpful and friendly. My friend had the grilled salmon - oh my gosh, it was so good (even though we had to wait a little longer, it was worth it!).  All in all I was very happy on my second visit.  Saturday I met another friend for lunch - this time I ordered the rice bowl and had the gyro meat again.  Again, delicious and I just couldn't get enough tzatziki! My friend had the chicken rice bowl and was very pleased with the portion size and taste.  It was pretty busy for 2pm on Saturday, but still had great service from very attentive front end workers.    I am a fan for life!"}
{"text":"The service was incredible and friendly!  The food was so fresh and authentic!  DEFINITELY my new go to for Greek food! Perfect portions! Such great vibes as well!  Loved the decor and cleanliness.  I will be back :)"}
{"text":"GREAT GREEK BOWL WITH SHRIMP! Not even kidding, don't come here without getting this- it is delicious. It's a huge bowl of soft, moist rice topped with cucumber salad, tomatoes, lettuce, feta, tzatziki, garbanzo beans, and the perfectly grilled shrimp. It's basically a Greek salad on steroids, with some rice. That shrimp is the bomb dot com, no lie. Grilled and seasoned to herby, lemony perfection. A light but filling meal.  The GREAT GREEK GYRO is also a tasty option- pillowy pita with a good portion of beef-lamb topped with red onion, tomato, feta, and more tzatziki. It's a good gyro, dont get me wrong, but the bowl is a bit more unique. The AVGOLMONO SOUP is a flavorful lemony broth filled with chicken and rice. The version here is tastier than many other places ice tried it, and as a side, the portion is quite large.  I'm not in Henderson often, but when I am, I'll be keeping this place on my radar."}
{"text":"Great pastitsco I have had, since the ladies from the greek church. Very delicious food and large portions so plan on a to go box. Best greek food I have had in las vegas."}
{"text":"Traveling through the area after spending time in AZ. I had the salmon Greek salad with avocado & it.was.amazing!! The BEST meal I had on my whole trip. My family loved everything we ordered. A new must stop next time we drive through. And the owners are so kind!"}
{"text":"Hey Jerry, we found out about the Great Greek through Yelp! We were down at the Galleria and I just did a search on restaurants in the area, Greek food sounded good. I'm glad we went...I have been craving those Feta Fries ever since.  Thanks for taking the time, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ample portions with quick service, The Great Greek was an excellent lunch for our family. The warm pita is delicious as well as the hummus. If we lived in the area, we would be regulars. The service was high quality especially for a restuarant where you order at the counter. At one point during the meal my son asked for sauce off of my plate, and within two minutes the sauce appeared, even without me or my son having to ask. Great service and good food for the cost."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service was excellent as well. We had a great meal (4 of us). The works; dessert included. This maybe one of the best Greek restaurants I've ever eaten at!   It's not a large facility. Though they have outdoor seating. It's likely crowded at the busier times so keep that in mind. But even if one had to wait a bit, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food.   I'm so glad this opened so close to where I live.   I've had the Great Greek Gyro, dolamades, and feta fries over the last few visits.  I've had nothing less than fast, fresh, and delicious.   Great job to everyone on staff.   Can't wait to stop by again."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is fantastic and staff are wonderful. Go get a great Greek wrap asap!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. Great service and food. Not to mention they can get your food out super quick. If you haven't been yet I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Just got back after 3 months and where do we go for dinner? The Great Greek ! Delicious as ever and the servings were great. The meat in the Gyro was melt in your mouth good and tender. The salad was garden fresh. Thank you Great Greek for fresh, delicious, healthy Greek food ."}
{"text":"Good quality of good, prices are pretty good.  Had a really solid gyro, fresh pita, lots of lamb.  Saw several other great looking dishes come out of the kitchen that I might try next time I am over here."}
{"text":"As I step up to the cashier,  \"Hey John, your salad is 15-seconds from coming out--15 seconds later--boom, here you go\" I come here so often they know my name now?!  Update: Jack and Felicia are pretty awesome.   I come back to The Great Greek every Friday when I work on this side of town. They do every thing right at this location. They are friendly, fast, considerate and the food --is absolutely fantastic--  I always order my typical large greek salad, with gyro. I order online so when I show up food is good to go. Sure enough, by the time I drive from my office to the restaurant my food is ready. I commend the staff at this place because they are always so busy but they always get things out in a timely manner.    My order is always to-go but I end up sitting outside to eat. The girl who works on friday afternoons always stops by and asks if I need anything else. This is wonderful, she acknowledges that I might not be \"dining-in\" but she still cares about my experience at their location. Kudos to you for great customer service.   The restaurant is also very clean. The bathrooms are clean (yay). The staff at The Great Greek takes pride in where they work obviously. They may get busy but they definitely get the job done right and well.   Thank you guys! I'll see you on Friday haha."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time today! I tried the Avgolemono soup and it was delicious (and by far the best side of Peta slices I've ever tasted)! I will most definitely be coming back! Prices are fair, however it is a small dining room and there's only 4 patio tables outside, all of which were occupied when I went. So prepare yourself to wait for people to leave and open a table or get your food to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Loved the lamb rice bowl. Was delicious. This is definitely our new Greek place. Service was great also. Very nice people."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good.  Service is somewhat harsh.  Also that they close on weekdays at 8:00 does not make sense."}
{"text":"Came here based on their good reviews and the convenient location. However, I didn't have the same experience. I came with the expectations of another similar Greek restaurant. I love the grilled chicken/shrimp Greek salad from the restaurant I usually go to so of course I had to try it here. The chicken skewer here was extremely dry, no flavor to them at all, almost like they were over cooked. The salad was alright, lettuce was extremely huge so I had to cut them down with a knife to eat them comfortably. Overall I just wasn't too impressed with the salad that I love so dearly at the other restaurant. Perhaps maybe I'll try their other meat options next time if I ever decide to come back.   They were very busy during dinner time so maybe I might've just had a bad batch of chicken that night."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!!  This was our first time eating here and the food was beyond delicious.  I got the Greek salad with an added chicken skewer.  The chicken had amazing flavor and was not chewy at all.  They also give you a ton of fluffy pita bread and the hummus was awesome.  Everything in the salad was fresh & perfect portions.  The kids' meals come with large portions of food.  We previously went to Crazy Pita, but this place is much better and authentic; the prices are cheaper, too.  Very reasonable prices!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for something a bit different from our norm so we figured on Mediterranean.  Now, usually, we'd go to Paymon's but this little place had some great reviews and was close to home so why not... Thankfully,  it lived up to the hype. The menu isn't extensive but it doesn't need to be, honestly. I chose the grilled steak, my wife (who was craving a burger from off the radar) chose The Athenian (as did a number of the folks grabbing a bite and the take out).  We also ordered the Dolmas and the Hummus, both being very flavorful. The burger was cooked to order and the feta fries very rich and tasty.  The steak skewers were near perfect as was the rice pilaf. I could have done without the minced onion garnish as well as the onions in the Greek side salad but other than that, no real complaints. The sitting area does get warm in the late afternoon sun so do try sitting towards the front or the mirrored side wall. The staff was friendly (at least the two cute young ladies we dealt with) and attentive, checking in a few times. We didn't try dessert,  but next time."}
{"text":"Great Greek food, great employees. Good Prices . My wife and this Greek really enjoy the friendly atmosphere . The patio out front is a wonderful place to enjoy your meal also. Greek egg/lemon soup and small garden salad are my favorites. Greek beer is available .   Bob and JuliaAnn"}
{"text":"This place offers some great Greek food! I truly have never been a huge fan of Greek food mainly because finding good Greek food seems to be a constant disappointment.  This place is pretty decent and I actually got to try something I have never tried before, Avgolemono soup which is like a chicken and rice soup but with a hint of lemon. The place is small but not overly decorated in white and blue which is a nice change.  The service could have been a little friendlier but maybe it was on off day. I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Best feta fries ever. They melt the feta on top. Their meat is delicious as a matter of fact everything I'm tasted Devine. Must come here."}
{"text":"Hands down best Greek food in Las Vegas. I have lived here for over 20 years and have tried almost all the Greek restaurants and this is the best Greek food. I attended the Greek festival a few years ago and fell in love with these fries that I could not find at any of the restaurants until I came here. Seriously the best feta fries especially when you squeeze lemon over it. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek has to be my favorite Greek restaurant!  The freshest salad ever, all ingredients are nice and fresh! Gyros are great! Always juicy! Never dry! The pita bread is so nice, fresh, and soft! Nice place to dine! Even though it's more like a to-go fast food place, but the quality of the food are no less then a fine dine in restaurant."}
{"text":"I am very picky about Greek food because I worked in an amazing Greek restaurant and this is one of the best Greek places I have ever been to.  Their gyro meat is juicy, thick, and it melts in your mouth.  I highly recommend the Greek bowls and they are big enough to share.  We moved away from Vegas four years ago but every time we visit we head straight here from the airport.  Oh and don't forget to order the tzatziki, it is creamy and the perfect combination of cucumber and dill."}
{"text":"Got the great greek gyro and the traditional gyro, both got greek salad as our side. Delicious!!! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Poor service, forgot item in to go order. Manager confirmed everything was there. Had to go back to get missing item. Asked for free small side of hummus for having to drive back and get the item they forgot. They refused and wanted to charge me for a small side. Very surprised for the inconvenience and lack of wanting to make up for their mistake. Not the best way to start out in a new area."}
{"text":"Wifey and I were craving some gyros. Our typical spot is all the way in Henderson so we decided to check this place out. The place is clean with nice decorations and overall inviting atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. I gave it a 3 stars based only on their gyros. To me it lack flavor and that certain \"umph\", it does not beat our favorite spot but it's not the worst either. Fries were nothing special but the feta fries was something worth getting. Wifey also enjoyed their Baklava dessert. Would come back but definitely nothing I would be dying to go for."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed \"cucumber heaven\" in my opinion lol. I haven't had this type of food before so when I saw a lot of things with cucumber and tzaziki onthe menu I knew my order would be customised. The lady who took my order seemed friendly but she might need a q-tip because my order was eff-ed up. I ordered the Athenian Burger and when the lady said it had the tomatoes, salad, and cheese would all be mixed together in tzaziki I told her to leave all of that salad stuff off and just put feta cheese on my burger. The wait for my burger was long and that was okay but when you bring me a burger that is obviously a frozen patty and put the salad on it that I asked you to leave off something is wrong. I did say something but it would have been a 15 minute wait for a new burger so I just said I would take the salad mixture off of my burger and deal with it. The burger was terrible. Then I tried the Feta Fries that I ordered and hot damn they were good! The fries were great but the gross burger and my lack of taste for cucumbers will not bring me back here."}
{"text":"It was my turn to pick lunch and The Great Greek had been on my bookmarks for a long time.  The location is small inside and seemed to be busy the entire time we were there.  There is also patio seating that will accommodate once the weather warms up a bit.  I had excellent service.  The gentleman helping us was very helpful since we told him it was our first time in.    I had ordered the grilled garlic shrimp plate.  It was accompanied with feta fries and pita bread.   Delicious!  There were 2 skewers of shrimp with 4 on each.   This was definitely plenty to fill my stomach.  Not to mention the outstanding fries.  This was my first time having these and I love feta cheese.  Yum.   My plate also came with a side salad which I didn't finish.  The dressing was a little bit much and overpowering.  But overall it was great.     I had asked the gentlemen if they had lemon potatoes since they weren't on the menu.   They do!  You just have to ask them to make them.  I might just have to go back soon to try those out!   So the business name fits the review - Great Greek! Opa!"}
{"text":"We came in right before closing (on accident... We realized this when we saw the door, oops). The staff was extremely nice and attentive. They took the time to explain the whole menu, and we felt right at home! The restaurant was full even though it was right before closing time.   It smells amazing inside, and the dessert looks amazing!   Everything we had was really good! I suggest the fries with feta because it isn't something you can get everywhere! Their soup is VERY good as well! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Absolute best \"fast food\" Greek spot I've ever been to. Better than my beloved Gyro House at home.  Take the \"fast food\" part away, and it's still one of the best Greek places I've been to - period.  Very clean inside, ingredients are colorful and fresh, staff is efficient and sweet (and super Greek). Owner can be seen walking around talking to friends.  Amazing hummus. Try the avgolemeno (lemon chicken soup). Greek salad is perfect. Feta fries are to die for. Free extra pita!!!!$&@&$$!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Greek food and this place is no joke, one of the best in Vegas. The food is fresh, amazing flavors, and portions are sizeable. Great value and the service is excellent. I had my first visit last week and it was so good that I brought others and ended up eating there three times in one week. Got to try the feta cheese fries, they are out of this world. Give it a try, I bet you can't stay away."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place hands down. Wonderful service AND wonderful food. The best of both worlds ;) and I love the family! So sweet"}
{"text":"I've hit this joint twice and, yes, it is very, very tasty Greek fast-casual food. But you knew that already from all the five-star reviews, eh?  The menu is a line-up of all the usual suspects: Gyros, salad with Greek dressing, pita tips, feta fries, baklava, souvlaki, falafel, pastitsio. Everything I've had is heavenly.  Parking/access is sort of odd; once off Warm Springs, you have to sort of wiggle your way back to it, behind a Jason's Deli. But it's worth it.  A wee bit more pricey that other similar venues I've experienced. And a bit shy, portion-wise. And from that, my one-star ding. But the quality IS there.  The last couple of months, I've noticed a big banner right out on Warm Springs, manned by several folks reading \"Labor Dispute with The Great Greek.\" I am OK with collective bargaining, in that it's a big part of how things are done here in Vegas. But since I don't see any Culinary 226 references on the signage, I am not sure what these (likely) former at-will employees are protesting exactly. Because their signage really doesn't say.  Anyway, if you are troubled by scabbing across a picket-line (of sorts), you have been forewarned.  UPDATE (from current owner Nick Della Penna, quoting his comment below): \"The picketing is from the Carpenters Union due to the construction of our second location on Blue Diamond and Decatur.  Rest assured that the staff at Warm Springs is happy with their working conditions and will take great care of you.\"  [ NOTE: The Great Greek's original Greek-Armenian founder Jerry Gorumian sold the Henderson venue to Mr. Della Penna in January, 2016. ]"}
{"text":"I ordered a side of steak skewer, shrimp skewer and  a side of rice. The skewers came along with the rest of our orders except for rice.  5 minutes later I asked where my rice is coz I have been nibbling on my skewers.  Lady apologized and said it's still being cooked and it should be ready in a few minutes.  I got up and said to the cashier to cancel the rice and to just order me a side of the shrimp skewer since I really liked it and will pay for the difference.  Cashier said to me that since it's their fault, they won't do a refund on rice but instead to just give me the shrimp skewer without charging me the difference.  Because she took ownership of the mistake and a few minutes later, the shrimp came, I WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK TO THIS PLACE.   That cashier has a great attitude.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came in to take some lunch to go. Walking in the restaurant was full of people and clean, always a good sign. The workers were super nice and accommodating! I ordered the great greek gyro with feta fries and hummus as an appetizer. Everything was delicious! I have had gyros all around the city and this is by far the best. Definitely worth taking a visit to the Great Greek Grill. Keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"this place is amazing! The food is delicious. the staff are kind and helpful. my inly suggestion is more tables to sit at."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! I enjoyed a chicken gyro with feta fries. The chicken was tender, the tzatziki tangy and flavorful, the veggies crisp and fresh, and oh the pita bread!!! Fresh, delicious pita bread. I capped my meal with a slice of baklava which was also very good. I'm no expert on Greek food but this definitely tops any of the places I've been. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We love the service with a smile. The food is terrific too. Never had a bad meal. This place is amazing :)"}
{"text":"The Great Greek has the best gyro that I have eaten here in Vegas!  It was so flavorful and they do not skimp on the meat!  The pita bread was perfect, as well!  The pita was soft but sturdy enough to hold the ingredients well.    My husband and I shared an order of feta fries.  The feta fries were amazing!  The fries were crisp and flavorful. The feta cheese topping was so flavorful and melted to perfection.  It was a generous amount and was perfect to share with our gyros.    This restaurant is a must for great gyros!  We will definitely go back soon!  The reason I only gave four stars is because of the dining area.  The dining area was not that special.  If the dining area had nicer tables and chairs and a more pleasant atmosphere/ambiance with actual waiter service and wine and beer it would actually be pretty perfect.    I will say the employees were nice, especially the man that took the order at the counter.  He was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Just ate the the great Greek for the first time and had a great Greek gyros with beef/lamb. The meat was clean, the feta and sauce taste fresh and light. I'm happy I stumbled on the this little gem. Can't wait to come back to taste other items on the menu. The staff here was very welcoming and fun to talk to. If you are in town make sure you come out and try this place."}
{"text":"All I can say is there is not one dish you will not regret ordering.  Been coming here since the first week they opened a little over a year ago. (Can you tell by all the Yelp photos I eat here alot?? )    Ambiance/Service -Casual, family friendly, modern decor, bright & clean, indoor & outdoor patio seating, place order at counter. If I could I would  give the staff of Great Greek more than  5 stars for service. From the first time I stepped foot when they opened,they have always been welcoming, warm and friendly.  They greet their regular customers by first name when they walk in and leave. Really impressive.  Food: Yia Yia's Pasticcio a Greek style lasgna that's topped with Greek Bechamel is a very popular dish to order here so if you want a slice of savory goodness I'd get here early for lunch.  If you make your meal a combo, get the Feta Fries!!!! Crisped golden fries topped with Feta cheese that's melted slighty. A different and delicious twist to eating french fries for sure!    Everytime  I order a Gyro and take a pic and post it, my friends are jealous cause here I am sitting having this huge Gyro that's filled with tender slices of beef(they also have choice of lamb and chicken)  feta cheese topped with a genourous amount of  their Tzaziki sauce that's made from scratch. Real light refreshing taste. Their Tzaziki sauce is gold!!   Ohhh the Grilled Garlic Shrimp is another plate that stands out. Shrimp is plump, jumbo size, it's an insanely garlickly & buttery masterpiece.  The Chef behind all these delicious dishes worked for notable chefs on the Strip. So you are in for a real treat when you dine here!   I must not forget dessert!! The most important meal  I never ever miss ;)  You cant beat Yia Yia's Rice pudding to top of your meal!!  Im not a big puddin fan but after Chef came over with a sample of rice pudding for me to try, I can say I am fan of rice pudding!! At least  the way Alice makes it here. What sets it apart is  it's creamy but has an amazingly light texture, with hint of cinammon.   Enough said. Don't pass up this comforting dessert.  The proof is in the puddin'!   Great food, great people, Great Greek lives up to it's moniker."}
{"text":"My husband and I regularly order food from here. It is very tasty and usually SO good. We just ordered our usual items and the hummus appetizer was very runny. Normally the taste and consistency is spot on. It was rather disappointing this time, hence only 4 Stars being given."}
{"text":"This place really is GREAT. After few unsuccessful attempts at eating here due to early closing time during the week, boyfriend and I became discouraged from eating here. This place was brought up again when myself, Jaime W, and Molly T decided to have our very own food crawl...at 11 am..  We arrived just as they opened and we were greeted by the friendly owner. I ordered Avgolemono Soup ($3.50) which is the traditional Greek soup with chicken, lemon, and rice. The portion was really quite large. It also came with a side of their delicious pita bread. Molly T and I decided to also split The Great Greek Gyro (~ $8.00) with lamb-beef combination. The portion, once again, was huge! And the gyro was really quite tasty. Jaime W shared her feta fries with us and they were delicious. They sound simple enough, but wow...they can quickly turn into a guilty pleasure.  All in all, the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. It does get very packed during lunch time, and they close at 8 pm Mon-Thur."}
{"text":"I'm waiting for Finese who had just pulled into the parking lot and there's only one available table so I take a seat and I'm looking at the menu... and the server comes up to me and says excuse me you can't sit here you have to get up because you haven't ordered yet. I'm shocked and finese just walked into the door. We get in line and order and the server realizes I'm pregnant  and goes oh now I \"kind of\" feel bad you should get a free baklava. Long story short I'm super offended and I wouldn't force someone who's pregnant out of a seat and he never got me that free baklava."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Food is fresh, delicious, amazing.  The ladies there are so friendly.  Outdoor patio is so relaxing and nice.  Affordable.  Eat there. Today."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?? This place is amazing. Best Greek joint I've ever had. I had a chicken skewer salad. All the contents were crispy fresh, the chicken was very flavorful and perfectly cooked. My husband had a lamb gyro no feta fries. The fries are sooo good. They have some of the tastiest thaziki I've ever had. Also hummus that is the perfect blend. The best part is that is he baklava ice cream. I thought it was going to be baklava with ice cream on top but it was actually more unique than that. It was ice cream with the baklava pieces blended in like a baklava blizzard. So amazing!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  We have finally found a Greek restaurant worth raving about.    Looking forward to returning as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Comida deliciosa,buenas porciones,los gyros son mis favoritos,postre riquísimo,empleados súper buena onda,todo me encanta...DELICIOSO!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! We came on a weekend afternoon for lunch and it was packed! The family is authentic and friendly. You can tell they care about their customers and food. The gyro was delicious and so were the fries. This is our new gyro place in town."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!! Going back soon. Taste so good, good price for the amount of food. Worth it every penny."}
{"text":"It's Friday at approximately 5:30pm. The place was packed and there was a line. It went relatively fast tho. Place is clean, and bright and had pretty pictures of Greece on the wall.   I ordered the Greek salad with a skewer of grilled shrimp, for myself. For my daughter, Greek salad Wrap w/Shrimp Combo ( Regular fries and a soda) and to share, an order of Dolmades ( stuffed grape leaves) and an order of baklava.  It was busy, and a bit loud, but none of that stopped the hardworking people behind the counter. They were friendly and knew their stuff. They worked fast, and efficiently getting out orders in great time. Everyone worked like a well oiled machine, no screaming, just head down getting the job done.  Kudos!  I took my order to go, the smell was so enticing I almost wanted to just eat in my car on my way home.  Opening the containers the presentation was 5 star.  Everything looked fresh and appealing, with a spring of parsley for an added touch  The homemade salad dressing was sooo fresh!! I could smell each ingredient in it. Just so yummy!  The shrimp were plump and  were grilled perfectly! Not over done or hard in anyway.   I am not a huge dill fan, and many times I find restaurants over do it when they put it in the tzaziki, not here!! The flavor was exactly what I have been looking for. So refreshing.  The Dolmades were just as good too. I could eat them all day.  Baklava was not the best I have ever had, a little on the drier side, but I did like it A LOT.  I like that they chopped the nuts finer than I'm used to.  My daughter loved her wrap and even the fries they use are really good. Other than the occasion joyous moan of happiness  and a \"This is soo bomb\"  I don't think we said a word to each other while we ate.  I wanted to devour it, but savor it all at the same time. I would have licked the container clean, but I used the warm, soft pita to sop up the dressing.   The bill was a lil over $30 for 2 people, not too bad for fresh food.   5 stars for food and service. But it is a bit smaller, and a bit too loud, but that might not bother others.   Anyway, TRY it! I can't wait to go back and try every single item on the menu. The menu is a not overly made, you don't have to look through a 100 items to figure what you want. It's easy to read, and will cut down on the time of making a decision. Love that!"}
{"text":"Awesome gyro! Posted a picture so look for yourself. Perfect combination of meat/veggies and the pita was light and fluffy.   I took my order to go and was quite amazed how my gyro was wrapped perfectly and stayed intact, I mean nothing spilt out, not even a shred of lettuce. They know what they're doing.   The woman who took my order was very friendly and quick. My food was ready promptly with a smile.    We often ate at Jason's Deli right across from them, but I think I might go Greek, try something else, and definitely get the baklava that I resisted getting the first time! This place was definitely as good as the great reviews I read."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is a nice place with great food. I enjoy the people and atmosphere immensely. Only down, closed on Sunday. Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek fast food.   Gyros plate was plentiful yet undercooked but order came out fast. Nice side salad with it. If you  are unlucky to sit on counter you get to look at the wall"}
{"text":"I've had the gyro salad and regular gyro - both were hits each time I got them! And I love love love love love their baklava! GET THE BAKLAVA! IT'S SO SWEET AND FLAKY AND AMAZING! I seriously take so many people there just for dessert!"}
{"text":"We went back to this place before we left for home because it was just so good. This time the meat was moist and perfect, the rice waa still perfect, the service remained excellent, the baklava is something I am still dreaming about. We also tried the 4 dip appetizer which was delicious and came with the wonderful, soft pita bread and the greek cookies which were flakey and amazing. We will definitely come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"After coming here on the reg for over a year I thought it was time to write a review. This place never disappoints! So many yummy menu items.. you can't go wrong with anything you order. My favorites are the salad, great greek euro, and the rice bowl. The rice bowl would be my last meal on earth if I had to choose one. Every time I have visitors in town I take them here and they love it just as much as I do. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is amazing. They never disappoint! The food always tastes fresh and delicious and they are very consistent about it. I always order the small salad (more than enough for 1 person) with a skewer of some kind (chicken or beef, both always so tender and juicy). Their garlic feta fries are also a must-have every time.   I've probably eaten there 10 times and I still have yet to explore the rest of their menu, but I'm confident it's all good!  The SW is blessed to have this restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"OMG SOOOOOO GOOD!  Last time I had this kind of food I was in a different country.......They are super sweet here and all the eating customers were happy.....good vibe good place....they get 10 stars!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice while visiting Las Vegas. Excellent service, great food, and generous portions, will definitely return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Wow!  Excellent! Everything is fresh and delicious. Saw this place on yelp, traveling from out of town and thought we'd try this place. The plates are loaded with food. The employees take real pride in working here. They have a sweet little patio and the whole place is clean and bright. You must try this place."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with this place. Always a thumbs up in my book. Everyone is always so friendly and the food is always fresh!  They are busy around lunch time but it's well worth it. Never had a bad experience!! I keep coming back every time."}
{"text":"Love this place so much. Definitely a little gold mine waiting to be discovered by everyone. Their gyros are to die for and their feta fries make my life complete. If I could rate this place higher than 5 stars I totally would!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times.  Every time we have had good food and service.  Restaurant is new so it's very clean.  I have called my order in a couple times and each time It has been ready and waiting at the counter when I showed up.  Order was always correct.  Glad to have a good greek place closer to home."}
{"text":"Doing some business in LV this week, and couldn't wait to come to this place. If the food is half as good as the reviews, this could be my favorite Greek restaurant.  The place is small... 4x4 tops and 4x2 tops, so make certain you arrive, eat, and then leave so someone else can have your table.  Good news... The Great Greek delivers! Ordered the Greek Salad (Large) with a beef skewer and it was fantastic. Quick, fresh, awesome!  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes Return? Yes Advocate? YES!"}
{"text":"Best Greek in town!!!! Need I say more? Why are you still reading? Come down here and eat some authentic Greek food. :)"}
{"text":"Greeeeeeat Greek food in the city. At first, I was a bit concerned about the food not being as good as the Henderson location. The food was consistent!!! This makes me very happy, as this location is closer to my house. Very very fresh food, great flavor and excellent service. Try the chicken rice bowl. It's amazing! And, always order hummus ;-)"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and good service. It's fast food, you put your order in. And they bring it to the table. After dinner we ordered the rice pudding, but we're all out. Next time I'll order the ice pudding with my food, we got cookies instead they were delicious."}
{"text":"One of the nicest people, clean places I have ever ate at! Great prices and totally worth checking out. YUMMY! I ordered the gyro meat combo and their fries are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Good price and their not stingy on the amount of food they give you.  People working there are friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is the greatest! Food is always hot, fresh, totally tasty and practically melts in your mouth! Service is always good and everyone is friendly. If it is busy, it is always worth the wait. My favorite Greek place in town!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch to go today and everything was perfect. We had the Traditional gyro combo with fries, the gyro was HUGE and flavorful, the fries were seasoned and crispy. We also had the beef skewers with rice pilaf and salad, again generous portions, well cooked and flavorful. The staff was very friendly, the food was ready in the 10 minutes they quoted on the phone, and the order was accurate.  I will be back soon, and often! I'm so happy to have some delicious Greek food near home."}
{"text":"I miss this place. I love the food and the atmosphere. I cant wait to go back to vegas and eat at the great greek again.  That lamb is delicious"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We usually eat here around once a week. The staff is friendly and the only thing I wish they had was more space for seating. Gets a little crowded due to their popularity."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place and cannot believe it has taken us this long to give it a try. We're making up for it though, as we just went back for our second visit in four days! Delicious rice bowls and skewers, amazing feta fries, and some of the best hummus I've ever had...there's no doubt that this place has quickly become a favorite. Oh, and the service is great as well, definitely can't forget that!"}
{"text":"Hnmmm.I'm iffy on this one. Borderline 3 to 4 stars.   So, it's windy as all hell and is raining around 745pm when we get there. There are still people in and eating. A young girl with dark hair and glasses takes our order, gives us our drink cup, and our number.  We order 2 gyros ...The beef/lamb combo, and of course, I had to try the feta fries.  Our food comes... and it's neither hot, or cold. Maybe this is how greek gyros are..? I'm not sure. The meat wasn't even warm...  While the meat was amazing, melt in your mouth barely had to chew it....The sauce and the feta was out of this world... It really didn't have any texture. The little mess of lettuce/tomato/onion was practically non existent.  I WOULD BATHE IN THE FETA FRIES. The fries were crunchy, warm, and covered, but not drowning in cheese. My guy and I were practically fighting over them, and I had enough self control to not pick at the lonely cheese left behind on the wax paper.  My guy stepped up and went to the bathroom.  That's how I was able to see what I'm about to explain next.  The younger girl with dark hair and glasses that took our order was wiping tables, when a cook from the back got her attention... He made some sort of hand gesture towards her. She stops wiping down tables, goes to the cooler that has the drinks in it by the register, pulls out a beer, and walks down the hallway.  She opens the door directly at the end of the hallway, and hands off the beer....  Drinking on the job.....? Is that why you are serving cold food?  meh. Maybe it's just me. I wouldn't mind eating here again, but I don't think I'll be driving by wishing I was inside.  3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"We ordered the Gyros so good and so stuffed we have been back again wow the Baklava is amazing  and the french fries salad  its just good I recommend to try it"}
{"text":"This place is deliciously fresh and tasty. Love the look of the inside. So cute. The food was so fresh tasting. My husband and I shared a gyro meat plate, I also had the chicken lemon soup. It was all so delicious. I usually don't like tiziki sauce (that I've tried at another Greek place down the street) but theirs was so yummy and fresh. I literally could put it on everything. I highly recommend this place and am beyond happy it's right down the street!! :)"}
{"text":"I love, love this place!  So far it's the only place I have found that has avgolemeno soup. It's so good, always very very hot.  Tiny little place, and the wait for food can take a little while- especially if ordering take out. But worth the wait.  The greek fries are delicious and the best in town.   definitely a must try."}
{"text":"So good! Very clean place, food is fresh, healthy, and meat is tender. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I liked this place.  Have not been in a while but it was awesome as usual. There are a decent number of Greek places in Vegas and this one is the best one I have been to.   For 11 bucks I got the gyro plate. Fries, a Greek salad and the gyro of course.  Food is good, staff is friendly and the place is clean. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is FABULOUS! My husband and I recently moved to the area and were looking for a great new Mediterranean/Greek restaurant to satisfy our tastebuds and this place is truly spectacular! The lamb beef gyros are the best I've ever eaten and the feta fries are to die for. The portions are huge, as such, my husband and I share one portion of the feta fries. I simply can't say enough about how good the food is here! The baklava is truly decadent and definitely were sharing as well! We have been there 3 times in the past few weeks since we moved here and have unofficially planned to make it back at least once a week."}
{"text":"Always greeted with a smile and the food is so tasty and fresh! Thank you for delivering on such an exceptional experience every time! Highly suggest the Feta Fries.... dang!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food. Great family owned atmosphere. Food is on par. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. Portions are a good size. And by all means upgrade your fries to the feta fries. They are amazing"}
{"text":"We've been coming here since we moved to LV almost 2 years ago and we are never let down with the service or quality of food. We always order our usuals - Tzatziki w/ extra pita bread, a Great Greek Gyro combo w/ Feta Fries and a Steak Souvlaki platter. Everything is fresh and we're always more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I am always more happy when I eat at a family owned restaurant and this place has both that and really amazing food.  If you are looking for Mediterranean food, and not wanting to wait a while, but still get awesome food, this is the place for you. It's an order and pay first, then they bring you your food and you can peace out as soon as you devour your last falafel. Which is sometimes just what you need from a restaurant. Waiting for the check is such a pain sometimes.    The food.  Falafel Pita: dang. I'm a sucker for a falafel pita and do I they do it so well here.  Greek salad with chicken: Okay. Greek salads aren't easy to mess up. They are pretty simple. The two most important things that you can mess up are the dressing and the protein. (As long as you have good produce, you're golden.) The dressing and the chicken were so amazing. The chicken is seared on the grill and served like a kabob on top of your salad. And the whole thing is just fantastic all together. One of the best Greek salads I've had.   Feta fries: So these are amazing. But what send these over the top compared to others I've had is 1. The crispness of the French fries and the fact that they use mozzerella and feta on the fries. So you get that creaminess of the feta and the stingy melted mozzerella that makes the French fries stick together. SO GOOD.   I absolutely adore this place. Go there if you like Greek food, go there if you aren't sure you like Greek food, and go there if you think you hate Greek food. Because chances are you haven't had Greek food as good as this."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas to get authentic Greek food. The gyros are on point and the staff is extremely nice. They have daily specials that rotate. Food is flavorful and they have great portions. Don't forget to the feta fries they are so good, they are even better with a side of tzaziki."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch places, their gyros are fantastic! :D I will definitely come back here again! Plus the staff are amazing :3"}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh!  I tried the chicken soup, a side salad, the gyro plate, falafel, and feta fries. I was stunned at how fresh and tasty everything was. Washed it all down with a fountain Coke...what more do you need.  A great meal after a long day driving.  Locals, this is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I went here when the place was not busy, aka not a Friday or Saturday night.  The service was very quick and the food was excellent.  Big portions, fresh and very tasty...will be coming back here often."}
{"text":"Delicious! We came in for dinner and I can say the food is phenomenal! Big portion and u can tell the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is really GREAT. One of the best gyros I have ever had. And it is right by my house. I've been there 3 times and the gyro is soo good I haven't ordered anything else! Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  My wife and I go almost every week.  The Feta fries are amazing and the Gyro is always what I order.  Great food, great people."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! Wish I had discovered it sooner. Excellent food, very friendly service and reasonable prices. It does get a little crowded around lunchtime, but that's only because it's a great option for a quick, great meal. Lemon soup is delicious! I recommend you try it! Family meals are I really good value and both have great choices. Definitely feeds more than you'd think."}
{"text":"I love this place. The soup is wonderful. The mezze plate is excellent. Everything is freshens clean. Staff also seems to really care. Super swell!  Note-it's got a to go vibe but I hope it'll continue to grow into a full size restaurant. In the meantime they've updated the decor and it's lovely to eat in."}
{"text":"Crazy. Good. Food. Seriously, the best gyros I've ever had, and being a former Chicagoan I've had quite a few. (Gyros, that is.)  The pitas were so fresh, the meat was flavorful and juicy...and the tzatziki...oh what a tzatziki it was. If I could have rolled myself in it, I probably would have."}
{"text":"Omg this place is the real deal....meat very tender....bread soft....food fresh....very clean.....simply delicious"}
{"text":"We love the Great Greek!  The service is great and so is the food.  So glad we found this great spot in our new neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 2nd time today and boy was it still a disappointment. First time we came here, I ordered a falafel pita and was disappointed by what I got. Instead of getting light and fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside falafels, I got mushy falafels that were falling apart. I didn't think too much of it and attributed it to probably a bad batch. Came again today thinking it might be different, but what I got were still the same mushy, soggy, broken down falafels. They didn't even hold their shape when I got them! It would have been okay if it still had that crispy exterior, but even that was non-existent. To top it all off, we waited for my hubby's Greek salad with chicken for more than 15 minutes, while other people, who ordered the same thing after us, got theirs first. He finally went up to the lady to ask why it was taking so long, and lo and behold, his order was just sitting there on the counter. By the time we got his order, the chicken was no longer hot-- heck it wasn't even warm to say the least. We gave them a second chance, and were still sadly let down. Guess were sticking to Meraki's!"}
{"text":"Living in new York City for years I ate at countless greek diners as well as upscale greek restaurants. So I know greek food well. This is real deal. Delicious food and friendly service. I will be back real soon.."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times in 1 week, ya feel me ? Pleasant atmosphere,  good food, daily specials, lots to like. Clean dining room and family run. Hit it up"}
{"text":"waited for 20 mins for food as people who ordered after me were getting their food they ordered. dont go here unless you want to spedn your whole day waiting for food."}
{"text":"Excellent greek food.  The gyro's are awesome and the rice is to die for. It's hard to find good greek around here, but this place is the best."}
{"text":"Says they're open till 9pm, closed at 7pm. Please fix your hours on yelp and your website and your door. What a waste of a fresh new spot in southern highlands."}
{"text":"There isn't a better Greek Restaurant in Henderson. Everything I have tried is tasty.  Never had a bad meal"}
{"text":"5 stars  Excellent customer service   Excellent Giro and fries  Again, 5 stars   Awesome feta fries."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite Greek restaurant. Their gyros are amazing and their feta fries are way too good! The only downside is the seating. They have a maximum occupancy of 35 inside, plus a few tables outside. More often than not you have to fight for a table if you plan on dining in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  It was my first introduction to Greek food, and it has been a fabulous adventure ever since.  The chicken and lemon rice soup in brilliant, as are the beef lamb gyros and falafel.  Reasonable prices and a great clean Greek atmosphere sharpen its appeal.  And best of all, it's a family owned place where you can be greeted by the friendly and knowledgable mother son team daily."}
{"text":"I'm not from here so I'm sad to say I won't be able to come back. This place is awesome! The staff is super friendly and very helpful. I'm he restaurant is very clean with a bright cherry atmosphere. They have a patio for outdoor dinning or you can sit inside the restaurant. They serve wine and beer along with fountain drinks and an assortment of bottled drinks. I had the avgolemono soup and a lamb rice bowl. I wasn't expecting the servings to be sooooo big! Everything was fresh and delicious! Eat here and you won't be disappointed!! Promise!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek food in town and actually ever! Everything I've eaten there is delicious! I love falafel but, often find them dry at other places I've tried . At the great Greek they are always soft, fluffy and full of favor! The service is always fast and incredibly friendly even when they are really busy.  The Tirokafteri is a must try , trust me! Also I love that you can get cucumbers instead of pita which I awesome when I'm trying to cut the cards."}
{"text":"Not very good service. I ordered the Greek salad wrap, 15 minutes later still sitting with no food. Went up to counter to inquire, older woman told me chicken takes awhile to cook. I told her, my order has no meat in it. She just kept saying, it was the chicken. I told her, no meat! She said it would be out in a minute. She brought my friends food and then we waited another 5 minutes for my meatless, cold salad wrap..  She dropped off a piece of baklava without a word. Sorry to say, not a big fan of nuts. Our fries with feta came next (we have now been here for almost 30 minutes) fries are plain, no cheese.  Won't be back, definitely won't recommend"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and the food was so amazing. We had gyro salad's and those grape leave wrapped things. Wonderful meal, the folks that work there were so nice, and we had a super time. I highly recommend this one!"}
{"text":"Lamb, steak and chicken, all a delight! Everyone aims to please.  Yummy and convenient. I'm sure they cater a party for me soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just a surprise stop instead of the deli across the street, what a surprise! Amazing food. Amazing service. Jack stoped to talk to us while we were eating and was so nice. First time eating Greek food in a long time. And it was so fresh and amazing. I had the small Greek salad with chicken and steak skewer and melitzanosalata aka puréed roasted eggplant with pita. My friend had the great Greek rice bowl with steak and lamb skewer. They ask how you want your steak cooked as well. We were greeted by Brittney, she was awesome. Explained the whole menu and recommended the rice bowl. The place was super busy and she saved the open table for me so I didn't have to leave my purse there. The whole experience was great. This will be a new regular spot."}
{"text":"The employees are always friendly and helpful. The food is delicious! It gets very crowded at lunch time and there's a wait, however it's worth it."}
{"text":"So glad there is a Greek place near me now! The decor is really pretty! Bright and clean, tons of tables and seating options, tables and chairs were clean modern looking.   I got the Gyro plate which was really good. Meat was not too salty, fries were crunchy, salad was fresh, sauces were delicious. My brother got the garlic shrimp and loved it, the rice smelled amazing and tasted great. I like that their plates and silverware looked nicer than you would expect it to, not paper plates or cheap looking plasticware. This is great for pictures :)   First experience here was great, will definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple of days ago. What a nice surprise it turned out to be. The location is very clean and inviting with large windows to let in the sunshine. The staff was very friendly and quick to bring out the food. I had the grilled shrimp entree. The shrimp were huge, and perfectly seasoned. Delicious!! It came with a nice Greek side salad, and the entree came with a bed of rice, a side of fresh pita bread, and tzatziki. My husband tried the Great Greek Gyro. It was huge!! Came stuffed with a generous portion of beef/lamb and very fresh lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and tzaski. Ordered a side of Feta french fries that were to die for. Never had anything quite like them. The fries were crisp, fresh and hot. Definitely give these a try. To end the meal we ordered an amazing \"Mom's\" rice pudding. this dessert was fresh still warm and topped with cinnamon. Some of the best I've ever had!! If you like Greek food. definitely give this place a try. It is delicious food, with reasonable prices and huge portions served by a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really loved how great this food tasted, and I appreciated how nice and clean the aesthetic was. My coworker and I, along with a lot of other customers, were just there for take-out, and while the wait was a little long, there was also a HUGE line of people - this place is really getting some business. The prices were a little high, so I wouldn't visit here too often, but the portion sizes were large to make up for that. I really can't stress how fresh and tasty everything was. I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I think my rating would be closer to 3.5, but I rounded up instead of down because I really enjoyed the food.  It is a small family-owned restaurant in a strip mall, close to Sunset Station.  This place is really close to my apartment, and since it was highly rated on Yelp, my boyfriend and I chose to go here to satisfy a craving for gyros.  We called our order in to go ahead of time, and the lady said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  When we got to the restaurant, we waited in line for a bit, and got to the counter -- only for them to tell us they didn't have our order in the system and didn't remember taking it.  This interaction threw me off a little bit, because the lady who took our order on the phone only 30 minutes before was the one telling us that we must have dialed the wrong number.  She had us show the call history on my boyfriend's phone to make sure we called the right number.  What other number is there to call???  She did apologize though (after trying to verify that we, indeed, talked to her and not another employee), and gave us a free piece of baklava.  That was nice.  It was too sweet for my boyfriend, so I ate pretty much all of it (yum).  As for the food, it was extremely tasty and fresh.  My boyfriend had the lamb gyro with feta fries.  He thought the gyro was great; the fries would have been better if the feta cheese could have melted into the fries instead of sitting on top of it.  My order was the gyro plate with rice pilaf, which was excellent.  The rice was seasoned great and the gyro was delicious.  It was actually a lot more than I could eat and ended up being two meals for me, which is pretty good for a $10 plate.  It also came with salad, which is another meal in itself.  The phone situation was pretty offputting, but the food is good enough and this place is close enough that we'll probably make this our go-to locale for Greek food.  Perhaps we will just order in person instead."}
{"text":"We lived in the Henderson area for about 2.5 years now and haven't been able to check this place out until last night. Well let me tell you didn't disappoint! It was so good! Haven't had some real good tasting home since we've moved from the east coast. Definitely will be returning for some more!"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and nice. We wanted to change it up from the traditional burger place and I'm glad we did. I ended up getting the rice bowl which definitely hit the spot after traveling all day and eating nothing."}
{"text":"This place is so tasty! The Greek salad with steak skewers is my go to for my ketogenic way of eating. The portions are generous too!"}
{"text":"Update:  Happened again... using the app to put special instructions on each item does not yield expected order. The first order of the Rice bowl was correct, but the second on the same order was incorrect regardless of information posted to it. -shrug- ughh I used to love this place  Original review: Order screwed up yet again. Plus 30 min wait for carry out. Online orders seem to have the higher priority than customers who take out or dine in. Other customers behind us received order. I used to LOVE this place, but it'll now be the 4th or 5th restaurant on the list now.  We've been coming to this place before they opened their second location. It's not worth the hassle to call to complain because I'm not driving 5 miles back to fix my Great Greek islands that's just a regular salad.   I threw it out. Hot pockets for me tonight."}
{"text":"It's a good place.  I've been there about 6-7 times for lunch.  I always get the Gyro and feta fries, so I'm probably a relatively terrible food critic.  I do like the friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  One of these days I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Fantastic Greek food... And I love my Greeks! This little place was filled on a late Thursday afternoon. The wait staff advised that everyone loves their gyros, however, he also was able to recommend a delicious salad/rice/any type of meat plate which o chose. The lamb was seasoned to perfection, the salad was fresh with an abundance of veggies and the rice was very flavorful. I couldn't finish the whole plate.  Can't wait to finds self stranded and hungry on Henderson again!"}
{"text":"Great little Greek place! We are visiting from San Diego and found this little gem. Service was amazing and food was right in point. We will definitely be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Very happy with last few times. I changed my times to not go during their busy lunch times. Now Togo orders are perfect. Great food as always."}
{"text":"Very good quality food... I tried the lamb souvlaki and is delicious  And very friendly staff  I recommend"}
{"text":"We were there last week for TISE. Found this place on the way back to LA, the place is very clean and bright. The service is excellent.  The food is really good and so is the quality. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We just drove into town and are staying at a 5 star hotel, yet we came to eat at Great Greek for dinner. The staff was so nice, food is AMAZING, and the atmosphere is perfect. They're busy for a reason. If we're in Vegas again, were coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I always have to stop by when I'm in the area. I love their gyros because they definitely don't skimp on the meat. And it isn't overly salty like many Greek/Mediterranean places I've been to. You also have to try the baklava... Amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to the great greek several time and the food is always delicious!  Unfortunately they close wayyy to early!"}
{"text":"This is the go place if you are around Henderson  Amazing! The food is fresh and healthy! I love the salmon bowl. It's packed with greens carbs and protein."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. The reviews are on point. My friend and I having never been, both got the Great Greek chicken bowl based on the reviews, and we LOVED it. The bowls come with rice pilaf which I normally don't care for, feta cheese, diced tomatoes, garbanzo beans, a little lettuce, cucumbers, olives and 5 pieces of delicious chicken. Everything was tossed in a light lemony dressing. They also give you a cup of really good and flavorful tzatziki sauce on the side. The flavors, I can't even describe how good they were. Everything just melded together perfectly. I have been talking about this dish since I left, and I can't wait to go back and try some other items. My friend and I also split and order of feta fries, which were really yummy. I love to dip the fries into the tzatziki sauce for an added flavor bonus.   This is a family owned business and everyone I encountered was super friendly. The place is small, with maybe 10 or so tables inside, but they do have a few extra tables outside on the patio. I just wish this place were closer to me, I would be here often."}
{"text":"Amazing Always. Try to stop here every time while driving through Vegas. Family was looking for a place with real food on a road trip and we love Greek food. Very happy to find these guys and they never disappoint. Staff is so friendly. Now I just need to make it for the special days of pork chops and lamb chops."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food and a good place to eat when you're really hungry this is the place. The service is friendly and quick and the food is always fresh.  This is the place that I always take out of town folks to come get a nice lunch. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal!! From the grape leaves to the tzatziki sauce was on point. I'm usually not a fan of the tzatiki but this one is the best I've had. It's not on the menu but you can mix the meats on the traditional plates!! I'm glad cause I got to try the shrimp and lamb. Both awesome!! The staff here is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. This place is very clean and they are fast. I will be back I have to try the gyros."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that this place is so fantastic that it's really busy all the time. The only thing better is the other location on Blue Dimond! I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"First time trying it here didn't know what to expect, I  ordered the Greek salad with shrimp and chicken it was greasy and delicious... nice helpful staff as well.. definitely coming back soon to eat more authentic Greek cuisine"}
{"text":"I crave greek food every now and then. I'm so glad this place is right in front of my house. My favorite is the really warm pita bread with hummus!! I can eat pita bread everyday. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food and super nice staff. I am afraid there is nothing more to say!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Great food when we don't feel like cooking and it's right around the corner from the house. It appears to be a family-owned place and that always is a plus for me.  We have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or service. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  This was our 2nd trip to the Great Greek and once again it was amazing.  Last time we were there we had the Gyro and a Greek Wrap along with the hummus.  This time we both had rice bowls, I had it with gyro meat and my fiance had shrimp on hers.  Both were huge and were outstanding!  The staff is amazing!!  Everyone, from the ladies taking orders to the guys cooking in the back have a great sense of humor and are more than happy to answer any questions that you have.  We only live a few miles away so we will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"3/9/16 - just returned from dinner. Food was good, the young gentleman working the register is a great asset the business.  Upbeat, positive good people person. Atmosphere is ok, don't get me wrong, clean, clean, clean. Just being from out of town I wanted a more relaxed setting.  I will return the next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and helpful. The food is fresh. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the classic gyro. The only thing I will do differently next time is ask for the Taki sauce on the side. It was a bit heavy and I scraped some of it off, but the food still tasted great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.   This place is great.   Clean dining area great service and Super Great food.  I would strongly recommend this to anybody looking for a great lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Must try the feta fries and the gyro.  We came during the lunch hour and it was pretty busy, so not the greatest place to grab a quick bite during lunch. I still want to go back and try the plates and dips. A bit pricey, but the quality is really good.  Employees are really friendly, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"This is my VERY favorite Greek Restaurant in the US hands down. The Greek fries are yummy, the hummus is so very fine!  Literally. The lamb is seasoned to perfection and the serving size is huge! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I have a new obsession with Greek food. I don't know why but I do. I guess there are worse things to do in Las Vegas.  So I did a yelp search and this was the closest place to my office. The reviews looked good so I went over for lunch. I walked in and the place was nice and clean. It's pretty new with several high tops and many shorter 4 tops. I got in line and ordered a gyro plate, Hummus (togo) and some banana pudding.   Gyro Plate - It was pretty good. I enjoyed the meat and everything was fresh and tasty. Now I'll have to say I enjoyed Ambrosia Cafe MUCH better which is why I gave it 3 and not 4 stars.   Banana Pudding - It wasn't that exciting. There was a  place in Denver that just had the best in the world. It was ok, but I would have liked it to seem like they had put a little more love in it.  Hummus - As always hummus is just awesome. Their pita was soft and yummy. I wish they had given more, but there you have it.   I liked this place but didn't just LOVE it. It's close so there is a chance I'll give it another change and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"The Skinny:  satisfying meals but the overall execution falls short on a few items(3), service: friendly for such a busy place (4), value: it's okay but nothing I would go out of my way for (3).  Craving some Greek food,  we schlepped it over to Henderson to give the Great Greek a try.   First of all, the joint is completely packed during Saturday lunch hours. It is good that the restaurant has counter service because every table is occupied. At the least, you can place your order while waiting for a table to free up. Luckily turnover for tables is relatively quick and the staff clean the tables promptly. I could also see the restaurant does a brisk takeout business which also bodes well.   We placed a order for a chicken souvlaki plate($11.95),  a gyros traditional sandwich combo (with their soup and a drink; $6.95 sandwich + $2.95 combo price), and a appetizer size hummus ($3.95).   The hummus was pretty delicious although it could have used a nice squeeze of lemon to really round out the flavor. The only thing is that the pita served was a little too soft (although served warm) which made dipping difficult. In addition,  we could have used a bit more pita to use for dipping.   The combo sized avgolemeno (lemon, egg, chicken rice soup) soup was very generous in terms of portion size not to mention filling. I found a tinge too salty for my palate and again it needed a bit more lemon to brighten up the taste. Overall,  the soup was just okay for me and I wouldn't order it again.   The chicken souvlaki plate was also quite generous. Served with a sizable Greek salad,  it comes with 2 skewers,  pita,  tzatziki and a choice of rice or fries.  The chicken souvlaki was a trifle dry and a bit too salty. Flavorless, it didn't have that lemony garlicky oregano punch that I normally associate with a kickass souvlaki. I don't think I would order this again.  The Greek salad was very fresh and the dressing was perfect. I also loved their tzakiki which was quite flavorful. Fries were okay.   The traditional beef/lamp gyros was very large and packed with meat. The spicing of the meat was good however it lacked that last bit of caramelization to make it the perfect sandwich.   Overall,  we were stuffed to the gills after all the things we ordered. Some of the items were great,  others were a pass.  Given our experience,  this joint rates a 3 starred review."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Warm atmosphere, helpful staff, and an establishment that is meticulously clean. I wish I lived here so that I could come back on a regular basis. The baklava is simply to die for. If I could give 10 stars, I would."}
{"text":"Amazing food! the Feta fries are chronic. Super nice staff. I am never disappointed with the beef/lamb gyro. *Update- this is now my regular place to go because the food is soo amazing. I always bring my family from out of town and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have eaten here a few times now and have enjoyed the gyros and feta or garlic fries and the falafel, so when the parents came into town thought we'd bring them here.  They are not familiar with greek food due to living in the land of Packers, beer, brats and cheese.  Needless to say, they loved it.  The gyros are the best in town.  Everything is fresh and tastes fabulous.  The gyro meat is nicely seasoned and you know it comes off a doner.  I had a small salad with my gyro and the dressing was excellent, not heavy at all and the perfect amount.  Next time we will have to save room for some dessert.  I wish it was closer to where we live."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. From the family that owns it to the tasty food! My family has been going to Great Greek since they've opened and we won't go anywhere else. Thank you for the amazing food and even better service!!"}
{"text":"It Really Is The Great Greek   My husband surprised me one day when he said he wanted Greek food. I couldn't argue with him cause the idea sounded great to me! When we arrived at The Great Greek the little restaurant was very clean, inviting and the help was exceptional!! The place was a little busy but nothing to extreme.  We ordered some Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with seasoned rice and fresh herbs). These dolmades are some of the best around. The grape leaves were fresh, with a little crisp to them. The rice and herbs were well balanced. They came cold, even tho I prefer mine a little warm, but after a few minutes they were gone so it didn't matter! We also got a side of Hummus (garbanzo beans crushed with garlic, lemon juice and some olive oil). It wasn't bad but I've had better. For the meal we got a Falafel Pita (stuffed with falafel, hummus, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and mint yogurt sauce, served with a side Greek salad) and a Gyro Plate (tender slices of Gyro with tzaziki sauce, pita, rice pilaf and a side Greek Salad). The Falafel was so soft and done perfect! I couldn't have wanted a better falafel! The combination of the falafel and all the other ingredients made for a healthy satisfying meal. My husband said the Gyro plate was really good as well. The meat was seasoned well! Although, I didn't try the meat, the rice was very tasty! To finish up the meal we got some Baklava (layers of filo dough, walnuts and cinnamon with honey). Seriously, the best baklava I have ever had...in my life!!! I would be very disappointed if I found out that they didn't make this in house. I've had plenty of homemade baklava, which has been very good, but this one tops them all! Overall the food was amazing, fresh and made to order! We have since been back and we will continue to go. So, if you want some great Greek food, head over to The Great Greek!!! You won't be disappointed!  http://inapplesworld.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome, great food and service. Staff friendly and knowledgeable. Open and airy."}
{"text":"I will get the only complaint I have out of the way first....my wife and I had planned on eating in (today's date) but upon opening the front door a rather unpleasant smell hit us. I assume they were boiling and peeling eggs and it took over the entire place.   So we got the food to go and it was really great. The giros are top notch and the feta fries are out of this world. Will be going back but please guys.....no smells next time!"}
{"text":"I was not a fan of Greek food, but this place proved me to be very wrong. Everything is amazing, the baklava is the best I've ever had. I find myself craving their avgelmono during all my waking hours. The pitas are awesome, their skewers are perfect. Eat here, it's awesome. And it's pretty cheap, too. Great service, great people. There is absolutely nothing about this spot that I don't love. If you're eating in, the feta fries are delicious. I wouldn't really recommend the fries for delivery, but you can have anything else delivered without a problem. The fries tend to lose their crisp during delivery, but that's just what happens to fries and it's not something the restaurant can do much about. I get my delivery through GrubHub, I don't think the restaurant offers it themselves."}
{"text":"Great place. I come here at least twice a week to eat. Local restaurant, family owned. I enjoy the food, always fresh, authentic Greek. I highly recommend eating here! My daughter came to visit from Florida, every time I tell her Im going here for dinner, she is so jealous that she cant be here to eat the food."}
{"text":"There is an asshole in charge here....after 3 people after me were served, I was told \"Your sandwich takes time\". This is after 35 minutes...this moron then proceeds to throw my money back and says,\"Here's your apology\" when I asked for my money back...good choice management...stop hiring children to work your counter..."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I've grown up eating authentic greek food and I must say this place is the real deal. Best gyro I've ever had. Also, get the Feta fries! So worth it! Price is reasonable, food is stellar, staff is friendly. Only downside is the place is a bit small for the demand. The line is out the door every time I go and occassionally there is a 10-20 min wait. But so worth it."}
{"text":"My entire experience here was GREAT! From when you walk in, you are greeted very vibrantly by the staff-- and even as you are still making up your mind trying to order, she is patient and always has a smile on her face.   The food is WONDERFUL! By far one of the best Greek places stateside that I have ever had.  The food isn't oily or greasy, the meat is good, and the portion size is great.  Also their tzatziki is delicious--- and they do not skimp on the serving size either.   I am definately going back here again the next time I am in Henderson."}
{"text":"OMG best Greek Food....not ever but in my work area. LOL.  DO: Order the lamb and meat gyro.  DO NOT: Order the chicken gyro. I ordered one and they took forever.  Service is good. While I was waiting for the chicken gyro (not mine, it was for a co-worker), they offered me everything. Water, drinks, fries, they needed to calm down. I just wanted my gyro.   I'd come back here IF I lived on this side of the town."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious!!! Very clean and nice inside Has a nice outside seating area too Reasonably priced The chicken skewers were my fav! Great place for a quick healthy lunch"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place one day and I didn't leave disappointed at all. Everything was delicious and amazing. The service was really good and it was a cute little restaurant. This place is defiantly worth going to. If your ever in the area defiantly worth a stop. For sure I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious! BEST Greek food I've had in Vegas! This will definitely be a go to lunch spot for me! So fresh and flavorful!"}
{"text":"I was THRILLED...that The Great Greek opened a restaurant in the Southwest area of the valley. I have previously eaten at their Henderson location - quite frequently and loved it. For a brand new restaurant, you would have no idea, because the team that is in place there knows what they are doing. They offer fast, friendly and accurate customer service. There is no different in the food from location to location - at least that I am able to tell anyway.   From this restaurant, I've had the Grilled Garlic Shrimp and the Grilled Steak Souvlaki with Feta Fries - Both were excellent and will satisfy any craving that you're having, especially the Feta Fries. In terms of desert the Baklava is the best that I've ever had. A few weeks ago, I took a friend from Oklahoma here while he was in town and he described the Baklava as \"being the best he's ever had outside of Greece.\"   There is good seating indoor and outdoor. With long lines it can get a little tight, but that's just part of living in a city like Las Vegas. The restaurant does to-go orders, but you have to place the order in the store. Once this location is able to handle online orders I will be more apt to grab dinner. This reason, and because they ran out of rice at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night (it was close to closing time) is the reason for a four star rating. Once the online thing is up and running, five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and easily now one of my favorite places to eat. It was so busy when we came in and now I can understand why! Everything we tried was so great and fresh. Not a bad flavor in anything. They are really doin it right. It's great that we live just a few minutes away. Definitely coming back no doubt. I recommend 200%!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is a relatively new establishment.  I've been in twice now for lunch carry-out and neither time did they disappoint!  I had the gyro plate, grilled shrimp, spanakopita, dolmades, and baklava.  The service was excellent and the food wonderful!  Price-points offered good value."}
{"text":"There isn't much to write about the Great Greek. It is a fast food type restaurant that serves delicious Greek food that tastes home made.  The Gyro, Grilled Chicken Souvlaki, Grilled Garlic Shrimp and Avgolemono Soup are all surprisingly delicious.   If you are in the mood for a wholesome tasting Greek meal, you would do well to give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The steak kebab was very tender and tasty and juicy. The Gyro sandwich was very tasty as well and they gave a good amount of tatziki sauce with it. Rice was flavorful.  Service was very friendly. The only thing is that they may need a bigger place to seat more patrons as customers kept coming. Our friend said that this was the best Greek food she ever tasted."}
{"text":"One of favorite places. I could eat there everyday. If you go at lunch expect a wait. Don't forget to order those delicious butter cookies. Amazing."}
{"text":"The food is really good . My current favorite is the grilled chicken soulvaki plate,even the side salad it comes with is amazing. Another favorite of mine is  the feta fries .This place is usually pretty busy during lunch and dinner. It's pretty hard to find a place to sit around noon,But the food is so worth it and the staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Again, Amazingly delicious every time. The best greek food in town. Always fresh with deep flavors and great prices. Doesn't matter what location I visit. Both the same quality and service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices and great customer service.  I will be making this a regular stop"}
{"text":"I'm picky when it comes to ethnic food but this place is as good as it can get for Henderson. When I crave for fast Greek food I come here. Reasonable prices, very generous portion sizes and very friendly staff! I don't know if authentically though if fries comes as a side."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Husband had a lamb gyro and I had a steak rice bowl. It was so good! You should try this place."}
{"text":"Date night with my wife. Fresh lamb gyro for me.  Steak kabob and salad for my better half. Waited 7 mins for table but well worth it.  Best food. Best service!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Friday night date night dinner spot. Service is awesome!  Staff very friendly and helpful. Food is so out of this world GREAT. I switch up between the lamb skewers and the gyro. Stacy has the beef skewers as a rule. The salads are awesome. Just a little heavy on the onion. You must try them if you like real Greek food."}
{"text":"First time here and loved everything about this place. From the food to the friendly customer service! Baklava tasted like God made it himself. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"While in town for my husbands birthday we decided to try this Greek restaurant for lunch. We have a vacation home nearby and heard good reviews. We arrived at 11:15 am on a Saturday. By 11:30 there wasn't a seat to be had. It's a small place with limited seating but the food is outstanding. We ordered hummus, Gyros and a baklava. The staff was friendly and attentive. They acknowledged by name several regulars who came in. The hummus was delicious. I have never had a better Gyro. The taste of the meat was so flavorful and abundant. Feeling bad for the standing room only crowd, I suggested we take the baklava home for later.  We were stuffed from all the other food. We got home and I couldn't wait any longer to dig into the baklava. It's by far the freshest most tasty baklava I have ever had. It nearly sent me into a sugar coma but it was well worth it.  We will be back in April and will be ordering lunch and dinner a few times."}
{"text":"I have had several Greek places around town and this is definitely my favorite so far :) everyone is always friendly and the food is always great."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite. I came for dinner and lunch yesterday and I am back for lunch again today. I love it here!!!!! So flavorful and healthy. So fresh. Amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was spoiled on retro row in long beach with 3 amazing Greek places all with different flavors and menus. This place is one of two that have spicy feta here in town and this spot makes it the best! The Avegalemno soup is so-so but they are against my old favorite place in SoCal. However, the rice pilaf perfect. This is my new go to dinner spot. Eat Fresh / Eat Greek ! id give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"We love this place - the food is delicious and the service is great! A wonderful \"mom and pop\" place...it is a great change to all these \"same old same old\" fastfood chains in the area! They even have some outdoor seating - but since it is rather small it is sometimes hard to find seating outside. Awesome place - it really is  \"great greek\" food!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was totally intimidated by the fast paced environment of this place when I first walked in. I was looking to grab something for lunch but the place was packed and the cooks and servers looked very busy, I almost just left. I decided to wait in line and order \"The great Greek gyro\" which was delicious.  The young woman taking orders was great, gave me a warm welcome and was very nice. After ordering my food was ready in about 3 minutes, and the man who gave it to me said \"Thank you, I'll see you next time!\" I think it's great when restaurants make a point to invite you back! I would recommend this to anyone for a quick lunch spot. Great food and service for a great price!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience! The place was packed and smelled amazing as soon as we walked in. Mom ordered the Gyro plate and I ordered the chicken souvlaki. The fries with feta are a trip to heaven, the meat is well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The  Gyro and Tzaziki are our top favorites and no matter what, do not leave without having Baklava. Superb!  I hope they keep cooking like this, the problem in Henderson is that restaurants change their quality of food and service, let's hope you stay on top for many years!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!! The best!  Everything is amazing, but the feta fries with Taziki!!!!!! Holy buckets, who knew I could be a vegetarian and just eat that the rest of my life!!!  Hummus and lamb the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!! The best!  Everything is amazing, but the feta fries with Taziki!!!!!! Holy buckets, who knew I could be a vegetarian and just eat that the rest of my life!!!  Hummus and lamb the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Upon walking into this restaurant, the ambiance is inviting. The decor is the typical blue and white from the Greece flag. I ordered the great Greek gyro (chicken) with tzatziki sauce on the side. Made it a combo with feta fries and a drink - everything was delicious!!!! Fresh, flavorful, and exactly as specified on the menu! Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Um, so, this place had the best Greek food I have ever tasted in my life?! I was overwhelmed by their menu because I wanted everything. I even had trouble ordering because my mind was trying to process all the goodness lol. It all sounded soo good, they all looked delicious and fresh. I ended up getting the gyro wrap and feta fries. The wrap was superb, FULL of fresh veggies and meat, and topped with a load of feta YUM! I got a chance to try my friends garlic shrimp skewer and that was delicious as well--perfectly cooked shrimp. Hummus was wonderful and didnt have that over the top sourness to it, which I personally like. And the staff was so nice and helpful! Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have read others responses on yelp and decided to give this restaurant a try.  It is a small restaurant and quite crowded.  The food was nothing short of amazing.  The service was up to par for how busy they were.  You order at a counter and hope to find a table, but they do that as first come first served basis.  I will be happy to eat there again."}
{"text":"took my cousin to go check this place out. i got the lamb/beef pilaf rice plate and he got some kind of salad platter thing. honestly when our two orders came out they had the same ingredients but positioned differently. but mine came with pita bread. the yogurt cucumber sauce was really good. definitely didnt think i would get full off of it but i was stuffed. drinks are self serve. the lady who i assume was the owner would come around and check up on us frequently and came and took our garbage away."}
{"text":"I love the chicken rice bowl here! So amazingly clean and yummy. Chicken is so tender. The young guy at register is always so nice! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Greek food and came across The Great Greek by chance. Tried going to Chick-fil-A close by and line was LONG (as always). Opened up the yelp app to find an alternative.  First of all, their gyro is bomb. Super fresh and cooked perfectly. Ordered a gyro platter which comes with your standard side salad. More than ample amount of meat, definitely not stingy. Also comes with pita bread and your choice of rice/fries. GO WITH THE RICE! I mean, I'm carb conscious and all... but their rice is worth it.  Service was great. Super friendly and smiles all around. Price is fair for the quality of food. Needless to say, I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"First time here, my husband went yesterday . We both got the Lamb great Greek gyros... they are huge and delicious. We also got fries and the butter cookies which are also really good ! We will be back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when I visit Las Vegas. I go every other week for work, and I will literally risk missing my flight to make sure I get my great Greek fix! Best salmon salad of my life! Shrimp skewers are awesome, I'm never disappointed here. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"First time trying today and I feel like they bought their reviews or something because I spent $45 on literally a fear factor episode. Everything smelled so good until I bit into it. I got the garlic shrimp and it had no salt or char no nothing and their rice was bland. My boyfriend got the Greek salad wrap and they still put nasty stank hummus in there and we HATE hummus. And the lady recommended the rice pudding and don't get me started on that because that was the most basic smiths brand rice pudding I ever tasted smh. And the best thing I can say was the pita bread and the baklava was whatever."}
{"text":"In the past I have had bad experiences with lamb prepared poorly before this restaurant and I was reluctant to try it. I tried their gyro plate with the full lamb (not beef/lamb mix) and it was absolutely amazing. Best tasting lamb I've ever had and it changed my attitude of the food. 6 stars if I could rate that high and I will come again. Service was friendly and top notch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek place in town, it's just a bit pricey I feel. The food is really good and quality is as well. However, three meals and drinks, with tip was $60. That's why they get four instead of five stars. I'd be here all the time if it were less expensive.   I've never had anything bad or disappointing here, and the kids like it. Even the picky one likes it because it's simple. We usually get chicken or steak souvlaki when we are there, and it's offered with fries or rice pilaf not also comes with a really good side Greek salad. The kids plates aren't quiet half price and come with one skewer instead of two. I order the full size and they split it.   Yesterday they were offering a special of mousakka (sp) and it was really good. It's egg plant, ground beef, potatoes and bechamel sauce  it also came with the side salad.   I recommend the feta fries, falafels, hummus with pita, cookies and baklava as well. We don't always get those but they never disappoint.   I like that they have healthy options that are just part of the regular menu, because you really can't go wrong with a protein and salad."}
{"text":"Great customer service, Brittany and Jack. We came in as the last customers, ( yes we were that couple) but the service was amazing.  The food was astoundingly good. Whoever owns the place, promote these two and the cooks. Way too good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, fresh and tasty and authentic. The staff is great, really a comfortable atmosphere with great food."}
{"text":"This place was very busy for lunch. Not a big restaurant. I went to this place on the last day of Las Vegas trip and ate the Gyro Plate. It was good and a nice way to finish off the Vegas trip. All the ingredients were very fresh. You order at the cash register first and then one of the employees brings you the order."}
{"text":"A-mazing!!  So Delicious.  I want to come back again tomorrow. Fresh ingredients, super clean, well decorated, all around great atmosphere.  The employees were super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Been here several times but never posted a review. Not only is the food delicious, well cooked, and perfectly seasoned, but the wonderful service you receive from this small business is awesome. I wish larger businesses in the area would practice the same wonderful customer service that The Great Greek has consistently provided. Love having this great place in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"Fast, casual, clean, and super fresh greek food. Love this place. Salads with a meat add-on and the lemon soup are my favorite but everything's great. Friendly and efficient staff. Good location"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a small Greek salad with a chicken skewer. Salad already had dressing but it was the perfect amount. Chicken was flavorful and not dry at all--will be going back"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. This is my first experience at the Great Greek. The bowl is huge and everything in it tastes really fresh and flavorful. I ordered shrimp and steak(cooked to order, med-rare), both meat portions are bigger than I thought they would be, are very good quality and not greasy at all.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time here i got the shrimp dinner the food is delicious even the fries are yummy. Really great customer service everyone in that place is so nice... definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food close to home. The flavor is wonderful and it tastes so fabulously fresh. A healthy favorite that keeps me coming back for more. Definitely recommend the Mezze Plate if you want to get a taste for the place. Even their dolmades, a food I typically dislike, is really delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here! The chicken gyro is outstanding and the hummus appetizer with FRESH pita is out of this world.   I find it odd that they don't serve Lamb, but since I don't eat Lamb I'm not highly disturbed by this fact.   The food is consistently delicious but the establishment is consistently FREEZING! My suggestion would be to get your food to go and enjoy it in the comfort of your own, temperature balanced dwelling."}
{"text":"I just love this place - it is like coming to see family here.  Food is great, and how I love all things Greek (I am a complete Malakas when it comes to Greek and Greek Traditions).  Best Dolmas in town, and the Pastitsio always makes my day).  Opa ela ethw tora fella arsenoko!!!"}
{"text":"Now here's a place to get excited about. It's delicous and delightful. Amazing fresh food. I just moved to Vegas 6 weeks ago and I've easily been here 10 times. Everytime the food is amazing, friendly staff. The place is small and getting a table is HARD, the wait for the food is a little longer than I'd like. But you can't rush perfection and deliciousness! Definitely worth all of it!"}
{"text":"My favorite greek spot down the street & around the corner from my house! I absolutely love the avgolemono soup I wish it came in a bigger size. I get the rice pilaf side & chicken skewer at least 3 times a week & that's enough for me as a meal & a snack for work later on. Always on time with my pickup."}
{"text":"I went to this place not ever going to a Greek place before. Not expecting much, I was blown away! Great food, great service, highly recommend this place, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"On our way to San Diego we stopped for the night in Henderson, NV. A group of 10 of us were lookin for some inexpensive dinner so I hit up yelp. While it was a bit difficult to find even with a GPS, we eventually found it and were not disappointed.   The woman behind the counter was a jovial Greek woman and another Greek man (son I presumed) was running around helping. She expalined the menu and after much deliberation we went with two family dinners for 4, which included a huge gyro, salad, dessert, and a drink for each person all for about $43. Very reasonable. The other two got some sort of salad, one got the shrimp. The portions are large and the gyro was very tender and tasty. It also had feta cheese on top, which was a nice touch. I tried the shrimp, which were easily jumbo shrimp and very flavorful. The gyro was by far the best part of the meal and the feta fries were also very good. We couldn't decide what dessert to order until a lady behind us in line said their rice pudding was delicious. We ordered both the rice pudding and the baklava. Both were very good. I can only take so much sweet, so I couldn't finish the rice pudding but it was very good. The baklava was one of the best I've had. And I've tried my Greek friend's mom's baklava straight from Greece. It had the perfect flakiness and combination of sweet with the nuts. I'm not a huge dessert fan but the baklava and rice pudding I would order again. Definitely a delicious, affordable meal and I will go again when I'm in the area.  Side note they had raspberry iced tea which was a plus if you don't drink soda :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic service. Would highly recommend. The best gyro that I've bad, and the Feti Fries are to die for."}
{"text":"I don't come to this side of town often, but as soon as I decided to meet my friend with the big fat Greek appetite I knew we would be coming here.  Great Greek is certainly where it's at for gyros!   A hearty portion of wonderfully flavored beef/lamb meat is sliced thick and surrounded by a warm fluffy pita (the kind you'd feel comfortable resting your head upon if you weren't ready to devour it) in this truly special gyro!  I'm not sure if I would bestow it with the title of best gyro in the valley, but it is certainly one of the best. ... add some Feta Fries and a Greek Salad if you brought your beast appetite... or just want to save some for later because both are great options here. I tried some of my friends Avgolemono Soup...another great addition!  I haven't had the opportunity to try any of their other dishes, but I would order whatever I was in the mood for with confidence based on the quality of what I had."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem on a drive by. Authentic Greek food made with love. My daughter had the falafel gyro and I had the lamb/beef gyro. Both were wonderfully delicious. I also had a small salad and she had fries. The salad was fresh and delicious with romaine, feta, kalamata olives, and most importantly, the tomatoes were fresh and crispy. The fries were crispy and flavorful too. I highly recommend this business. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place has to be the best Greek restaurant in the Las Vegas area. Their chicken/lemon/rice soup is fantastic and will only set you back $3.50. (with Pita bread). I also can't get enough of the feta fries . The place is small with an outdoor patio to accommodate those who don't mind melting while they eat. After you order at the counter, the friendly staff will bring the food to your table. I can't wait to come back and try some of the other options at The GREAT GREEK!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek places to eat at. This place is always clean and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas for the first time and The Great Greek came highly recommended to eat at, glad I did this place will surely not disappoint you. Great family atmosphere and very friendly, will be back on my next visit. Order the chicken rice bowl!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food!  Steak kabob and lemon chicken soup were amazing!  We always come whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would!  I arrived right when they opened, just a minute before actually and within 10 minutes, EVERY table inside was full, on a Monday!  For a quick restaurant type of environment, the service and food quality was amazing! Not to mention that while inside, it had a feeling of community/family, everyone was talking and it felt cozy.  There is a small outdoor patio with nice tables and umbrellas which would make for a great place to grab wine/beer in the evening. They have a decent little selection of each.  An overall great experience, would absolutely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Its great to have a new cuisine in the area off Blue Diamond, if you are in the area you know the choices aren't vast. With that said The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill in my opinion is not the greatest Greek you can get in town. Meraki Greek Grill or Shish Kabob House is a much fresher choice for the same value. I found the Grilled Chicken Souvlaki plate ($14.02 w/tax) at the Great Greek to be dry and mildly flavorful. The rice pilaf was cooked properly and probably my favorite part of the dish. The feta on the salad was fresh as well as the other ingredients, olive garden should ask for their vinaigrette recipe its pretty dang good! So I would have to give their salad an A+. I would cover dessert but when I was in line ordering I asked if I could get a order of Baklava but I was informed they where out (this was at about 8:15 pm they close at 9 pm). A customer behind me, which ordered (5) orders of baklava ice cream told me that the baklava dessert was awesome, sad to say I didn't get to try it. That actually might get me to go back on another night when I want a quick and easy fix for some Greek food, that and the salad. Other than that I am traveling to Meraki off Trop and rainbow. The Great Greek does stay open a little later than others so that is another plus and actually the reason I tried them in the first place, as Meraki closes at 8:30 pm. the owner was there the night I came in, great operator, friendly staff, clean establishment. I want to give this establishment a higher rating but the food was just not there for me."}
{"text":"Food is good but service has been slipping over the last year.  Last two time have have gone they took forever to bring my main course out after I got salad.  Second time brought out main dish and forgot to bring out salad first.  Then had to wait for utensils to eat while my salmon got cool.  Not good."}
{"text":"Came back today with my wife. She go the falafel Gyros and love it.  I got my traditional Gyros. It tasted even better the second time around. Bread was soft and meat and veg were super fresh. I ask for some extra peppers. Girl that work there more than happy to give us some. Great service and food. This is our go to place for greek food. :)"}
{"text":"Super tasty Greek food, had my first meal there last week and definitely won't be my last. Worth the 15 minute drive from my place!"}
{"text":"My husband and two boys are picky eaters and it hard pleasing all of them. We tried this place for the first time and WOW! The restaurant is very clean and simple, the lady that took our order was very friendly and helpful, portions are huge, and the food is fresh. We got the family meal with 4 great greek gyros, feta fries (I paid $2 more for the feta), and huge Greek salad, 4 drinks, and 4 desserts. It came out to $49 great deal to me for the amount of food. I was surprised how fresh everything was considering we went before closing time. The lamb was wonderful tender and full of flavor, the salad dressing was so good even my 11 year old loved it, and the tzaziki was so delicious and refreshing. The fries was a huge hit with all of us especially my 4 year old son. We have baklava which was good, but a bit stale considering it was sitting for the whole day. The Shamali wasn't to my liking, but it was sitting all day also. I really wanted to try the Yia Yia's rice pudding after reading all of the reviews, but she said they sold out. I will definately frequent this place, recommend it to my friends and brother (another big foodie), and bring my mom (the biggest foodie). I give this place two thumbs up and a double ok!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch on 5/27/18. Great food, everything tasted very fresh. Even the soda was good! I will say that the feta fries are great! I couldn't eat them fast enough! Next time I plan on having them with the lamb/beef gyro meat. Very clean inside & a bright room. I will definitely be back! Thank you for a tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once every two weeks. Gyros are the best in town. French fries done crisply and flavorful. This fast-serve Greek food at its finest. Food is consistently good all the time!"}
{"text":"This is my Favorite place to eat! I've been coming here for the last year and it has been amazing every time. The salad, kabob and even the soup Amazing! If you are in the area it's a must. I've been to a few other Greek restaurants but this is the best. Oh and when you stop in please do not forget to order feta fries, life changing deliciousness !!"}
{"text":"My favorite place! I just had the chicken gyro twice this week along with the feta fries that are so amazing. Delicious fries with melted feta cheese. This place has seriously never failed me. Both locations are great which is a plus because sometimes different locations are not consistent. I definitely recommend this if you want Greek food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Kind of hard to access their parking lot if you're not familiar.   Came during lunch on a Friday, it seemed busy but not too busy. There's indoor and outdoor seating available. You order up front and your food is brought to your table. The line to order moved fairly quickly and we got our food in less than 10 minutes.   We ordered two lamb/beef gyro combos (side & drink) with feta fries ($.50 extra) for about $25. The gyros had lettuce, tomato, red onion, tzatziki sauce, and feta cheese... A LOT of feta cheese. The gyro meat was moist and had good flavor. It was also sliced thicker than I'm used to. The gyros also came with a couple of small pepperoncini peppers.  The feta fries were tasty; battered fries covered in feta and another white cheese (mozzarella?). They were pretty garlicky as well. I wasn't even able to put a dent in the pile of fries as the gyro had me stuffed.   The food was solid, but nothing absolutely amazing. That being said, I would come back if I was in the area or if a companion wanted to go."}
{"text":"This place is a 10min walk from my house and I absolutely love it!!! We don't have a lot of good food in our area and The Great Greek was such a breath of fresh air! Not only was it one of the only food places I could eat while pregnant(everything made me super sick) but my daughter is 6months and I still crave this place. Iv never been given bad food. Service is always fast and AMAZING."}
{"text":"Simple fresh ingredients! I love good Greek food and The Great Greek is just that - great! Came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and the place was pretty busy. I ordered the Greek salad as a wrap. The dish was simple yet the flavor was amazing and the lettuce seemed very fresh. We also enjoyed the feta fries - you can never go wrong with cheese and fries!   My friend got the combination plate with lamb and steak and said the meat was excellent. I would return to the Great Greek and recommend it for a quick healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Henderson I've been looking for some good falafel.  I found it at Great Greek.  When my wife was out of town I ate there 3 times.  Their grilled shrimp also delicious, get it with the feta fries.  It may be a little pricey, but it's to die for.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for s great Gyro, baklava, or anything Greek head on over to the Great Greek.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The grilled garlic shrimp plate was so full of flavor, it was hard to put down. The shrimp was juicy, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The Greek salad is delicious and very refreshing. The pita bread and tzatziki is super yummy and the fries give it just the perfect crunch. A local family owns and runs the business and takes great pride in their work. It is kept immaculate and is very welcoming!  This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Now that I've been back to The Great Greek several times and have had the pleasure of trying several additional dishes on their menu, I've had to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  This really is as good as this type of food gets in this type of setting.  Everything is always fresh and delicious and the several people I've brought all think so too.  I now make it a point to come here about at least bi-weekly or more."}
{"text":"Great rice pudding. Their salad is good and gyro was decent. I will definitely try this place again. It was clean and had very good customer service."}
{"text":"Ok folks I just got done eating at this gem of a place. I have started a plant based diet (ignore the cheese)....lol. So what better food to get then Greek/Mediterranean. I ordered Dolmades, Falafel Pita with Feta Fries. First the place: it's a very clean and quaint place with both indoor and outdoor seating. The Service: Quick and Super Nice. Now to the fun. The Food: I thought the Dolmades were very good. The Falafel was DYNAMITE!! VERY TASTY and filling. Then comes the feta fries. THERE was a recommendation to add hot sauce. So I did. I wanted to jump in the fries and live there. They were divine. One side note that doesn't matter but I had to say because it was kinda cool to me. Now I'm married and happily but the amount of beautiful women coming here to eat was phenomenal. They just kept coming. Anyways! Give this place a try. You will totally love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I have a new addiction ... and its Greek.   Have tried the greek salad, gyro and rice pudding. Reasonable prices and large portions - the large greek salad usually lasts me two meals!  On the greek salad you can get, for an additional charge, your choice of added \"protein\" ... I usually choose the gyro meat.  They also give you sauce and pita on the side, so its like getting a mini gyro and salad.    On my last visit, someone in front of me inquired about the rice pudding and apparently it is made fresh / in-house.  So I had to get some to go!  WOW - it is amazing.  fresh rice pudding ... don't make a habit of eating it, but I just may need it each time I visit for a gyro or greek salad now.  Have outdoor seating also (although you look at a parking lot) but its a nice option.  order at counter and dine in, on patio or to go."}
{"text":"I joke with friends that I could easily eat here every day of the week and not have a problem with it or get sick of it. It is by far the best Greek restaurant in Henderson, and I'd argue it may even be the best in Vegas.   I typically order the chicken bowl but also really enjoy when they have lamb on their specials menu (this changes daily which I appreciate because it means the meat is very fresh). The portion is normally large enough that I have enough for a snack later in the day which makes the somewhat high price (in my opinion) worth it. All of the food here is very light and fresh and is a great pick me up after a long stressful day. The service is always incredibly friendly as well. I definitely go there regularly, and look forward to many more meals there."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Greek food prepared by a Greek family, go to The Great Greek. Fresh, high-quality ingredients. Kind & courteous staff. If I could, I would eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!! The service was a+++!!! The girl at the counter was so nice and so informative. We got the feta app with cucumbers (OUTSTANDING), I got the Greek salad (small) wth gyro meat, my husband got he rice bowl with double chicken and said it was incredible. We happened to be in the Henderson area, and pulled up yelp for a lunch spot, SO GLAD we did! So yummy, super clean, and excellent service. What more could you ask for?!  And we found out they just opened a location right near our house on Blue Diamond!! So naturally we went there the next day, LOL!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer of The Great Greek located in Henderson for quite some time. So, when I saw the sign go up that they were building a Great Greek near me I was pretty excited to say the least. My to go meal is the greek salad with gyro meat. It's always so fresh and crisp! I have tried several greek salads around town and the Great Greek remains my favorite! I recently tried their chicken skewer plate and it was delicious as well! I have noticed it's quite busy at this location as well, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This has become are go to spot for lunch and we keep coming back for the amazing food. The bonus is the customer service is great, such a welcoming enviroment.   Our usual orders consist of:  The Great Greek Bowl with Chicken, other choices are steak, shrimp or Gyro for 10.95 and salmon at MKT price  Traditional Gyro $6.95, make a combo for additional $2.95.  Tzaziki extra pita $3.95  Side of Steak Skewer $3.00  We had pretty much everything and we have liked everything they served us. They also offer daily special like Lamb chops plate or pork chop plate etc all at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I must start this review by saying, I LOVE Greek food. The flavors, the fresh vegetables, and feta cheese is a god send. With that said, I've been to my fair share of Greek restaurants in the states and The Great Greek is hands down the best place I have ever been to.   This place is ALWAYS packed, on my last visit a family of 3 had to cram into a 2 top table and I had no choice by to take mine to go (literally the only drawback to this spot is how popular it is, go figure).   My favorite items on the menu are the gyro's and feta fries and the consistency in their meals is fantastic, always delicious, always perfect. Honestly, you haven't lived without trying the feta fries (extra lemon!)"}
{"text":"We went to the location in Henderson the day prior. Had we not have gone there first, this would have been 5 stars. The food was still outstanding  -Feta dip w cucumbers  -Greek salad with gyro meat -Greek bowl with double chicken   The service was ok....... nothing great nothing bad. But after the over the top great service at the Henderson location, this location was more get you in and out and boarder line rushed you with ordering and picking up your order. Again, still a great experience, just not on the same level as Henderson!  See you tomorrow, LOL!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food spot. I travel from Summerlin to Henderson. That's how good it is. I have gotten their Gyro and athenians burger. The meat isn't too oily and is seasoned well. The feta fries are nicely seasoned and the feta is melted properly and not burnt on top of the fries. It's a small place so it's hard to find a table but the service is good and the workers are nice and helpful. Their rice bowls are good too with good amount of protein and vegetables. Will continue to get my fix here."}
{"text":"Simply the best greek food in Vegas. Gyro plate has a very generous helping of perfect meat. The rice is wonderful and the side salads are extremely fresh."}
{"text":"I order the Greek salad with chicken/shrimp skewers. It was so fresh and so satisfying! Will definitely be back! Place was nice and clean. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"My employer caters with this place once a month or so. DELICIOUS food. It is always a work favorite when we order here. Fresh ingredients and great taste!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing! We ordered through Postmates and were not disappointed. So glad we have a quality Greek restaurant in the area to keep coming back to. I highly recommend the Greek salad and beef and lamb gyro. So fresh and perfectly seasoned and made with pride. We will be back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Best Greek in town IMO. Our family's typical order is Greek salad with gyro, Greek salad with chicken skewer, and the steak souvlaki. Everything has always been outstanding. Salad is fresh, pita bread is killer, tzatziki sauce is great. Service is always friendly and pretty fast. Dining room is clean and nice atmosphere. It's our go-to for Greek in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We love the Great Greek! The service is always fast and the food delicious. Having Celiacs it's not always easy to find delicious gluten free meals when I go out to eat. We eat here about once a week! I love that they really listen and don't put the pita on my place because of my allergy. Some restaurants will accidently put it on and then remove it but I still have a reaction to it. I've not once had this happen at the Great Greek and they always take special care to make sure the pita is not any where close to my plate! I love the steak souvlaki on the plate of rice. The side salad is comes with is a traditional Greek salad. After starting with the salad I usually take half my meal home and enjoy it all over again the next day!"}
{"text":"This place has the best greek food I have ever tasted! I always order the steak kabob greek salad. It definitely does not feel like I am eating fast food. Their baklava is really good too!"}
{"text":"Food is still really good but I am through with this place. I have a family of five and every time I go, there is never any place to sit. They have four tops and two tops. The two tops are always open and the four top tables  always have one or two people taking up the tables meant for a bigger party.  I am tired of going  in and having to leave because there are no tables. Then I usually settle for Jason's deli. I don't like Jason's deli."}
{"text":"Excellent little corner Greek restaurant, authentic with a full menu of Greek specialties. Lamb soulavaki and gyros. Probably the best French fries Ive ever had !  Casual. Little pricey but quality food and generous portions. Best of all..... the best customer service Ive experienced in Las Vegas  thank you fellow behind the register!"}
{"text":"Went here again a second and third time and service was not as expected.  Second time I went after work around 4:00PM. There weren't any customers ahead of me so there shouldn't have been any problems. Took about 15 minutes to get my chicken gyro to go. Since I was off I wasn't in a particular rush so I let it slide. Food was still great so I would give it 4 stars.  The third that I went I was around 1:00PM on a Thursday. The lunch rush looked like it was about to end because many people were finishing up there food. I got in an ordered the grilled shrimp plate thinking it shouldn't take so long to make...that is if the kitchen doesn't forget order.   I sat and waited patiently for 25 minutes and noticed people that came in after me after got their food already. Nobody came to check up on my even though I was at the table right in front of the counter. I approached the counter and asked what was going on. The lady working the front looked confused and shouted at the kitchen asking what's taking so long with the order. The slip was still just hanging at the food window untouched. I couldn't wait any longer as I had to get to work and asked for a refund since my food haven't even been started yet. The lady did not even say sorry and just kept shaking her head at me as she voided my transaction.  Maybe back of the house were new? I don't know, but I was not treated very well by the front of the house. Maybe I'll try this place again later, but it's going be a long while before I come back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Staff was super friendly and helpful with the menu. The decor was very modern and fresh looking. The restaurant was set up fast food style where you order your food at the register and it is brought to you. Don't let that fool you the food isn't fast food style but gourmet Greek food. The gyro and steak souvalki was very good full of flavor. I love that they have a kids meals here not only with the traditional chicken nuggets but actually Greek food made smaller for kids. My children loved the kids chicken souvlaki and they offer it with soda or a juice box.    You have to have to order the feta frys. I've never had anything like it feta and and another type of cheese with more Greek seasoning on it so good I could not stop eating it!!"}
{"text":"Tiny spot but amazing food. The Greek fries or feta fries are beyond amazing. Even my picky kid was trying to steal my fries. This place is a must if you are in Henderson."}
{"text":"I dream about those Feta Fries! Very friendly Staff. This place makes driving all the way to Henderson worth it!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Their tzaziki and garden veggie app is amazing, the gyros are huge and delicious,  kid's meals can be made healthy and are always a hit, and the falafel is a really yummy vegetarian option. This restaurant is a true gem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch... it has a nice, fresh look to it.  I ordered the mezze plate, my husband got the greek salad with a steak skewer.  The mezze plate was good. The spanakopita was huge. The grape leaves had a great taste along with the tzaziki. The hummus was ok. I wish they had falafel on the plate too.    My husband said his salad and steak skewer were good. The salad (small) was huge. He could not finish it. This is a great spot for a fresh meal on a road of fast food."}
{"text":"First time at the Great Greek. Food deliciously fabulous. I had the lamb gyro special. It was the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, nice size plate of food for the price. I'd recommend it to anyone in the area for a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"It's a tiny space that is well lit, with a charming little fountain in the outdoor patio.  10mins before opening for lunch on a Wednesday, there's already a line outside.  I was in the mood for Moussaka but had to settle for the grilled shrimp with extra Spanakopita, while my friend had the Beef Souvlaki (grilled skewer).  We were extremely happy with EVERYTHING.    The Spanakopita was light and satisfying, the skewers (esp the shrimp) were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sides were all faultless... from the fries, tasty rice pilaf, salad to the pita and tatziki (yogurt dipping sauce with cucumber).  These large, composed plates are a treat, an in-between fast food and fine dining.  They have great service and sell wine here too!  So if you're craving for great greek grub, the drive to Henderson will be worth it."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and we love it. Never had a bad dish and the portions are huge. Staff is always friendly. The only place I go for gyros."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food, full of flavor. Downside was it was kind of pricey, and the lamb gyro was not very good because the meat was too soft so the texture was all the same. Would definitely come again if I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food everything tastes great! The burger is always picture perfect if you want french fries get the Greek feta fries! They are amazing"}
{"text":"I was running errands and I happened to pass by the Great Greek. Earlier this week I went to another Greek restaurant that was just average, so I figured I would do a round 2 and hopefully score a better experience.  I did, but unfortunately not by much. From the outside it looks like a big place, but it is actually quite small with only a handful of tables to sit down at. It is very casual, and I suspect most people are taking their orders to go.  Surveying the menu, I decided on going for hummus, and Lamb Souvlaki with fries and a bottle of water. That turned out to be much more expensive that I thought for such a casual place. But if the food was great I can justify it.  My meal started with a greek salad (comes with the entree), and that was very good. Honestly, it was the best part of the meal. The hummus with pita bread came next. The hummus was good, much better than the last place. Creamy, with some whole garbanzos mixed in with some paprika and olive oil. The pita bread was nothing special, but worked for dipping into hummus.  Then came the Lamb Souvlaki and fries. The fries were very disappointing. It reminded me of my childhood when I would make Ore Ida Zesties freezer fries. The Lamb was cooked okay, but had very little seasoning on it. It just tasted like meat. It was good quality, but not properly seasoned.  A lot of this could be forgiven if it was properly priced, but as it is I wouldn't go back. While I was waiting for my food, three ladies went to order and there total was over $70. They were shocked and just left. So I think for this class of restaurant, the price is steep. But they seem to be doing okay, lol, so perhaps it is just me. :)"}
{"text":"Quick lunch here with friends. I had the small salad with falafel. Excellent salad, liberal use of cheese, kalamata olives-watch for pits- and perfectly prepared falafel. The tziziki sauce - hey my spelling stinks- was thick and rich with a lovely flavor. Cheerful staff- eager to please. We ate outside. Very pleasant time. Locally owned. I will return next time I am in Henderson."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! I think they have really excellent pita. The salads are excellebt. I also really love the chicken and rice bowl! All their ingredients taste really fresh! What I love most about the place is that it's quick and they are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Greek spot!! Portions are very generous and the food is quality. Plus they have some of the best dolmas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"First timers, I ordered the garlic shrimp with rice plate it was delicious and more then filling. Walked in around 11:30am and it was packed, but the staff found us a table. The dining area is extremely small."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. My husband and I came here for lunch and it was pretty good. We came around 11:30am and it was just before the lunch rush. The ambience is very modern and casual. I ordered the Grill Chicken Kabob and my husband got the gyro plate. Both selections were very yummy and their fries and yogurt sauce is on point! The service was great, as well. We got our food less than 10mins of ordering it and the staff checked up on us frequently. We will definitely come back in the near future."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is super delicious and well priced!! I recommend getting the avgolemono soup which is a creamy, lemon, chicken soup! For 3.75 a bowl you can't beat it, even comes with complimentary pita bread. I also tried their great Greek gyro which had tender meat, a well flavored tzatziki, and a generous amount of feta. Lastly, my boyfriend tried their steak souvlaki plate that came with rice and a side salad. He said his steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  *** Bottom Line: The Great Greek provides well flavored food, good-sized portions, friendly service, and fair prices!"}
{"text":"I wanted to get some Greek food for lunch and found this place. I got a chicken gyro and salad. It was really good. The pita was so soft and I'm glad I didn't ask for extra feta because finally a place that puts on the proper amount!  I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"A fly in my food.  How gross. I payed $45 for take out and when we get home there was a dead fly in my wife's salad.  Did not even want to take it back as we we live in Southrrn Highlands and the girl behind the counter was extremely rude anyways so it's just not worth it.  Clean up please!! We took a loss but will never go back."}
{"text":"I love Greek food! This place did not disappoint.  The staff was friendly and the Mezze Plate I ordered super tasty and fresh.  Obviously this place is very popular with the locals because it was jam packed.   My friend and I cleared our plates and probably would have ordered seconds if we weren't stuffed."}
{"text":"Colleague recommended this place. We walked to it from our hotel after a workshop. Fresh fast food. Comes out hot. Ordered a plate of grape leaves and they were large and seasoned well Great price for 6 of them! Loved the salad bowl with warm rice, Topped it with salmon and it was delicious. Very filling meal. Casual dining, outdoor seating as well. Good prices. Vegan foods available."}
{"text":"Amazing gyros! The feta fries were delicious as well! My daughter loves the chicken fingers and fries. And I love that it tastes like real chicken!"}
{"text":"I have been searching Vegas for a long time to find a Great Greek restaurant that would make me feel like I was in the kitchen of a homemade cooked meal. My search is over. Yai Yais pastitsio can't get any better! The seasonings in the Greek salads cannot get any closer to booking a trip to Greece itself. I am in the food industry and I will send everyone I know,that has a longing for excellent Greek cuisine.It gets busy,but well worth the wait. Portions are large,price is right. You have a new customer for life. OPA!!!! Good luck to you and your family."}
{"text":"Starving, famished, desperate, and craving some Greek food, I stumbled upon The Great Greek and was so please with their delectable fresh offerings. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki plate with rice. Bascially it's grilled chicked skewers over a bed a rice. It comes with two slices of pita bread and a small greek side salad. With a small drink the whole meal cost maybe $13 which is a little pricey for lunch, but it was defintiely worth it. The chicken was so tender and juicy and the biggest suprise to me was the rice. Usually at most restaurants they just throw some rice on the plate so it looks like you got a lot of food, but oh no, I feel in love with this rice. For some reason the rice had a hint of a lemon flavor and it was just really delicious and comforting. I could have just eaten that rice by itself.   So enough of me gushing about the rice.. but bottom line.. if you're looking for some fresh Greek cooking, come try The Great Greek. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. I just tried their rice bowl which was kind of like a Cafe Rio style salad but totally Greek. I took that bad boy home and drizzled some Sriracha sauce and it was heaven.   All their food tastes so fresh and very flavorful. Some people don't do Greek food right, but these guys are great, they run a solid restaurant.  Five solid stars."}
{"text":"I must start this review by saying, I LOVE Greek food. The flavors, the fresh vegetables, and feta cheese is a god send. With that said, I've been to my fair share of Greek restaurants in the states and The Great Greek is hands down the best place I have ever been to. If you love garlic, raise your hands. If you love Greek food, raise your hands. You have reached my favorite Greek Food Location in Las Vegas. Not only do they offer great food, they sell good deserts too."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek food in Vegas. Great service, delicious and fresh food. I love the people who work here and the rice bowls and baklava"}
{"text":"5 freakin stars. This place is one of my TOP 3 spots to eat. The food is always excellent. The service is even better. The feta fries are to die for. The only complaint I have is it I wish there was some closer to my neck of the woods, Summerlin. But it's always worth the trip!! Thanks Great Greek for living up to your name!! (:"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local, family-run businesses in Henderson. Their Gyro Plate is my absolute favorite! It comes served with your choice of rice pilaf, fries, or Greek salad and then AMAZING tzatziki!! It's  super delicious - I cannot get enough of it. Yia Yia's Pastaccio (\"grandma's lasagna\") is also another great option. Oh, and don't forget their mouth watering Feta Fries!!!  Whenever I come in the staff is super friendly and personable. Zack is awesome and makes sure you're getting taken care of and that everything is to our satisfaction. The place is always clean and they have a lot of beverage options as well.   I wouldn't get Greek food anywhere else in town, this place is just too amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here to see what the hype around the feta fries was all about. They were alright, felt like I could have made them at home. Nothing really special about them, still good though. Got good service and the staff was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is great and reasonably priced! Everything looks pretty clean and the staff is very friendly. Busy spot at lunch (went to pick up lunch on a Saturday and place was packed), good thing we pre-ordered over the phone for pick up. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Greek restaurants in town.   The food! This location off blue diamond is always spot on with their gyro meat. Juicy, perfect spice blend, and generous in portions. I recommend the Gyro Plate with rice pilaf or Great Greek Gyro with feta fries if you're feeling indulgent! Haven't tried the baklava yet, but have heard amazing things about it.  Service has been top notch every time, with speedy serve times and plenty of staff to handle lines. It is an order at counter style eatery, so no table service. However, the effort that goes into the food and service deserves a gratuitous thank you. Treat them well and your tummies will thank you for a Great Greek time!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is hands down the best Greek food in Henderson/Vegas.  The girls at the counter are always great and funny.  The food has inspired a new love in me for Greek Food. Their food is always made with love and particularly their Gyros are always on point.  Go there now!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and by far the best Greek food in Vegas! Get the gyro plate!"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS   Friendly service. Love the rustic industrial ambience. We ordered the great Greek gyro, feta fries, Athenian burger & hummus.  Greek lamb gyro A+ says my husband  Feta fries C Athenian burger B Hummus A+  I gave the fries a low grade because it tastes like the fries were old & fried again.  The Athenian burger was good but not the best.  The hummus with pita bread was excellent. My husband loved the gyro."}
{"text":"I try something new every time I go! Their Gyros and Falafel are my favorite!! Must try!! So good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, especially for a quick lunch. Portions are huge food is awesome. Employees are friendly, area is nice and clean. Def recommend for anyone in the area that has a small amount of time for lunch."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes are tasty.  Love their salad dressing, tziki sauce and their fries.   The meat dishes are good too.  Unless they expand or change their menu, it can get a bit tiring to only have the same options all of the time.  Other than that, I haven't been disappointed"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant in town! Staff is consistently helpful, friendly & efficient. The food is fresh & delicious. My only concern is occasionally waiting for a table or a line because of its popularity!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Mix up on our order, but overall extremely pleased with taste and authenticity of food and customer service. Will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am sitting here now, waiting to pick-up my order to go, happily anticipating them calling my name. I have already been here several times, and it is superb each and every time. This is the best Greek food that I have ever had. Luckily, I live right down the street, so I get to visit as often as I want. I highly recommend the gyro meat, it's beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this restaurant when going to their Henderson location. Then they opened the Blue Diamond location and I have to say it's not a good representation of this company at all. The food is still good but the service.. Jesus! The girls in the front are either overworked to the point where they don't remember to smile OR they really don't smile! There's one that I try to avoid at all cost when I go. I am a regular customer and by \"regular\", I mean I purchase food from here 3 times a week at least. However, I will NOT go when that girl is there. Which is hard because I think she's part of the owners family or something? She's unprofessional, rude AND unorganized. I heard her tell the kitchen staff \"If you have something to say, you can work somewhere else\" while I was eating today. I was shocked and that was the last straw. I will not eat at this location anymore. If I ever want their food I'll make the 15 mile trip to Henderson just to avoid this chick.."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, hands down!! Always pleased with food and great service. Great Rice Bowl is terrific and the soup is a must have.  The chicken is my favorite so far, but after 9 or 10 visits I must admit I haven't tried the beef or lamb, but my husband has and he really likes them. Pita is wonderful and tender, and giros are really good too. We do feel like family when we dine here...everyone is warm and friendly, quick and efficient too. And the place is spotless. What more can you ask for? Even the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"New restaurant in Southern Highlands, which Southern Highlands greatly needs more of. The food is fresh, good portions, and lots of options. However, I'm not sure why but the food just doesn't stand out compared to my other favorite greek spots. Everything was just, okay ... not wow. Good ambiance and service though, food just mediocre."}
{"text":"If you love garlic, raise your hands. If you love Greek food, raise your hands. If you love feta! You have reached my favorite Greek Food Location in Henderson. Not only do they offer great food, they also sale beer!   I had the absolute pleasure of trying, The Grilled Chicken Souvlaki! I have now idea how to say Souvlaki, but it's amazing! For $12.95 you get two skewers of Marinated Chicken Breast, rice Pilaf or Feta Fries! Yes Feta Fries can you believe it!! check the photo out, they are in no way cheap on the Feta! My entire order came out hot, and ready to eat, the restaurant and it's service second to none. When the suns out you can eat outside or inside either or!  Other great items to try, warm pits bread and hummus $2.00 and Falefel $2.50.. gyros run, chicken $6.95 enjoy all and don't forget the gum after or the mints!! Garlic is life here! Yummmm"}
{"text":"So good...and the family really makes you feel welcome. The food is consistanly delicious. Alice makes all feel welcome. The baklava is outstanding"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek and Mediterranean places in Vegas by far. Ran across this place while losing my paycheck at Sunset Station.  Tucked away in a parking lot, it's a little hard to see or find unless you're really looking for it. There is plenty of parking at theres always a slight line and wait around dinner time. They have about 8 tables inside so it's better to order ahead and pick up.  The food here is well above average. The meat is extremely fresh and all the items on the menu are pretty authentic as far as taste.  Decided to try the lamb kebobs. 2 skewers of marinated lamb chunks, not the ground stuff, served with either rice of fries or for an up charge you can Greek fries, fries with feta. The lamb was succulent and tender. Seasoned perfectly and very juicy. The rice is to die for! Rich buttery taste and seasoned to perfection! They also give you a side salad! Whole combo is a 5/5!  Then we tried the beef kebobs. Didn't do the ground but the chunks as well. Try not to go past a medium when ordering. Smaller pieces tend to dry out. The perfect flavor combination on these skewers!  For dessert try the Greek cookies. Their take on sugar cookies leaves you wanting more and feeling like you were cheated as a child for never having these introduced to you!!  Only gripe is they tend to be temperamental at times. We've had amazing service and then we've had just ok service, all by the same people. But don't let that discourage you! Food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek place in Las Vegas! Everything tastes fresh and delicious every time. I dream of their hummus! The feta fries are to die for too. I would eat every meal here if I could!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the delicious food is always on point! Be prepared to have an appetizer, entree and dessert! An Authentic Greek Grill   Congratulations, to the owners with a beautiful restaurant and a prime location. Way to hype up the SW Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Very nice Greek restaurant on Blue Diamond and Decatur. Near Fruits & Roots and Capriotti Sandwich. They have a nice size patio and parking lot. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean! The menu offers many option \"sandwich for smaller portion\" or plates if you are very hungry! We ordered 1 Gyro plate and 1 Chicken plate. It comes with choice of rice or fries and a yummy side salad (baby romaine, red onions, feta cheese, tasty tomato & olives) It cost about $42 including 2 fountain drinks and 2 rice pudding Our order was brought to our table. The chicken was juicy and tender. The gyro meat was very good and nicely flavored. Very happy to have another great Greek in SW!! I like that they had some Franks Hot sauce, Sriracha & Tapatio available"}
{"text":"I went to this place the previous week and I'm still thinking about it. I got the great Greek gyro combo  (beef and lamb) with a salad to go. I was expecting typical gyro, but I was wrong. The sauce and the feta cheese was really good. What I really am still thinking about is the salad and salad dressing. That salad was very good, the dressing I used as additional sauce for my gyro.  This is definately a place I'm coming back to. The place is an okay size restaurant, but it's so busy there is no room to sit. That's really tells you it's a good place to eat. Just be prepared when you want to sit down and you have to wait 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great experience! We were created by friendly, informative staff. The food arrived quickly. Tasty and flavorful, but the chicken was a bit dry. We suggest trying their cheese fries. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I love love this place the food is amazing BUT if you order to go becareful, the foil container they use to put the salad in sliced my thumb! Would hate for a child or anyone to have to experience this!"}
{"text":"Go! This place is superb. Everything is fresh, the family that works here really care that you're satisfied, prices are fair, and the portions are huge. We had a felafel gyro and lamb gyro. Fabulous. If you feel like outdoor dining, no problem. They have tables with umbrellas."}
{"text":"Good solid food - great and simple greek salads, gyros, passticio and other greek favorites.  Woman who runs the counter is friendly, and all of the food is fresh, with fresh ingredients.  Has a home cooked quality to the food.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and a very picky greek eater. This was the best gyros I have ever had.  The place was packed but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Visiting from the Bay Area we discovered this gem by walking by on the way to a nearby Starbucks. Checked it out on Yelp first. What a find! Fresh delicious authentic Greek food with friendly, fast and fun staff. Generous portions and did I mention fresh and delish? My favorite is the traditional gyro but the homemade pita and dipping sauces as well as the lamb chops were all amazing too. Hubby loved the crispy falafels too. They are closing end of July for a week of renovations but check it out as soon as you can. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"So good. Been there a bunch of times and Everything that I've ordered from here tasted awesome! I do however wanna try their desserts, they looks delicious but I'm usually too full to try them."}
{"text":"The service here is very good. The Greek food here is some of the best in the valley. If you are in the mood for something fresh and fast check out the great Greek."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby went here the other day for the first time it was amazing. Service was outstanding,  food portions were big, food was super good! Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is a yummy place. We have gone to their location many times in henderson. Glad there is one closer to our house now. :)"}
{"text":"I was passing thru town on a cross country trip.  Got a Greek salad with a chicken skewer and feta fries.  It was absolutely delicious.  Tasty and filling.  And the service was outstanding.  I would eat here anytime!  What a find!"}
{"text":"I more than love Great Greek. I could eat here every day if possible. It's more than just delicious food. When I come into Great Greek I feel like a part of the family. Every person who works at Great Greek is friendly, efficient, and they make me want to come back to the restaurant. We met the owners and their family, and each of them thanked us profusely for coming to eat at their establishment. What more could you ask for?  Well, I guess you could ask for good food, but that is a given when you come to eat here. There is so much to try and not enough time! I haven't been able to eat the rice due to a gluten allergy - they did not feel confident that the pilaf was OK for me to eat (it rarely is), so I had Feta Fries instead. They were terrible. Never eat them! I will suffer the torment and eat anyone's orders if they don't want them! They're simple, overloaded with dressing and cheese - just delicious with herbs and feta. For $13 you get a Greek Salad with delicious good quality Olive Oil dressing, Pita (if you're not GF), 2 Chicken Souvlaki Skewers, Feta Fries and happiness. Could you ask for more? Their steak is also always cooked a perfect medium rare, and their shrimp are so delicious I could eat 4 skewers and still want more!  Their Avgolemono Soup is my favorite...ever. This is made with just white rice, no pilaf. Their hummus is homemade, smooth and delicious, just like everything else on their menu. What's not to love?  My husband has had the gyros and the rice bowls and loves them both. The gyros meat is good, not as salty as the meat we had back home in Chicago. He says the rice could be eaten in pounds all day long, the rice bowl is great because when you mix everything together and add a pita nothing can go wrong!   I would call ahead if you're ordering take out, or if you want to know their daily special. I've had their grilled lamb chops, and I assure you, it is worth every last dollar spent on that dinner. SO GOOD. The Greek Chicken special is one of my favorites too! You won't go wrong stopping by here! Eat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is always great.  Exceptional food with a culture of great customer service."}
{"text":"Food is generally pretty good but not exactly worth the prices. The service is decent and I have never had any issues with staff."}
{"text":"After 5 years of living here it is still I'm my opinion the best greek food in all of Vegas!  Still my goto place when looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Definitely glad this placed open near me! There were no Greek places nearby when I would want to just go grab Greek food. I love Greek food and this place did not disappoint. I got a traditional lamb gyro as well as the the feta fries. That was a great deal of food that I could not finish but worth the price for delicious food. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some great quality food!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The gyro plate and the steak souvlaki were both amazing. Rice pilaf was tasty, and the french fries were also great.   They're getting pretty busy. We showed up at around 8pm and they were out of Baklava. The owner told me they were going to have to start making twice as much. Awesome."}
{"text":"So good! I was very happy with the service and the food, you can tell everything was prepared fresh and in house from high quality ingredients. I will make sure to add this in the rotation for a fast casual meal."}
{"text":"I love this place! I haven't been to many Greek fast food places but so far, this place is my favorite. Everyone is really friendly and orders are usually pretty fast. Everytime I've come, there's always been people dining here, must mean I'm not the only one that thinks they're awesome!  I love the combination gyro- beef/lamb, so flavorful and tender and also enormous. I would recommend sharing if you aren't starving or if you can't save the rest for later. Their chicken gyro is pretty juicy and good but is basically just grilled chicken. Good option for those chicken sandwich type people lol. I also really love their feta fries. Because of them, I always request feta on top of my fries anytime I go to a Greek/Mediterranean place. Their tzatziki sauce is also really flavorful and has the perfect amount of tang. Everything is also really fresh everytime I come! Next time I definitely have to try their Baklava & plates!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is amazing and the service is above and beyond! A great lunch spot or weekday dinner. The outside patio is great when the weather is nice if you can grab one of the four tables."}
{"text":"Baklava is awesome!   So YUM!  Pretty big portions and can be shared. If there are 4 of you.... get the Family Platter... it comes with kebabs, rice, salad, grape leaves, hummuss, pita bread and bakalava.  And it's a lot of food for a really great price.  They have a small patio area so you can sit outside when it's nice.  Note... It's a fairly small family run restaurant so the wait for your food can be long.  Suggest calling ahead and getting take out."}
{"text":"I love this place. Lots of vegan options: falafel, eggplant dip, hummus, grape leaves... My omnivore bf also loved the steak gyro. But what really sets the Great Greek apart is the staff - super friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of best Greek food you will get in Henderson/Las Vegas area. The owner and staff is so friendly. Gyro combo with the Greek salad is probably my fave. It's a must stop! Little hard to find if you're not familiar with the area but it's right behind Jason's deli if that helps."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with fast food, the food at the Great Greek is made from scratch. and is fresh and flavorful and very satisfying.   Without missing a beat the staff takes care of you in a timely fashion.  The  establishment is squeaky clean and the simplicity in the decor is a sign of sophistication.  Dining at  The Great Greek is a delightful culinary experience.  I ordered our rice pudding to go because it had just been prepared and needed time to set in the refrigerator.  We ate it later that night.  What a coup!  It was the best."}
{"text":"Ordered the great geek gyro with lamb & beef, and a side of pita bread with hummus. It was absolutely delicious and was delivered in a timely manner. I will definitely be ordering more often."}
{"text":"FUN local place with impeccably fresh and authentic tastes of Greece.   Order at the counter, and be prepared to do as the locals do:  when the restaurant is full get your food to go or ask to share a table.   The line to order can stretch out the door, but moves quickly and efficiently. Lots of cooks in the kitchen on a Friday night -- we saw 6 -- cooking as fast as they  could in a kitchen we could see was stocked with authentic quality ingredients.   Kids meals re the perfect side for smaller tummies but don't dumb down for Americans: choices are 1/2 gyros, 1/2 souvlakis and other smaller portions of Greek favourites -- no chicken nuggets or grilled cheeses. TWO THUMBS UP FROM US!!   One of us had the beef souvlaki and asked that the steak be cooked rare, and IT WAS!! So many Greek places seem to be unable to cook steak rarer than medium, so we were excited! The steak was tender, deliciously seaoned, and did we say RARE??  The cup of Avgolemono soup comes studded with rice and chicken, served with a quartered pita on the side. It is easily enough for a light meal, and was so delicious we took what we couldn't finish back to the hotel to finish with breakfast tomorrow.   A side of falafel arrived fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and spiked with cardamom for extra YUM.   Two of us got the Great Greek Original Rode Bowls -- large Greek salads with a scoop of yummy rice pilaf.  These salads were made with perfectly crisp fresh leaf lettuce, seasoned chickpeas, small diced red onions, tangy pitted Kalamata olives, and a meat (chicken or beef souvlaki or gyro meat)  or fish of your choice (salmon or shrimp) or falafel, all dressed in tangy and lemony Greek dressing. DELICIOUS!!   We got an order of fresh homemade Koftiedes cookies to go.   We HEARTILY RECOMMEND this restaurant -- Henderson locals have a gem in this place!!"}
{"text":"Small busy but every time I go there, the people that work they're are so friendly. The food, oh my I get the chicken rice bowl and that is so great tasting and filling. For me it's enough for two meals. I recommend this place to everyone no matter how far they live, it's a must place to go."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit. Service was great, the young man that took our order saw right away I had 3 children,  said he would hold having our food prepared until we got a table inside.  The food was excellent, it was my oldest's 1st gyro, and he said it was amazing.. Service was great , pleasant, friendly and accommodating.  My 4 yr old are all his chicken fingers, which if you know him says a mouthful.  Thank you for the delicious food and awesome service. We will definitely be back. Got some baklava,  can't wait to eat it."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with friends before the movies, was awesome. I enjoyed the grilled shrimp and Greek salad and watched so many delicious looking entrees served around me. Have to go back and try them all!! For dessert I devoured the baklava ice cream which was heavenly. The service was great, you order up front and they bring it to your table. Truly enjoyable."}
{"text":"So I'm a little confused by this place. It took 30 min to make two gero's to go. We ordered next door a Capriottis and from this place. Within 5 min, the sandwiches were ready. 30 min to shave some already cooked meat and put on a pita? Capriottis had to cook their meat and it was done within minutes. If the food was extraordinary then I would understand it would be worth it but.... it's not.   Good luck, if you keep this up."}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Las Vegas today I enjoyed a simple, well crafted dinner from The Great Greek. True to other's comments the feta fries were unique and tasty. I was a little worried the fries would be soggy with the added cheese but they were crispy to the last bite. The gyro was warm lamb with cool veggies. A little double flavor with the white sauce on the gyro and feta fries. Knowing that now I may have gone with the falafel. All in all a delightful meal if you have a few minutes to wait for fresh made food in a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Was really excited to have a Greek place close to home but after trying was a little disappointed. Ordered the Rice Bowl. Not sure why they called it that considering there was barely any rice yet there was a lot of greens which was fresh but it drowned out the rice and you couldn't even tell if the rice had any good flavor. Had the steak with the rice bowl and asked for medium but instead got way well done not to mention it was so little meat it really wasn't even worth adding to all the greens and barely any rice. I also added the Mezze Plate so I could try a few of my favorite Greek items. The Spanakopita was the best I've ever had, the Dolmades were really tiny and had no flavor, the Falafels were really dark brown which I can assume was way over cooked, the Tzatziki sauce was watery, and the Hummus was extremely lemony. I love lemon but not as the main taste in my hummus. I guess I won't be having Greek food so close to home after all because I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The great greek has awesome food.  I live right around the corner and come here often.  I get a greek salad wrap with chicken and feta fries. Sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Place was crowded, while waiting to order the rest of our party sat at a table, when we were approached by a white haired man (who said he was the owner) and told us \"tables are for people AFTER they order\". Really?  You need 6 people in line when 2 know what to order.  Ended up leaving  & going to Millers Ale House around the corner.  Guess the \"owner\" doesn't want us!  Have to find a new Favorite Greek place"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and had seen some good reviews plus been recommended from a few friends to try this place out. It was good but nothing to really make it stand out from any other greek/ Mediterranean restaurant I have tried! Not worth going out of your way!"}
{"text":"Ive been here three times and the food is exceptional. If you have never had a gyro that you cared for you need to try one more time at the Greek.  All the meats are done to perfection on their grill. The steak and lamb are moist and tender. Crowded at lunch time, but there is a reason for that."}
{"text":"Great shish kabob especially their chicken. I never get tired of their food and I'm here even on a Saturday"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. Really enjoy eating here. The foods great the service is great. The great Greek is just great."}
{"text":"Really really good food. The place is clean, the food is fresh, the service is fast. It's nice to have more food options in the Southwest of Vegas."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek restaurant I've been to. The staff is awesome and the food is delicious.  This is my spot!"}
{"text":"The Greak Greek is one of the best things that has happaned to our neighborhood. The Fries alone are worth the trip and I believe the Chef has created an amazing deal for a $5 Gyro which makes Subway look like a Ford parked next to a Rolls Royce. If you are looking for an affordable place to eat that serves quality fresh food at its finest then go to The Great Greek."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD! My favorite place to get my Mediterranean craving. This place has the best hummus and the best rice pilaf I've ever had. The lamb is my personal favorite cut of meat, but the chicken and beef are great too. The falafel is good but needs to be eaten right away since it gets quite dry quickly. And oh my goodness, the rice pudding is the BEST way to end a meal here, a must have in my opinion. I've had homemade rice pudding for years and this is just as good (maybe even better but don't tell my mom that)."}
{"text":"Love this food!!! Can never get enough!!!! I come here at least once a week!!! We always get the chicken Greek salad!!! The portions are big and I always have left overs. Staff is very friendly and when I call in my order it is always ready for me when I arrive!!!"}
{"text":"I am usually really generous with my stars and giving the Great Greek 3 stars is me being generous. I wasn't super impressed with the food here. We got one chicken and one steak Gyro and although huge in size, there is too much feta cheese on it to really get the flavor of the meat and the rest of the sandwich. We also got a Greek side salad and overall it was ok. I will not be coming back to eat here because at almost $20 bucks for dinner, I would rather make something at home."}
{"text":"As far as I am concerned this place is tied with Milos at the Cosmopolitan as far as taste, authenticity and freshness. I am always willing to make the trek to Henderson so my pleasure that there is one in the SW can't be measured.  If you love Greek food - do not sleep on The Great Greek."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch a while back and it was packed so we went to Jason's deli across the way. This time I found a seat I ordered the Great Greek rice bowl which is a 9\" bowl with a base of rice pilaf covered with Greek salad and two skewers of chicken. Everything was phenomenal. I really enjoyed the quality of the food. I ended up coming back the next day and ordering the falafel and tzakiki sauce. The falafels were some of the best I've tasted no exaggeration and the sauce actually came with a pity bread which the menu doesn't mention but was a pleasant surprise so I had some pita falafel sandwiches with tzakiki sauce fantastic. I will try everything on the menu eventually and I will also bring my girl here cause she loves this type of food. Oh yea the people that work there are awesome friendly and attentive I really like this place keep doing what you're doing guys n gals!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek spot to go to for lunch or dinner!! I've been looking for years in Las Vegas of a good spot and I swear this is it! And it's conveniently close! I think their food is so fresh, and my favorite is their shrimp & rice  I come here about 1x a week if not more."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken gyro! Friendly folks and fresh food. I have passed this place many times and never even noticed it. Thanks to Yelp reviews, Torrance and I decided to give it a try... and I am glad we did! Torrance had the beef/lamb gyro with feta fries. I had the chicken gyro with regular fries. We both ate every morsel, it was so good.  2 combo meals cost us a little over $20. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. My all time favorite Mediterranean place & I've lived in a few states. I used to live in Pahrump, now Summerlin & I still make the commute whenever I'm craving something Greek. I have not one complaint. The staff is amazing and always so welcoming. It is a small cozy business, but plenty of seating outside if you have a larger group. :)"}
{"text":"I am so excited that a The Great Greek location has opened closer to my house in the SW. The food is delicious and the customer service is excellent. One of my favorite places to eat and I cannot wait to become a regular again!"}
{"text":"I know everyone raves about the Gyros, but the Souvlaki plates here are incredible. Skip the Feta Fries and check out the rice pilaf. You won't be disappointed.  This place has great service but small dining room. It's perfect for grabbing some food to go."}
{"text":"Great gyros, nice portion and full of flavor. Plates come with good portion of rice and salad. All of it's was great, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The staff was not friendly. Nobody smiling at all. It's like they could care less if your there.  Gyro meat was very good  Fries were half cooked and mushy.  Probably won't be back mainly because I did not feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is sooooo good.  My only complaint, it needs more menu items!"}
{"text":"Dear Jerry G, On May 11, at 4:30, we placed an order of your House Special Pork Chop, the lady said it'll take 10-15 mins. We came at 4:45 and I sent my son to get our food, they took my son's pay but did not give him a receipt and told him we had to wait another 10 mins. after the 10 mins, it yet was still not ready, I was furious, I finally went inside to see what was the hold up, and they said that they didn't want to serve raw pork. like are you serious?, Who does that! I finally got everything by 5:05. If I knew it would take more than 30 mins to cook my dry pork chop, I would've chose another place to eat. They also need to stop telling people that it would take 10-15 mins, when it take 30 or more minutes.   P.S. This is the first time I've ever written a review on a restaurant because of how many flaws and how much I was disappointed. I didn't enjoy my food because of this, yet this would've never happened if they told the truth of the time."}
{"text":"very average.  I got a gyro sandwich.  the meat was overdone.  lettuce was starting to wilt.  there was very little tzatziki sauce.  when I asked for additional sauce I was charged $1.00.  told her it was light on sauce.  still charged me.   nothing more annoying than feeling like they are trying to get every last cent from you."}
{"text":"I wish I was a better review writer so that I could do this place justice.  That being said, I'll try anyway.  The food here is amazing!  The portions are large and everything tastes fresh.  I have had the gyro plate, falafel pita, and feta fries.  The feta fries are really addicting.  I am normally super picky about falafel and usually only like it if it is homemade.  The falafel here is quite possibly the best I have every tasted, it is flavorful and isn't dry (the problem I have with most places).  My mom came here with me and said it's the best baklava she has ever had.  This is definitely my favorite place to eat in Henderson.  The woman that works the counter (the owner?) is super sweet and friendly on top of it all.  I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This great food is so good! The ingredients are so fresh it makes me wonder if they have their own garden. We come here each time we passed through Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The food is really good here, but finding a seat is sometimes hard! They are busy and the restaurant is almost always full! The staff is helpful and extremely friendly which makes the atmosphere fun and enjoyable! Portions are appropriate for the price too!"}
{"text":"The freakin best.  Those feta fries... lord have mercy!!! Must try.  The gyro meat is very good as well, flavorful and tender.  I'd prefer crispier but that's minor.  The gyro plate is very filling,  loved the salad and rice and pita with the meat."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last week and was very impressed. The food was fantastic. Would have loved a few more small pieces of pita with the kabab dinner, but it was nothing short of fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner. Looking for something to eat. came across this place online. Through yelp. On our way to our hotel in Lake Las Vegas. We called and placed a pick up order. Not knowing what to expect. Hoping that it will be decent at least. We ordered the chicken kabob, rice and salad. The portions were large. Salad was placed in a separate container. Which kept it crispy and fresh. Chicken was tender and so good. Overall so pleased by the results. We took a chance and so happy we did. They had my order ready and they even made me my own personal dressing for the chicken. Loved loved the food. Thank you for not disappointing. We will definitely return once we come back in town.   Only negative thing I have to say was. Google maps has a different directions then where it was actually located. But wasn't hard to figure  out the mistake once we arrived. But yet confusing especially from a non local."}
{"text":"We've eaten here once a week if not more since they opened. Food is is fresh, fast and taste amazing. Love how they ask you want your steak. The usual is the great gyro and a steak plate and a small side of hummus....and the FETA FRIES!! Those are a must try. You can also do a mixed plate... I do steak and shrimp sometimes. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is they messed up on my to-go order, nothing big just forgot my small side of hummus but was refunded for it.  Put it this way, I don't review anything but I just want people to know how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Love the gyros and the feta fries. A little pricey. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious food! I always feel  welcomed.  My favorite is the shrimp skewers and hummus! I've tried almost everything on the menu and can't say one bad thing."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great and fantastic customer service. I usually order the gyro plate with side salad and drink. Gyro meat is perfectly cooked and the salad isn't overly drenched with dressing. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Read good reviews about the place on yelp and it didn't disappoint me or my wife. The service is very welcoming and the food tasted equally better. Would definitely  recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers! Very much enjoyed our meals and the friendly people. Portions are huge and tasty. The night we went there were several tables that had ordered one of the special family meals (looked like a good deal). The baklava seemed especially good (albeit still very sweet). I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"YES. Let's get this out of the way: I am born and bred in Astoria, Queens, NY (Greek hub of NY). I'm half Greek. I can tell you about Greek food. Being out here, I didn't expect to find such a great place to eat, but I did, and it was awesome.   The Great Greek is a fast-food, very casual style restaurant that seems popular for both dine-in and take-out. With my family of 5 people, some of us were hungrier than others, so we opted for the Meal #2: 2 dips, 8 pita, 8 dolmades (rice stuffed grape leaves), Greek salad, rice pilaf (or french fries if you want), 8 meat skewers, 4 desserts, and 4 drinks. It was the perfect amount of food.  The grape leaves were tender and flavorful, the salad was huge and modestly dressed (I like a ton of feta, so I wish there was a little more), there was more pita bread than we knew what to do with, but that was chewy and served warm. For dips, we chose hummus and tzatziki. Both were creamy and tasty as heck. It tasted, though, like the tzatziki was made with sour cream rather than Greek yogurt. It lacked the pungent tang I expect, so it had a softer flavor but it's a personal preference. The rice pilaf was perfectly cooked and lightly lemony.   The meat skewers! SO GOOD. We got 4 chicken and 4 steak, cooked medium. Dude, the meat was tender as hell, well-seasoned, and surprisingly juicy. It's the kind of food that makes you wish you were hungrier so you could eat more. We were all so stuffed that we ended up taking the dessert to go - baklava. But later that evening with coffee, it was delicious.  It needs mentioning that the service was incredible. Maybe I'm just used to rude New Yorkers, but the staff here was very friendly and accommodating.   Overall worth driving to for the great food and atmosphere. Man, I have some very exciting leftovers."}
{"text":"Since our original visit, we have eaten here 6 or 7 times (Just about every time we are in Vegas). Every meal has been outstanding, the place is immaculate and the service has been excellent. If you like Greek food, this is definitely a must-try when you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has the best service and the best food. We come here atleast twice a week. The staff knows us already and we love coming here !"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!   Everything here is incredible!  If you want a great family style restaurant run by a great family, make the drive out to Henderson and check out The Great Greek!!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was delicious and the customer service was awesome! I ordered the lamb gyro and the rice pudding and both were delicious. My sister and her husband are both vegetarians and they left full and happy as well."}
{"text":"Always delicious! I have been to this place too many times to count! It never disappoints. Even when it's slammed the service is northing but great! Love coming here!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Las Vegas and Henderson. Needs to be bigger but the inside is clean and service is great. Food is fresh and made to order. I go with my parents and brother so we get the family meal which is 4 gyros, a big thing of French fries, a big Greek salad, and 4 desserts.. AWESOME"}
{"text":"Great food! So happy it's close to my house. Great pita bread and hummus they will give u more if your sitting down to eat but make sure if your ordering to go you order extra pita bread they do not give enough.  Tomatoes in salad are little big I always cut them smaller. They once Ran out of rice ...... thought that was really weird but substituted fries . Great chicken tenderness and flavor"}
{"text":"i think this is the best greek food i have tasted in las vegas....i lived in new york before coming here ...and the food here is excellent.....the staff that works here is very friendly......i would highly recommend this place......"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros, we come here every time we are in town. Def a must have if in Henderson! The large gyro salad is my go to when I need some greens that have a little protein and flavor to help wash down all that healthyness. The baklava is worth trying if your diet can spare the extra amplifier of sugar but in my opinion well worth the extra time at the gym to indulge now and again. The specials that are posted daily are usually really tasty I had the salmon avacado wrap as a special and was sooo good."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I saw they were building this super close to home. Naturally, when it first opened my boyfriend and I visited. The space was a bit smaller and it was super busy. Not complaining tho, I'm sure everyone else wanted to try this place out.  Customer service was good. The staff is super friendly and very professional.   I would recommend the feta fries! Ugh. To. Die. For! No complaints here! I will def be back."}
{"text":"Great food...staff...whats not to like??  Quality at its best and prices are unbelievably low compared to other places"}
{"text":"I ate there today with my kids and grandmother. She in in the early stages of dementia and acts out with unprovoked hatred and anger at the worst possible times, today at lunch was one of those...The food we ordered was all DELECIOUS! Service, unbelievable, they could not do enough to try to accommodate us. They were challenged today with an elderly customer who at first glance is a bitter old bitch, they were understanding and patient and no matter the insults being unjustly screamed-she complained about EVERYTHING, the yummy food, clean tables, great service etc. the young man and woman remained professional, kind and attentive. I would go back based on their authentic food alone but their customer service went well beyond amazing.  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food!   The Gyro plate is such a GOOD DEAL! You get so much Gyro meat for your money. They give you a Greek salad, that is really fresh. Then you get a choice between fries or rice. And they give you so much Gyro lamb and beef.   And it was really delicious.  The girl working the counter was very friendly. Restaurant was clean and so was the bathroom.   I live about 15-20 minutes from here but I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The Great Greek NEVER disappoints. Another fantastic meal! Chicken Souvalki Plate -.Excellent! Steak Souvalki Plate - Excellent! Yia's Yia's Pasta Dish - Excellent! Side Salad - Fresh and Excellent! Side of Rice - Excellent   As always my takeout order was packed so securely and everyone that works here are so nice."}
{"text":"I was dying to try this location and just like their Warm Springs location this restaurant did not disappoint. The freshness and flavors and service are EXACTLY the same as their other location. Quite impressive!  I have to add the consistency clearly states how well run this business is. My favorite meal is the Original Greek Rice Bowl. The flavors just work so perfectly together. I order it twice a week!.....it's a huge salad consisting of perfectly seasoned rice on the bottom topped with the freshest, flavorful greek salad you'll ever taste. I always get a chicken skewer on top and the chicken is consistently cooked to perfection. Their tzatziki sauce is outstanding too. The food here is always so fresh and flavorful I just keep coming back.   My only complaint is I wish they'd open a restaurant around the Anthem/Eastern Ave area. PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't gotten my food yet but there is a line out the door and the vibes are just so good. Everyone who works here is so happy and seems to know every person in here by name. It's bright, clean, and popping. Though I had to wait in line awhile to order, I can already tell it's worth the wait. Great environment!"}
{"text":"I just love this place . The food is just so good, Staff is very friendly , they treat you like family. I really like that they have specials going on every week. To have a big menu with a lot of things on it. I recommend it to everybody"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town!!! And the Avgolemono soup is amazing! The soup is a must! And Jack is truly an asset,  he always has a friendly smile, and a heartfelt greeting. He remembers people, and and is genuinely glad to see them again."}
{"text":"The food as always is absolutely delicious. They deserve the 5 stars...  But sadly disappointed with my delivery today. I was missing 1 chicken skewer which was my daughters lunch. I called and apparently they are closed for the day.. at 1 pm??"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for first time.  Recently moved from San Diego.  The slightly higher priced menu was absolutely worth the quality of the food and the quantity; there is no short changing.  The shrimp were tender and flavorful on the salad.  The gyro was jam packed and the meat popped.  The gentleman running the cash bay was spot on and actually made me feel like they were happy to see us.  Would eat here again and was added into the retinue of restaurants in Henderson.  Super happy.  Pretty fast service also which was surprising for how large an order."}
{"text":"Came here after shopping around at Costco. We ordered the gyro plate with feta fries and a rice bowl to go.   The mini salad that came with the gyro plate was BOMB. Just be careful for the olives... they still have seeds in them and you could easily break a tooth if you aren't paying attention. I loved the feta fries because they had a nice crunchy coat/soft center with a strong garlic taste. I recommend not ordering this if you plan on going out afterwards because your breath may stank.   I think each dish was hovering around $10 to $12 range which was not too bad considering the decently large portion sizes and fresh ingredients. The meat was quite tender and flavorful which was a huge plus.   The guy working the register today was a cool dude. Very customer service savvy and eager to serve the patrons of the restaurant. All in all, I would recommend people to come check out this place especially if you are craving some fresh greek food.   I haven't tried the wraps at this location, but that is on my list of things to try here."}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing service. I either order yhe steak souvlaki or the shrimp skewers with the feta fries. The gyro plate is also really good as well. If youre really hungry, try some of their deserts!"}
{"text":"After working at Estiatorio Milos inside of the Cosmopolitan for over three years, I'm a little spoiled and critical when it comes to Greek food. This is my third time visiting and each time it doesn't disappoint.   The restaurant was packed and every table was taken at 2PM on a Thursday. I was on that side of town after hiking in Boulder City and was running late to class, but decided that a chicken gyro was worth being 15 minutes late for. After having a few gyros from Paymon's and having issues with being skipped on hummus, I was worried that I would have to ask for extra tzatziki with my gyro but after seeing the monster of a sandwich that came out, I knew I was in great hands. So much chicken, so much sauce, the pita was perfect- a week later I'm still dreaming about it.   While waiting for my sandwich their cashier was sweet enough to let me try their vanilla cookie which was just as delicious and satisfyingly sugary. I can't wait to come back and am thinking of making the 30+ minute drive from my house just to have another gyro!"}
{"text":"Excellent quick serve Greek food. I ate at their other location in Henderson a couple of times, and I'm super happy to see a Westside location. Their food is excellent, always fresh, and I really like the atmosphere. Best gyro in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ive now gotten take-out here a few times and ordered meals for multiple people at work. And I have to say they have exceeded my expectations both times. The food is delicious and the stuff is fantastic! Thanks again honey bunches!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I ordered here for lunch. I got the greek bowl with the gyro meat. EXCELLENT! We all were greatly pleased! Only wish they delivered."}
{"text":"By far, the best Greek food in the valley. The feta is mild and delicious. It is always busy so be prepared to wait for a table but it is well worth  the wait. The gyros are delicious. The salads are superb. The staff is nice. It is just good food period."}
{"text":"Delicious little Greek spot! The food is delicious and the service is fantastic!! It is always busy when I'm there, but I think that's just a testament to how great this place is. (Okaye, the space is a little small as well) definitely plan on coming here more often."}
{"text":"I can confirm that the food is excellent and the people are friendly. My chicken gyro was way more tender and flavorful than what I have come to expect from normal Greek joints. Excellent, in fact. And since my order took all of 10 milliseconds longer than my server deemed appropriate, I got a slice of complimentary cake! Yay for Great Greek!"}
{"text":"Delicious every single time! You can't go wrong with the traditional gyro. The place is nice and clean and has plenty of seats if you want to dine in, but I usually call ahead and get carryout."}
{"text":"Tried for 1st time 10/4/14, everything we had was awesome! Athenian burger, chicken gyro, soup, and feta fries are worth the calories. The service was very friendly and they have outdoor patio seating which we enjoyed. Will be back."}
{"text":"So.... We are really getting in to Mediterranean food.  We found this local eatery and we were very pleased.  The food was flavorful and fresh.  We will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant probably 4 times so far and I'm surprised I haven't given a 5-star review yet! Quite possibly the best chicken gyro I've ever had and their salad is right there with it (those are the only 2 things I've had).  One thing I did notice though is that the time it takes for food to come out can be long. I know that it bothered me a couple times primarily bc I had a to-go order and needed to get back to class, but the food took over 30 minutes to come out. However, the flavor and quality of the food made up for it. Just know that this isn't a stop and go kind of restaurant.  Prices are fair for what you're getting. Middle eastern/greek food is always going to be on the more pricier side, but then again its the quality that matters so the prices here are decent.  Service is great and everyone is nice over there! I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I don't write great reviews but I'm in love with this place. The service is awesome and the food is better. Favorite place to have lunch during my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We were near the galleria and searched up food places in the area, and this place popped up. I read the reviews and hey who doesn't like good greek food? So we decided to try it out. Glad we did. We walked right in with no wait even though the place was poppin. The staff was friendly we asked him what we should get and he told us about the chicken bowl. It had everything you could think of in it. Kalamata olives, feta cheese, fresh tomatoes chicken on a skewer, rice and mixed lettuce with a tasty vinaigrette. It was soo good. I recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Got the Mezze Plate appetizer and the Rice Bowl with Gyro meat. Both were super tasty and portions were plentiful. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We came to dine and usually my wife or me will get a table while the other orders our meal. Well the cashier male who is always congenial with us told my husband in front of everyone to hold off sitting at a table. We were embarrassed and left the establishment. Long story short we thought seating was first come first serve and feel this treatment was unnecessary. We ended up eating at Mimi's."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, The food was very flavorful. Ordered fries w/ feta but they forgot the feta, but that's ok bc the fries were hot and crispy.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!  From the staff to the food. Even the free smells as you walk by are amazing. I've eaten at that location for 2 years and never a disappointment, ever. The lady that owns it is so sweet and even her sons that run it now are always friendly. Any way you want the food is how they will make it and they always remember me and what I want.  Love this place and will always go back!"}
{"text":"Been coming here every other day the last 2 weeks because the food is great! Tonight we ordered for pick up and our order was missing the Pita bread & one of our plates did not come with much meat. We usually don't have issues but bummed out about this missing pita haha."}
{"text":"So impressed!  Food is incredible.  Service is just as great!  Am devouring the Great Greek Rice Bowl with chicken as I type this.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"They catered a meeting for my local Labor Union and it was a hit. Not even salad left over. The gyro kit was perfect so everyone could build the sandwiches how they like them. Plenty of food for everyone. Everything was fresh and it came with lots of tzatziki. Super nice staff. They even fit my order in at the last minute while already having aa bigher cstering order at the same time. That is awesome customer service. We will be coming back for dinner for our meetings again."}
{"text":"We had a delicious late lunch today. Brittany was super helpful and friendly. The food is fresh and flavorful. The feta fries were pretty damn good!!! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Seems to be family owned. They were all very nice and genuine.  I feasted on the gyro plate. Very good portions. The food came out hot and delicious."}
{"text":"The food here is close to perfection in every Greek way. Reasonably priced and delicious. The only drawback is that  it does get busy here at dinner time and there are not that many tables so you may have to order to go. Great service and once again this is probably the skimpiest food review I will ever post because everything here is really good! You can't criticize perfection, the end."}
{"text":"I HATE HUMMUS, but bought some for my wife... I devoured the hummus here! Had the Gyro and feta fries which came with a salad....I practically licked the plate clean! To top it off,  I finished the meal off with some Baklava....perhaps the best thing I've ever ate! Run to this place, do not walk! It is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Was in for Labor Day weekend w/ the family, visiting ... family.  Asked My sister n Law, \"Wha's goo' 'round hurr\" ( terrible texan accent, maybe it's 'cuz I'm not from there)  She had no clue and I had to whip out the phone.  I was looking for something healthy, quick and nearby and .. BAM!  This lil' place had good reviews and I hadn't had a gyro in 4-5 days!  Got there 5 min. after they opened, there was a chick taking pics of a plate ... prob. for some paper/mag. and the guy looked greek, the lady that took my order looked greek, so I was pretty confident that this place was going to be good.  11:15, this place was busy, no seats available and when I saw the Gyros come out, I knew why.  Everything was fresh, except for the pickled stuff, obviously ,,,and I think they make their own Tzatziki sauce since I've haven't had cucumbers in long strips.  Delish!  I highly recommend this place because they were not stingy on the proteins and that's always what most places skimp on.  took away a star since my order was lost in the shuffle due to a guy being late and didn't know who ordered first.  There is also outdoor seating but who the hell wants to sit out in 110 degree shade.... yeesh."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is amazing.  Seriously.  Uh-may-zing.  The lamb gyro, the spanakopita, the salad, the steak souvlaki, the shamali, for all that is good in the world, come here and try them all!   Seriously.    I cannot express enough how good the food is here.  The rice pilaf, the rice is loose and flavorful and filling.  The spanakopita is fluffy and dense at the same time (yeah, I don't how that happens, but yes, just yes).  The souvlaki, oh, hello super flavorful and rich meatiness on a skewer.  The salad, there is something addictive about the dressing, and I really appreciate the olives having the pit.  The gyro, well, this is how most people judge a Greek place, and I can say that it is flavorful (everything in this place is flavorful, you cannot go wrong), sliced at just the right thickness, and just works so well with the tzaziki, vegetables, and pita.    Oh and the shamali, dense poundcake like with an orange infused in it, a great way to end a meal.   I have only eaten on carryout, so I can't speak for the waitstaff, but the lady at the register, she is such a welcoming and kind person.  She really does make you feel like you are in her kitchen and you're a guest."}
{"text":"This is my second time in the area and this place is 100% worth a repeat visit. Let's face it, there are tons of places to eat in the area, but I felt I would be disappointed if I didn't come here!   The staff are super friendly and it's very clean inside. The menu is simple and easy to navigate. You order at the counter and they deliver the fresh meal to your table.   They sell wine & beer but I came for the  Avgolemono Soup $3.50, Classic Greek side salad with falafel $7.50.  Fountain drink= $13!  Did I mention how nice the staff is? Everyone here seems to enjoy their job and takes pride in their food."}
{"text":"This was such a delicious meal! I had the Gyro and feta fries and I was shocked with how good it looked and tasted. I will definitely make it back out here some day :)"}
{"text":"Great Greek food :)   What else do you need to know? We got chicken gyro and steak gyro plate. So delicious and fresh! I couldn't stop eating. The place is small and very busy. But totally worth the wait - great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Real greek food! Delicious fresh and over all beyond expectations! You should go! Food coma !"}
{"text":"Great interior, clean bathrooms, importantly a great lamb gyro. Awesome lamb burger too!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food! Tried the gyro and side of rice and loved both however seating is limited. Maybe 12 tables plus a bar like counter. Went here on a weekday evening and took the last table. They do carryout as well!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to try this place out and decided it was well needed.  I ordered a gyro platter, which I figured would give me a solid impression of the overall quality of the food. Their gyro meat is tender and moist, always a good sign for the hungry patron. Diced tomatoes complimented the meat well, which was PLENTIFUL. They served it on that standard white flatbread that you see at a lot of places. Not my favorite choice of bread but it was not problematic. The tasty cucumber yogurt sauce was authentic, as expected. The salad was pretty delish-- it had that ever so tasty olive in it and that yummy vinagrette dressing. Their rice had a nice wholesome taste to it but I wouldn't have minded a bit of extra seasoning in it. The fries were good but also could have benefited from some additional seasoning.  I'm very much looking forward to trying some of their kabob dishes and specialty salads in the near future.  Final verdict: good quality, authentic greek food, served in plentiful portions."}
{"text":"Went to great greek with a group on Saturday and ordered the chicken Shawarma Salad, the Beef and Lamb Gyro fries hummus and Tatziki. Overall the meal was great and everything seemed awesome. Until night time 3/4 people in our group all had extreme stomach discomfort. We were all sharing food so I can't pin point exactly which dish did this to us but we hadn't eaten anything else the rest of the day so we are guessing it was the food we had."}
{"text":"When I found this place off blue diamond I immediately fell in love! So good I returned 2 nights in a row! And am yet to be disappointed. I got the hummus and pita bread for appetizer and you can tell right away the pita I quality either home-made or locally sourced based on the freshness. Went with the great Greek gyro combo (beef) which comes with a side Greek salad and a drink. The auto was huge portion and the salad was dressed properly (not too much dressing) I also tried the mezze platter for an appetizer that gave you a good variety of Greek finger food and everything was amazing! The second night I got the shrimp plate which was also a hefty portion for the price with amazing flavor start to finish!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people. I got the burger, which was very good, and my wife got the chicken gyro wrap, she liked hers too. Place was packed, always a good sign, the food is superb."}
{"text":"I've stopped in a few times and there's always a steady stream of people. If that's not a sign, I don't know what is... Actually, my bf says that he sometimes passes by people picketing a labor dispute here, but I guess those signs don't deter anyone. Like they say, \"there's no such thing as bad publicity...\"  Talking strictly food, I do enjoy ordering from here. Even though the beef/lamb gyro seems to be a customer favorite, I prefer to get the grilled chicken option. The traditional gyro ($6.95) comes with tomatoes/red onions/tzatziki, while the Great Greek gyro ($7.95) includes that plus lettuce and feta. Worth getting the latter. Love me some feta cheese. The traditional plates range from $11.95 to $13.95, which include your choice of protein, along with a Greek side salad, pita bread, and your choice of rice pilaf OR french fries. Plenty, plenty food. I've only bummed off a few bites from my bf's plate, but their rice pilaf's good -- light and lemon-y.  Tip: Order ahead of time online using ChowNow. It'll save you from sitting around and waiting for 20 or so minutes. The first time we went, the poor cashier was handling both for-here and to-go orders, AND bussing the tables."}
{"text":"Good place for fast food.  They have a great service, all the Employees were super nice. I ate the chicken skewers with rice and it was delicious! Will absolutely go back for more.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Two words: Falafel Pita.   I'm not lying when I say that The Great Greek's Falafel Pita is the best I've had. Bold statement, yes, but I have my reasons.  FOOD I made my order into a combo and chose a side of fries over the salad (not this time, lettuce). The combo also comes with a drink which I wasn't aware of, because I'm accustomed to dining at Greek and Mediterranean restaurants that normally charge extra for beverages.  +Falafel Pita: Hummus, shredded lettuce, diced onions and tomatoes, and ground falafels all wrapped in a soft, warm pita and topped with a pepper. To say that it was \"good\" would be an understatement, so just look at this photo instead: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BJO8YVuJQo1jVeyGoDovuw&userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg).   One of the main reasons why I like Great Greek's Falafel Pita is that It's easy to eat. Unlike the ones from other Greek and Mediterranean restaurants I've eaten at, Great Greek breaks down the falafels, thus making it easier to consume. I couldn't help but think, \"Duh, why didn't anyone think of this sooner?!\" while I was eating my pita. It just makes sense! Breaking down the falafels saves me time from having to unwrap my pita and eat my falafels with a knife and fork.   +French Fries: Originally, I wanted to order a side of Feta Fries, but taking into consideration that this was my first time dining at this establishment, I stuck with my combo's fries. Deep fried, golden brown, and crunchy, the fries are delicious as they are. I can only imagine how wonderful they would taste like with crumbled feta cheese on top.   SERVICE Restaurants where the employees greet you with a smile are a plus in my book. When I first walked in, I was welcomed by the kind lady working at the counter.  The food here is quickly made and served right to your table within 10 minutes, so you won't have to wait too long to eat.  OVERALL Their Falafel Pita combo has won me over, and now I *have* to try everything on their menu, as well as their baklava that's displayed right there on the counter, ready to be consumed."}
{"text":"Amazing. That's all I can say. I tried a lot of different dishes and everything was better than the last! I'm craving it as we speak :) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect the food to be this good. The staff is incredibly friendly! I am definitely going to come back and recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is everything you would expect from a Greek restaurant: gyros, salads, baklava, you know the drill. The interior is sleek and modern, and the staff were friendly.   The Great Greek has a perfect location if you live in that part of town, since you literally turn right off of Blue Diamond to access the restaurant, perfect if you're craving greek on the way home from work. Give them a call, order up, and your food will be ready by the time you arrive.   The food is good, but nothing that will particularly blow you away. The tzatziki was noticeably creamier than other tzatziki sauces I've had in the past. It was an interesting change of textures, but was slightly ruined by the fact that they LAYERED that s*** on my gyro. Unless you're into that, be mindful when ordered and maybe ask for it on the side to control your own destiny.   Overall, it's nice to have another Greek restaurant, but Stephanos is still the undisputed Greek God when it comes to Greek food. The Great Greek is...good, but I'll have to visit a couple more times and have something magnificent before I would consider it 'Great'."}
{"text":"Husband & I travel between Las Vegas & SoCal frequently. BUT we have not found a better Greek Restaurant like The Great Greek! I get the chicken skewers & he gets the steak bowl. If I could eat it everyday I would. I mean it.   Place is always popular so get there early or order take out or delivery thru grubHub."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean food so we decided to try this place out for lunch on a Saturday.  The place has indoor and outdoor seating which would be nice on a warm day. (we sat indoors as it was not) Very casual dining atmosphere.  The food was very good and the price was very reasonable. I had the Gyro sandwich combo with soup and a drink and it filled me up.  The only downside that prevented me from giving 5 stars was that the Baklava that I ordered never came... The brought out all our food except for the baklava but since we were so full we forgot about it until we got back home... so partially our fault too I guess??  Either way, good food, good service, good price = Will be back.  Good to take friends, family, coworkers, and a date."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite local place. Yes, I know Vegas has lots of great restaurants, but this one makes me feel like a nice Greek family invited me over for dinner and served AMAZING food!  I've tried a little bit of everything but my absolute favorite dish is the gyro rice bowl. First of all, it's delicious. The meat is always perfect, the rice is seasoned just right, and the portion is big enough you can squeeze three meals out of it.   I've also had the gyro and chicken pita sandwiches, but to be honest, I go for the rice bowl everytime. Also, the lady who runs the restaurant is always so nice and attentive. I love eating here."}
{"text":"They have the best Gyros in Vegas! It's worth the drive, except on Sundays because they're closed. If they were open I could bring the whole family. Excellent customer service and very patient I picked up a to go order at 5:00pm on a Monday and it was packed!"}
{"text":"Food is freaking amazing! Eat here alot but...figuring i only order a small side salad with a lamb skewer cooked medium i thought it would be a fast order to call in. Not the case. I had to call 27 times for no one to answer and went inside and nobody was on the phones at all only taking orders at the counter and someone expoing the orders ready. Then waited 20-25 min for my sm side salad a one skewer.  Bummer"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night and I was glad to finally check this place out. Inside isn't huge, but it was clean and there was a girl constantly cleaning tables and the floor under them. The woman at the counter who took our order was nice and gave us a number to put on the table. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out, but the place was busy and they claimed to be making everything fresh so I didn't mind.  I ordered a side \"Classic Greek Salad\" priced at $4.95 with house made Greek vinaigrette. The salad had crisp greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, kalamata olives (has pits...be careful!) and feta cheese. The salad tasted fresh and the dressing was delicious. The salad also came with some grilled pita bread that I put some cucumber and tomato on and folded it up to grub on. Yum! Hubby got a burger (said the patty seemed frozen) and made it a combo with \"Feta Fries\" for us to share. The fries were excellent! Especially dipped in some of their tzaziki. I will be back to try a gyro and baklava.   They also have tables outside if eating inside isn't your thing or you can call ahead and place your order to-go. Ask about their family meal deals, they have a couple to choose from."}
{"text":"Food was really good but I watched them handle all the food without gloves.    2 cooks kept wiping their noses.   As foul as foul can get.  Not one person handled food with gloves.  I cancelled my order and left.    Visit at your own peril"}
{"text":"The Gyro here rivals and or tops any I've ever had. A healthy portion of feta cheese over the top I think is the secret vs the competition. Well worth the $7.50."}
{"text":"OMG this place is heaven. The traditional gyro with the feta fries is so good and my girlfriend had the Falafel pita with the feta fries it was so delicious it should be illegal for reals. Its very busy during lunch and dinner but believe me its worth the wait. The staff is friendly which is a plus.  The Great Greek just earned 2 forever customers. I will tell my friends and family about this awesome slice of Greece."}
{"text":"After wondering what I should eat for dinner other than In-N-Out, I remembered reading about the Great Greek.  I decided to order a gyro meal to-go.    The lady at the counter is super nice.  After explaining to me the items on the menu, I went with what I know best, the gyro.  I shared the meal with my bf and it actually was enough food.  The gyro was tender and flavorful, the salad consisted of fresh ingredients, the fries were freshly fried.  Definitely a delicious meal.  We will return to try other items on the menu..."}
{"text":"Awesome food and really nice owners!  I love everything I have tried here but the Greek fries are my absolute favorite.  The falafel rocks and the gyros are the best in town.  I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to see if things had improved.  We didn't have chicken this time but tried the falafel. They give you a lot but they should for the price.   We were looking fwd to french fries we'd had before that were great, they changed them...the new fries are terrible. .coated with something flaky and greasy. Big let down. Service is good. Wouldn't rush back but it's OK in a pinch."}
{"text":"We come here at least a 3 times a month.. love love love it! Clean, fresh, nice employees, quick service and food always tastes good. We have been eating here since we moved to Vegas almost 3 years ago My family always is happy after eating here and we will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food, friendly staff. Prices seem a little high, especially if you take the salmon option (why is salmon so much more $ than shrimp?). But, excellent falafel, rice bowls are huge, delicious hummus, grilled steak plate was nice, & great pastitsio (this is over 2 trips). The salmon for my rice bowl wasn't cooked quite as much as I like but given it's twice what I can eat in one sitting, I can cook it up a little more when I have the leftovers tomorrow. All in all, very good and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly atmosphere.  I had the small Greek salad with chicken. The portion was hearty and the dressing light. The chicken had excellent flavor and was not dry. The hummus is probably the best I've had. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I had the Greek salad with gyro meat last week for lunch. It was very fresh and a generous portion. My only complaint is that the meat was soggy. It didn't have any of the nice thinner edges that stay slightly crisp. It was still very tasty.   Service was okay. We got our order to go and it took a while for the woman at the counter to acknowledge us when we were at the counter.   Their tzatziki is amazing in both flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Went there for pick up only.  Nice little place.  I ordered the greek salad, and a side of hummus and the bread.  The salad was huge!  I think next time unless I'm sharing I will get the 1/2 and the hummus and bread.  I was so full off of this meal.  I paid about $12.00 for it, it was enough for 2 people to eat if you both like this combo. I will be back to order something else in the future, because as I was waiting for my to go order, there was some pretty nice looking dishes going to peoples tables.  Try it, you might like it!"}
{"text":"bomb bomb bomb!!! portions are huge and the food is delicious!! i'd eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"The food is SO BOMB. I haven't had anything I don't like. The chicken lemon soup is my absolute favorite. The service is great, cute little location. I highly recommend this place. The portions are a really good size too."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is amazing, the staff is friendly, and the overall experience is just awesome."}
{"text":"Food was solid, but I think they prioritize Togo orders faster? When I arrived there were two people in line who got their food within 10 minutes of ordering. 5 or so minutes after I ordered they did get 3-4 customers ordering to go who all got their food extremely quick as well. My gyro took almost 30 minutes to get to my table. Not used to waiting that long for Greek food and not the best experience for my first time here."}
{"text":"The only reason its not a 5 star is that they close at 8pm ... stay open later guys.  I had the Gyro platter ... beef strips, pita bread, rice pilaf, and a mixed green salad that will blow your mind with how good it was."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for lunch after a coworker's recommendation. Since it's a little over 10 minutes from my office, I decided to try ordering from Grubhub for the first time. Before I placed my order it said \"total time will be 30-40 mins\". AFTER I placed the order it turned into 90 mins! Yikes! So.. I decided to cancel my Grubhub order and just go to the place directly.  I drive the 10+ minutes, park, and when I walk inside there is a huuuge line and only one person working the counter. I'm waiting for at least 10 minutes which seems silly - why not have at least one more person working the register so they can handle the crowd more? On top of that, the person at the counter was also taking ordering calls so we had to wait for her to finish making the line move even slower. I was almost ready to bail but since I had waited this long (and made the trek), I decided to stay.  When I finally got up to the front, ordering was thankfully fairly smooth. I got my food to go and when I asked, I was told it would be another 15 minutes for it to be ready. I wish the lady behind the counter would have volunteered that information instead of me having to ask after I placed the order. But once again, I'm already committed, so might as well ..   Ordering food to-go is kind of weird because they don't give you a number and there's really no where to sit and wait. I didn't want to take up a spot at the table for people dining in since it was already crowded, but I didn't want to stand because it was gonna be at least 15 minutes? So the whole thing just felt weird and clunky. I saw a lot of people get to-go orders so I would have thought they'd have a better process.  After a few minutes, I decided to check on my order, and I found that my original Grubhub order was actually made instead of being cancelled. I panicked because I had just placed an order for the same exact thing. The lady at the register assured me my order had been cancelled and so I wouldn't be charged (even though it was made). At the same time, the order I had placed a few minutes ago came out, so she packaged that. While I thought she would just give me the second cancelled order as a nice gesture since it was already there and ready, she instead put it to the side and had zero interest in offering it to me. This was a huge disappointment as other places happily offer me \"mistake orders\" all the time. I mean the food wasn't cheap to begin with. But, since I had to get back to work, I didn't want to fight it.  And as for the food? It was just okay, but definitely not worth the hassle. The steak was decent but the lamb was super tough. I got it medium - which the lady recommended - so I don't know if it should have been cooked less or what. I was also REALLY hyped about the feta fries, but when I got them they were way too cheesy. They also didn't taste very feta to me? If you love cheese then you'll be fine, but if you're looking for more crispy fries with feta accents (like other places I've been to), I think you'll be disappointed.  Overall I'm hesitant to recommend this place for lunch. If you do, order ahead or be prepared for a long wait."}
{"text":"After watching Guy Fieri munching on some gyro I also had a craving. I remember seeing the Great Greek when I met some friends at the neighboring deli so I drove here. A small dining area inside and a patio outdoors there were plenty of seating option.  -Started out with the Melizanosalata. A roasted eggplant purée with garlic,  olive oil, lemon juice, tomato and onion served with some pita bread. It was delicious!  - next I had a beef lamb gyro. It is loaded up with meat, tzatziki, onion and tomato on a pita. A nice portion had me filled up in no time. I got the combo which came with your choice of soup, salad, fries or feta fries. I had the feta fries and glad I did. These were very good."}
{"text":"(O)rder the Meze Platter to start..great way to try different things (P)izza pans are cleverly used as trays here...Sorry kids, This ain't Cici's...:( (A)vgolemono is the way to upgrade your combo especially with this weather...Fries go with burgers and salad is for rabbits  (G)angnam Style won't be on the stereo here....THANK GOODNESS!!!!!!!!

{"text":"Happy to see this business thrive in the Las Vegas community.  Serving great food!  It's quick service, great quality and friendly service.  Restaurants like Me Gusta Tacos and Great Greek coming into the southwest part of the valley are a great thing!  Keep doing your thing great Greek!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally good food! Fresh, quality ingredients. The salad is always crisp and flavorful; the meats are lean, tender, and moist. Even the rice pilaf is delicious. So happy that they opened a location in the southwest!"}
{"text":"Great choice for Greek good. The quality is good. Prices reasonable. My only complaint please have mora lamb. Every visit lately I ordered dishes with lamb buy they were out of it. Thanks."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yia Yia's Pasticcio which is a ground beef pasta casserole with Greek bechamel  and fresh tomato sauce, I also had a Greek salad and an order of their baklava. I am not usually an adventurous eater so I called the restaurant and spoke with a very friendly woman named Alice. I asked her about it yia yia's pasticcio and she described it to me as a Greek lasagna.  I decided I would try it and I am not disappointed. it was incredible. I don't typically care about baklava either, but this was truly delectable,  due to the amazing food and very friendly staff, I will be coming here time and time again when I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We've visited this location 3 times now and each time the food has been delicious, very clean inside and never a long wait. I can only comment on the salads & skewers because it's the only thing we've tried. But we keeping back for them!!! I can't wait to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"I didn't have much time. Just popped in to get a gyro. It was incredibly good.  one of the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"I eat at The Great Greek at least once a week, and as a business owner I witnessed an awesome employee tonight. Brittany did amazing job with a costumer tonight under a tough situation! Their food speaks for itself but this employee is a total asset! Stop by and say hello to her!"}
{"text":"I got the rice bowl with shrimp it was so good. Can't wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food. Their Turkish espresso was phenominal. Steak scewers were great as well. Jack was awesome and the whole staff there was great."}
{"text":"Went back for some Fetta Fries and Gyro, if i can change my previous 4 start to 5 star i would. Had some Greek some other place and DID NOT COMPARE to the freshness they offer here."}
{"text":"1st time having Greek food and I was very impressed!  Ordered the chicken gyro with fries.  The gyro was bomb.com! Can't wait to come back and try something new again!"}
{"text":"Great food. Will definitely come again and try more of the menu. The spanakopita was tasty. Service was fast and friendly, the place was clean and inviting"}
{"text":"This place is clean,tasty and quality food although I do wish they would do a better job of keeping the line down and being more flexible on their combos.I don't want 5 servings of rice..how about 1 serving and a salad included?I refuse to go here anymore due to the portion sizes,I go to the place down the street usually but I do still enjoy this place very much."}
{"text":"I moved to the area about a year ago & instantly was in search of a good Greek restaurant. I stumbled upon The Great Greek and haven't gone to any other Greek restaurant since! The food is always fresh and the staff is always nice and welcoming. I recommend the Greek salad with gyro meat - such good portion sizes and soooo delicious! I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The gyros here are bar-none the best in town.  I have not had a better gyro in town.  The shop is extremely small but they are good at turning tables quickly.  I enjoy their food thoroughly."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good value. We really like it. Service is quick and fast."}
{"text":"This place rocks! There are a couple greek places around here and this place is by far the best one... I seem to catch them closed more than I would like but other than that, I am a raving fan!"}
{"text":"We visited for the first time yesterday (7/13/17) around 4PM prior to the dinner rush.  The restaurant is clean, with a modern/minimalist interior.  We frequent Greek/Mediterranian establishments quite often due to our diets, and this has risen quickly to the upper ranks of our list.  You go to the counter to order, and the food is brought to the table by a runner.  Drinks are self serve.  The tea is fresh brewed, so that's a huge plus.  All of the staff members were super friendly and helpful.   The menu has a large variety including avgolemono soup, all types of skewers, and even baklava ice cream.  Prices are very reasonable.  An add-on skewer (shrimp, chicken, lamb, beef, salmon) is only $3.75. The kid's menu is fantastic.  They offer gyros and skewers, not just the usual chicken tenders kid's fare.  As someone who has a very restricted diet, I appreciate that I can get skewers separately or a decent kid's plate without a hassle or a weird upcharge.   I got the plated gyro from the kid menu and my husband got the regular gyro plate.  He substituted additional salad for rice at the suggestion of staff.  It has to have been one of the freshest salads I've seen in town.  I don't even like tomatoes, but they looked glorious.  My kid plate was larger than I expected.  I don't know that it would be a full meal for most adults, but it would definitely not fall too short.  The food was fresh, super tasty, and very filling.  The Tzatziki was wonderful. The gyro meat was nicely carved and wasn't overly seasoned.  The pita was not as soft as I would have liked, but not because it was old or stale. I believe it may have been baked just a little too long.  Overall it was a nice experience and very convenient for the SW end of town. I look forward to a return visit to try the skewers and soup."}
{"text":"The wait time here is always ridiculous. The food is good, but not worth the wait. If they tell you it's a 10 minute wait, it's really 20. Today they said 25 minute wait, but I waited 55 minutes! It's Mother's Day, they're busy, I get it. But I asked them before i made my order how long it would take. Don't tell me 20-25 minutes and have me waiting an hour! And he's worse, the girls behind the counter acted like I was inconveniencing them! I would like to leave then a 1 start for rude service and inaccurate wait times, but like I said, the food is good. But I most def won't be back. If I wanted to wait an hour, I would go to a sit down restaurant"}
{"text":"This was delicious, the service was excellent, the portions very generous!  Next time I'm in Vegas, I know where I'm eating dinner"}
{"text":"On Friday I searched Yelp to look for a Gyro Sandwich, there were alot of different places to choose from so I chose to try this place.   Great decor and Food. Had to wait about 25mins for my order and that's because this place was rocking, there was nice amount of people eating outside and inside when I got there. I ordered the Gyro Sandwich with fries. The only problem I had was that I ordered the fries with tzatziki and they forgot to add it, so I had to wait for another order of fries. The staff was pleasant.   If in town you should try this place."}
{"text":"Just had the great Greek rice bowl it was awesome it's a nice location here and the people are very friendly and the establishment is clean"}
{"text":"Was decent. Not 100% authentic but it's close. Will try again. Wasn't too impressed. My friend loves it. Will b back"}
{"text":"I could probably eat here for the rest of my life! I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and they're all delicious.  My favorite is the greek salad wrap with chicken, it is perfectly tangy and delightful but the gyro is solid too.  My boyfriend always gets the falafel which he loves and sometimes if we're feeling wild we'll get dolmades and hummus.  I almost forgot about the feta fries!!!  Great Greek is really doing something right with those fries they're the best.  I believe its family owned and the woman behind the counter is always so sweet and welcoming.  It can get pretty busy though so we always order it over the phone and pick it up, otherwise there are about 8 tables or so inside- not bad but it can get packed"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Best Greek food I've had since I went to Greece in 2009. Chicken gyro was tender, fries super crispy and the pita bread was so fluffy and delicious. I took my food to go but I'll dine in when I return. Great selection of domestic and Greek beer (Mythos!) and wine. Great menu, too much to choose from is a good thing. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken & Falafel rice bowl and Feta Fries. Both were delicious, especially the bowl. Portion of the bowl was humongous so I had to put half of it into a to-go box. Overall, amazing Greek restaurant and customer service. Will definitely come back here whenever I'm visiting."}
{"text":"We are always happy when we leave this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and attentive, the food is fresh and delicious, and the price point is spot on. I recommend the hummus with a salad and a side of falafel. My husband always gets gyro & we share. The children get a very generous portion with the kids meals. If you like cheese fries, get the feta fries! My daughter & husband love them. Fries are not my thing, but their fries are crispy. The tzaztiki is thick and good."}
{"text":"Wow, what a not so hidden gem in Henderson. The food is fresh with cool crisp salads and hot, tender and juicy meats. My friend goes apes over the Pita bread and hummus or Tzaziki sauce. The staff are always smiling, very helpful and there to serve . The only drawback is the building is a bit small and there is often a short wait to get a table. But when the food is tasty and fresh it's no problem to wait. Also the new Blue Diamond Hwy location is just as good with a bigger seating area and a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! Walked in and was greeted very warmly by staff. It was pretty packed inside so I knew I was in for a treat! The guy at the counter was super friendly too and even gave us a couple suggestions since it was our first time there.   Like I said, they were pretty busy when we came in so I can understand waiting a little longer than usual but when I got my food, which I took to go, it was cold and the pita bread was a little hard.  Regardless, the food was still delicious and very flavorful. I ordered the chicken skewer which I highly recommend along with the feta fries! Yum!  Another disappointment was that they forgot to include the side of hummus in my order :(  I was super disappointed since I was really looking forward to trying it. Oh well !   The food was delicious but I really wish it wasn't cold when I ate it and I wish I got to try the hummus. I gave this place 3 stars but I want to give it another shot and maybe dine in next time! Will definitely update this review!!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek used to be my favorite place for lunch or pick up. But that changed today, last time I picked up the food was just okay. Salad with mushy tomatoes. So I figured maybe an off day.   Today I ordered the same as always 2 salads with two med rare steak skewers. When I got home with my food once again mushy tomatoes but this time the steak was so well done I could not eat it Two salads both with charred steak skewers.  Not sure what happened in the last couple of months but I I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Great people, great food, This place does it Right!  We usually stop in here every time we come through the area. It's always a very comfortable and casual atmosphere. The staff are the most happy and relaxed group and always smiling and helpful. To me that really adds to the mood of the restaurant.  We have a toddler and they are always super friendly to the baby and accommodating.  The food is delicious and well priced. We have eaten here several times and tried several dishes. They are all very good and worth your time.  We found the great Greek by searching for something outside of Vegas because we don't really want to fight the traffic or the crowd just to eat. This place is easy to find, easy to get to, lots of parking, no wait, fast service and even a patio.  So If your just in the area or looking for something good outside of Vegas this is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual lunch! We got the gyro plate with the feta fries. The feta fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Greek in town in the most friendliest owners I've ever met. They know what you're going to order even before you sit down when you've been a loyal customer I truly appreciate that"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant!!! The people are always so nice and the food is above and beyond delicious. We always get the hummus and falafel rice bowl. They are fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken gyro and avgolemomo soup are absolutely delicious. I haven't had Greek food this authentic and tasty since I moved here from So Cal."}
{"text":"This is THE best dive in Henderson!  Great food, great service and always packed.  Whenever I'm in the mood for a gyro, this is the only place I go.  They also have great salads, great chicken, and the humus is amazing!  If you're ever in this neck of the proverbial woods, stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food was OK but having tried a lot of the other Greek food in the area I definitely think there are better options"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area. I love this place. Salads with gyro meat is OMG Good! The kabob chicken with yellow rice my grown boys just love. I will be a regular here. Food is always fresh and the service is great with a smile."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  Looking for a place to eat and chitchat with a dear friend, we happened upon the Great Greek.  She had her one-year-old with her so we wanted to find some place appropriate, accommodating, and with indoor seating.  It was quite packed when we got there, with no seats left inside (only tall counter area left, which is kind of difficult to manage with a one-year-old).  Before we walked out, one of the servers / food runners saw us and told us to hold on because a couple tables were getting ready to leave soon.  He told us that he'd clean it up right away and get us a highchair, too.  I thought it was amazing that he even spotted us in the midst of all the food running and the fact that it was quite busy.  It's not a waiter-type of restaurant; it's the order-at-the-counter-and-get-a-table-tent-number-type of restaurant, but still.    The food was just as good.  The hummus was absolutely delicious.  Not the overly fancy kind where they try to throw everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Just straight up good hummus.    The gyro was rather large, which was great because I was super hungry.  I enjoyed it.  The vegetables were fresh and the meat was tender and flavorful.    The baklava was good, but different.  Kind of tasted like cereal, granola, and really tasty honey.  Overall, I really liked this place.  It's a cute, casual spot that's great for catching up with friends or grabbing a bite with family.  Nice, friendly, and helpful staff.  Would recommend and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well, this was a surprise!  The husband and I were craving Greek food and he remembered seeing this place \"coming soon\" not too far from the house. We swung by tonight and, in all honesty, I was expecting decent grub and a so-so atmosphere. It was far better than that.  The place itself is very nicely put together, especially considering it falls under the \"fast casual\" umbrella. Beautiful wood on the walls, lots of planters, nice lighting, lovely tables all with vases and fresh flowers. It was very inviting. Also, food is served on real plates with real silverware and the plates have a kind of pottery look and feel to them which adds to the overall effect.  But more importantly - the food!  We ordered two gyro combos; my husband's had feta mine didn't. Both were the lamb/beef combo with juicy fresh tomatoes, red onion, deliciously fluffy and thick tzatziki sauce, and a scrumptiously fluffy pita to hold it all together. Guys, it was phenomenal! Meat was tender and delicious, veggies were on point, and the sauce was addictive.  I had rice pilaf as a side (yummy!) and the hubs had the feta fries. The feta fries were a revelation. Perfect spuds with feta and tons of oregano mixed throughout (I hate it when there's only cheese on top!) and cooked together into a creamy, gooey, crispy, unctuous mass of magic. I stole many of his fries and husband is a good man because he let me.   We also got some eggplant dip as an appetizer and it was very good. All good was ordered at the counter but brought to your table. Service was wonderful, extremely friendly and genuine.  I short, I'd go back in a heartbeat. The only problem is deciding whether to eat that amazing gyro again or try something else because the whole menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a gyro, this is the place to go.  At other places, I have to order two and it gets pricey, but here, one is plenty!  Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I would like this place more if it was next door to my house. Actually I would like this place more if it were in my house. 1 star because this place is not in my house.  Kidding! I loved every last bite on my food crawl with Jaime W. and Dana S. That egg-lemon-rice soup, yeah, I would bathe in that shit. It would make me smell funny, but I feel it probably contains healing properties for the soul that regular bath water can't fulfill.  The Gyro meat was especially delicious as well. Yeah, I could see myself eating here on a regular basis...they just have to move in downstairs. A major plus is that you can dine outside and they will bring your food to you. I know that their tea is just regular Fuze tea, but it was so good!   5 stars. Go before I renovate my basement to be their new kitchen."}
{"text":"We were there once and we loved it. Order was quick and easy. We ordered soup and two entrees. The soup was tasty and hot, as well as the big plates. Everything was fresh and looked delicious. We ordered the skewer meat plates and they were yummy. Will definitely be back there when we are back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Amazing customer service and OUTSTANDING food. (Sometimes there is a wait for tables but seriously doesn't even affect my 5 stars) Their flavors cannot be best. Stop by here. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this place over a dozen times in the past 6 months and it is AMAZING!!!!  The service is always friendly and helpful.  I usually get the hummus appetizer (ask for extra pita bread!!) steak-lamb gyro and fries.  You would never think that fries would be good at a place like this but they are delicious!  A little crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.   I have also tried their greek salad with chicken. So good, especially if you are watching your waistline.  A little of their dressing goes a long way.  If you have room for dessert you need to get their rice pudding."}
{"text":"Fantastic Greek food, especially love the feta fries!!! Took away one star due to the employees sitting outside the front of the establishment in the outside dining area smoking, other than that I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Fresh and fast, and YUM! You know you've made a good lunch choice when there are police officers eating at the restaurant as well - they always know where to go for food with a great value. We tried chicken soup, dalmades and a salad. The salad was amazing, definitely try it with the falafel or chicken, comes with a couple pieces of warm pita. The dalmades, do they make them fresh? Because it sure tasted like it, comes with 6 pieces and a wedge of lemon. The soup is a little strange, it doesn't know whether it wants to be chicken-based broth or a cream-based, but very citrus-y and refreshing, so I let that slide.   Basically, a great place for a quick lunch, it's very clean and as usual with restaurants in Henderson, NV, tons and tons of parking."}
{"text":"So.. I haven't tried ALL the greek spots around town, but now that I've found the Great Greek, there's no reason to look further. Their chicken and steak souvlaki is amazing. The seasoning is just right. The grilled shrimp is delicious. The rice pilaf compliments the meats very well. And... Feta Fries?! Come on dude..   The one and only knock I have on this place is... You can't call ahead and dine in. But they still deserve all 5 stars on the food alone. Great people too. So yeah, only greek joint in town that I would suggest!"}
{"text":"Best Greek spot in town, hands down! The food never disappoints and I'm speaking for both this and the original location in Henderson. Their salads have so much flavor, the gyros are crave worthy, the feta fries. Yeah, I'm gonna just leave that there.   My girlfriend and I usually get the souvlaki (chicken, steak and/or lamb) plate and it is so satisfying, and for the price, you really can't beat it. The staff are also very friendly and efficient. If you don't like to wait, I suggest you call in your order for takeout as it usually takes about 10-15 mins for them to have your food ready. Hey? At least you know it's fresh! But personally, I think it's well worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to try based on a friend's recommendation. So glad I did! Service was very friendly & helpful. I tried the gyro bowl based on cashier's  recommendation. It was fantastic. Lots of lamb, perfectly prepared. The bowl was a huge portion, I got 2 meals out of it!  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A friend an I stopped by here during a long lunch break. The interior is small, with limited seating but on a nice day you can always enjoy your meal on their outdoor tables.   The guy who took our order was very friendly and he  immediately made my visit a little bit more enjoyable. Both my friend and I got the great greek gyro which comes with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, tzaziki sauce and feta cheese. I made it a combo and got the regular fries and a drink. The food came out quickly and just looking at it made my mouth water. The gyro is a good size, the meat was flavorful and the tzaziki sauce and feta added just the perfect amount of a cool, creamy contrast. I was pleasantly surprised that the french fries were hot, crispy and didn't taste like frozen potatoes.   This is a great place to get some Greek food in the Henderson area and I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This place is decent but nothing to go out of your way for. I tend to go due to its location.    The service is super slow and they seem to be a bit unorganized, im sitting here now waiting 15min for a gyro.  If your in the mood for greek and just happen to be in the area its ok but i think there are much better options with better service.  Ive changed to 2 stars as im gettimg close to 30min wait for a f'in gyro!!  From now on I will take extra time to drive to rainbow where there is a much bettet greek spot!"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. This place... oh this place. I have to admit I eat here at least once a week. I have never, ever had a less than perfect meal here. The only downfall is that the place is so small!  That being said, they are so organized that even when the line is out the door with the greek food addicts like myself, they always make sure people get seated in order if they choose to dine there and the wait is never too long. I am surprised with the magic that these people create in such a tiny space.  The staff is so friendly and they work their butts off!  The presentation of the food is like fine dining and the price is outstanding. If I ever win the lotto, I'm getting these guys a great big spot... next to my house. :)"}
{"text":"Small place with a pretty big wait but I understand why. I got a falafel rice bowl to go without the yogurt to make it vegan and it was so amazing. My BF got some kind of burger and he was equally impressed. The people at the counter were super nice. Everything tasted really fresh and I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Omg!!! The most excellent Greek salad I've had. Add the gyro meat, which is superb, and you have a great lunch. The staff was extremely nice, and welcoming. They were very attentive to the customers. There was one guy running the show, and in between taking orders, he was cleaning up the table and even had the sense of making sure those who needed a table, got one inside because it was a very hot day."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience. How do you run out of rice? I mean I guess it happens but you should really be prepared if you are running a business. I'm Asian so I need my rice or I won't be satisfied. Ugh, waited 30+ mins for it. So annoying when you are starving. Their food is ok. Not bad but but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood Greek spot. We went in mid-week around 8 p.m. and the place was clean and the customer service was fantastic. We were recommended to try the feta fries (amazing) and we ordered a gyro plate and a grilled shrimp skewer plate. Both came with a really fresh Greek salad and rice pilaf, which was also quite good.  Portion sizes were huge (we had enough for dinner and lunch the next day). My husband really liked the gyro, he only wished that they had put it on the flatgrill for a couple of minutes to crispen it up just a bit. My shrimp was flavorful and not overcooked and the plate came with 2 large skewers of shrimp. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"It's so good that we seriously need to consider leaving bad reviews -- it's getting too busy!  EDIT: After a couple years, the Great Greek just became too busy. The quality has suffered a little bit (chicken soulvaki tough on a few occasions) but overall it remains a solid place to eat. Us, personally, we've found another Greek place in Henderson that we enjoy a little bit more (I will not disclose the name, because both are very good, and the object is not to take away business from the Great Greek -- because, it is, in fact, great. It just isn't as great as it used to be. And I have to be fair to the original five-star review.   This seems to be somewhat of a regular problem in the valley: places open strong & then cannot deal with the influx of customers."}
{"text":"I went there once and that would me the last time. The management is very rude and extremely un organized. Do not waste your time and money to go to this over crowded zoo."}
{"text":"We grabbed food here after leaving the Las Vegas airport. The heat was a startling more-than-100-degrees, so there was no way we were leaving the air conditioned restaurant to eat. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to open up. The interior of the restaurant itself was pretty cramped. The service was alright - we ordered at the counter, and the staff came around to clear off tables every once in a while. The ambience was very similar to that of a well maintained fast food restaurant.   I ordered the rice bowl with falafel. It was a huge bowl, and the vegetables in it were very fresh. There wasn't as much rice pilaf as I assumed there would be, but they say when you assume, \"you make an ass out of u and me.\" The rice pilaf was slightly salty and it added more flavor to the bowl (which was extremely reminiscent of a salad). The falafel was flavorful, although the middle was a little mushy.   Overall, the bowl was really good, healthy, and filling. I believe it was about $11, which I thought was a fair price. I would definitely recommend this place yes"}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food in town, hands down! The flavors are rich and zesty, the people are friendly, the atmosphere is energetic. For a great overall taste of the menu, I recommend the Mezze plate."}
{"text":"I travel to Henderson often for business, and I have been wanting to try this place for some time. I'm glad I did- WOW! I will be back often!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean place with friendly staff. Food is your typical Americanized Greek food. I suggest if you can't tell the difference than I would give it a shot. Decent portion but more on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. We were passing through town & this place sounded like it would hit the spot and it did. We had gyros, rice pudding &  baklava ice cream. Everything was so good & fresh."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing great about The Great Greek with the exception that they greatly manage to fool a lot of Yelpers into thinking this is a four-and-a-half star average listing. \"Eek! Methinks not.\"  If this is the best greek in the valley, then I should quit eating greek food right here and fucking now because it was \"A-OK\" at best. Add to the sum of the equation the shittiest service I have received anywhere in Twenty-Fifteen, and you've got yourself a one-star. Great job, Great Greek.   The night I went -- the last time I shall ever patronise this shit show -- it was packed. It might be always packed here. (People have no taste.) Now, I will never penalise a business for being too popular; however, I will deduct stars for how they handle their high amount of traffic.   Service The ladies providing the table service were beyond rude. \"Excuse me!\" they would loudly shout every couple of minutes in the same way one would exclaim \"Get the fuck out the way, asshole.\" The queue exists, and it only has a very small area where to exist, and those in it weren't even excessively occupying more square space than necessary. \"Excuse me!\"   On the other hand, the lovely, middle-aged lady behind the till was pleasant without exception the entire time  we were there. She should get a raise if she is not already the owner. \"Excuse me!\"  The service aside from the cashier continued to earn itself the Worst In Show with one of the \"Excuse Me!\" ladies tossing the plates on our table and snatching the table number without asking if we needed anything else. Missing was the dessert, naturally -- \"Excuse Me!\" -- and my fucking salad.   Food The food was alright. I had the Greek lamb burger because I am boring. The dessert might have been the greatest thing west of the goddamn Mississippi; however, I shall never know.   Just like The Great Greek will never know anything other than this one-star from Edwin P. from Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A.  The yuppies with no taste and no sense of decent service can keep it. One star."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry I ate all my food before I could take pictures. My boyfriend and I both got gyros (one chicken one lamb) and they were delicious. Get the feta fries as well you will thank me later.   Food was awesome, and the service was just as great! Both young ladies assisting us were very sweet and efficient. While they weren't ringing orders through they were keeping the place spotless. We will be new regulars here. :)"}
{"text":"Gimme a bucket of tsaziki and slather me up!  I have been absolutely craving Greek food for the past few weeks.  Maybe it's the upcoming festival season.  Maybe I'm getting tired of of my wife's cooking.  Uh, maybe I better shut up.  Whatever the impetus, I was determined to give this place a shot.    The lady at the register was really nice, despite having half the dining area overrun by my two monkeys.  They don't have kids meals, which posed a bit of a challenge in ordering, so be advised if you do have kids.  As a workaround, I decided to order the soulvaki plate with one skewer each of chicken and beef, with rice and a salad (about $11).  My wife opted for a gyro pita ($7.50) combo that came with fries (hey, don't judge) and a drink (add $2.50 for the combo).  +1 drink for me and our total was just under $25.    The food came out reasonably quick and smelled delicious.  The salad was fresh and refreshing, with just enough dressing for taste, not drowning in it.  The beef I ordered medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  Some steakhouses can't even get that right!  I don't know what kind of beef they use, but it was really tender and the seasoning was pitch perfect.  The chicken was also cooked ideally and oozed juices when cut into.  Of the two, the chicken was my favorite - whatever is in the marinade makes it sing.  The skewers sat on a bed of really tasty rice pilaf that seems to have some tang to it.  Add to that some of the best tsaziki sauce I've had and you're in business.  I could have slathered everything with it.    The kids were shoveling my rice and took about a third of my meats, so thinking I would be left hungry, I ended up ordering a third soulvaki chicken skewer ($3) and a side of rice ($2.50).  Of course, as soon as I paid for the extras, my kids say they're full.  Typical.  So what's a dad to do except scarf it all down myself?    Unfortunately, I ran out of tsaziki because I shared it (rare for me) with my wife, who, of course, didn't share any of her gyro pita with me.  But $0.75 for a side?  Yikes!  No matter how good it is, I can't justify paying that much for a small container.  The only thing more disappointing than running out of tsaziki was the fries.  Yeah, I know, who the heck orders fries at a Greek place?  Well, blame it on the kids.  Also, the pitas don't taste home made, but that's not a big deal to me, I'm just giving fair warning if that's a must have for you.  Despite the hardships I experienced, I overcame.  I used some creative ordering, decided never again to share the most cherished items on my plate and made a note to self to always leave the family at home."}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have had in a long time.  Moved to the area recently and heard about this place from some co workers.  Good value and really great service.  A little crowded with how many tables there are but they do a good job of shuffling people around if needed to accommodate bigger groups.  I had their Gyro and it was excellent.  Also you got to try to their fries.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and healthy. The enthusiasm of the staff is delightful to observe. This place is light, cheerful and the food will not disappoint. It's that great combination that you get from truly good Greek food: light, delicious foods but filling and full of flavor. The coolest part of my experience here came from the attitude of the staff. They were just so damn happy to be there! That upbeat vibe was unexpected but very welcome."}
{"text":"Great food with quick, friendly service. We order take our here from our office a few times a month. It's fresh and consistently tasteful. Love the feta fries!!!! So good! Although I usually stick with the healthier choice of rice with my chicken kabobs & salad, but it's an e notable \"cheat treat\" occasionally. It seems to be appreciated by all as it has always been very busy every time we've eaten there. They're efficient though because I've never had an unreasonable wait time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and had a lot of flavor. I loved all of their clean eating options. The food had a please take presentation. A few of my friends ordered the same thing and our food came out a little different but all was really delicious!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff and amazing food. Seasoned just right and presentation was awesome. Appetizer was so good it DIDDNT stand a photo."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! The Falafel was not too dry, it was perfect! Highly recommend if you enjoy Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Very good service, prices, and food.  I had a lamb gyro with rice and feta fries and a piece of baklava. The lamb had very good flavor and was not dry at all, as is the case sometimes. The feta fries had a great balance and were not overpowering. The baklava was a large piece and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a go to place that you can count on every time to be perfect . I love the Greek Salad and I get 1 of each meat . The chicken and lamb . The owner is super friendly and always in a good mood . Poor guy needs a day off though . The place Is always packed so give yourself plenty of time ."}
{"text":"I wasn't overly happy to be dining here, as I'm a vegetarian, and most Greek places don't offer a lot, other than a Greek salad which I can make at home. Alas, my friend was set on coming to this place, and worst case scenario, I could go next door to Capriotti's.   That being said, I ended up ordering fries with feta and tzatziki sauce on top, and they were DELICIOUS!! However, not something I can order regularly unless I want to gain a hundred pounds lol. The tzatziki sauce was so incredibly good, I took a few bucks back up to the cashier to order another side of it, and she just gave me another side, free of charge. Staff was super friendly, and restroom and dining area were clean. This is close to my house and would really like to dine here again and try something different! Oh, he loved his gyro that he ordered, also."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! I cant get enough of this place.  I really love the feta gyro!  The service is quick too which makes it nice when in a hurry"}
{"text":"This place was packed I went at 430. So it was dinner time I got the gyro platter with feta fries to go. It came with aside salad also. Feta fries were so good never heard of them before the fries alone were nice and crispy. The gyro was good but I didn't get any onion on it and I asked for everything on it. It had what looked like pica digalo. Just tiny chopped up tomatoes with looked like cilantro in it. It was still tasty though.  Last complaint is they cut the pita in half. This makes it really hard to eat. But it was still good"}
{"text":"I decided to try Greek food for the second time in my life. As a Jamaican Chinese, I fancy myself knowing a thing or two about delicious food. I was absolutely thrilled with the high quality of the food itself and the service. I had the Greek Salad with the grilled chicken and it was flavorful, fresh and delicious. The pita was also warm, fresh and delicious. The handsome young fellow serving and being ever so busy was very welcoming and warm. His attitude ensures that I will be coming back as well. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek quick food option and now it's on south west side of town at Decatur and Blue Diamond.  Can't go wrong ever with chicken kabobs or the gyro plate. Delicious"}
{"text":"We love this place!  It is a very clean family owned restaurant and the pride in their work and food shows!  I am a VERY picky eater and have an allergy to cheese and I feel that they always take that seriously when I tell them No Cheese on anything of mine.  Thank you!  I also can't say enough about how good the food is here too.  I love the chicken kabobs and the shrimp ones are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!  I am a huge fan of their Greek Salad and their gyro meat as well.  We get carryout about 3 times per week and would eat here more often if we could.  :)"}
{"text":"Simply put: great food with fast and friendly service. Absolutely great Greek food. I had the great Greek gyro with the feta fries. You must try the feta fries. Also the soup is really good. Everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Love The Great Greek and beyond excited to now have it in the SW on Blue Diamond and Decatur. The food is always so very fresh so you can't go wrong with anything  here! The decor is also very nice."}
{"text":"Oh so good. I think their veggie wrap is the best I have ever had. Really nice people too!"}
{"text":"The Greek food here is so good and smooth. The steak for the pitas melts in your mouth . It is so great. The lobby is very welcoming and inviting. Our cashier brought us our food and continued to make sure our food was delicious and we were comfortable. Which we were"}
{"text":"Excellent Greek Food!    After searching around on Yelp for places in my neighborhood, we found the Great Greek.  Most of the reviews raved over this place and I for one can not disagree.  We got in around 3pm on a weekday and this place had a lot of patrons dining at the time, always a great sign.  The food, cleanliness of the dining area and service were top notch!  We started with our orders at the counter.  We explained that it was our first time here and the lady who took our order was very friendly and was kind enough to give up some recommendations on things to try.  We placed an order for a Hummus App, Great Greek Gyro with Lemon soup side and the Chicken Souvlaki with a side salad.  A lot of food for about 27 bucks.  The Hummus which was very good, not the best I've had but very good for the price was out fairly quick.  The Chicken Souvlaki was excellent with the rice pilaf.  The Chicken was very tender and had a great taste.  My wife had the chicken gyro which looked amazing.  Her soup which she was kind enough to let me try tasted great.  Very unique on the taste, the lemon soup can really bring together a great meal.  My salad was good but I really had wished I got that soup, I guess next time!     As a lunch or dinner option, you can't go wrong with the Great Greek.  The menu is diverse and food tastes great.  Decent size portions for the price will probably have you coming back for more.  I for one will be adding this place as one of my regular stops whenever I am in the mood for excellent greek food!"}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall frontage fool you, this place is unreal. The best Feta Fries I have ever had and some of the best Gyros in the West. Absolutely amazing food and the service is just as good. I'd take a meal here over most places on the strip."}
{"text":"Solid local joint for a quick dinner. The gyro meat is really good, not scary and blobby like you sometimes get.  Portions are very generous - one of their rice bowls (comes with veggies and your choice of meat) can easily feed me and the 2 li'l kids. Same goes for the dolmades. I've noticed other places shrinking their portions, some all the way down to 3 in a serving! The Great Greek still offers 6 good-sized dolmades in a serving, and they're delicious. Prices are reasonable, about $10 for the signature rice bowl, similar for a gyro meal with fries and drink. Bonuses for being family-owned and having a nice patio."}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Skewer Plate with feta fries, and my bf had the traditional gyro plate. It was alllll delicious. Plates came with a salad (yummy), pita & hummus (yummy). Everything was awesome and the feta fries were freaking fantastic!! Coming back for just those in general. And, the service was great. A woman served us and she was so incredibly nice and explained the menu to me!!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, juicy chicken with excellent rice pilaf and a salad that's PERFECTLY dressed every damn time!!! If you don't like this place, you are not from this planet."}
{"text":"Wa sadly disappointed. The spanipokita is no longer made with filo  instead they are using a berry gummy puffed pastry and flavorless spinach fill. Ugh. Do not order it. It's not Greek and not good"}
{"text":"I am in love!!!!! I bought like 7 different items to try, and it was alll amazing . My 3 year old son loved EVERYTHING !!!! He is a picky eater so I am amazed . I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Very very good, and great that it's so close to home. The southwest has needed more Greek options and this is a great one! Got a traditional gyro- gyro meat was good, tzatziki sauce good, and my stomach will leave happy! 12 dollars for the pita, fries, and a soda which is pretty average. Can't wait to come back and try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to the Great Greek today since one will be opening in my area in May.  I was very impressed.  A lot of menu choices and reasonable prices.  Large portions and great food.  The gyro was the best I've had in awhile.  Better than the other local food truck and sit down bar options.   I'll be happy when they open near me!"}
{"text":"spectacular food and service.  chef worked with the hubs during his wynn days.  now he's got his own place, serving up his food - the way his family has served it up for  generations -- and you can taste the love.  great flavors.  simple, honest, fare.  Our only complaint is that tgg is not open sundays when my chef is usually home - so we have to go on those random week days when he is because he loves it, too.  we usually leave happily with buddha belly accompanied by a serious food coma.    greek salad is not to be missed -- best in town by far.    and for me with celiac, I eat here with confidence knowing I'm safe and can just relax and enjoy the food and my husband's company -- that's the best part."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Gyro. Neat, fast service & friendly staff. It gets busy most of the time but good quality stays the best. Reasonable price menu and well worth driving for."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant for reunion lunch of my friends who live in Las Vegas.  We are so delighted with  fresh good tasting food.  I like shrimp plates.    It was the first time visit to this restaurant for all of us. We were so happy to pick this place.    I recommend this restaurant!!!  We definitely come back for another reunion. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"It's almost comical how often I've eaten their food without actually making a visit. Now that I have, it's time to review.  My friend and I were going to try another Greek restaurant closer to my place, but they had already closed on Christmas Eve. Luckily, we had a plan B that was still open: Yelp and Las Vegas Weekly \"Best of Las Vegas\" darling The Great Greek.  It's tougher than expected to reach it because whoever designed the plaza inexplicably didn't add enough entrances or even paths. Even though you can see the restaurant from Warm Springs, you'll have to make several turns to arrive at the parking area. It's welcoming enough once you finally enter, with indoor seating for around 20 and a TV with ESPNEWS in HD.  The Great Greek Gyro ($7.95) with a beef and lamb mixture (or chicken if you really, truly must) is a solid lunch option. In addition to the tomatoes, red onions, and tzatziki of the \"Traditional Gyro\" ($6.95), this pita comes with lettuce and feta. I had experienced this in an assemble-it-yourself form many times with trays ordered for group events, and while it was certainly fresher and warmer at the restaurant, it still didn't truly tantalize my taste buds.  That said, it's at least on par with if not better than any other recent gyro that I've experienced. And it's really cool that they cut it in advance per request so that I could share it with a friend.  I also split one of the \"traditional plate\" menu items. The Grilled Garlic Shrimp ($12.95) has two skewers of four marinated shrimp a piece. The shrimp was cooked properly and had that juicy bite to it. I can't say that the stated garlic, and oregano were particularly prominent flavors, but I liked squeezing the lemon wedge for acidity. The pita was good, the tzatziki was fine, but... the fries.  Specifically, the feta fries, which I think was a slight upcharge (maybe I'll back-calculate from credit card records) from the regular fries. But it was worth it for the rich feta and its creamier partner in crime. Sure, the fries alone are the fairly thick, floured kind that I enjoy the most, but do the feta fries if you can.  There was also a small salad included in the plate, with a simple vinaigrette not really contributing as much as that ever-present feta. It's cool though. I mean, what are you doing here anyway if you don't like feta?  I'll probably be back, but not in a huge hurry or anything. My first visit bore out my past perceptions that the food is really solid, but not the be-all and end-all of Greek cuisine."}
{"text":"I really like this place. 2 times in the last 5 days good. I have had the steak traditional plate w/ feta/mozzarella fries(omg best fries I think I have ever had), side greek salad. Yesterday I had the small greek salad w/ chicken and steak skewer and a side of feta/mozzarella fries. I love Stephanos but, Great Greek has just been put on my radar. I stayed away for the first few weeks due to the reviews. Well either they just had some opening pains or people are morons. Either way \"Great Greek Fam\" amazing job and I love how hard you all work to make this place somewhere we can grab something not so unhealthy other than the feta fries but, omg I can't those fries are so dang good keep it up!"}
{"text":"We drive by the place a lot and we finally made it in for the first time. There was a line when we walked in and the dining room was almost full which was a good sign. It also gave us a chance to look at the menu as well as see entrees being brought out to the tables. We placed our order and about 10 minutes later one of the girls came to our table telling us that it was going to be a 30 minute wait for rice and asked if we wanted to wait or get a different side but we went ahead and decided to wait since we wanted to have rice with the meat. It really did take 30 minutes for the rice to cook. Then we noticed them starting to serve plates with rice and other tables that had been there way after us we're getting their food first. My husband had to go tot the counter and talk to someone and let them know we were there way before these other customers and the girl told him that they just start putting rice on all the plates but not in the order that they were placed. We finally got our food and fortunately it was very good. It was disappointing that they would run out of rice on a busy Saturday during lunch causing us to have to have a long wait for our food. After this experience we don't know if we will come back or even recommend the place to our family and friends."}
{"text":"Nothing beats FETA fries and a gyro for a great lunch!!!  Been here numerous times and always greeted as a regular and never disappointed with great food."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very friendly and amazing food. We go there for lunch and dinner all the time. Best Greek place in town."}
{"text":"The Great Geek is a prefect mix of classic Greek Diner to fast, on-the-go. The gyro plate was on fantastic - and be sure to try the hummas & pita! I'm definitely trying the Feta Fries next time!!!  The owners are pleasant and hard working! They have customer service down-pat!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. The Great Greek looks like a fast food joint but don't let that keep ya from checking them out. There was plenty of parking during the evening and the owners were so friendly.   I ordered the gyros meal, beverage and balklava for dessert. All the food was delish. The salad was fresh and the gyros and rice portion was gererous. I was so full I ended up taking the baklava to go. When I ate the baklava OMG,  It was the best ever. I would come back here just for the baklava!  I looking forward to returning again."}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these in Baltimore  because I would eat there everyday. I had a Greek salad with dolmades and chicken skewer and it was the best meal I had this week while in Vegas.  The veggies were crisp and fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Had the Great Greek cater a second event for me and as with the first time, it was fantastic!! Nick is especially helpful and nice to work with. He was able to make some vegetarian modifications which my guests appreciated. Everything was delicious as usual. I actually think the catering food is better than the restaurant food. The biggest crowd pleaser was the salmon kabobs. I really appreciated that the catering order was cooked the same day and everything was fresh and all the meat was moist. I also appreciated all the serving utinsils that came with it. From start to finish the entire process was easy and one less thing I had to worry about!"}
{"text":"this place has great fresh homemade food. one Friday i had the Greek lasagna and been craving it ever since.  highly recommend this Greek food as much as the other great place around the corner, the family run hole in the wall Manna.  if you love this place try both, love the homey feel"}
{"text":"I am typically very picky when it comes to Greek food because it is the cuisine I was raised on. I went to The Great Greek over the weekend while in Las Vegas and can I just say.... AMAZING!   All the food was fresh, seasoned well and delicious! Definitely a great representation of the Mediterranean Diet.   I will be coming here again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When I visited The Great Greek for the first time last week, I was simultaneously irritated and pleased and both for the same reason.  The place was packed.  It is irritating because I hate crowds and I hate waiting.  Pleasing because a crowd like that means this place is doing something right.  Need I say more?  Yes, if I am any sort of worthy Elite ;)  I stood in line for a few minutes to place a take-out order.  I settled upon the Mezze Plate which is Spanikopita (spinach pastry), Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves), Falafel (fried chick pea fritters), tzatziki (cucumber and yoghurt sauce), and hummus (pureed chick pea dip).  This plate also came with a small Greek salad and some pieces of pita bread.  Its kind of a great way to sample a lot of good stuff.  The spanikopita was great.  Super flakey and packed with spinach, one of my personal favorite greens.  The dolmades were good.  They are stuffed with an herbed rice. These appeared to have a ruddy tinge presumably from the herbs and oil used.  Different that what I am used but they were very tastey and I would happily order them again.  The tzatziki sauce was fresh tasting and delicious on both the pita and falafel.  Speaking of falafel, this was probably the best I've had.  It was well seasoned and not at all dry like other examples I've had.  The hummus was good and strong with the taste of garlic and oil.  It made me wish there was more pita to dip in it.  Perhaps my least favorite part of this meal was the Greek salad.  The olives, complete with pits, were great as was the dressing.  But this salad had a particularly strong red onion sliced up in it and the entire salad ended up tasting of onion.  Kind of a turn off for me.  I am picky when it comes to onions and this fell outside of my preferred dose of the root.  Waiting the 15 or so minutes for my food ended up being a sort of treat in itself.  It gave me the opportunity to notice how clean the restaurant was even though every table was being used by some couple, small group or family.  I also took notice of the Greek music playing softly over head.  In those days immediately prior to Christmas, I was feeling overrun by Christmas music.  This was a welcome departure to the seasonal norm even if I understood no words being sung in this ancient language.  I was also able to observe the hard and constant work of this Greek family taking care of who would become extended family simply by walking through the doors.  It was like organized chaos at its finest."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It is by far my favorite Greek place in Las Vegas. The food is so fresh and you can tell lots of love goes into every bit of making it. Yes it is busy and crowded, but that's how you know it's a really yummy place. I'd wait any day because it's worth it. You have to try the RICE PUDDING. Seriously amazing. The service is great and the people working there really make you feel at home and try to accommodate you wherever they can. I laugh at reviews that say\"it needed a bit more salt\" or the pita was a bit too soft? If you are that picky you should dine at 5 star restaurants. It's a mom and pop place( family owned) people. Geez....trust me try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing especially the Feta Fries holy snap! Employees are personable and polite. I've come here multiple times on my lunch break and unfortunately didn't get the chance to write a review until today. Give it a try, you'll be hooked! :)"}
{"text":"This is usually my favorite Greek restaurant but the last time I was there was so disappointing. I got there 5 minutes before they opened but they let me in and took my order. More people came in and started ordering. They all started getting their food and I'm still sitting there waiting for my order. After waiting for 25 minutes(20 minutes after they are open), I asked them how much longer it was going to be. They said because I ordered before they opened, they didn't have the chicken prepared yet at the time I ordered so they were still waiting for the chicken(that makes no sense they start prepping at opening time and not before?) I asked if it took more than 20 minutes to cook chicken so she said she will check on it. I got my order almost 10 minutes later. I don't think it should take 30 minutes for a Greek salad with chicken and rice bowl with chicken. Specially when a party of about 10 people came in after I did are almost finished eating their food that they ordered after I did. I only gave them 3 stars because I like their food. Otherwise, it would've been 1 star"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty meals. A definite must try, if you are in Vegas. There are a few good choices in Henderson, but this place has to be on your list."}
{"text":"Delicious.  I called up and placed an order to go.  2 gyros.  Perfectly delicious.  Only next time I will order tziki on the side, as it wasn't evenly distributed, but who cares cause the food was great.  Growing up in NYC and lots of gyros, I was very happy when hubby brought it home. Since first posting, we have been there over 12 times.  Three of those times we brought other guests, a few of them from out of town.  I just recommended them  Saturday night to a friend who lives in the neighborhood who didn't even know it existed.  They went yesterday (Sunday) for lunch and loved it.  I think they have a new customer who will be back. Reminds me of a greek fast food place back in my home town of Bayside, NY."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect walking into the Great Greek. I was hungry and had heard good things, so I decided to check it out. It is a fast food Greek restaurant. The interior was clean and orderly, even though they were at the tail end of a busy lunch rush.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The staff are helpful and will help you figure out the menu.  I tried the beef/lamb Great Greek Gyro, with a salad on the side. They also offer the Gyro with chicken.The Gyro was a little heavy on sauce, but the flavors were good. The tomatoes and onions were fresh and popping with flavor.  The salad was crisp and refreshing. Watch out, the kalamata olives still have pits in them.  The staff collected our dishes as soon as we finished, they were definitely on top of their game. Impressive for such a new restaurant.  This was a quick and easy meal that tasted pretty darn good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The reason I give them 2 stars is just because of the food . I ate there few times , the food was always fresh , the chicken was great ..  too bad that the employees made my last visit my last one . The Mexicans in the back kitchen thought because I'm white I can't understand Spanish ..while I'm waiting for my food I hear them laughing at the customers that coming in including myself , saying stuff like \"why this niggers come here ? They should go to McDonald's \" \"now this old couple gonna take forever to finish eating \" etc...  I don't know if they were mad because people came like 5 minutes before closing but they were just unbelievably disrespectful .. I'm not the one who will anything to them .. I just took my food , threw it to the trash outside and left the place .  Never coming back there again .  The owner should definitely fire the back stuff !"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Great portions and very consistent!!  So nice having a place of quality near Mtns Edge!  My husband usually is not a fan of Greek food but he loves this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic....so fresh and tasty.  Love this place and the staff is always on it.  Great menu.  Whats not to like about the Great Greek."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from here. The service is awesome I love the fact that its a family owned business. The food is authentic and tastes sooo good! Last time we had the Greek plate 1 beef/lamb and 1 chicken. This time 2 Gyros and they were fantastic. You have to try the grape leaves and feta fries!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!!!! I work in the area and I been going to Kyklos in the Galleria Mall for years! Well today I thought I'd give this place a shot! Loooove it! I ordered the Rice Plate and chose chicken as my meat. Glad I did! Everything is so flavorful!! I thought how good could can rice taste, it's rice? WRONG! It's so good!! They put a scoop of rice in the middle, salad along the outer edges and your choice of meat on top. It is the most favorable Greek food I've ever had! Everything compliments each other. Not a fan of garbanzo beans which are in the salad, funny? I don't mind them! All the flavors compliment each other! Oh I will be back! Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek joint in town.  Excellent and fresh every time.  Get the rice bowl or the plates, you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Very good quality. Restaurant.was more like take out than sit down dining experience. Shrimp, rice pilaf & tazaiki were some of best ive ever had. Athena hamburger was also great. Side salad perfect size. Great value for money."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a whim, and we could not have been more pleased. The food is incredibly fresh, and not to mention absolutely delicious. The salad was delightful. The dressing was perfect, and it had all the yummy crisp veggies you would expect on a Greek salad. The gyros were enormous, and the meat was cooked perfectly.  The hummus was wonderful, and the warm pita was delightful. Don't let me forget about the baklava. Hands down the best I've ever had. I didn't want it to be over. Can't wait to come back! Thank you for such a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"The food and service is fabulous. Real Greek food. Will be back again and again. Fabulous food. Great for takeout for special events at home. Everything is YUMMY..."}
{"text":"I love the Great Greek! The good always tastes fresh and delicious! This is my favorite mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't even taken a bite of the food yet and I Will never be back. Some of the worst service I've ever had.  The cashier was incredibly ride like o was inconveniencing her. I wasn't quite sure on what I wanted bc it was my first time here. She rolled her eyes and as she walked away she rudely said, \"just let me know when you're ready, I need to do forks\". Then I let her know I was ready to order, and she said, \"hang on I'm not ready\"  Then someone else came up to take my order and I thought she would be a better experience. We are healthy eaters, so when I didn't want fries or rice, I asked for a side of vegetables and she told me no. She didn't even give me another option. I told her I wanted to buy a side and she said that would be five dollars. And that they don't do substitutions. Overall it was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"first off, around 1120am the placed is already packed.  there are police officers sitting in a table. whenever I see police officers in uniform at a restaurant I get excited because they know all the good places to eat. after tasting the food I understand.  best Greek food I've ever had. rice pilaf is perfectly seasoned, meat is juicy and well cooked. if you're in the mood for some Greek food come here. if you're in a mood to try Greek food for the first time come here. highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I always get their grilled chicken souvlaki plate with rice pilaf, and it's usually enough food for 2 meals. Everything is always cooked to order, so if you're in a hurry, you must call your order in 15-20 minutes ahead of time. They're also pretty busy most of the time, so you will more than likely wait a while for your food. The staff is very friendly, and the guy always offers me a cup of water or something while I wait. The only downfall to this place is that their dining area is really small and always busy."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place for Greek food.  Fresh, fast, large portions. I always get the KIDS size because once I got the regular portion and I had enough for 2 meals (which is not a bad thing). I have gotten the Gyro sandwich and platter from the Kid's menu with the salad and fries as sides. I have also tried their lemon chicken soup, which I think would be wonderful when you are feeling sick. Don't forget to get the Greek cookie to finish your meal! They are yummy! I have only taken my meal to-go but the restaurant is clean with a very nice design. You order at the counter and they bring out your food. They also clear your plates when you are done. Overall, I highly recommend them. I look forward to trying something new on their menu the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"This is the only Greek restaurant I will ever go to. I have been going her forever now and the people are so nice. The customer service is amazing and they remember people. The food is amazing and i've never had a bad experience. Always delicious and I would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Can't wait to try more from their menu!  I needed appetizers for a gathering after work.  I ordered the Four Dip Combo:  Tzaziki; Hummus; Lebni; and Melizanosalata.  The Melizanosalata with roasted eggplant, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice was my favorite! But all four were super delicious!  It came with warm, yummy pita bread.  They were a big hit!  Just because I can't pass up on dessert, I also got the baklava.  OMG - it was perfect, not too sweet, just perfection!  I arrived right around 5 pm, just before a huge rush!  :-)  Will be back for a full meal!"}
{"text":"Very good.   Ate there today and had the gyro plate and greek salad.   The Rice Pilaf as a side item was excellent and the gyro was tender and moist and the sauce was excellent.     Place definitely gets a thumbs up from me.   Clean, inviting, and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and never been disappointed!! The food is awesome and the place is clean. Highly Recommend place"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 1 star because of the customer service . As soon as we walked in the door at 8:50 we were told .. ohh we close at 9 by the way . Not a hello, welcome nothing . So basically she told us we couldn't stay and eat that we had to take it to go . It was so uncomfortable that the couple next to us was sitting down eating and they got up and left and the lady cleaning the table said oh you can stay and they still got up and left . About 5 min later a group of 8 people walked in and they told them the same thing I can take your order but you can't stay . I will never be back because of the horrible service ."}
{"text":"The place is clean, nicely decorated and the staff is super friendly and not to mention good looking  ahaha  The food is delicious, and flavorful!  I've gotten the chicken gyro and the chicken and rice soup. The veggies were all fresh and the only minor thing was that the chicken was a tad bit on the dry side."}
{"text":"Pita bread was super toasty, the Greek yogurt dipping white sauce was creamy, the chicken didn't have any burnt tips at all, salad was delish, and the rice pilaf was kick ass!  Good shit y'all! Keep up the good service, too!  Opah!!!!!!!!! Yours truly, Onasis"}
{"text":"This is hands down, one of the best Greek restaurants I have ever been to! I lived in Europe and have been trying to find a restaurant in the states that has the authentic taste I miss... Not to mention, the friendly people that work there, the filling portions, cleanliness and good variety of options on the menu!   If you don't live in Henderson but are in the Las Vegas area, or even just visiting, this is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"My forth time here and everything is super good...I am transported  to Greece everytime!"}
{"text":"The customer service was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice, but there are only a few low tables in the center of the restaurant with hightops along the sides of the restaurant.  The beef platter was very good, with tender meat along with a choice of rice or french fries.  I was in the mood for rice, as it goes well with the accompanying Greek salad.  You also get some soft pita bread and a little side of tzatziki.  I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Everything u can ask of for a Greek place! Great fresh made pita, feta fries were new for me(I think there was also some mozzarella on them too), decently quick enough, moderately priced! Minus 1 star cause my fried were not as crispy as I would've liked."}
{"text":"Food was really good. The service was also amazing.  She was very aware of us having 3 kids and helped.  Gyro meat was awesome and hummus tasted fresh"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I've had out here in Vegas! The staff that work there are very nice and my food came out fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT and DELICIOUS FOOD, a FRIENDLY and INVITING STAFF, and IMMACULATE RESTROOMS!     This Greek bistro in Henderson is a winner on so many levels.  I'm fairly picky about Greek food and haven't been too satisfied with the choices of Greek-themed restaurants in Las Vegas, but The Great Greek in Henderson has won me over.  I ordered the Gyro plate, which was stuffed with ample meat and other fresh ingredients.  One another occasion I also tried the Avgolemono Soup (a traditional Greek chicken and lemon soup).  When I first tried this soup some 25 years ago, I fell in love with it.  I could tell that The Great Greek prepares this soup daily, as you can see and taste the fresh dill, roasted chicken and pasta in every spoonful.  I also highly recommend the Dolmades (stuffed grape leaves with rice and fresh herbs).  Squeeze a little fresh lemon on them for a tasty treat.  The Spanakopita is also delicious, made with spinach and feta cheese inside a light and flaky puff pastry.  What I like most about The Great Greek is the staff.  They remembered me each time I visited, they knew what I wanted and prepared my meals quickly, and they engaged in a friendly banter that made me feel right at home.    The Great Greek's menu is designed for customers to return again and again to try new dishes.  I've been there three times in one week!    Finally, dining at The Great Greek won't break your bank, unlike many other Greek-themed restaurants.  Just about every meal can be purchased for under $10.  Now THAT'S a bargain!    OPA!"}
{"text":"Looking for a delicious place to eat while out of town, I stumbled upon this restaurant. It had great reviews and the photos looked delicious, so I had to give it a shot. Let's just say, I was not disappointed! Not only was the service great and very friendly, but the food lived up to the expectations.  The food was definitely authentic but it was also very fresh. Mediterranean food can lean towards the heavy side, what with all the gyro, tzatziki, and rice, but even with those delicious ingredients it did not weigh me down. I got a Gyro wrap that had fresh lettuce, tomato, tzatziki, and feta, as well as a bowl of rice on the side. My fiance got a \"Rice bowl\" which is essentially a large salad with a scoop of rice dolloped in the middle, topped with cucumber, tzatziki, tomato, meat and feta. We were both really impressed!   The service was on point; though there were few tables in the restaurant and it wasn't a sit-down restaurant, the staff was very knowledgeable regarding who was sitting where and which group of people got the next table. As someone who has dealt with trying to find an open table in a busy restaurant, this was very refreshing to see! Seriously, the staff was great.   I would definitely go back if I find myself in Henderson again!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town.  Everytime we come here the food is great.  We started with a side of Melizanosalata.  It was nice and creamy.  Great gyro plates"}
{"text":"If you're in Henderson, and want Mediterranean/Greek food, this is the place. Their chicken kabob is grilled to order, and is always fresh. The salads are huge, crisp, fresh, and their greek dressing is fantastic. I do enjoy a gyro on occasion, and the quality of gyro meat is very good, and tasty. Tzatziki is made in house, along with the hummus, and baba ganoush (which they call a different name) all delicious. They sometimes have a lambchop special which is fantastic. Plan ahead during peak hours, because it does get busy. Definitely worth the wait. Nona, at the counter, is the greatest too! She keeps things moving swiftly, and efficiently, and has never gotten my order wrong."}
{"text":"My falafel rice bowl had no rice, no dressing, no tomato, no garbanzo beans.  I came in today around 2:30 for a takeout order and didn't realize until I was at work and could not return.  :("}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I've had. The quality of food is great! The amount of food they serve you is great! The employees are friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love their rice bowls, and their damaldes and baklava are the best I've ever had! If you're looking for a great meal for a really reasonable price this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is so stupid good it doesn't make any doggone sense. Like, seriously... Yes, it's the bomb!"}
{"text":"As much as I love the atmosphere here at the Great Greek, there are no seats available tonight. Which I'm totally okay with, because the friendly smiles, the delicious authentic dishes make take out just as good as dining in! My wife and I love this place, from their traditional dishes like Souvlaki (chicken or steak), the gyros, or their modern options like feta fries, and the Athenian burger. The variety of delicious Greek food is worth the sometimes long lines out the door.  Come hungry, leave full and satisfied. And if you have any room left after a helping of their generous size dishes, the baklava and the baklava ice cream is phenomenal! The Great Greek always does everything right! I wish them continuing success, and I can't wait to done with them again!"}
{"text":"Living in the southwest, it's really hard to find a good greek gyro place. I'm from Chicago and the gyro here reminded me of back home. Friendly staff and great customer service."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. My husband and I have loved this place since we first arrived in Las Vegas two years ago. I would drive across town for this restaurant, but lucky for me it's around the corner from home. They are awesome in food and service.  We've had a variety of items from the menu and everything is very tasty. My favorite pick is the steak souvlaki plate. There is more than enough food with this dish. It comes with two skewers of tasty steak, a salad, pita, and the choice of rice or fries. I typically choose feta fries because they are crazy delicious. My husband is a fan of the gyro. Another one of my favorites is the pasticcio. You can't really go wrong with their food since everything I've had has been delicious."}
{"text":"The Great Greek is next to a deli place. It's a bit smaller and kinda hidden/easy to miss, and the parking lot isn't super big.  I really like the Greek salad wrap with gyro. I love that they load it with a nice serving of gyro as well as a good serving of fresh vegetables.. gotta get my vitamins and proteins in somehow! I also like the spanikopita and baklava. How can you say no to baklava? :)  Service is prompt and courteous. The food comes out in a timely manner, depending on what you order."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in town!  We always get the gyros with  feta fries and a spanikopita...so yummy!  We will have to try some of their other items that look delicious.   Super friendly staff and it's always so clean."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for a few years now and it is a consistent and always a 5 star experience. It is setup as a fast food place but the quality of the dishes is of a home made meal. I have had every single item on the menu... Yup every item. My favorite is the beef shish kebob. It is hard to get good lamb in the US so naturally the beef one is better. If you like feta cheese I recommend upgrading your side of fries to feta fries. The place gets busy around lunch time so do not expect to get there and be out in 5min. Good food takes time and the key is having everything made upon order and not a month prior... One overlooked item is Yia yia's Pastitsio and it is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant in Vegas. Great service and great food! Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Great place to dine for lunch or dinner. Our meals were made fresh, using fresh vegetables, well seasoned meats and fresh pita. Overall, we had a delicious dinner and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. I ordered take out ahead as I  wasn't sure if it was fast casual or more sit down. It is fast casual, order at counter and they bring to the table. Food was ready b4 I got there so quick. We got 2 gyros. One with lamb and one with the gyro beef/lamb meat. The lamb was very good; tender and juicy and seasoned well absolutely perfect.  The gyro meat on the other also tasted good. We also got the 4 dip app. It is huge, 3 types of hummus and a yogurt dipping sauce. Lots of pita bread. Also get the feta fries,  delish."}
{"text":"I came late to the party because I didn't know Gyros could be this good!! I was so used to going to that other Gyro place on Eastern, but now I realized I settled for mediocre food there. Well Thank you Great Greek and my Yelpers for opening my eyes to what a Gyro should be. The presentation was wrapped in a pretty and neat package. Tender seasoned meat sliced perfect, with a tzatziki sauce that actually has taste (I always thought tzatziki was a bland yogurt sauce) and the freshest feta cheese, lettuce & tomato. Nice touch with the pepperocini on top to add a little zing. Bite then drizzle juice on the gyro. The bread was soft and allowed the gyro meat to shine without getting in the way. The perfect vessle to hold this delicious creation. OPA!! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I've had Greek food from coast to coast, this was one of the top two places I've eaten. My hubby even told me as we were leaving that this would be our new spot. I'm glad there was a lot of food so I have leftovers for breakfast."}
{"text":"So happy to have a new restaurant in the area that isn't fast food. The chicken gyros here are amazing. Nicely seasoned and juicy."}
{"text":"To me this is the best place for Greek food in Vegas. I travel from Summerlin to get food here. It is a little pricey but worth the money and the portions are reasonable. I just wish they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is great! Had the garlic shrimp, comes with choice of feta fries or rice pilaf. Comes with a Greek salad, pita and tzatziki.  Very fresh and taste great! I highly recommend this place. Looking forward to trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The name says it all.  It was great!  We each had chicken gyros with rice and fries.  Great!  We also ordered the rice pudding! Great!  Ordered a cup of coffee...Great!  Really hit the spot.  Family owned. Great!"}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of Greek food in my life, but this place stands out. The Spanakopita was amazing. The Gyro was amazing! And the Baklava was on another level amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife took me there for the first time and told me they have the best Gyros, she was right, I absolutely loved them. We had two older gentlemen almost going to fist fight over our table while we were eating . They were arguing over a table, That shows how good it is when you're fighting to get seated. My only complaint is that I don't have one closer to me in the Southwest, but the drive is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Just had the Great Greek cater our get together. They delivered on time. Ordered a half tray of chicken Giro kit and a half tray beef/lamb Giro kit, a half tray rice pilaf and a half tray greek sald. It was so much food, enough to feed at least 25 people. We only had 10, but I have The Great greek for the rest of the week and we're not complaining. Everything was perfect, just like eating at the restaurant. We will definitely be ordering again and again, just a bit less since it was so much food. The prices are very reasonable. I recomend them catering any event you're having."}
{"text":"I couldn't even eat the food, the sewage smell was so bad I gagged!!! I mean how can you not smell it while sitting in here eating"}
{"text":"I don't hand out 5 stars lightly, but this place earns it. My wife and I just returned from Greece and were craving authentic Greek food. This is the place to go. It's the same stuff you get over there. Prices are fair, portions are generous, staff is friendly and efficient. It's a very casual place, but nice and clean and has a nice outdoor eating area. We got gyros. I've had their kebab before and my wife loves their greek salad. We got a small appetizer -- tzatziki -- their pita is great. There was a decent sized line (no surprise since it's so good), but we didn't wait long. We'll be back very soon. In fact, I almost ordered a second gyro just because it was so good!"}
{"text":"I came around 2:00 pm on a Saturday and the place was packed! Staff members were absolutely wonderful! Fast service, friendly, gave recommendations on the food, asked if I would like a water cup while waiting, and was busing tables the soon as one opened up. Excellent food, staff, and atmosphere! Great little gem in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"The food, beverage and customer service is awesome.   If you are in the Henderson NV area, don't hesitate to stop by here to try some greek food.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten a gyro wrapped in tin foil off the coast of athens, and I'm telling you, one bite out of my plate here in Henderson, I was taken back in time.   This place is not only delicious, and authentic but its reasonably priced.   The lady who owns the place is super friendly, everytime me and my wife go in, she remembers us and preps some hummus and pita for us.   I love this place."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality of food at a very reasonable price. Everything we tried was excellent. Very quick and courteous service. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the food here. However, the growing popularity makes your service lack. You can see the bustle on the faces of both front line staff and cooks. A bit of suggestion to maintain the flow. If you know your kitchen is behind why not slow it down by just having one person ring in transactions on one register. The rest can do what they were doing which is one busing and the other running food. The guy at the register should not bounce back and forth between the two registers, you made the wait time horrendous. Especially since people who walked in 5 minutes behind me got their transaction and food before me. I truly hope you guys sort out a game plan on how to handle the business before the food becomes sub-par cause of lack of attention to quality and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Just a wonderfully family oriented staff that is so friendly and make the most amazing Greek food. I love coming here! The Greek salads are to die for! Even the small size comes with pita and a side of yogurt!"}
{"text":"Fabulous gyro! My wife is raving about the soup. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Henderson. Consistently great!! Parking tight but worth all the struggles."}
{"text":"Love this place! We order out from here about once a month. The fries and chicken gyro are my go-to and my husband loves the steak souvlaki. The service is always good even when they are completely slammed with customers. Get the greek yogurt for dessert!"}
{"text":"We've had take out from here numerous times and never been disappointed. It's our go to place for good Greek food when we're back in town visiting relatives and friends."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not into Greek food but while others in my group ordered Greek (and didn't much care for it) I had the cheeseburger.  Note here: Don't go to a Greek restaurant and order American food... I had absolutely no flavor at all."}
{"text":"I guess GREAT sounds better than FAIR Greek Grill, but that's what it is, fair compared to the Greek in Houston, Chicago, Denver, etc.  The Gyros were flavorful but dry and some pieces slightly crunchy.  The salad wasn't very Greek: a sprinkle of Feta and 2 kalamata olives drenched in a way-too-oily dressing? Come on.  The tzatziki only tasted of yogurt, no other flavors, so thank goodness they had Sriracha.  Fries were standard.  The pita was good.  I didn't get Baklava because it wasn't shiny as all other Baklava I've eaten has been.  The woman at the counter seemed bothered by me despite my 20% tip paying at the counter.  She didn't even give me a water cup.  She just wanted to chat with a couple of regulars.  If you don't know Greek, it'll be bomb.  If you do...this place will disappoint."}
{"text":"Yesterday around 6:30 we ordered dinner for 4 people through Eat24. While ordering we weren't to clear about some of the items on the menu. No big deal. We just decided to call to get clarification. We called three separate times: 1st time: we just wanted to know about their combos. When the call was answered we were asked if we cold be placed in hold. The wait time wasn't long at all but the woman at the other end of the phone was EXTREMELY rude and hung up on us before we could ask all of our questions. We only had two....   2nd time: same thing.  3rd time: our order arrived between 45-60 min after we pressed, which was expected but our order was incorrect. When we called back the same woman from the first two called answered and continued to be very rude. And again hung up.We just wanted to let them know that what we presented was not prepared how we ordered it.    All though our order was incorrect, it was very good. There's no question that they have good food. The reason for two stars is because of the customer service we received. I'm not usually one to leave reviews. But I think they may need to look at how they treat customers who call their establishment. That experience alone is enough to not make me want to order there again regardless of how good the food is. Customer service is key!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to take my parents somewhere different.  We had the four dip appetizer which everyone really liked.  The pita bread was outstanding.  Our party had the shrimp fettucine, the falafel salad, and the lamb souvlaki.  Everything was flavored well and cooked well.  My parents said they would come here again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and the food is sooooo delicious!!!  I highly recommend that anyone looking for quiality Greek food should take a trip down to The Great Greek on Warm Springs.  Opa!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food, friendly service and nice indoor and outdoor seating. The lamb/beef gyro is huge and perfectly seasoned. The feta fries are simply delicious. Perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Dropped by for another gyro.  The wife had the shrimp platter.  The fries were kind of gross tasting tonight.  I think the gyro would taste better if the meat and pita were grilled up a bit.  I want a slight char to my meat and the pita is a bit doughy.  The shrimp were a tad undercooked.  They were slammed, so I chalk it up to being too busy."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful we had the great Greek gyro and great Greek salad and the rice pudding was perfect. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Greek food, authentic and staff was very nice! Traveling thru, right off expressway to/from Vegas in Henderson. Definitely will be back when in area!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and we are leaving so happy!! Everything we ate was so great and the service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I used to manage a small family owned Greek restaurant back in Florida, and in my opinion, we had the best gyros I've ever had. Coming from a large Greek family, I've tried a lot of different gyros. But today, having eaten at the great Greek for the first time, I have found my new favorite Greek restaurant. It's a small, family owned place with beyond amazing customer service, perfect atmosphere, and some of the best Greek food I've ever tried.  I've also never taken the time to actually sit down a write a review of a place for Yelp, but this restaurant was so good, I wanted to be able to share my thoughts. If you're looking for a place to eat, please go here!"}
{"text":"This place was average. The kabob was good, the rice was ok, the hummas was ok. It wasn't my favorite in town, but if you're looking for something close by, for an ok price this place will do."}
{"text":"So thrilled a Greek place opened nearby. The food is fresh, no frills, and delicious.   This is my second time in and it's still very good. I love consistency! The service was also faster this time (came on a Sunday holiday weekend evening).   Also checked out the bathroom this visit and it's clean.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"The best! Staff are so nice and friendly, food is excellent! Would always go for great greek!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is always fresh.  Sorry I ate everything and forgot to take pictures.  The staff is friendly.  And they are efficient and fast.  The fresh hummus is super yummy.  My favorite dish is the garlic shrimp plate! So yummy! I highly recommend this place. The price is right!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the hype. It is up to par with yassous. The lamb is great, the tzatziki was amazing, the fries were BOMB, and the gyros are one of my favorite. This is a place that I would absolutely go out of my way for."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY!!! We've tried several different dishes, every one was great. Service is friendly and fast. You can't miss here!!!"}
{"text":"Just as awesome as the original location in Henderson, The Great Greek is a solid addition to this side of town. I ordered at the counter and the food was brought out to my table in less than 5 minutes. I'm a fan of the fast casual restaurant format, especially for this type of menu. Much faster than a sit-down casual format.   I ordered the Great Greek Gyro and made it a combo, adding a drink and rice pilaf. My gyro was filled to the brim with meat and was happily stuffed at the end of my meal. Since it's so close to home, this will be my go-to Greek restaurant going forward."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and stumbled upon this place.  The staff is amazing as well as the food!   We had the humus,  geek salad wrap, feta fries and baklava.   They were all out of this world! We are in town 1 more day and are considering coming back. It is a little pricey but well with EVERY dollar."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at the Great Greek!  All I can say is WOW!!!  I was immediately impressed with how clean and sleek the restaurant looked.  You know when a restaurant goes through the effort of putting fresh flowers on the table, that they care about freshness.  Now onto the food, absolutely unbelievable!  We had hummus as an appetizer, then both my husband and I order traditional gyro's where he had rice pilaf and I had feta fries.   This food was spot on and the pita was so fresh you could tell it was right out of the oven.   And the lamb was incredible! The staff was quick and friendly,  I loved everything about it.   I will be back!  My new go to for Greek food!   Love love love!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek spots to go! Food is always Delicious and great service is provided weather donning in picking up or delivered."}
{"text":"BS +++  Holy Greek.  I am very fond of good grilled food.  As soon as I saw this place I was curious.  I've been eating lots of fried foods and I want to see what the buzz was all about.  Holy yum. Me and my wife had the salmon salad, grape leaf wraps, and I got the chicken gyro.  The portions was just right and the meat was cooked to perfection.  The prices here are super good and the wait staff was friendly.  If you're a vegetarian or a omnivore like myself this place has all the right choices.  I'm a foodie from NYC and trust me this is authentic Greek food.     * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"This restaurant gets one star for seating options food is exceptional but every time you go there there's nowhere to sit the owner needs to do something to increase his seating capacity you order your food get your food and there will be no where to sit and you have no option other than take it to go home and then it's cold"}
{"text":"Two stars for their bomb ass sauce! But oh man! What to start with...  The girl that was helping us out was really nice and knowledgeable with the menu. My main complain is the bowl itself. For almost $12, you get a SMALL skewer of DRY chicken, rice & the cucumber and veggies. So basically, the whole bowl is 80% rice 15% veggies and 5% meat. The chicken was very dry and was hard to eat. Although once the sauce has been added, it's good. Overall, wouldn't go back to this place. Too pricey for the quality of food"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very busy on the Saturday evening, but a table opened up just as we approached the counter to place our orders.  My wife and I each each chose the Great Greek gyro - lamb and beef gyro meat wrapped in pita bread along with lettuce, tomato, tzazki and feta. At a nominal additional cost, these were upgraded to a platter that included a small Greek salad and soda.  We were more than happy with our dining chose this evening."}
{"text":"After our long flight to Las Vegas, we are not usually interested in large sit down meal, so once again we settled on dining at this fast casual restaurant.  This time we ordered their eponymous gyro (beef+lamb, lettuce, red onion, feta and tzatziki) and requested extra tzatziki sauce which involved a nominal up charge and not really necessary.  The gyros were delicious and very filling though we left nary a slice of lettuce on our plates."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a long time, but what finally pushed me to go now was a recommendation for their Avgolemono soup. Greek is one of my favorite cuisines since I grew up with gyros, tzatziki, baklava, etc and it can be tough to please (though I don't consider myself an authority on the matter). Either way, I really enjoyed The Great Greek and I just wish it weren't so far away!  I started with Avgolemono ($3.50), a traditional Greek soup made with simple ingredients - chicken broth, egg, lemon, and rice. I had to try The Great Greek Gyros ($7.95): beef & lamb (the other choice is chicken), lettuce, tomato, red onion, feta cheese, and tzatziki all stuffed into a folded fluffy pita. I also ordered a side of Feta Fries ($3).  Side note: You can add Feta Fries and a fountain drink to your sandwich for $3.45. All other combinations (regular fries, rice pilaf, Avgolemono, or Greek salad) plus the fountain drink is just $2.95. I'm not sure how much a drink costs separately, but this is still a great deal!  Gyro is actually the traditional preparation of meat on the iconic vertical spit, but we associate the name with sandwiches since it is typically served as that. Although not the traditional choice of meat in Greece (it's pork), there is a 50-50 combination of beef and lamb that we have come to love in America (also dubbed gyro meat). At least I love it. It's so good. I don't even care that it doesn't resemble either animal or that it falls apart easily. It's delicious. Good Beef & Lamb: Roasted appropriately with a bit of juice, some crust doesn't hurt (yum), and cut about a centimeter thick.   Although their gyro meat didn't have a crust, it was still delicious. I loved the fresh tomato, onion, lettuce, feta, and refreshing tzatziki. The pita was nice as well. The soup was tasty and they generously served a whole pita with it (cut into four slices). The Feta Fries were good, but not amazing. Either way, fabulous meal and good prices! I will definitely try some of their other Greek specialties next time."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the sub par ratings here. Service was amazing! I just ordered take out but they gave me water while I waited and extra to-go supplies so I could bring some for lunch tomorrow. Food was super good. This is fast casual people! I'd say it's like Pei Wei for Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I took a group of friends (14) there this past week. All agreed the food was hot and delicious. There are large portions. This is a walk up but you are served almost immediately at your table and the food is hot, cooked to order. I have to keep saying that it's hot because so many fast food locations give you \"almost\" warm food.  My lamb was cooked perfectly. Others said the beef was excellent. Gyros were huge! The salads were fresh and the employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is the one of the best Greek foods in Nevada. All my Greek friends go there and love it. You NEED to try this place. Our favorite is chicken souvlaki with rice pilaf, feta fries and their tzatziki sauce"}
{"text":"Its places like these that make Henderson a great town for families! The people, food, music, and atmosphere........OPA!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Everything is very fresh and good. Even the vegetables that come on the side are good, and I seriously dislike vegetables."}
{"text":"This place is \"off the hook\"!!!  The food is very fresh, with large portions.  I had the Mediterranean Salad and added gyro meat. It came tossed with a Mediterranean vinaigrette dressing, the standard veggies, a generous portion of feta cheese, and a side of delicious tzatziki sauce with a full serving of pita bread cut into quarters.  The salad was perfect.  If I could say anything constructive; I wish it came with kalamata olives.  I paid about $14.00 with a drink, which is about the going rate these days.I saw the Gyros coming out of the kitchen and they were huge!!  If you are coming during the lunch rush, plan on sitting out on the patio in the hot Las Vegas heat or just order \"togo\" or \"pick-up\" via their website.(www.thegreatgrill.com) This place is busy; which is a good sign for the freshest ingredients but not so good for seating. Inside the restaurant, they have four 4 tables that seat four and 4 tables that seat two which means the inside seating capacity is only 24. The patio has 4 tables which seat four each. Rents are high these days not to mention the common area maintenance fee that they have to pay, so I totally understand the small restaurant foot print.  The staff is super friendly, efficient and the restaurant is super clean .  I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointing."}
{"text":"The first time I had this 2 years ago And it was great I had it last week and ordered the same thing, and it was disappointing.  I was just sitting here with some coworkers in my office and we were just talking about this place Mixed reviews I guess it depends what you order and when."}
{"text":"What I mean this side of town in Henderson I absolutely have to stop by the great Greek phenomenal food great service very fresh very clean and great desserts a nice little Beer and well. I thoroughly love the traditional plates a lot of food great fast service I got the rice pudding which is outstanding Tzatziki is lively. I ordered the combination plate of grilled marinated shrimp and the chicken Slovakia which was outstanding and very filling. This is a must if you're in the mood for some great Mediterranean or just a great lunch."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I see so many 5 star reviews, where are people's taste buds? I think its because it's the most decent \"Greek\" you can find in Henderson. I got suckered into the hype but I have had way better.   I called in an order for pick-up. The guy put me on hold but I hung up after hearing him chat the whole time with another customer about irrelevant stuff. Second time I called the guy took my order and I liked how fast he turned around my order, said it would be ready in 15 minutes.   The restaurant is a bit small but it's really cute. It has an outdoor seating area with shades and a water fountain. The inside looks very clean and organized. I ordered two gyro sandwiches and a combo which comes drink and fries. The guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and very cute I must say. When I got home I chowed down and it was satisfying but not out of this world. The amount of meat was good, how gyros should be, but it was not that marinated it was bland. The tzatziki sauce did not taste much like cucumber or the fresh dill it's described as but it had a lot of feta which made it taste better. The fries were ok.  I want to give the greek bowl a chance. Place is convenient for Hendersonians but I rather drive and use my gas tank to Las Vegas and go to The Fat Greek on the corner of Flamingo and Decatur. My review is from 2011, check it out but my thoughts have not changed. Maybe I held my standards high for this place in comparison but I'll update this review if my mind changes."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. Counter service always seems busy, but it's worth standing in line. Hummus was tasty, but the \"Great Greek\" gyro stole the show. If you're not watching your waistline, get the Feta Fries as your side."}
{"text":"It is wasn't for the staff I would give it more stars. I was very disappointed by the way we were treated after patiently waiting for our order. It's been about a month (6/14/17) but I cannot get out of my mind how rude the guy at the counter was, and his excuse for reacting the way he did was \"I've been here working for over 12hrs\". I wish I had taken his name, but at that point I just wanted to get out of there. I was really looking forward to this place but unfortunately that one person ruined the whole experience.  The restaurant needs more tables and maybe add a drive thru.  The Greek salad was my favorite item on the menu."}
{"text":"Today is Saturday and I hadn't eaten with the old folks for 4 weeks now. So I grabbed the better half, cranked the old beater car up with my cranker, shouted \"contact\", and off we went to take them out to dinner. I have been wanting to try these 2 Greek places out near Galleria Mall, since, well since the last time we went to eat. With a name like the Great Greek, it's got to be great, right?  It was very good. I don't think it was great. (It's The Good Greek to me.)The place is busy and fast paced. The kind of place where they are so busy that they might tell you to get the heck out and don't let the door hit your rear end on the way out, if you disagree, type of place. IF they were that type of establishment.  But the place is very cheery and inviting. We arrived at 6 so there was a line of 2-4 ppl. I didn't know what to expect when I walked in. So I heed and hawed until I figured out the arrangement. Yup, you order, they give you the numba and you sit down for them to bring the order out. I don't eat Greek too often. Ok, why lie?I don't eat it barely. So I stepped aside and stared at the menu on the wall. Since I couldn't make up my mind, I took a paper menu and stared at that some more, thinking something would jump at me.  The prices range from $2.95 for the feta fries to $12.49 for a entree dish. We ordered 3 dishes, feta fries (because all the good ppl of Yelp said they were to die for...a little more on that in a bit), and baklava for dessert. The girl taking the order is more than happy to teach you how to say these alien sounding words on the menu.  The tables have a nice touch with a flower in it. The place is bright and welcoming. The food came in about 10-15 min. I went to wash my hands in their uber clean restroom and hallway since I was anticipating eating my fries with my hands and not with a knife and fork as they do in England I am told (as that is how 007 would eat, being all debonair and a spy I suppose).  I munched on a fry and then I munched on another. It's crisp and fried hard but tasty. Not so hard that it will crack a tooth mind you but sufficiently more fried and nice and brown then McDonalds (my fries barometer). All I have to say is those people who die for the feta fries, they must not have much to live for. Because heil no I wouldn't die for this fries. They melted some feta cheese on the fries? Forgive me if I contain my exuberance. But I might shout more if I was in a shampoo commercial like Julia Louis Dreyfuss did years ago. The fries reminded me of In N Out chili fries. Does slapping a American Single on top of their fries denote chili fries?  Yeah, like that kind of to die for if you ask me. The fries is better enjoyed left alone without the accoutrement if you ask me. But then again, what do I know about Greeks besides their IMF downgrades and EU bailouts? I think I vaguely remember that they are famous for catering bathrobe parties in college fraternity houses.  We ordered the pasticcio, mezze plate, grilled steak souvlaki, and gyro plate. The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was tasty. The mezze plate composed of hummus, dolmades, falafel, tzaziki, and spanakopita (I have no idea what these things are, they sound very cute though).  The falafel was small and it didn't remind me of falafel. It was ok. Is it supposed to be that small and dry? I honestly didn't know which was the falafel but my better half pointed it out to me. I just eat. It was the size of a giant Walnut. The hummus was ok. The plate came with yogurt, Greek \"yoghurt\" that is. I think it had olive oil in it as it was green. (That or my yogurt was crying green.) Greek yogurt is so special that they included a H in it. The rice that came with the steak was tasty. It was more yellow than I was so I assume it must've had butter all over it? A salad came with 3 of the entrees. It was good, it had feta cheese in it? Really Mediterranean olives that were tart enough to make Stevie Wonder see for a second. It was a nice small salad. The pastry looking baked things were nice and flaky. The pasticcio was a lasagna it turns out. Basically cheese on top and macaroni on the bottom that's been impregnated with meat all swimming in a nice tomato sauce. It was good.  By 7pm there was a line that stretched from the counter to the door. Now this isn't Katz's Deli kind of snaked line but it was long, then again there's only maybe 6 small tables inside. If they sold pizza, I'd have to go outside to eat a Large pizza.  The girls were nice and friendly and brought out the food fast and cleaned up just as fast. They cleared the table for us before bringing out the baklava dessert that was drizzled in honey. Yes, it was sugar on sugar on honey. If it was any sweeter, Shirley Temple would've been a penniless Vaudeville player (I am a history buff). So if you are in the hood, want friendly and fast service with a small neighborhood feel restaurant, stop in and see The Good Greek. (Yes, I said good not great."}
{"text":"200+ Yelpers certainly have the right idea about this place.  After spending the day hiking in the Grand Canyon, everything about this place hit the spot.  My party ordered a few different wraps, a rice bowl, a couple salads, and a rice plate.  The base ingredients had flavor beyond what you'd get from your grocery store produce, and that flavor was enhanced by the best yogurt sauce I have had in all my trips to Greek restaurants.  For my own dish, the gyro woke up your taste buds when it hit your tongue.  In short, the Great Greek has a commitment to both price and flavor, something that's not nearly as commonplace as it used to be."}
{"text":"An unassuming, spartan dining area in a fast food type setup, but oh boy, is the food good. We went with another couple and each ordered something different. It was all delightful. The gyros, the lamb kabobs, the Greek chicken, and the salad was amazing. The staff is friendly and upbeat too. Good Greek food is hard to find in the valley, but this place is one of the best."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is currently 3.5 stars! This is my new go-to fresh restaurant. The first time I came I loved their juicy gyro plate and today I had a large Greek salad with the falafel and a side of hummus. The presentation of the plates makes your mouth water before you even start! Everything looks fresh. The falafel are better than Crazy Pita and the salad was crispy and not overly dressed. Any time I want a fresh, healthy meal and I don't want to cook, I'm coming here. Oh, and my dining companion pointed out the plates and silverware are all machine washable, so they are helping the environment, too!"}
{"text":"Good food but too many times we have missing items from our order! So frustrating! So we either have to go without sauces or humus ect... or go back at a later time for refund. What a hassle! A small family owned business should have better QC than this! Honestly we've just stop ordering from here."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends who lived in Vegas.  They suggested Greek and this was the place to GO!!!.  They are busy but you dont have to wait super long to get your food.  We ordered the traditional gyro and it was THE BOMB.  The sauces they use are super tasteful and they are super HOT (hot service).  The hummus and pita are on point, fresh, warm, and fulfilling on a cold night.  Overall, If I were in Vegas again or ever lived in Vegas, this would be my regular Friday night spot."}
{"text":"I personally didn't think the food was as great as people said so on the reviews. Mediocre to me i give the gyro a 5/10 to be honest maybe it was a busy day an they couldn't put to much attention on it who knows. The feta fries were good just wish the cheese wasn't melted to the point where it was dry. The tiziki sauce was fair the red sauce they hard was rather good I enjoyed that. The shrimp skewers I had were fair. Like I said. Nothing special who knows if I'll be going back. Best place for gyros is Greek bistro in Henderson by sunset station I'll continue to go back there.  If you see me at the great Greek it's because my wife dragged me..."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience all around. Waited an hour for 2 small crappy salads with under cooked poor quality chicken. I must be glutton for punishment because although this is the last time I come in it's not the first time it's happened. Save yourself the hassle if your in the area and go to capriottis next door. I wish I could give negative stars but one will do."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday, the food was AMAZING!!!  I could not believe how large the portions were for the price either.  I had to take half of my lunch in a to-go box.  The staff was extremely nice as well."}
{"text":"This place has great food with generous portions! I got the beef/lamb gyros wrap to go. When I got home I opened it up and was really glad that I was super hungry because it was a pretty stuffed wrap.  The meat is tender, juicy and flavorful without being too salty or greasy. The feta cheese and tzatziki sauce added a nice dimension.  My only complaint that isn't really a complaint because it's also kind of a good thing is that it's messy. With the feta and tzatziki loaded on top, and the wrap stuffed full makes it a good messy. Especially when it gets to the part where its wrapped, use caution when unwrapping to be able to continue enjoying it as a wrap and not a splat."}
{"text":"The Avgolemono Soup and Greak salad are amazing. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I'm in love with their chicken skewers :-p"}
{"text":"Loved it. Very authentic! The girls were doing double and triple duty, serving as cashier, bussing tables, and serving food with a great attitude and a smile. The gyro was fabulous. Didn't skimp on the Tzatziki sauce like most. The salad wrap is actually on a grilled tortilla. (I missed that in the description). Though my fault, I was still disappointed. I love pita. Why would you choose a tortilla when you could eat a pita?? Still, food was great. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great gyros and salad. Friendly staff. Only problem was tough to get a table at lunch!!"}
{"text":"There is love in this food. Family owned, casual restaurant. Worth the 30-minute one-way drive from my house. If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be their Greek salad with chicken. The olive oil dressing is perfect. Also love the perfectly cooked gyro meat, the tzatziki and the feta fries!"}
{"text":"Within 30m of eating here, my stomach was turning! It is now the next day and I'm still not right. My stomach has been tied since!  It's now 24hrs later and I still can't be too far from a bathroom. I'll never eat here again. I had the traditional gyro and salad and the falafel appetizers."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the lamb rice bowl. The food is great and people friendly. Being as clean and organized as it is says alot on its own. Employees always happy and manager keeps plates spinning like a pro. We are regulars for a reason."}
{"text":"Trying out a new Greek restaurant! We ordered a beef/lamb gyro and a lamb wrap. The gyro was pretty good but I wasn't really a fan on thw wrap. I thought it was ok. I wish they could have add more ingredient to the wrap though such as rice or some more lettuce. All I tasted on my wrap was alot of sauce and lamb.. overall, it was ok for me but my husband loves the gyro that he ordered. The area is very easy to find and the restaurant is pretty spacious. It's not like a togo place."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for great Mediterranean food....and great is what this place is! Upon walking in, there was a line and a few folks on the phone on hold, so I had a feeling we'd hit the jackpot. It's not super easy to find and is located next to a couple other restaurants, so I'm sure you have to serve something top notch to stay in business here.  I had their world famous rice bowl which had generous portions that left me feeling full and satisfied. Their rice isn't typical, and is cooked to form a very soft, tasty texture.  Whatever they're doing, it's delicious and worth a million bucks!   Joe C. had the gyro plate which came with a massive salad and a bunch of delicious feta fries. The friendly ladies and the made to order business model makes it my favorite Greek place in Henderson!"}
{"text":"We had the gyro after a day of golfing and the feta fries with a shrimp plate and it was absolutely to die for."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended to me, and it is really is a great restaurant. This is our only salad restaurant we have found that is excellent. We have visited many times and always salads with chicken skewers.  I have recommended this restaurant to many friends who have also heard good things about it. Without doubt a second restaurant near Mountains Edge would be a gold mine."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my most favorite restaurants. Everyone about this place is great. The food was amazing I went with my family last night and everyone loved it. Best Gyro's in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow...great food! The place was full and had a line of people waiting. I ordered the Great Greek Gyro with lamb and Feta fries. The lamb had great flavor and was not dry and the feta fries were great. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, but very limited indoor seating, which was a must since it was winter, and yes, it does get cold in the desert at night!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE!!! FAVORITE!!! FAVORITE...Greek place I have ever been to! I have tried many different Greek places to eat from Utah, Phoenix, California and Nevada. I can tell you with 100 percent honesty that this place has beat them all!   The staff here treats you like family and are always welcoming. The Chicken Gyro is so so good! The Feta Cheese that they put on it.. whewww heaven seriously! The side salad is amazing with the cucumber yogurt dressing.. Ohhh and I cannot forget to tell you how delicious their Feta fries are. You have to try those no joke!   I seriously could go on forever about how great this place is! If you are in the mood for some great and I cannot emphasize great enough.. then you need to check out The Great Greek!   On the plus side.. the owner is a Hottie.. just throwing that out there ladies! :)"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because they are a bit pricey. But other than that....let me tell you about the extreme measures I would go for just a drop of the lemon rice soup. It has such a fabulous taste! Get extra pita bread with it and make it a meal. Dip it until the last bit is gone. The hummus is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Slow service and incredibly rude customer service too. Person was on their phone the whole time. Never coming back. Don't recommend. Wait time and ugly attitude isn't worth the food."}
{"text":"Very great food and the customer service is awesome best Greek food in Henderson for sure will come back soon."}
{"text":"Food - 4/5 Value - 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Atmosphere/Decor - 2/5  Gyro Plate - Deliciously seasoned gyro meat over soft pita bread. Served with tzatiziki and rilce pilaf. Rice was a bit undercooked and underseasoned. Served with a salad with feta and unpitted kalamata olives. 4/5  Update: First visited 11/3/2017. Ordered from here 1/5/2018 and the rice was both cooked and seasoned perfectly. Updated to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been going to this place for years when I lived by their Henderson location. Now that I moved closer to Blue diamond I was really excited to see that they decided to expand! The food is still consistent with the right flavor and portions. I love that this new location is larger. I usually order the chicken gyro with feta fries and my hubby gets the gyro plate which also comes with a salad. The prices are reasonable with the amount and quality of food you get. Great service that is always welcoming. I support these family businesses."}
{"text":"My least fave falafel in the valley.  They do not carry tahini...and the falafels were mushy. Which is still bettter than the raw ones Ive gotten at another falafel joint in town, so 3 stars for decent edible food."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars, but I guess I can round up.  It is a clean little restaurant in a strip mall, with a nice outdoor area complete with fountain. That said, I didn't expect world-class Greek and a wine list.  I ordered the Greek bowl with gyro meat, hubby ordered the gyro with side salad. Then, we sat down to wait.  After a brief wait, we got our order of dolmathes. They were skinny and soaked in oil and, frankly, not that good. But, I'm addicted to Mezze Foods' dolmas, so it would take a miracle to find any worth comparison.  We sipped iced tea and proceeded to wait for dinner.  And wait...  And wait...  And watch both parties that came after us get served...  And wait...  And, just as I heard my husband's stomach actually complain louder than he was whining, the food came.  Lots of it. Fresh and tasty. Absolutely no complaints about food quality - yummy. Plenty of feta and meat, nice crunchy greens, good dressing.  One thing I will say, particularly to those who complained of \"too much\" cheese on their food: No. Such. Thing. Weirdos. Loved that my salad was nice and cheesy, much like my hubby. :)   But, worth the wait? Meh."}
{"text":"The best place in our area for Greek cuisine we have found.  Very small though, so you may have to wait in line to order."}
{"text":"and I did come back! but to a different location this time, the brand new one- and it definitely lived up to it's name, it's great Greek:) the food was absolutely delicious and so fresh, even on a 120 degree day, service - fast and attentive, everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals, we for sure did! will gladly come back:)"}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken gyro and greek salad it was very good.  The lady behind the counter was so nice!"}
{"text":"I visited this place during dinner time on a Saturday and there was a crowd! The good thing was that the service was quick and the food came promptly. They have inside and outside seating which is pretty nice when there's nice weather.   My husband ordered the great Greek gyro. He ordered it as a combo and it included a drink with a side. He picked the feta fries and they were good. He also said he really liked the gyro. It looked full of lamb and yummy!   I ordered a plate with rice, lamb and pita bread. The portion was big and there was food left on my plate when I finished eating. I thought the food was very flavorful and fresh.   We also ordered the dolmas as appetizers and they were pretty good! There were 6 pieces in our order which I think it was more than enough for two people. I do wish they offered a 4 piece for 2 people since we ended up not eating all of them.   I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great first experience here! Large portions, fast, delicious food, clean and bright atmosphere. The bows, gyro plate and chicken dish were all great. The baklava was just ok but we'll definitely return. Great addition to Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the Henderson area!! Small but well appointed eat in area, we normally do take out its very tasty and packed well. And even during busy weekend they said twenty minutes and it was ready on time!  The dolmades are amazing with the proper hint of mint. The gyros and feta fries are our favorite along with the chicken Greek bowl. Pricing is in line with the quality so not the cheapest but the best we have found. Hope they expand someday so we can try sit down service."}
{"text":"We had the Gyro, Feta Fries, Kabob, Hummus and Rice Bowl.   All were delish!   Portions were large, very filling.  My friend is Vegan and the staff were very helpful with guidance for her meal."}
{"text":"Falafel wrap is good.  Be warned:  portions are big, so come hungry.  The feta fries are ok.  The feta just doesn't melt well like other cheeses, so I was disappointed with the \"upgrade.\"  The dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves) were not good.  Too oily.  Not enough rice.  They were on the thin sized.  Daphne's Greek Cafe's dolmathes are better.  Restaurant is small, so come early if you plan to eat inside.    Prices are reasonable and bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Okay, it's clear I love this place.  BUT, I recently, and I can't believe it's for the first time, got their baklava.  As expected, it's fantastic.  Perfectly moist and tasting of honey.  I don't usually get dessert here because the gyros are so huge, but of course we'll start to now."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday. It was so good I'm back today for lunch. The lamb gyro is amazing! The owner just came up to me with the sweetest greeting and smile asked me how I like it I told him I'm back today I like it so much. Super friendly vibe. Very clean. Nice staff. I see us visiting here quite often to get our Greek fix."}
{"text":"TBH pretty pricey for the amount of protein you get. For my steak bowl, it was $15 because the upcharge for steak. You only get ONE skewer of meat, which is very little. Your basically getting all salad and rice. I dont think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The Best of West! This is the place you go to to have nice Gyro , Kebob and salad! Friendly staff and clean organized place and delicious meals! ***** 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the restaurant was exceptionally busy. I requested the gyros sandwich and a side Greek greens. Everything was extremely crisp, truly delectable, served rapidly and with an inviting state of mind.  I'll be going by again soon!"}
{"text":"I gotta say I loved this place.  My gyro was the best I've had. The pita was incredibly soft and fluffy and the tzatziki sauce was awesome. Make sure you get extra sauce on the side... The had my  Lagunitas IPA and a nice little bottle of wine for my wife. The lady behind the counter told us about the kids meals even though they were not listed on the menu. Even my kids loved their half gyros in their meal.  Great place for a very good gyro.  They were semi busy and we got our food promptly.  This place will be my first choice for gyros in the future."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for work, had the chicken rice bowl yesterday and it was so good I had to come back again today fo"}
{"text":"Outstanding Greek fare with super friendly caring service.  Had the Gyro Platter with Rice Pilaf & the Souvlaki Platter with Feta Fries, both with Greek Side Salad.  The Tzaziki Sauce is some of the best we've ever had anywhere.  Henderson is truly fortunate to have such a choice for truly Mediterranean Grill!"}
{"text":"We had the garlic shrimp plate about $13 and the chicken plate about $12. The place is clean but small. Grab a table right away they go quick. Service was efficient. The food is awesome. Fresh clean taste and the ingredients are quality. The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars is that the desserts was a limited selection and the plate doesn't come with hummus."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and excellent customer service! A must go if you haven't been here yet!"}
{"text":"My mom and dad are in town and love Greek food! We were on our way home from Bonnie Springs and saw this restaurant just opened up on Blue Diamond and decided to give it a try. It was packed but the wait wasn't too bad. Very well put together with very cute decor. The kid menu was 7 bucks for whatever you choose to get but the portions are large! Very tasty food and will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Soft pita Tender gyro meat Top notch Mouth orgasm Very filling For cheap Crisp and sweet Wonderful treat!  Will provide a more elaborate update of my full experience soon, wanted to provide my enjoyment in a quick silly poem initially!"}
{"text":"The Great Greek is such a cute place to eat at. The service is always so welcoming and friendly! This is my boyfriend and I's FAVORITE place to go. We are very healthy and consider this a healthier alternative compared to most fast food. The meat skewers, chicken or shrimp, the rice and the pita bread  are all so flavorful, comes out hot and quick! My boyfriend always always always gets the lamb or chicken gryo. Im assuming that is very good as well!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and everything has always been really good and fresh!! The chicken and steak skewers are good, pita is hot and hummus is delicious!!  The service is always friendly and you can tell that they work very hard!!  Last night I ordered the Salmon Greek Salad and the Salmon is the best thing that I have had so far.  The Salmon was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Make sure to order it medium because they said if you order it well done, it will be dry.  I am so glad that I listened to them because it was AWESOME!!!  This is definitely my go to place for Greek and Mediterranean food now and can't wait to get back there and have some more Salmon!!!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with the Great Greek. Their food is fresh and delicious. If your looking for traditional Greek food this is the place.   If your going for lunch make sure you get there early. The Great Greek has limited seating and although quick are still packed. They are just that good.   On this visit Joel and I both had the Great Greek Gyro with beef and lamb. We also shared some Feta Fries. Definitely spend the extra fifty cents for the fries. They are crispy, tangy and cheesy. Perfect combo! The Gyro was huge and piled with meat. It also had a generous helping of taziki sauce. I looooved their pita bread. I would be happy just having that and some hummus. Which I can't wait to try next time.  If you have a hankering for some seriously excellent Greek food the Great Greek should be your first stop in Henderson."}
{"text":"Any other day this place has a 5 star rating. My family and I have eaten the food here countless times. Until today, we've only had one bad experience. Where our food was overcooked...but today the person taking the order was full of attitude. That I chalked it up to maybe them being busy or her having a bad day.  But when I gave my son his kids plate and plastic film wrap embedded in the food that is not ok. I'm glad I caught  it before it went into his mouth.  Please be more carful with your food prep I don't care how busy or backed up you get.  Safety should not take a back seat to speedy service."}
{"text":"Food was decent. The steak skewer was the best. The chicken could use more flavor. We ordered fries but received the plate with rice instead. The rice was good.  The plate comes with a delicious greek salad. The girls servicing were a little rude. It was very busy but we sat down rather quick. You make a line, order and then you ate able to select a table and sit down.  The lemon chicken soup was very good."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FRESH DELICIOUS FOOD!!! If you are looking for a great Greek meal, this is the place.  The chicken greek salad is to die for, the salad dressing & toppings are always fresh & yummy.  The employees are always very friendly & it's more like a family style restaurant.  Every time I call me order in they remember me and when I show up I am greeted immediately by 1st name and taken care of in a timely fashion, no matter how busy they are.  They have daily specials that are always delicious and nice variety.  There are several Greek restaurants in the neighborhood but I only go to the GREAT GREEK."}
{"text":"Fabulously Exceptional Greek salad + perfect chicken souvlaki kebabs + light and tasty rice and warm pita....Opa!!! Welcome to Greece!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love the feta fries!!! Best Greek food in town!"}
{"text":"The food is always outstanding! The service is just okay and the food takes forever to get to your table. In the end, it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is great, everything on the menu looks amazing but I have only had the gyro. Can't wait to go back. Better than other greek places in the area that I have tried."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite Mediterranean/Greek restaurants in town. Excellent customer service with great food. My boyfriend found this place on yelp months ago and since then.. we order from here every time we crave their gyros, tzatziki dip, & fresh pitas. This place never disappoints us whenever we come in."}
{"text":"Food is great! However definitely need to improve on the customer service. I spent $75 on a dinner and asked for 3 extra sauces. The girl at gives me major attitude and says they are extra .95 extra... ok fine... charge my card for an extra $3 for sauce WOW ! You would think that it would be on their menu if they charge for sauce or they would include one with a meal but nope... I'll probably be back but was really disappointed with the lack of customer service. If I could give 1 star for service and 5 for the food I would.."}
{"text":"Since my last visit this place can keep 5 shiny stars. The are definitely worthy. Service was great last night and the food was delicious as usual. Went for the same steak souvlaki plate to share. Meat was tender and delicious. Feta fries were crispy , savory and melt in your mouth. We tried the soup this time. So comforting.  Definitely don't get a huge lemon flavor but it's there. It's so comforting and hits the spot. I can see myself coming here in the cold months and ordering 2 bowls it's so good. We also tried spanakopita which was good as well. Crispy phyllo dough with spinach and cheese the bitterness of the spinach could have used some more cheese IMO but nonetheless still yummy. Last but not least we had some Baklava .  Oh my gosh ! I thought I died and went to heaven. This was absolutely delicious. Layers of phyllo dough and ground walnuts and honey. I heard they only use honey and not sugar. I'm glad because I can't handle things that are overly sweet. This was perfect. So delicious. I will be back great Greek. Next time I will try and order something other than the steak. I've stuck to it because it's just that good."}
{"text":"One of my Henderson favs. Great service; awesome food; great specials! Great location! A++++++"}
{"text":"The food here is good and I'm a regular here, but after my last visit I will not be back. I ordered takeout via GrubHub and prepaid for my food and when I came in the service was awful. I waited and waited in line without any acknowledgement from the staff and a woman came in after me and walked right up to the counter to pickup her food they served her immediately and she walked out with her prepaid order. I said to the woman at the counter that I also ordered via GrubHub and had been waiting long before that woman walked in and her response was \"hold on.\" If that wasn't enough for me to not come back, she then sat my bag in front of me on the counter and walked away without saying a word! Smh so rude."}
{"text":"I work in the area,, and stopped in after reading the reviews... I ordered the gyro, i can honestly say it was the best gyro i have had in a long time.. It was a nice size, loaded,, I came back and ordered the pastisio,,  that was very good as well..  Generous serving,, took me 6 hrs to eat it all,, greek salad was the side salad,, the dressing was decent,, order 2 extra,,  I will continue to come here,, its good, busy, the people are nice...  Its across from Sunset Station on Warm Springs side.."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for quite a while now after seeing the reviews. Well Thank you fellow yelpers! You never let me down! I had the chicken gyro with a side of feta fries. The chicken was delicious! Very moist and flavorful. Just the right amount of ingredients on a soft fresh pita! The fries were tasty and not at all greasy! The staff here is so friendly and I had great service! I have been looking for a good Greek place on my side of town and I finally found it! Adding this to my list of favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"Sadly, my knowledge of Greek food comes from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and a killer hangover from a few too many shots of cheap ouzo and pine sap Retsina to wash down \"Greek\" takeout in Hawaii.   With those credentials to back me, here goes.  The Great Greek makes very good, tasty Greek food.  Simply put, proteins are juicy and properly cooked, breads are fresh, everything is flavored with fresh herbs and well seasoned.    Dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice dill and other herbs) a real surprise.  Dense, moist and herbaceous, the leaves so tender you can eat them.  Lamb and beef gyro and grilled chicken gyro are real standout.  Juicy, well seasoned, sliced beef and lamb or chunks of chicken , atop simple veg, bathed in a zesty tzaziki, piled with a tart goat milk ricotta all enveloped by a fresh, warm, fluffy pita.  Grilled steak souvlaki, no complaints.  Deeply flavored, juicy tenderloin on skewers over a fluffy rice pilaf.  A squeeze of fresh lemon to brighten up the dish.   Done.    Finally, desert; baklava.  What's not to love, flaky filo, butter, sugar, walnuts, cinnamon all bathed in honey.  Friendly counter service.  Clean dining area.  Reasonable prices.  Poker Pro Tip:  Give a bud who lives in the area a ride to the WSOP. On the way stop for lunch.  For days after \"hey, you want me to stop at that Greek place and get you something?\"  Heck yeah!  Ponder if you must, is the food so good because it's different from our norm or is it the difference from its norm that makes it delicious?  It's all Greek to me."}
{"text":"Really fresh veggies and tasty sauces and cheese.   Did take out to avoid trying to find a place inside to sit.... as it turns out it wasn't too busy.  The fries are fabulous.  Crusty and still crunchy 15 minutes later when we got home.   Great Greek gyro is enough for 2 meals!  Again.... so fresh! Tasty tasty tasty"}
{"text":"PERFECT Greek food.  I got a chicken santorini sandwich the other day, but I substituted pita for the roll it normally comes on.  It was THE BEST THING I EVER ATE, hands-down.  The Great Greek continues to impress me!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but the young girl at register very rude! No personality, acted as if she was doing us a favor, from the get go as soon as we walked up all we got was attitude instantly. As a person in the food and beverage industry this is no way to treat a guest at your establishment. Will not be returning here any longer."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Warmly greeted when we entered the restaurant.  You can tell this is a family owned business.  I ordered the small Greek salad with grilled shrimp.  Delicious.  Everything was fresh and excellently prepared.  Tables were bused quickly, so you feel the restaurant is clean.  Many \"regulars\" came in for lunch while we were there.  We found our regular Greek food restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have yet to eat anything that wasn't good. The Chicken Souvlaki and Feta cheese fries are my favorite. The Gyro is a generous size. The lamb is outstanding. My boyfriend get the salmon and loves it. Great food good service and my order is always right when I take out. It always on time. It's my favorite Greak place."}
{"text":"Best Greek food around! This is a regular spot for me, family owned and operated, you can go wrong with this place. I love the Greek salad and Greek fries."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the gyro plate and the baklava ice cream is the best way to end a meal. Service is consistently good and it's perfect for a grab and go on the way home from work. So happy it's opened close to my house!"}
{"text":"Dolmades and avgolemono were excellent and authentic.  Baklava is not over sweet with excellent flavor.  You can tell they spend the time to make it right."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I have been to other similar restaurants. This one is by far my favorite, when I'm on this side of town I will be eating here .."}
{"text":"Finally popped this bookmark....how does the GYRO fare??  The Great Greek Gyro ($7.50): Beef-Lamb, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, and Tzaziki. This was very good, with LARGE thick slices of meat, and heavy...had to be a POUND of goodies! Yum!  I think the meat here is a little thicker than the others I've tried, and it was seasoned well with just the right amount of salt.  But when I compare it to my current favorite, this one didn't really blow my mind.  Now I have to try the other spot again to refresh my memory, to see if it really WAS that good.  Check it out if you are in the area!  :)"}
{"text":"I live right down the street and this place is a favorite. It's usually pretty busy but hey that's a good thing right!?!? Super fresh, healthy, and delicious. The service has always been on point as well as the food."}
{"text":"This is the best ever! I have been all over town and I am so glad we have a local place this fabulous.  Impeccable service with great owners that take it all seriously unlike most places in henderson. Friendly service and very clean restaurant.    Everything was fantastic! The gyros, the rice, the salad. The Steak was so tender, the soup addictive.  We've been twice already and may make a weekly indulgence. :) Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"There's been a line at the counter almost all the way to the door since we got here. After my Great Greek Gyro with feta fries, I understand why. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The food is really tasty and good portion sizes. One of my favorite places to drop in when I don't feel like cooking dinner."}
{"text":"I just moved out here (from Orlando, FL) 10 days ago.  In those 10 days I haven't had a meal that I would classify past substandard.  Not only did I just eat the best Gyro and Feta fries that I've ever had, It's also the best meal I've had since making the move.  I will definitely be coming back here weekly."}
{"text":"If you are in Henderson and want a great Greek meal you need to go here. I love a good pita and that sauce I cannot spell. The folks here are super friendly and will also give you a soda while you wait. Price wise it is affordable and filling. Good portions and great staff. Go here if you have not been. It can get busy so be patient. Not a large space but they have outdoor seating if needed."}
{"text":"Now Open!! Was excited to have a Greek place finally on this side of town, this place doesn't disappoint.  Gyros are great with a reasonable price, combos about 12-14$.  I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely  delicious. Not phenomenal atmosphere - after all, it's in a strip mall. But very friendly and helpful service, and the food was great. The  great Greek Rice Bowl with gyro meat was delicious and more than enough. My wife tried the gyro - maybe not the best ever, but good. The feta fries are killer, matched only by our dessert choice, the kourabiedes  cookies.  Well worth a stop."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a chance to eat here I'm always impressed. The Great Greek Rice Bowl with falafel is one of the best plates."}
{"text":"This was quite a surprise! Great authentic Greek food made with quality ingredients.  Staff was very friendly, personable, and professional. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to pop in for yummy food. Wish they would open one in Summerlin I would be here weekly."}
{"text":"To write this review while I am starving is dangerous because I am tempted to eat my screen to see if I can perhaps capture just a drop of the deliciousness contained in the chicken gyro at The Great Greek. My stomach is angry at me for even attempting to write this while it is suffering, so I will keep it brief.  The spot is casual and spotless. You order at the counter. The prices are reasonable.   I ordered the chicken gyro combo and selected the Greek salad as my side, and as soon as it hit the table, I was in love. The pita was fluffy and piled high with every condiment I could covet. I snapped up a morsel of chicken that had fallen out, and I made a little \"oh yeah\" noise upon eating it. It was tender, juicy and filled with flavor. The side salad was super fresh and topped with the perfect Greek dressing.   I know it is trite to say, \"I wish it were closer,\" but it is true! I want a chicken gyro, and I want it now!"}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food on a small scale. It was definitely authentic and rivaled that of our trips to Santorini, Mykonos, and Athens. Great prices and beers from the Greek islands are available. We had the Lamb Gyro and the sampler plate with Greek salad. Everything was fresh and on par. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Best Greek Food I've ever had!!! Probably the nicest staff I've ever seen too!!  I drive all the way from the north side of Vegas to eat here!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  Only reason I didn't rate 5 is because the prices were maybe a dollar two more expensive than I'd like to see, and I don't care for the order at the counter option.    With that said, I definitely will return.  Falafel, dolmades, and salad were all great."}
{"text":"I always love coming here. I have brought friends and family here many times. Everyone loved it. The food is high quality and the service is great. Every employee from the kitchen to the register is constantly working for the customers. This isn't a fast food place. Food is made fresh every day.    I will order my food a head of time for pick up. It's great when I am in a rush to get back home."}
{"text":"We were blown away by the excellence of this Greek place. My mom got the shrimp entree; succulent mild shrimp over rice, topped with a scattering of raisins and sliced almonds, and served with greek salad; it was fantastic. The pita bread was the best we had ever had. Good hummus, too. I tried the famous rice pudding (far too sweet and heavy for me - Paymon's Mediterranean Cafe on Maryland Pkwy has the best) and the baklava (just okay). Staff was entirely Greek; family-owned place, with the requisite blue and white everywhere. Made me smile with the predictability of it all. In a good way. The wife-side of the ownership came by our table and chatted with us; very pleasant. There is another Greek spot very nearby; I had a hard time deciding which to try. It may be good as well, but I'm so glad I picked this one! It's not fancy, but there are tablecloths and they do serve wine and beer, with a couple of imported Greek beers."}
{"text":"I love this place! They're always busy. I usually call ahead and order takeout. The food is always fresh and delicious. My go to place for a healthy meal when I'm too lazy or tired to cook.   Portion size is fair and reasonable. They always cook the steak skewers to the correct temperature. I've ordered chicken, shrimp and steak. They always cook the proteins perfectly, it's never dry at all."}
{"text":"This place is such a GEM! Not only is the service great but the food is excellent!!! The shrimp side with the Greek salad is a perfect lunch and will keep me going back again and again."}
{"text":"Rice pudding Home made is to die for. Family owned and run. Very friendly staff. They used to offer a salmon version of the greek salad wrap. So so so so so good, but not sure if they still offer it with salmon."}
{"text":"The feta fries were the highlight of my family's first time here. I've been to numerous greek/Mediterranean spots and since this place is fairly new and near where we live, we decided to finally give it a try. We ordered the traditional gyro and shrimp and steak kabob plate...it was alright. I tried asking if they have the special garlic sauce, my heart shattered when the gentleman mentioned, \"I know Stephano's has it but we don't have that here.\" I haven't been there (yet!) but I've been to places like Manna and Meraki that carries the super \"oh so yummy\" garlic sauce that makes the food that much more delicious. For two plates, it was close to $30 which is quite on the pricey side, in my opinion. The place was clean and the traffic was steady on a Sunday afternoon. The workers didn't seem as upbeat as other Greek/Mediterranean places that I've been to. My son enjoyed the pita bread and I guess that's why I gave this place three stars...it was fresh, warm...the way it should be."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place. Awesome food, awesome service and awesome portions!! The guy behind the register explained what we were getting and he was right on the spot."}
{"text":"I've never taken the time to post, this time I made the time. Love this place! Food is fresh with great flavor. Love the Greek Salad, Lamb Gyros and Feta Fries. Busy but don't worry, you won't wait long and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Along the way to Hoover Dam, there was really not many choices. The Great Greek was the best I could find. We only tried Gyro Plate because they were not serving other grilled places that day. Attentive service, bright dining environment and food was served in a really generous size."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant when the wife and I were out running errands. I had been craving Greek food for a while and decided to give it a try.....boy am I thankful I did! As soon as we walked in...it was clean and refreshing! The Vegas summer has been kicking our bum...but it was comfortable the moment we walked in the door. The first thing I noticed, was how nice the decor is and how well kept the location is. I was excited to get to the counter.   Since I hadn't been here before, I stared at the menu in amazement...I feel the young lass at the counter is used to the shock on new faces...so she advised I grab a menu and make myself at home at a table...excellent idea! The wife and I sat down and looked over all of the delicious options.....thankfully she pulled me back...or I would have ordered two of everything!   Everything sounded beyond appetizing! We decided on a few appetizers, a salad, and some fries, but then I noticed they were offering a special that included a few of the items we were ordering. So we decided to get that and split it. I wanted the greek salad, hummus, and fires....but I was worried that us splitting the meal would leave us hungry.....boy was I wrong!!!!  The ladies behind the front counter continued to bring us parts of our order, as soon as they were ready...and I thought it would never end! I do wish the tomatoes for the salad were cut a tad smaller.....but that's just because I need to be able to shovel the yummy foods in faster!   Everything we tried was fresh and more than I expected for the prices. Our table was cleaned as soon as we finished each plate, and everyone was beyond kind and helpful. I look forward to making another trip here very soon and highly recommend you do as well!"}
{"text":"Filthy disgusting place! The owner is rude and I'm going to call the health inspector. We arrive and got the greek salad, skewers, and chicken pita. My boyfriend split the salad with me and when I was about to eat it a black hair was in it. My bf went to the owner and she said, \"must be the wind, so what do you want.\" My bf said I'm not eating this so she said ok and took the salad back and said she would make a small salad for him not even the entree salad he purchased!! Then he asked how come she's keeping the salad back there he returned she said oh she's going to reheat the chicken when the hair was mixed with chicken and the salad. My bf said no he's not eating that and she starts arguing with him and my bf said he wanted a refund. He got the refund. She got upset and better yet she told the chefs to hold on to the salad so yet another customer who orders it would have it! We have been here multiple times and honestly the food isn't as good as it was before and the owner is a ruthless old hag. WILL NEVER RETURN! Unless you want to eat hair and deal with it."}
{"text":"Will have to come back another time to try other plates. Food portions are bigger than I thought and even more delicious. Prices are reasonable but my only regret, I walked away without trying the baklava. I didn't have anymore room in my belly and had to pack up my leftovers (which my dad ate and loved). I'm definitely going back again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their Greek Salad.  I usually get it with slices of lamb in it..."}
{"text":"Food was very good  Service was ok. One of the woman who worked the front was a bit rude when my mom asked a question about her order.   Atmosphere was ok. Small location.   The only negative was the cost of the food. It was $90 for 4 people including drinks and a side of hummus. I don't think this place was work that cost.   You - we had 2 gyros plates, 1 vegetarian plate and 1 shrimp skewer plate, 2 sides of hummus and 4 drinks. With 15% tip it was just over $90."}
{"text":"Delicious and FRESH ingredients in all their dishes.  Salmon is delicious and perfectly cooked.  Veggies are crisp and SO fresh.  Love love love this place.  Wish there was more seating and delivery!"}
{"text":"That soup (which is named a word that I can never pronounce) is so good! More lemon would have made it even better. The feta fries that everyone was raving about are very good; the perfect bar food munchie. I was pretty hungry, so I also got a small Greek salad, which wasn't very small! It was very fresh and good. Same with the pita bread. Yum yum yum! Customer service was great, too. I wish they had Jasmine tea or something unique like that, but only unsweetened Fuse."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  This place has great food and amazing service.  Everything is always extremely fresh and tasty!  They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Honestly was stocked to have this near the house. Heard it opened and been wanting to try it. Asked the Hubby if he wanted to have dinner there this evening only to be disappointed.   We ordered the traditional Gyro (beef/lamb). It was a HOT mess! Everything was falling apart. The sauce was overpowering and I couldn't taste the flavor of the meat. The meat was cut carelessly. Some where thick, some were thin and some were super thick. The feta fries were very sad. Served \"cold\" where the feta was just blooped on top. Was difficult to eat as well.   Ordered a chicken fingers kids meal and it was overpriced. Came with three very small pieces of chicken, fries and salad.   Place was packed, clean and LOUD!  Would we come back? Nope."}
{"text":"I love this place! The whole staff, especially Jak always make me feel so special. I would recommend anything and everything on their menu.  It's always fast, fresh and always exceptional service."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday for lunch and ordered 1. Athenian burger combo with fries, 7.50+2.95 - Grilled Angus Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzaziki 2. Great Greek gyro combo with rice, 7.95+2.95 - Chicken or Lamb. Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, Tzaziki for $23.08  Side choices include: French Fries, Rice, Greek Salad, Avolemono Soup, Feta Fries (50c more) - Nice patio seating. Food delivered to us.  - Wait time around 15 min. Fast food style but wait time like a dine in restaurant. - Big portioned burger. Fresh and crispy fries.  - Packed Gyro. Lame rice. - Good taste. A bit pricey for what it's worth. Worth it for 1 try.  - Hard to compete when there are so many around for about the same taste with coupons for cheaper.  - Uncertain if I'd return."}
{"text":"This place is flat awesome! Super friendly staff, clean facility, and great food and value! Enjoyed the Greek gyro with chicken and feta fries. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wow, let me start by saying I this is the first time any business has asked me to give my seat up for other patrons. I came in and ordered to go, feeling under the weather so I decided to get dinner for my husband and I. After ordering and tipping I found a small table and waited for my order. The Owner/ manager comes over and taps me on my shoulder and asked me to move to a single chair by the door so other customers could sit. Wow! I'm African American and a business owner myself, and that is a complete no! No! There was a gentleman ordering to-go whom sat at a table with four chairs and remained until his order was complete. I wish I could've un-tipped and left! I will never return as well as letting all my friends and family know just how this establishment feels about people of color! I'm more hurt than anything that this type of action is allowed yet still. We are all humans, no matter what color."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good Greek restaurants in Henderson.  From my house to this place is like climbing Mt. Olympus but it's soooo worth the drive.  Holy Michael Bolton, this is my favorite Greek restaurant in all the land!    It's a small but very clean restaurant.  This may be irrelevant to most people but for somebody who freaks out a lot when the battery on my phone is less than 90%,  the high top tables against the wall with outlets was a great plus! Oh yeah, the service is great too.  It's quick, to-go orders are quicker and phone-in orders are quickest.  The steak souvlaki is tender and has great flavor.  It comes with Greek salad and you can get it with either rice pilaf or fries.  What I always get is the beef and lamb gyro and feta fries.  Soft and warm pita bread hugging slices of meat topped with melted feta cheese and tzatziki...underneath lettuce, tomatoes and red onions.  It's heavy yet portable and non-messy.  I can eat their gyro hot or cold.  Raw onions give me a headache but theirs is sliced rather than chopped so it's easy for me to just pick them out.  The feta fries are amazing.  Each fry is lightly breaded for that extra crisp.  Hot fries topped with feta cheese = cheesy goodness!  \"I'll be there someday, I can go the distance I will find my way, if I can be strong I know ev'ry mile, will be worth my while When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong\"  - Michael Bolton"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by here to get a couple of gyros to go. This place was super busy but from the looks of the food we weren't about to turn around. I ordered the traditional lamb Gyro and my mom got a traditional beef Gyro meal, that came with a salad and fries. We sat and waited for our food. A party of two ordered after us, then a party on one and a party of three ordered after them. ALL of them were served before our food to go was ready. We asked the cashier/server/bus boy why three parties for their food before us and he said \"we're really busy right now. Maybe that big order up on the window is yours.\" My mom told him \"We ordered two things and everyone else ordered way more than us. Why is it taking so long? This is not ok.\" The guy said sorry, but didn't try to make anything right. Thankfully when we got home and took a bite of the Gyros they tasted great. Hopefully, if we decide to go back this place will be on their game."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today! loved the food and service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the steak souvlaki with extra tzatziki, it was so good. Take out was fast and easy too."}
{"text":"best gyro ! love the feta fries.  mom and pop place, always try to support local!!  make sure your call in orders around dinner time, bc it gets busy! they recently just renovated to make it bigger..."}
{"text":"The grilled shrimp was excellent at a reasonable price. Grilled perfectly, great fresh taste. Crispy fries and fresh salad. If I lived here, I would frequent this place! I took some baklava to go. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious... hit it out of the park again. Greek salad with gyros meat. Huge sluces of vegies in it snd lots of meat. Always my fav greek place. The service was gast for lunch so i appreciate that and the people are always nice."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome we had a lamb chops special it was the best night ever have had, and I'll be Greek food all over the United States!"}
{"text":"Do they put crack in their food?!? It is so extremely addicting. I get an undeniable craving for the Great Greek at least once a week.  The restaurant itself is casual and small but has many tables to dine in at, and they have outdoor seating as well. It does get busy but you'll get a table soon enough. You can also call ahead to take out.   The service is OK. The employees are nice enough and they're great about clearing tables. It usually takes me quite a bit of time after ordering to get the food but it's so worth the wait.   Their classic greek salad is delicious. The hummus and pita is the perfect side dish or snack. They also include pita with the salad so I try just to get a small side of hummus and not the whole appetizer dish. The portions are great.   If you haven't tried this place I'll warn you, the food is so amazing that your first taste will make you a hopeless Great Greek addict just like me! I'm going to need a support group soon because my husband must think I have a serious problem with how often I want to come here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service here!  Checked out the restaurant shortly after it opened, and it's a great addition to the southwest part of town!  I come here fairly often, and am always satisfied.  During my last visit, I witnessed a grown man have a meltdown over a pepperoncini, and the staff responded professionally, and calmly despite the comments made towards them.  They work hard to provide a welcoming environment, and they are great at ensuring customers are satisfied.  Cleanliness is always spot on!  Even when busy, they make their way around to clean up the seating area, and pick up your plates when you're done.  I've come here every week since opening, and haven't seen the place a mess yet. The food is also always consistent, and is made perfectly every time.  If something doesn't come out to perfection, they quickly remake it without incident.    I will continue to frequent this location, and highly recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"This was really great place and food was amazing. The place was very really clean. We ordered several items as take out and all of the dishes were good. The surprize was  the Yia Yia's Pastitsio, it was so flavorful- super yum! I hope to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Who needs a Fat or Mad Greek when you can have a Great Greek. The Great Greek really does hit the nail on the head. What was so great about my meal? Everything, start to finish. It was a completely enjoyable experience.   Dinner with fellow Yelpers, Judd and Lynn L., put this place on my bookmarks and it was about time to pay them a visit. With two other Greek food lovers in toe, we came out to try as much as possible. One Mezze Plate, Two Beef Slouvaki Plates, two fountain drink, one bottled water, Rice Pudding, a Baklava, and two secret Greek Coffees (explanation later on) cost a little under $50. There was even left over after I tried to cram as much in as possible. As I write, I lay in bed in a semi-comatose state.   The Mezze Plate is a combination of vegetarian favorites; spanakopita, two dolmas, hummus, pita bread, tsaziki sauce, and two falafels. The puffed pastry was flaky, buttery, and filled with spinach and cheese. The falafels were crispy on the outside and light inside creating the perfect combination. The Slouvaki Plate boasted the most tender and juicy beef. They were drool worthy at medium rare and the juices oozed into the rice. Taste bud overload! With the second plate there is an option to pick between three different sides; rice, fries, and Greek salad. The gentleman behind the register gave us all salads on top of one rice and one order fries. The guest service is amazingly friendly. We were continuously checked upon during dinner as well.   After our meal, one of my friends pushed me to ask about coffee. It is not listed on the menu, but it could not hurt to ask. The same guy who took our order made a joke that it was on their secret menu and it was no problem to make. Now to desserts! The Rice Pudding is thick and rich. The Baklava had great depth and not too sweet. They are definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in town. On the way out, we even got a warm farewell. Thorough is a good way to describe the service."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here while I was visiting Las Vegas. I wasn't sure how I felt about Greek Food, but after trying the food here, I am on the lookout for a Greek restaurant around me that can compare and I don't know if i'll be able to find one.  First of all, the service was amazing. The staff was friendly and we received our food in a very timely manor. I tried the Great Greek Gyro and Feta Fries... I don't know if I have words to describe how delicious they were. I know that the next time I visit my friend in Henderson, I will be begging her to take me back!"}
{"text":"This is a really great spot for some great affordable Greek food. We came here as a family of 12 and the employees were so nice and catered to us like we were family. I will definitely come back here next time I visit the area. All the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Greek eateries in the valley. I used to go here frequently when I leaved close by but now that we moved across the valley I can only take advantage whenever I'm in Henderson. They have a delicious Greek rice bowl which is my go to dish here but all the other options are good too. I like the fact that they play Greek/Mediterranean music it gives a good mood should you choose to dine in."}
{"text":"Checked in to this place based on the reviews and it did not disappoint. Not a spacious sit down affair but the food is delicious. Lamb gyro and Greek salad were both amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome unreal super fresh .... this will be a favorite each year really good food great people"}
{"text":"A friend that knows his food told us about this little place and was he ever right! Went out of my dietary comfort zone and fell for their feta fries. Saw them on several tables and it was a done deal. Thank goodness after a few my craving was satisfied and I moved on to the real food. The chicken souvlaki plate was more than tasty. The two chicken skewers of marinated chicken breast were moist and tender. The rice pilaf was seasoned perfectly and side salad was delish with a more than generous side salad, romaine lettuce, too, no iceberg lettuce here! My hubby had the chicken bowl which he said was excellent.  Bascially,  it was a Greek salad with a skewer of chicken breast served over a bed of rice. We also sampled some hummus, which was also flavorful.  It was presented in a little bowl topped with  several garbanzo's and sprinkled with paprika. My only comment was that the grape leaves were bland.  A tad more seasoning would be helpful. The were presented beautifully and again the portion size was generous.  This family run restaurant has personalized excellent service. Very friendly and helpful!  Parking is easy, close and free,  can't beat that!   Next time we're in the area we will be back and I'll see if I can be strong and not yield to the temptation of the feta fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to The Great Greek a couple of times. Tasty food with nice size portion. Friendly service . Defiantly will go back there again."}
{"text":"Like Ellie Goulding's song \"Lights,\" Greek food never gets old to me.  On any given day falafels and gyros can keep calling, calling, calling me to lunch or dinner.   Been wanting to try out Great Greek for a while, but it's a little more east than I usually travel.   Tonight I found myself in the area and decided to call in some takeout.  I went with a lamb gyro with feta fries on the side, and asked for a side of falafel because I simply have to try some at every Greek restaurant I go to because it's in the title of my list here on Yelp for Mediterranean eats.  When I arrived the food was ready and waiting for me and I was happy to see Dr. Pepper on the list of fountain drink options because as you may know, Dr. Pepper is the unofficial non-alcoholic nectar of the Gods.    I did have to drive about 20 minutes until I got home, so please take that into consideration for the food review that follows.  I immediately went for some feta fries which were pretty standard french fries covered in, you guessed it, feta cheese.  Because of the drive, the feta cheese had sort of started to congeal a little, but it had no effect on the taste and I found them delicious.   I will say for a quick comparison that I do prefer Yanni's Gyros fries where he adds garlic, feta and hot sauce, but I digress.  Then came the gyro.  With the first bite I knew it was something special.  Tender, flavorful gyro meat with the standard lettuce tomato and onion SMOTHERED in tzatziki and feta.   I think it had more of these two ingredients than any gyro I've had elsewhere, and to me that was a good thing.  Between the fries and the gyro the meal was fetariffic!  Sorry about that.  Lastly I tried some of the side of falafel, and was a little disappointed in those.  They weren't bad by any means, but I feel like I've had better in many places like Hedary's and the Fat Greek for example.  The texture was good, but it just wasn't as flavorful as I like.  Prices were reasonable and service was friendly and efficient.  If Great Greek were closer to my work or home I'd make it a regular visit, but for now it will remain a solid choice when I'm in the area (which is almost never.  Step your game up Sunset Station!)"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST GREEK FOOD IN VEGAS!!!!!!! Need I say more? What are you waiting for, go check it out."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I truly believe it's the best Greek restaurant in Henderson. Last night my husband and I got the  falafel pitas with a side Greek salad and the feta fries. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! This place never disappoints which is why we choose to come here for our Mediterranean flavors. Not to mention the price is very reasonable for the portion of food that you get. The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly. I believe the owner took our order last night and he was very helpful and so very polite. The restaurant feels very family orientated and I like that. There is plenty seating on the inside and outside and the decor is pretty. All around a great place to eat and will be eating here in the future."}
{"text":"Loved it! Really good Greek food, awesome and fast service, good prices!! My favorite Greek restaurant in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Lamb gyro is big and delightful! Their white sauce is very tasty and has feta cheese mixed in it. The lamb has ingredients that lingers in my mouth in a good way. Their fries are perfectly thick and and perfectly crunchy on the outside. Their baklava is wonderful-not too sweet either compared to others I've had.   Customer service is on the friendly tip."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this place but I can honestly say the best part of the food was the pita my gyro meat was cold and the fries were not seasoned. The chicken souvlaki was okay but tasted like it was old. The salad was just plain with some feta cheese and dressing plus this was kinda expensive. You do get a lot of food for the price but you won't eat most of it"}
{"text":"My friend took me to lunch here for my birthday! I was craving Greek and had never been here before and she doesn't eat lamb, or onions, or... so this was a gamble on her part as well.  Absolutely terrific, delicious food.  When I ordered the gyros plate I was specific as to what I wanted and got exactly what I ordered and it was DELICIOUS.  Meat was well flavored and tender, the tzatziki was perfect and the pita was exactly the correct mix of soft/crispy that I like.  My friend discussed all her requirements while ordering at the counter and the gracious and helpful server made sure that absolutely everything was perfect before we were served at our table inside.  We were lucky enough to be against the window and watched a tiny boy and his father signing back and forth about his food demands...it would have gone viral if we'd filmed the 2-year old feeding himself the hummus.  So I think we were served immediately but can't be sure. lol.  I will not only go back but I've already been back.  And I ordered the hummus this time.  Great flavor.  Clean, great food, gracious and polite staff, efficient...it's my go to Greek forever."}
{"text":"The food is fresh. The service fair.  Upon ordering and paying i am prompted to, would i like to leave a 15-18-20 % tip.  For what. Standing in line to order my food to go or at best eat there. Get my own water/drink.  I dont think so. The online ordering was a terrible experience. I could not order what i wanted. The site kept showing the wrong quantity. The lid to my salad dressing was not put on tight and leaked all over the bag."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Very friendly service, fast to bring out the food and excellent gyros to boot! Highly recommend you check this place out as it's definitely one of the best gyros I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new to the southwest side and I'm glad that they opened to add more cuisine flare to the long Blue Diamond stretch. The food is delicious and portions are fairly large. Customer service was superb. I would definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"A little pricey but worth the bang for the buck. I love the French Fries. Nice clean place very friendly and great service."}
{"text":"We have been here a million times. Never disappointed. We seem to always order the same things. Gyros plate with rice and salad, I like my salad village style...tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and dressing.  My man orders the 2 skewer meal, lamb and beef, with rice and regular Greek salad. If we are really hungry we order the feta fries also. Feta fries are fries covered with melted Feta and I believe Monterey jack cheese...mmmm mmmm mmmm! The Gyros is cooked to perfection and so flavorful. The rice is buttery and lemony perfection. I don't know where they get their tomatoes from but they are always so ripe and red and flavorful.  The meat for the skewers is always cooked exactly how you request and the steak skewer meat is so tender and tasty I would think it was filet mignon.  They need to expand their Henderson location because they are sooooo busy that sometimes you have to wait for a table and they are always busy with take outs!!! We LOVE the Great Greek and even though it is a drive for us it is well worth it!!!! We always take visitors there for dinner when they come to town!  Keep up the great cooking!!!"}
{"text":"While traveling on business we stopped in for lunch, and what a great choice it was.  We had the Beef & Lamb Giro platters.  They came with the Greek salad as a starter and french fries.  The giros where excellent, served with lettuce and tomato.  The Tzatziki sauce was very good as well.    Appears to be a family run business and they did a really good job of serving and keeping us happy.  Don't miss this one!!!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Henderson and some of the best Greek we have had.  The portions are great, the food is great, the staff is great, and the speed of ordering to food arriving is great.  I wish they would expand their store so there would be more inside seating!  People waiting for orders sometime take up the seats for those of us wanting to eat inside."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food! I usually get the chicken gyro with feta fries. Very fresh and tasty! If I come in during peak lunch hour, I usually get my food to go because it's so packed that there isn't an open table. No big deal - just shows how much people enjoy their food. I'm glad that the manager clarified on Yelp what the picketing on the street corner was about. We were  really curious."}
{"text":"First time here & I have to say... GREAT customer service and amazing food, with a pretty environment. It's like I'm in Greece again! Thank God there's a Greek place nearby! Definitely coming here more!"}
{"text":"Can we just talk about how aesthetically pleasing your food looks on their wooden tables as the sun is streaming in. It's absolutely beautiful to a foodie who is obsessed with food porn shots. Have visited this location and twice, and both times did not disappoint, nor did they differ in experience or quality. The staff is extremely friendly and patient to newbs like me, who have absolutely no idea what to order.   On the first visit I ordered the Gyro Plate with rice pilaf. It seemed a better option and a more bang for your buck kinda thing, but wasn't as yummy as the skewer. Second visit I went with that instead, and was definitely more satisfied. Go with your gut peeps!   Service was prompt, and location clean. It was definitely yummy!!"}
{"text":"Love , Love, Love this place!  Best greek food in town.  Glad they opened on this side of town. Because I usually drive to Henderson to get my greek fix at their original location."}
{"text":"Eat anything on the menu! Delicious! I have visited this place three times in one week! That rice bowl is to die for, it has the perfect rice, salad ratio."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! love the gyros plate!! amazing staff so very nice and helpful!  and nearby my favorite shopping making this the best spot to stop for lunch or dinner!! Gyros plate is delicious the fries are top notch and salad is fresh, and tasty! I love to stop here when we come to Henderson! 0"}
{"text":"My yo go place for lunch. I used to pass this place every day on my way home. Finally I got to try it and wasn't disappointed. Good is EXCELLENT! I haven't try everything yet but I will. Interior is very nice and clean. Easy to order for pick up, usually ready by the time you get there if you call in advance."}
{"text":"This really is 'Great Greek'. Hubby and I popped in for mid-week dinner to go. I got a grilled chicken gyro with feta fries, he got a grilled chicken plate. Both were really good! The cheese on the feta fries had gotten a little cold by the time we made it home but they were still pretty tasty! We also ordered a side of dolmades, which leads to the -1 star, they were out of dolmades so she offered hummus instead which was priced less than the dolmades. We didn't make a big deal about it because we paid with a card and it would have been more hassle to refund such a small amount so we just ate it. Plus the hummus ended up being good anyway!! Over all I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mediterranean restaurants I have tried. The chicken and steak is very moist and tender. If you love lemon soup this is the place. I add a little rice pilaf to it this just perfect for lunch or a light dinner. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"WOW OH WOW is what this place does to my tastebuds. I stopped by here on a whim & was not disappointed. I had the avgolemono soup, the great greek gyro & feta fries. OMG the feta fries are ridiculous good. Everything was so fresh, flavorful and amazingly delicious. The restaurant is quite small but extremely clean & service was A++. My husband & I are now regulars."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp looking for Greek, this popped up and was near. Good decor and food. The staff was pleasant and place was clean. Was a nice small quality restaurant. Will be back  If in town you should try this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the portions are huge and the taste is great, the price is good, for Greek food, the restaurant is impeccable. Will definitely come back  again. If you come with a group the family deals are the best: Gyro, rice or fries, salad, soda and dessert for about $45-48. We had the 4 people deal and could not finish it. My husband wanted for me to add: \"The rice pudding is great, just like my sito used to make.\""}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Vegas! Great service. Wish they would open another restaurant closer to green valley but, we'll drive"}
{"text":"This place is the best in town. It is consistently delicious with SUCH courteous service.  I recommend this place to any and every person in the area. You won't be disappointed.  The mezze plate completes me.  Last time we ordered from them, my husband went to pick up the food and there was an incredibly rude and obnoxious patron and we got a free baklava for the inconvenience. They didn't say anything, just slipped it into the bag. Needless to say, it was the greatest baklava I've ever had.  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now and felt the need to truly express how much I enjoy their food. The food is exceptional! I usually get the skewers, like all the skewers they have and I'm always delightfully satisfied.   I couldn't think of any other place I'd rather try for catering my daughter's little 4th birthday staycation than The Great Greek. OMG it was AMAZING!  I ordered a half tray chicken 5 skewers of the chicken, steak, pork, and vegetable Appetizer combo  And it fed 10 people vegan and non!! Bonus, it was under $150 which was unbelievable!  If you have not tried this place please give it a shot. You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Happy that they opened something different on this side of town.  My fiancé and I tried the traditional Greek beef/lamb gyro and they definitely didn't disappoint.   Get ready to eat with both hands because the Gyros are packed with meat.   Look forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"The food was tasty.  The atmosphere OK.  Price was reasonable.  The Gyro platter was good.  I thought the sauce was a little bland (could have used more dill and seasoning).  The feta fries were good.  Food easily deserved 3 1/2 or 4 stars.  Customer service pulled them down a star.  The reason:  When they were taking my order, they asked how many were in my party (I was alone) and they told me to sit at a 2 person table (a reasonable request since they were almost full (a testimony to their good food), but when I finished placing my order, only a 4 place table was available (someone had sat down at the place they had pointed out to me).  The only table left was the 4 place table, so I sat there (outside was too hot).  When my food came out, they were clearing a recently vacant 2 seat table and put my food there, and motioned me to re-seat myself.  I felt they could have handled moving me a little better then to put my food at another table.  If they had asked me 1st, it wouldn't have been an issue, but somehow the way it played out without a polite exchange of communications made me feel there was an underlying lack of customer commitment.  I will go back, because the food was good, but hope this review will help them sharpen their customer communications skills."}
{"text":"Great family place good dessert the baklava ice cream is so good. The best gyros and Greek salad I've had. It's authentic Greek and the owners are friendly. Always come here when in Vegas.  Price is well worth it. Tried the garlic shrimp and Greek salad first time was here then the gyros but always get the ice cream. Lol"}
{"text":"Newly opened closer to us and the food and stuff are still great.  It's bigger than the one on Stephanie but it's not to crowded here which is good for me lol"}
{"text":"One of the better Greek/Kabob places on this side of town. Everyone is always friendly. Place is always clean and they are working FAST to get you your order.  Their lamb gyro is good and on par with most other gyros I've had. Their fries are normal fries. Nothing super special. I'm used to krinkle cut(which I love) fries at Greek places usually, though. The salad was super fresh, but needed a little more dressing (maybe on the side, as not everyone would agree with me).   All in all, I am here once or twice a month cuz I live in the area, but I wouldn't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"I love this place for 2 main reasons. First, the food is delicious. I recommend the lamb souvlaki and the Great Greek Bowl with falafel. Their hummus is so creamy and light, I could have it every day. So much flavor with everything, we were pretty much quiet the whole meal bc we didn't want to do anything but eat! Two, the portion size is phenomenal for the price you pay; you definitely get your value/ money's worth. The ambience is cute, fresh and clean and the staff is very friendly. I liked seeing that they enjoyed their job and being there while we were having our meal, it was just a nice extra touch. Outdoor seating is available and the dining room feels like you're eating at your place or a friend's house. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Such. Great service, even better food! So fresh, so crisp! First time here but I will be returning. Inside and outside seating. Great menu selection. Easy to read. With plenty of customization options.   We had the two kabob plates with rice, warm pita, and a side of Greek salad. Huge and delicious portions. Chicken was cooked perfectly. Grilled  crunchy but soft on the inside.Rice well cooked too. The salad was my favorite. Just the right amount of every ingredient with every bite.    We opted for sitting outside since it was nice that day. They brought our food to the table. Had a great time. They are well priced and with the amount of food you get its well worth every penny."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Henderson. The food is delicious (and I have tried several different dishes) and the staff is unfailingly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Home run for anyone who loves Greek. We finished a fun day mountain biking and climbing and we're looking for a good, healthy dinner. Fresh, crisp Greek salad, rice plate and Mezze plate was a homerun."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!!! Only complaint is that the place is bursting at the seams! It gets quite busy and it's hard to find a place to sit... but then again that just proves how good the food is! This is my favorite restaurant in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not reviewed this place before. We have been coming here for literally years. We only moved to Henderson about one year ago, but this place is close to our office here that we visited many times before and we used to only eat here. Solid, authentic, tasty Greek food. I LOVE the chicken lemon soup. The Greek salad is good too - they use good, real feta unlike other places. I usually get chicken skewers that are yummy and juicy too. The crazy fries are amazing - the French fries are very tasty and the crazy fries have feta on top that melts and tastes like a dream. Ok - I am done now. Just thinking about this place and my mouth is watering"}
{"text":"OMG!! OMG!! OMG!!! That is really all I can say.  I ordered a gyro sandwich and feta fries. TO DIE FOR! Yup really. Can't wait to go back on my next visit to the area. Can I franchise this is San Diego please???"}
{"text":"This place is the best greek food I have found in vegas. Hands down worth the drive off the strip."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that this place comes in second best next to the original. I did like the open seating at this restaurant plenty of space for family style dinner. The benefit to this place is definitely being closer to the strip.  I highly recommend the feta fries"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep short and just say that this is quite possibly the best Greek food I have ever eaten. Everything from the souvlaki to the pasticcio to the rice pudding was phenomenal and I can't wait to go back. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Blue Diamond location a few times and it has been good almost every time. The steak and chicken souvlaki is amazing and you cannot go wrong with the rice pilaf. The baklava is actually very good and just enough honey. A bit on the sweet side but I prefer that.   Each plate comes with a salad so no need to order a huge salad is you are ordering many plates."}
{"text":"Beef/lamb gyro + fries + drink = $10?  Yes, that's what I had for lunch today at The Great Greek and it was a great deal!  It's probably only the second time I've had a gyro and this one was overflowing with meat, lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese,Tzaziki sauce, and flavor.  The fries were also delicious.  The service is attentive, the place is clean, and I'm just sad that I didn't take baklava to go because I'm sure it's great, too.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum yum lemon rice chicken soup with fresh dill? Wow.  The baklava is beautiful, can't wait to eat it... But too full from the small Greek sale with gyro meat. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent,  very very good easy to read menu and reasonably priced. Fast service and lots if parking. They could be a little more friendly but over all 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant.  The food is so delicious and the family and staff could not be more friendly.  Our go to dishes are the rice bowls, gyros and feta fries.  And don't skip dessert- the baklava is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm coming back. By far the best Greek salad I've had in the Valley. If you haven't tried this place you should have a solid case of FOMO. Get in and get some amazing food prepared the right way."}
{"text":"Yummy...awesome food, great service, fun atmosphere. A wonderful place to go with a group of friends and just relax and cpmmunicate."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I've been twice and look forward to returning on my next Vegas  trip--it is worth the drive from  the Strip.   I've ordered the same thing both times: the Great Greek chicken gyro with the feta fries.   Today, I also tried the hummus and souvalaki. Amaze-balls. Everything is fresh and delicious. They bring you warm grilled pita. I gobbled every morsel. We were almost tempted to order to go. But the portions here are huge and our room does not have a mini fridge.  Hands down, the best Greek food I've ever enjoyed!"}
{"text":"There's a reason I keep coming back every time I'm in Vegas. This food is AMAZING. The girls who work the front are so sweet and helpful. The soup is to die for and super clean.. Oh come back to So Cal with me."}
{"text":"Standard Greek takeout food but with sit-down restaurant wait times to get your food. Staff seems a bit frazzled and confused.  Menu is made up of gyros, casseroles and salads with rice pilaf or fries (the good kind, not garbage Ore-Ida crinkle fries cut like Raisin' Canes.)  Food is pretty standard, tastes like Kronos gyro meat. Prices average about $10 per person. Dining room gets extremely busy at dinner time so maybe order ahead to go to avoid fighting for a table."}
{"text":"Delicious. I really enjoyed the feta fries and gyro. A lot of delicious Greek food. The people are very nice. It gets really busy at certain times but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"When I go to Vegas we always have to eat at Great Greek. Everything in their menu is delicious, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. We always enjoy our meal no matter what we pick. The manager Jack is great! He always checks to see how we are doing and keeps us laughing. We will continue to eat here regularly."}
{"text":"1 - 5 scale Food 5 Service 4 Decor 4 very clean  I think the gyro is as good as what I've tried in New York City, but the fries are the best in town. The flavor is fantastic if you're a chicken or lamb fan and the feta fries are killer good.   This is a great little place to grab a quick lunch on the patio."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their feta dip (Tirokafteri)! It is creamy Greek feta with spicy roasted peppers and it is amazing! I seriously dream about this dip.  My Husband loves Greek food, so it doesn't take much convincing to get him to take me to dinner here. We traditionally get the gyro plate, which comes with sliced gyro meat, pita bread and your choice of french fries or rice pilaf. I usually get the rice because it's a healthier option and it's very well made.  The restaurant is small and gets crowded. There is no table service - you order at the counter and they will bring your food to you when it's ready. The gyro plate is just $11.95, which is a much better value than many of the other local Greek places we've been to, and in my opinion this food is better. They've been around for a long time, so I'd say they're doing something right!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  We drive all the way from Summerlin.  A good 30 minute drive!!!! Everything is delicious.  Please build a cafe in Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"This Greek place is EXCELLENT!  :-)  Very high quality food, service and facility + good prices = GREAT VALUE! I've become a regular over the past several years!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken souvlaki and the beef gyros are great.  The rice pudding is sooooooooo good.  Definitely a new regular spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go got home had no tzatziki and no pita with my gyro plate.. gotta have some Ziki with gyro meat. I was really excited to try this place and let me down on my first trip. Food is fresh and tasty and salad was really good & fresh with the dressing, but not happy with no ziki sauce, to me that's what I love most about gyro meat it's the combo of ziki and gyro. It's quite a ways from my house also so not traveling back, maybe I'll give it another shot in the future. All in all tasty food 3 stars for the lack of order completion, went to a Greek spot by my house for a side of zeek."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, clean restaurant, fast service and all around great experience! Definitely a new fave for my family"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here. I stood in line while my husband and kids secured a table. We were asked to give up the table because \"whoever orders first gets a table\".  This was broadcasted over the entire restaurant. We got up and left immediately as that's the first time I've ever heard that. I will be sure to never come back to this restaurant and I will tell all my friends about the rude way we were treated."}
{"text":"Someone recommended The Great Greek and boy was I impressed! I had the grilled marinade shrimp with extra pita bread...sooooo good! The restaurant was clean and the service was food.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The fiancée and I love Greek food and wanted to make a stop to try out a new Greek place! After walking in we were greeted by friendly people. We ordered two gyros. One was a chicken meal with feta fries (yum) and a beef/lamb gyro with an added steak skewer. After waiting a few minutes our food came out. Instantly we were both surprised by how much tzatiki sauce was on both gyros. Seriously there was a ton! After scraping some of the sauce off we were ready to eat. I went first with my lamb/beef gyro and it was quite tasty. The biggest problem with both gyros was the tzatiki sauce wasn't implanted into every bite! The tzatiki sauce was misplaced and hopefully they can fix that. The chicken we both tried was very dry. The steak skewer was cooked to perfection. Seriously good, but it could have used some salt. Overall I'll be back but ask for lighter tzatiki sauce and hopefully they can put it on the pita bread as well as some on top."}
{"text":"I can be your gyro, baby.  . Went on Saturday 2-6-16 at 12PM and placed a to-go order.  $32.20 got me a greek salad bowl with chicken, a greek salad wrap, and some goodies for my baby boy.  After about thirty minutes and watching many who came in after me receive their food I went to the front counter to see what was going on.  I think they lost my order to be honest but shortly after that they had my food bagged up for me and I was on my way.  They were nice enough to give me a free baklava for the inconvenience.  COOL!  .  $10.95 Greek salad rice bowl comes with your choice of meat (I chose chicken), rice pilaf, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and tzaziki sauce, though I received no tzaziki sauce.  Unfortunately I didn't notice the tzaziki sauce was missing until I was already home.   It was still pretty tasty, however.  The rice was cooked well, the chicken was nice and tender, and the salad was delicious even without any dressing. For some reason there was half an avocado on it which is not on the menu and I didn't ask for it.   .  $7.95 Greek salad wrap comes with lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, cucumbers, garbanzo beans, kalamata olives, feta cheese, tazaziki sauce and is wrapped up in a grilled tortilla.  My husband inhaled it and said it was delicious.   .  I didn't like having to wait so long and they kinda screwed up my order but the food is delicious and they gave me a free baklava...soo.....4 stars I guess.  I definitely want to come back and try the feta fries!"}
{"text":"Tried the gyro and after all the positive reviews on here was not as inspired by the taste as I thought I would be.  The cost was more expensive than the normal.  The meat was not that tender as well .   I will try again however"}
{"text":"Wow! I was delighted to have sampled the delectable Mediterranean cuisines at The Great Greek. I savored the steak entree and my hubby had the gyro one. Each dish starts off with salad and the fries were so so tasty. I have to say, the hummus here is one of the best I've had. The service was very attentive and the whole restaurant well kept. The portions were very generous and the value for what is served is quite plentiful. If you're craving appetizing Mediterranean fare at a great price, you'll love The Great Greek!"}
{"text":"The is place is awesome my fiancé and I come to the Great Greek every other week. The food is super fresh, the staff is friendly and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good moderately priced meal living in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food, ambience is pretty amazing! I have gone to both locations now and I appreciate their consistency throughout the brand."}
{"text":"The Greek bowl here is good. It's basically a Greek salad with rice pilaf, garbanzo beans, a tzatziki dressing, and your choice of meat (I pick gyro) . It runs about $9-10 but it's enough to make two meals out of it and leaves you feeling light and not sluggish like fast food does."}
{"text":"My quest for a good Greek restaurant in Las Vegas has been a long and arduous journey. I am admittedly quite picky, you see I've had the real thing in Greece and it was so delicious and effortless that I refuse to settle for fake American alternatives. This is definitely the pinnacle of Greek food in Las Vegas!  This cute little mom and pop shop is spotless. The decor is surprisingly simple with a few Greek finishes. They have the typical menu and are very friendly. I got a traditional beef/lamb gyro and made it a combo to include a greek salad and a drink. The greek salad was delicious. I am not a huge fan of olives and onions, so I gave half of the salad to my husband, but I was sure to clean up the huge chunks of cucumber and a good portion of the lettuce and tomato.   The gyro was gigantic! The meat and the tzatziki sauce were delicious and complimented perfectly by the soft pita bread and the tomato, feta, and lettuce. I couldn't have been happier. While it definitely looked impossible to eat the entire thing, it was exactly what I did. I cleaned my plate and stole a few of my husband's feta fries. The feta fries have melted feta and herbs and were pretty good, but I have definitely had better. Unfortunately, for the amount of cheese on them they didn't have much flavor at all, in fact I had to dip them in ketchup which seemed like a real shame. The fries were rather thick, perhaps it would have been executed better with shoe string style fries. Other than that, this place is fantastic! I am so happy to finally have a good Greek restaurant in town to curb my cravings. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love having a great Greek restaurant in the neighborhood. Food is always delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday.  First time here.  Looking for comfort food with a dog friendly atmosphere and ended up here.   I had the chicken kabob plate with feta fries. It came with a side salad. The wait time wasn't that bad after ordering.   Dog friendly patio makes me happy. I love bringing my dog wherever I go if possible.   I would definitely come back and get other things on the menu.   Parking lot.  Casual dining. Indoor and outdoor seating.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Overall: The Great Greek serves up good Greek food, and everyone seems to know so don't be surprised if there aren't any seats!  Food: 4  Grilled Chicken Souvlaki: The chicken was moist with a nice grilled flavor. The rice was fluffy and separated, just how I like it, but it's not as flavorful as the rice at my favorite kabab place. A lot of places seem to skimp on the quality of their pita bread, but their pita bread was fluffy and soft.  Grilled Steak Souvlaki: The steak was tender and moist. I enjoy the grilled flavor on meats, but they took it slightly to far and some edges were burnt and bitter.  Both our plates were on the saltier side (in terms of meat and rice), but it became well balanced when eaten with the light tzatziki and acidic salad.  Service: 3  The restaurant is quick service, so you order at the counter and servers will bring out your dish if it's eat in.  The servers were nice. I didn't realize that there was feta cheese on the salads so I didn't specify no cheese during my order, but they were still nice enough to exchange our salads for us. Even though it's quick service, the staff was nice enough to stop by and ask us about our meal occasionally.  However, the cashier did seem to have a little bit of an attitude. She made a face when another customer ripped open a packet of sugar and ate it alone.  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant is fairly small but super busy. As a result, it may be difficult to find seating inside the restaurant. They do have some nice tables outside with umbrellas, but I'm not a fan of sitting in the heat."}
{"text":"What can I say...  food from The Great Greek is made with love and that's the not so secret ingredient!!!  First off, this place takes care!!!  The food that they serve is definitely a reflection of the quality of produce and products used!  This is an important element that differentiates their food from surrounding competitors, and it's a difference you can really taste.  Moreover, the food here is extremely affordable and definitely worth the price mark, add ons and all!  I'm always open to new food but when trying a new Greek restaurant I always take it back to basics.  Hummus and tzatzki with pita bread are ALWAYS a must for me so I was delighted with the fact that I had found a place who knew what they were doing.  The texture and seasoning was on point and I love the accompanying pita bread!!  It was thin, soft, warm and didn't overpower any of the dipping sauces.  In other words, it was not overly thick and hard.    Do try a little combo of the different appetizers such as the hummus, tzatzki, dolmades, pita bread!!  It's a wonderful selection of the most popular Greek comforts.  Those little dolmades were fresh, flavorful and stuffed just right.  Please... Do yourself a favor and get an order of the Great Greek feta fries. Damn!! This dish really won me over cause i'm a sucker for fries and this little twist was such a nice palate pleaser! Amazing!!  Can't stop thinking about them!  Gyros are tricky ordering for me because others i've tried either had too much of something, or too little.  The Great Greek's gyro was huge and each ingredient it was stuffed with did not outshine another; it was the perfect amount of everything.  Presentation is simple and to the point but also exhibits a hidden wow factor that I like.    The restaurant itself is extremely inviting and exudes a very \"my house is your house\" type of feeling!  Being that it is a family affair, there are no inconsistencies when it comes to service!!!  This is what I love about gems like these... It doesn't have that \"chain restaurant\" feeling... and that brings me back to the not so secret ingredient: love, love, love!!!  You can tell that you matter as soon as you step in cause you're always greeted with a smile and a welcoming hello!  Anyway... Go ahead and give The Great Greek a try for yourself.  You'll see just what I'm talking about once you take your first bite.  I highly recommend! *love*"}
{"text":"Sooooooo impressed with every single aspect of this beautiful restaurant. First of all, the service here is so genuine, really refreshing decor and the food is amazing. Yes, AMAZING!   The owners of the restaurant should take pride in the wonderful people working behind the counter. They are so helpful and really know all the dishes that they serve. They go out of their way every single time when it comes to our order to make sure we're satisfied. I just can't say enough great things about the staff here.   The food is fresh and very flavorful, I don't know where they find such beautiful tomatoes for their salad but these are the real deal! These are not your grocery store variety tomatoes, they really do taste homegrown.  Their hummus and their pita bread are probably some of the best pita and hummus that I have ever had. As a family, we have ordered many dishes here and a lot of crazy to go orders, and they are perfect every single time.  I highly suggest this place for a date, a fun dinner with family, and especially if you're looking to impress coworkers or a boss! My family eats here just about every single week because we love it so much.  Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I love Greek food and am happy this place opened on this side of town.  Their veggies are crisp, meats are juicy, hummus is on point, rice is tasty.  I tried their soup, yogurt and rice pudding as well.... and wow!  So good!!  It's a place where you walk up, order, pay, sit, then wait for them to serve your order.  Definitely a more delicious and healthier alternative to drive-thrus."}
{"text":"I've only tried the gyro here, but based on that I would return to try other menu items. The flavor was great, but the only thing holding me back from 5 stars was the amount of meat in the sandwich. For me, a gyro isn't top of the line unless you need a fork to eat some overflowing meat first  just in order to hold the sandwich. With this one, all the meat fit too nicely in the pita! Also, they put the tzatziki sauce on the sandwich for you, so if you're someone who doesn't like a lot, make sure you ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"So much food for your buck and the quality is top notch!!! Love everything I've tried! Very authentic!"}
{"text":"Nice to have Greek food on this side of town. Build out is very clean n modern. Food was very tasty. I ordered a gyro plate which came with basically an open face gyro sandwich with rice and salad. Portions were ginormous and price was on point. Not expensive for what you get. I could of shared this plate with my husband and it would of been more than enough. Husband had the chicken souvlaki plate, which was 2 large chicken kabobs with rice, salad n pita. I tasted the chicken and it was moist and tasty. We also ordered the hummus. Everything tasted fresh not like some other Greek chains we've eaten at where the food tasted frozen and just heated up.  For 2 meals, 2 drinks and hummus w pita =total was around $35... we went home with tons of leftovers.  Yes will be ordering food from here in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I've never been disappointed, customer service is on the other hand a different story..  While I waited for my food I went next door to get a juice, came back and in a couple of mins my food was ready I went to get it and the girl handing it to me threw it on the counter top!  Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but that is really terrible customer service. Hopefully her day gets better and the customers after me have a better experience."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have had!! I am not an easy customer to please and this place always hits the spot.  Family run. Always greeted warmly.  They do get busy around lunch and dinner so call your order in if you are in a rush.  Limited inside seating would be my only complaint but their amazing service and food bring them right back up to the 5 star level. Food takes a little longer to be made than say a sandwich place and prices are a bit higher than other places, but the value is served; all fresh ingredients made in house.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here and have to say we tried the hummus and Greek salad and the food was very good! The staff was friendly and the manager on duty was very helpful and explained some.items on the menu to us. The pita bread was fresh and was so good with the hummus. We enjoyed it so much went back to have hummus again and tried the little fried dough balls that have a Indian spicy taste to them. I can't remember what they are called. They tasted very authentic.  We are a fan now of this place especially when we are in the mood for a good Greek Salad. It was very good and one was enough to share. I think there is one other location in Vegas for this restaurant and the girl we spoke to thought they maybe opening more soon. Check it out you won't regret it! Especially if your a hummus fan like us!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon when it was pretty busy. We decided to come here due to the good reviews and were not disappointed.  I ordered the Greek salad wrap (4/5) with chicken which was very filling and fresh. My husband had the gyro which was pretty big and stuffed with meat and all the toppings (5/5).  The feta fries with lemon were 5/5 due to the yummy melted cheese all over. The service was also fast and friendly."}
{"text":"It's so good and everybody is SO friendly!!  My husband got the lamb gyro and I got the Greek salad with lamb kabob.  Both were so delicious. We split a lemon soup which was fresh and hot, delicious and light. The food came out quick after that and had plenty of soft warm pita. The Greek cucumber yogurt sauce is the best to dip pita in!!  The half salad is a large portion, so if your a light eater it's perfect as salad doesn't keep well for leftovers. Grab a small baklava or butter cookie for after your meal. Dont wait, they sell out quickly."}
{"text":"I come here regularly, as it is by far the best Greek food spot I've been to in town.   My favorites are the grilled shrimp (either the entree, or added on a salad). The marinade/seasoning they use on the shrimp is flippin delicious. I'm also a fan of the falafel and greek fries.  It's family owned and I've always had great customer service. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute place with a fun light-hearted ambiance and decent lunch rush. Nearly identical to Stephano's, almost creepy how similar they are, but Great Greek has a much smaller menu.  Prices are higher, but probably dictated by their lease.  Food was very mediocre. Americanized Gyro offering with average flavor tzatziki. Fries were grossly undercooked, pita was cold and gyro meat was not freshly sliced; it was not even warm.  Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Mediterranean and Greek food here in town, this place always hits the spot! Menu is simple and food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while I crave a Gyro and when I do, this is my place!  The tortilla is so soft and yummy and the beef-lamb is so tender and flavored just perfect!  The family meal deal is great as are the kids meals which are half a gyro with a side of fries and a drink.  Great place for a gyro!  The Baklava is amazing and a very good portion, best for sharing!"}
{"text":"Great find!! This is a perfect spot for a quick and tasty meal.  Don't let the fact it's in a strip mall keep you from trying this jewel of a restaurant.  The food is great and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love the soup they have here and the rice. I dont really like the Gyros. They are so big , they fall apart, the meat they used was bad."}
{"text":"I should get a frequent customer card for how often I come to this place. That being said, The Great Greek offers a clean, affordable, welcoming and most importantly, DELICIOUS dining experience. Immediately walking into the restaurant, you can sense the meticulous family touch that is all over the place, from the service, to the ambiance.   The food is not a wallet buster, which is an additional plus given the quality of the food. I am a frequent consumer of the chicken rice bowl. Freshly prepared, with fresh ingredients, you really can't go wrong.  I recommend The Great Greek frequently to my peers and friends. They have always treated me well, and I've always left full, and satisfied. Definite must try."}
{"text":"Third time I've been here this week with my family- we try something new each time and are never disappointed! Fresh food=light and fresh flavors. Best Greek food I've ever had! The salads are super fresh, proteins are perfectly seasoned and juicy, and the garlic feta fries are out of the world yummy. The prices are also super reasonable. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Always a great Greek meal. Love the Gyros, not a huge fan of the feta fries, but their plain fries are great. Try the dolmas-very good. Always busy so be patient for a seat."}
{"text":"I have eaten there a few times and it was good average Greek food. If you have been to Greece, you know what I mean. Today I ate there and they surfed me and my kids warmed up and greasy Gyros. It looked like it was cut a few hours back and it was way too long on the grill afterwards. After telling the girl, she said sorry and ran off, never came back.  Don't ask the question if you may not like the answer, daaaah!  We all had a funny stomach all night and I was upset about their behavior. The food was yucky and the service was silly. Running off and not doing anything about it. $66 bucks out the window ...  I am gonna find a better place. Bummer ..."}
{"text":"I have been there too many times to count, and every time the food is just as good as the first time. The reason for only 4 starts is the service. My husband and I have been coming here for years and there is one girl in particular who is very unfriendly. I'm a loyal customer and I always tip, but for whatever reason she is always rude. I really miss walking in and seeing Zack's friendly face. He is there on an occasional weekend, but not nearly as often as he used to be. Besides the service issues we've encountered, this is our go to Greek spot so check it out. Even if you're not in the area the food is well worth a drive!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this out for a few months. - The food was Excellent, tasty and pretty authentic. Half of my family is Greek so I compare and contrast to Aunts and Grandmothers recipes handed down for generations. I will be going back very soon to try the rest of the menu. I had the Greek Pastitsio and Avgolemeno soup and they gave me a greek salad on the side (may have actually been too much food, even for me). i give the Pastitsio an 8 out of 10 just because NOBODY makes it like my grandmother but this is pretty darn good. - the Avgolemeno soup however I will give a 9.5 - i will say this was one of the best tasting lemon soups with chicken i have ever had. I am extremely impressed. I was so into the food i completely forget to make some food porn images. I will take more when I go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, fresh, homemade, very clean place and really good customer service!  We are really pleased to finally have a spot in the neighbourhood that's little different than average American restaurant. Athenian burger was awesome, my kids enjoyed rice bowls, veggie is very nicely cut!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken kabob meal. Everything tasted fresh and good...I got two meals out of one. An excellent value!"}
{"text":"Good food. The only thing I ordered was the great greek gyro. It was huge. I am so glad I decided to forgo a combo or getting a side and I don't think I could have handled anymore than the gyro itself. The flavor was great! I'd return if I was in the Vegas area again."}
{"text":"Better than average veggies.  Hubby loved the rice bowl.  Falafel in my salad was the best I've ever had.  Great crunchy outside, but nice and thin so you get a lot of the moist yummy inside.  Juicy lemons on the side were delicious.  Loved the eggplant dip.  I wish they had whole wheat pita and brown rice."}
{"text":"I stoped by on my way out of Vegas towards LA and wanted to get a healthy salad ... and found this guys on Yelp. Fantastic food .... great service.... lovely staff! Highly recommend this place. The salad was very fresh and the sandwich was delicious. The person behind the cash was very helpfully recommending options to me !"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. Food is fresh and made to order. Meat is tender and very flavorful. This is my go to place!"}
{"text":"We recieved the recommendation for The Great Greek as we were on the opposite side of the city and we were very glad we went.  For a fast casual, the food was excellent and so was the service.   We tried the lamb chop special which was great, gyro plate as well as sandwich, the burger, fries, hummus and baklava.   Everything we had was really good as we share family style and the environment was very comfortable to sit and talk after our meal."}
{"text":"I've been here exactly three times in the past two days, that's how much I'm diggin' The Great Greek.   They have ah-mazing vegetarian options. And while I usually go straight for the falafel at greek places, I find it pretty lacking here. I found it too dry and kinda bland. I also generally go for hummus, but I found it pretty unmemorable. HOWEVER, their salad wrap, greek salad with grilled salmon, and tzaziki sauce are amazing options I definitely recommend. And grabbing an order of feta fries is a MUST. Ridiculously crispy and simultaneously fluffy, these are fries are seriously delicious. The quality is decent, the taste is great, and the price is just right.  Also, while the service is friendly, you may not get your food super fast since this place is poppin'. Expect a lil' wait since it's made to order and enjoy the fresh options The Great Greek has to offer."}
{"text":"Perfect rainy day to visit a sick friend facing major surgery so I stopped at The Great Greek for a fast but tasty take out lunch. Fresh Avgolemono soup ( traditional thick Greek chicken & lemon rice soup), warm pita bread and a bit of white wine. I really like having lunch there but stopping by for take out at noon or dinner works too. Counter customer service is reliable, friendly and respectful. They remember customers and I appreciate that in the food industry. Thinking about using their catering service next."}
{"text":"I admit it, I cheated yesterday. And unfortunately it wasn't worth it! I was on the way to Greek Bistro, my usual gyro place when I drove past Great Greek. I remember seeing many great Yelp reviews so decided to give them a try. It was not busy when I arrived around noon.   The girl at the register was all business. Not unfriendly, but not friendly either. I ordered the Great greek gyro with the infamous feta fries and a drink. It was around $12.50 for the combo. I received my order in a decent amount of time. The pita was good, nice and soft. However the meat was really dry. I thought the feta fries were completely overrated, maybe I had a bad batch? The fries seemed under cooked to me. The meal was okay, but definately nothing I would return for.   I will stay true to Greek Bistro as I think their gyros and seasoned fries are much much better."}
{"text":"This tiny, family-owned & run Greek joint shouldn't be missed if you find yourself anywhere close to Stephanie & Warn Springs. The same family who owns The Fat Greek on the west side also owns this place. The Fat Greek has a larger dining room and includes a bakery counter (the family, as I understand, is actually mostly Armenian and whips up some pretty incredible Armenian baked goods). The Great Greek Grill is a smaller place without the included bakery, but it's clean and light (mirrors along one wall and windows along two other walls help it feel larger & brighter). Service here is always patient and with a smile; you can tell they really care about keeping loyal customers. I can vouch for the fact that their hummus, tzatziki, spanakopita, Greek salad, and chicken souvlaki all have great flavor. I don't like dolmades, so I can't really help you there, though I can tell you these are longer and skinnier than most I've seen/tried. Unlike most Greek joints, this one also offers avgolemono soup, which I enjoyed, but since I don't have too much experience with different incarnations of it yet, I'm not sure how it compares. I love their chicken so much that I haven't tried their actual gyro meat, but nothing I've had there yet has done me wrong.  (Note: Evidently there's a duplicate page out there for this place, listed under its full name, The Great Greek Mediterranean Grill. I'd posted this review under that listing first (there are 5 other people that reviewed under that one), and now I'm posting it here as well.)"}
{"text":"I love the Chicken Souvlaki Plate. Tender moist chicken, rice pilaf, pita bread, and a side salad. It's big enough for two meals. This place consistently has friendly staff and great food."}
{"text":"Love the food! Love the service! Just don't love that sometimes the wait is so long! I usually get the Greek salad wrap with chicken and it is always so good! I would love to come more often but I don't because the wait for food is usually a bit long but if you're not in a rush, this place is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Great gyro plate... Tasty feta fries... Very clean. Little on the expensive side but they give you a ton of food."}
{"text":"We came her last Sunday, and the women working the register was very abrasive. Not very upbeat and friendly. The food was good but the protein should not be placed on the fries, it makes them soggy. Don't know if I'll return."}
{"text":"My favorite new place in the Southwest. I go at least once a week. The gyro meat is delicious and the portions are very generous. The eggplant dip is my favorite appetizer. I can't say enough about how much I love this place."}
{"text":"Great spot for quick healthy options for dinner or lunch. I usually get the salad bowl and it's filled with so many toppings. The Greek fries are amazing as well. I love this spot."}
{"text":"I have a Greek food obsession & they definitely are the best in Las Vegas. From the hummus to the fries to the gyro... amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place! My classmate and I come here for lunch at least once a week. We go so much they know our names and I'm not at all ashamed.   The service is great - always friendly, always prompt. One time Jeck (Jack? I don't know how to spell his name) saw us shivering at the outside tables and came out to get us when a table inside opened up. There has never once been a mistake with our orders.   I always get the beef-lamb gyro combo with a side salad for ~$10. Since I always save the side salad for my dinner, that's a pretty good deal! The gyro is tender and flavorful, the tzatziki is just the right consistency, and the pita is always soft and delicious.   I rarely give 5-star reviews, but this is one my favorite Henderson haunts and they deserve it!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. So glad they opened closer to me!! I got the lamb/beef gyro and it is so full of meat you can barely hold it with two hands. For dessert we had baklava ice cream. I thought I died and went to heaven, such a great combo of flavors."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Vegas hands down. Pretty much a must whenever we're on this side of town. Thank you Nordstrom Rack."}
{"text":"Today was not a 3 star rating by any means but I have to average the two visits.  This visit being a 1, maybe a 2, but the first visit a 5.  The food was very good the first visit.  Couldn't wait to get back there.  Today we ordered our lunch at 11 to be ready at Noon.  It was 12:30 by the time we got up to the register.  Our order wasn't ready.  An hour and a half??  (All we ordered was 2 salads and a skewer)  I ordered a chicken skewer to go with mine.  She said they ran out of chicken.  ???  I was adamant when placing the order NO OLIVES.  The cashier repeated no olives when ringing my order.  Guess what I got.  It was nasty and I did my best to sit and pick them out.  Today's visit was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I love eating at this place the food is amazing but this is now the third time i have ordered to go and haven't gotten everything i ordered...first time no tzatziki sauce second time no hummus that I ordered this time no tzatziki sauce or lemon....this is actually pricey food to not get what you ordered....looks like I need to find a new Greek place to go to once a week"}
{"text":"Really tasty gyro meat, most places make it so greasy but this was fresh and tender, soft pita bread and a great Greek salad , would go back :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today to grab something somewhat healthy. I like how they have a generous portion of salad even if you get a small salad. I ordered a small salad and a steak skewer. The steak skewer is $3.75 on top of the salad which is $5.95.   It's nice because if you eat there they will bring your food to you, but since it was my first time ordering the salad I didn't know they were supposed to give you the dressing on the side. If my friend didn't say anything I wouldn't have known, which is why they got a four start instead of a five star.   The steak was good and they even provide you with naan and tzatziki sauce. Not sure how you spell it. The salad had an abundance of onions and oversized tomatoes which I didn't enjoy.   Overall, the food was good and the service was average. I'd come back again to try their other items on the menu."}
