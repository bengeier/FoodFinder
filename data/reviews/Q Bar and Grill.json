{"text":"Surprisingly good food for a dive bar. The all-you-can-eat fish fry is their specialty and we get it often. I do think it is priced a little high, but if you eat a lot, it's worth it. Their coleslaw is the best. Pastrami sandwich is great and so are their fries. Nothing fancy, just cold beer and good food."}
{"text":"We try to stop in every time we're in town.  I loved the all you could eat Cod on Thursday's, but they had ended that the last time we were there.   I had to settle for the \"large\" Cod dinner and it was almost enough to fill me up.  Looking forward to me next visit."}
{"text":"Deirdre is AMAZING!!!!  Why isn't she here ALL THE TIME??  If she were here more, WE would be here more. She is THE BEST server of ALL TIME!!  I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere, quick service and attention from our Server. A plus plus for her and this place. Just yes....why would you NOT come here?!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. The customer service was horrific and this establishment should be shut down."}
{"text":"I have been going to Q Bar and Grill for years mostly for the all you can ea Catfish which I love.  The fish is up to par, but I also from New Orleans and a little cajun kick on the fish would make it much better.  The inside of Q is dark and lots of stuff animals outlining the walls so i can see how it can be a turn off for some, I again I am not there for the looks and more so for the food.  From my understand Q Bar and Grill has been there for a long time, and it can use a major upgrade and some serious cleans on the ceiling and walls.  Overall is it a great place if you can fish (all you can eat) 7 days a week.  Mon-Wed (catfish) Thur (cod) Fri-Sun (halibut)"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the visit. As others mentioned, once inside you are transported from the doldrums of the strip mall local. Taxidermy-shack vibe with not too many tvs nice. Food slightly above average but be warned, because of the frequent fish frys, you WILL smell like said fry when you finally tear yourself off the comfortable booths and back into the harsh world."}
{"text":"Yay! I think I finally found a cool dive bar close to work to frequent. I stopped in a couple of weeks ago for an early happy hour/quick bite to eat. I was a little nervous about ordering food from the appearance of the outside of the bar. My kind of place to drink, but not necessarily to eat. The inside looks better, but still dark and bar like. I asked to see the menu and was surprised to see the selections, and even more surprised by the pastrami sandwich I had. It was tasty. The best part was the bread, grilled to perfection. I would definitely recommend a cocktail and a bite to eat at the Q. 

I wasn't there long enough to give it a 5, so I'm going back today to try it again. If you drive by that area, stop in and give it a try."}
{"text":"BEST FISH IN TH VALLEY...........HANDS DOWN!!!!!! GO CHECK IT OUT!!!!  Oh, and the other food is good too!!"}
{"text":"We're regulars, but that was hard to tell by the service tonight. Needed a table for 6, and was told we'd have to wait. Thought we'd take a table in the bar so we could have starters and drinks while we waited for a table to clear. But was told we couldn't do that. Wtf? We needed to get in line and wait. Seriously? You're a bar, not the Ritz! Funny thing...had we had been allowed to sit at a table in the bar where we could start ordering food and drinks, we'd have spent a lot more $$$ by the time we sat down at a table to order food. Instead, 6 bar tables sat empty while the \"the rules\" were enforced. Sad. We left and went elsewhere. Hope these rules will work out in the middle of summer when the snowbirds are gone...

UPDATE: After reading the other reviews, I've decided that we're not going back until Leslie is gone or retrained. There are way too many great restaurants in town to have to put up with attitude."}
{"text":"My family and friends used to look forward to grabbing a quick bite at Q Bar and Grill mainly for their fish and chips but during our last two visits we now must think twice about spending our cash their.
Their fish is never the same breed {we feel it is mostly bottom fish} and their portion size's have dwindled to 1/3rd their former size but we must say that their French fries are still very tasty.
In the past we would arrive to lines of people waiting to be seated but now the bar is almost empty and what does that say for business.
We know that this is a bar but at times their noise level is unbearable preventing conversation from being heard even from across one's table.
We hope that the Q Bar and Grill will return to it's roots and we can again look forward to enjoying a good meal at a great price.
Thank you..."}
{"text":"Dining here will provide you with a prime example of bad customer service that will easily ruin a business. A rude manager and waitress refused to continue serving us when one in our party was stuck in traffic trying desperately to get there fast which violates these inflexible new rules.  It goes like this.  Put your name in for a table.  Get seated almost immediately because the place is not very busy (fish good but pricy).  Asked if we read the sign?  Said what sign?  The sign out front stating all parties must present to be seated.  I stated there were many tables open when we arrived and I did not know reading the chalkboard sign outside was a requirement for entry and seating. Was told that the greeter told us this rule (she did not basically calling me a liar).  Said we would order for our missing member (had already ordered all drinks) because she would be here in 3 minutes.  Manager states we have rules that can not be broken and our late arriving party would need to be seated separately from us.  So dumbfounded, we are forced from our table to an empty waiting bench with drinks in hand where we now wait for a table we were already sitting at. 2 minutes later our missing party arrives and we are then \"granted\" seating rights. Trust me when I say it was much worse of an experience than I describe here resulting in an incredibly poor customer service experience overall and MY LAST VISIT HERE."}
{"text":"Great fish I grew up in the Midwest and this is as close to a mom and pop bar and grill as you get love the rustic cabin feel will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food cold beer, total dive bar but very fun!

Great food, they have specials every night, all you can eat check out Thursday's pork chop special & Friday's fish & chips specials"}
{"text":"We have been going here for years but not anymore. Last visit was horrid. The server was completely oblivious to our table and rude. After 20 mins she came to the table to take the order...which would have been nice but no menu or drink order at all. There was tartar sauce or mayo on the table so I asked for something to clean it off with and she got attitude and said \"let me get my white glove out for you\".   I was done after that and we got up and left.  Keep staff that gives a damn about your customers and you might not be losing so many. So I guess rule of thumb is if you go here don't sit in the back sit up on the raised section cause in the back you get a very rude server"}
{"text":"Come here a lot - the club sandwich and fish & chips is really good. The service can be pretty bad though - there is typically a big crowd with only 1-2 waiters - hard to get drunk refills and you have to wait quite a while for your check - but the waitstaff is very friendly. Its not their fault management doesn't schedule enough employees per shift!"}
{"text":"The service was awsome...everybody was extremely friendly.food was very good.  Recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that you would typically miss when driving by in your car, or even if you were stopped at a light right there on Olive, possibly even if you were sitting at a bus stop across the street. It has blank concrete and glass facade. But inside, it's like Cooter's garage, but cleaner, and way bigger.

I was a bit fuzzy when my friends dragged me in here, but I seem to recall high ceilings, neon, and aluminum signs. But I could be wrong. 

I definitely remember that I utterly devoured a platter of hot, fried shrimp served with a nicely spicy, horseradishy cocktail sauce, and that our server was so sweet. 

I've heard that their Friday fish fry can't be missed. Judging from those shrimp alone, I'd say that's probably very true."}
{"text":"Hi as we wait  for food notice the cook hasn't gotten off the phone yet..,Not. Good start...more to follow....Well wings were good.....buffalo chicken wrap was good.....French fries were undercook.....all in all was ok"}
{"text":"This used to be my place for fresh cod but today was freshly frozen.  The waitress Leslie said they just got it today. Right! Out of someone's freezer. The cocktail sauce wasn't the same tartar sauce either. Sad to say thIs my last visit.  Yuk yuk yuk not too many people here,maybe they knew what we didn't."}
{"text":"My usual go to bar. 
Cheap beer, good food, great staff, chill and cozy atmosphere and best of all: frozen mugs. 

What else do you need?"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. You could relocate it to any ski or hunting town. In fact it would be a great post hike or kayak bar. Servers are real cool and the food is better than most corporate menues and at a much better price. You will find a strong local crowd inexpensive drinks and food that is worth more than they charge you for it. Grab a beer some grub and Q up the music box before the game and leave with out your pokets empty, your belly full and a good story to take with you. Good spot for a game of pool and a good getaway from the day. See u there when your in town."}
{"text":"No more all you can eat Catfish!  Big mistake on the new menu and the prices are too high.  This is what was special about the Q.  After over 20 years, I probably won't be back and I certainly won't recommend this place for the Catfish anymore."}
{"text":"Went here over the holidays w/my parents, sister, and parents' friends.  This place is definitely a dive.  Good, relaxed atmosphere.  They had a Hawaiian breeze drink special that night--those were good and reasonably priced.  I had wings for dinner--they were mediocre.  Not too spicy.  I am kinda picky about my wings."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to say that the food is always good.
Unfortunately, the manager Leslie made me decide I will no longer come to Q Bar!! I arrived around 6:10pm on a Friday night. They are super busy due to the delicious fish, so I did expect to wait. Requested a low table due to injuries. After waiting 50 minutes and MANY others that arrived after me not only having been seated, but had completed their meal and were leaving, I inquired to the hostess how much longer my party of 3 (including a small child) would have to wait. Since she said there was still no low table available, I told her at this point we would take anything. 
4 other parties were seated within the next 10 minutes. I asked the hostess again, and she told me I would have another 20 minute wait (?!?!), so I asked to speak with the manager. Leslie came over and, instead of diffusing the situation, proceeded to yell at me. I tried to explain why I was asking when we could expect to be seated, and she was even more rude! 
My friend wanted to stay because their fish really is delicious, but I doubt I not my family & friends will return here!! And I seriously hope someone takes Leslie aside and explains to her how to treat guests."}
{"text":"The servers and atmospheric are fantastic....you feel at home the second you walk in...I havent had service this good since 1998! The only fish you can get FRESH in Phoenix! !!!!!! I will definately return often"}
{"text":"All you can eat fish night. Not really impressed fish was a little gooey. Large party and waitress not very motivated to help."}
{"text":"This is a dive bar that serves up some above average food and some below average food. The atmosphere is dark with many stuffed hunted animals decorating the wall.

 I tried the walleye pike. They coated the fish with a cornmeal kind of fish fry mix. Traditional coating for a sweet mild meaty walleye pike is a cracker crust or a beer batter so the corn meal was unexpected. Most of the fish was good but the ends were a little dry and chewy. Possibly from being microwaved or maybe from being freezer burnt. The kitchen is open so I did see the microwave oven getting a lot of use here. My platter also came with sweet but tasty cole slaw and shoe string fries that were very similar to Burger King kind of fries.

My husband had the French Dip. The beef was roasted in house and was very good but they served it topped with processed Swiss cheese and served it on a budget squishy soft roll.

It would take very little work for the food to be four stars here with some of the above average food they serve like buffalo burgers, walleye pike and the very good house roasted beef but the subpar bread, fries, processed cheese, cornmeal fry mix and heavy use of microwave cooking brings the level down. 

Service was above average and was thoughtful and welcoming.

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my parent's house and though I used to live there a few years ago, I never once was interested in going in. It's in a strip mall so it's not very easy to spot. My fiance likes coming here with his buddies for dinner during his Guys' Nights. He always came home smelling like fried food so I was never curious in the slightest sense to come here. He brought me home some Thai Chile Wings after a night out with the guys and I found those delicious, but I still couldn't get over the smell of fried fish every time he came back from this place. He and some friends dragged us here after a day at the shooting range. I was still skeptical when we walked into the bar, but was pleasantly surprised after trying their food. Their buffalo wings were good. I had the spicy beef sandwhich, which I couldnt finish because it was fairly big. The nacho cheese made it somewhat messy, but delicious nonetheless. My fiance loves the Buffalo Burger here. The beer came out nice and cold and the waitress was very friendly and constantly came back to check on us. She knows the guys by now because they come in so often so they had a little fun banter back and forth. Left here smelling like fried fish, no doubt - even though no one at our table had any fish. THat's really my only complain about this place, but I have to admit I really enjoyed the food. Very casual, good food, friendly wait staff. The Mr. wont have to drag me to come here again! :-P"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends. Good beer and friendly staff! Excited to come back to this bar close to home!"}
{"text":"stopped by the other day to try out your buffalo burger and it was great.   friendly service and good atmosphere. Love all trophies on the wall.  Will stop by on Friday to try the fish. best dive bar around.   Keep up the good work. A new fan."}
{"text":"Okay, based on the food alone I would give the Q 4 stars.  Good fish which isnt greasy and is worth the trip there.

The decor on the other hand is terrible.  I am a vegetarian (that eats fish obviously) and was pretty freaked out with all of the stuffed dead animals hanging all over the restaurant.  Like big bears and all kinds of heads right over your table, it was too much.

Also, after leaving here, everything you are wearing and your hair smell like fish, even the next morning so you have to shower after you leave.  I might have to try take out and give it another review."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It' got a dark, quirky atmosphere that reminded me of a little hick bar up in the mountains.   We had heard about it from a friend, and the reviews were pretty good, so we thought we'd try it for lunch a few Fridays ago.  I guess our first mistake was not getting the fish- that's what they are famous for.  But we had gotten the zucchini/mushroom basket and didn't care for the breading (too greasy) so we figured the fish wouldn't be all that great.  I ordered the rueben sandwich, and all I can say is it was the strangest one I've ever had.  I don't know if it's because the grill might not have been clean or what, but the meat tasted exactly like a shredded hot dog.  I know that sounds weird, but that's the best description I have for it.  But the beer was ice cold, and the waitress was feisty, so that scores a couple of points in my book."}
{"text":"Q Bar and Grill is nowhere close to home for me.  However, most of the people I spend my time with live in the Glendale area and I have been in need of a reliable place to stop in for a drink on the Westside.  What I've found is A LOT of dives (but not in a good way) OR big name resturaunts with bars in them and ridiculously over priced drinks.  Last night I refused to do the whole \"where do you wanna go, I dunno\" back and forth convo so I yelped before leaving the house and it didn't let me down. 

This little gem is so hidden- my cousin who lives 1/2 mi away didn't know it was there.  We walked in and the place was packed!  My cousin and I barely squeezed in at the bar.  It smelled like yummy fried shrimp inside.  This place has a \"margaritaville\" type decor.  It's a little tacky but hey, I'm there have a good time, not buy home furnishings.  The drinks and food were very inexpensive, we got our drink on for 3 hours then split a selection of fried veggies $37 + tip, cheap night out.  

The service was great!  Very quick bartenders, cute but not bitchy which is a rare find in the bars around our lovely city. 
I always like to comment on the restroom when I go to a place because I'm not a big fan of using public restrooms and I know I'm not the only one out there.  I can't say they were that great.  Dirty and dated."}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood bar for FUN, FOOD AND DRINKS! We  the staff! They always make us feel at home....Great food and drink specials! 
Rustic and primitive decor makes for great pictures...

{"text":"Beware the cashiers are padding your bill. 

I have eaten in and ordered to go at least fifteen times in the last two months. Everytime I ordered for pick up I noticed the price would be several dollars more than I figured up in my head. 
Tonight when I ordered and i asked the price of the items I was ordering and I wrote them down. When I was quoted the total, once again it was several dollars higher than it should have  been with Glendale's 9.2 sales tax. 

When I went to pick up the food I asked the cashier to tell me the item totals again. When I brought it to her attention that they were higher than I was quoted she says \"oh we charge a 50 cent delivery fee\". She says with attitude,  \"I have to charge you for the Styrofoam containers and the sauce we give you\". She goes on to say \"everyone does it, you just don't know about it because they hide it in the price\". 
Umm, NO freak, everyone else doesn't do it, you're the one doing it and you're ripping off customers by up charging them extra for every single item they order. 
First off, Q bars prices are high to begin with but i will say some of the food is good. 
Second, that is the dumbest excuse I ever heard because if I dined in, Q bar would have to pay an employee to buss my table and clean my dishes while still serving the very same sauce on the side. It would cost Q bar more if I ate in.
Third, the girl lied to straight to my face when she said we charge a 50 cent up charge. No you thieving pos you charged me 1$ extra on every item I ordered. 
What kind of establishment charges a to go fee let alone a 1$ up charge on every freaking item you order. Probably one where the employees are stealing from the register. I honestly think the cashier is stealing because on the receipt there is no seperate delivery fee. The cashier is adding the dollar charge to the actual items price. Out of the ten times I ordered out not once did anyone ever say they charged a delivery fee. They just hide it by adding it without ever telling you.

Anyway the Q bar just lost a customer that spent 25$ to 50$ a week in their establishment. Everytime I go in Q bar they are damn near empty. With business practices like this, it's no wonder why."}
{"text":"Awesome bar food, could not have asked for any better deal!! I love their chicken and French fries.  I would So would love to eat lunch there everyday! The staff is friendly and clean.  The environment is happy and inviting, made my friends and family feel really welcome. Thanks for listening..."}
{"text":"Came here to enjoy some fish fry. Sat at our table for 20 minutes and hadn't even got greeted. Finally we get up to leave and the servers who repeatedly made eye contact with us told us \"have a good night!\" Ummm we haven't even been served.. I am giving two stars rather than one for the fact that the manager ran after us and told us that if we came back in he would make it right. At that point we were starving and didn't even bother going back in. I would really like to try this place sometime, hopefully they get it together!"}
{"text":"We had great service and the fish fry was really good! However, the beer was warm and my two tequila shots were really watered down. I love my favorite drink and do not mind paying premium price but $8 for a very watered down shot is disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered a Margarita that they had on special, Agave Loco Margarita...which they didn't have anymore Agave. I got 1/2 Jumbo Dog. The hotdog was okay, but the fries was plain and soggy. The waitress did her best. But the quality of the food and drinks were awful. I ordered a normal margarita instead and it tasted beyond awful...I can't even begin to describe it. The cook was messing with the Direct TV for who knows why. My husband had to get up to fix it. They have the Direct TV box directly over the fryer...which is probably why it doesn't work."}
{"text":"Gave the q bar another try last weekend.  Juke box blasting a tune from the 80's...:Whip it good..whip it into shape...\"  very appropriate.  service was slow. the bar was covered with a gooey substance in my area. no worries , though. I can overlook a few minor problems like unpleasant odors and odd-colored stains on the flooring,
     Atmosphere is less than cordial.  Basically a dive bar with an unfriendly atmosphere. All I can say is...'whip it. whip it good...\""}
{"text":"OMG!  This is THE BEST food for a strip mall, non-descript bar and grill in the universe!  Yes, the universe!  The motto on the door as you walk in states: \"Warm beer, Bad food\"....NOT!!!  This place has it all: GREAT FOOD, GREAT, FRIENDLY SERVICE and incredibly reasonable prices.
You just can't go wrong here with anything on the menu, but you must have the all-you-can-eat Fresh Fried Fish!  
My family took me here on my first night here in Phoenix and I can't wait to go back!  I ordered the fried fish dinner with fries, coleslaw and 2 home-made sauces for the fish: a cucumber-dill tartar sauce and cocktail sauce which isn't afraid of horseradish. Other party members ordered the all-you-can-eat pork chop dinner (every Thursday nights special) with mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw and dinner roll .  Sweet Mother of God, this food is good!  
The service is so friendly, I felt like a member of the family there!  Our waitress, Debbie, was so attentive and just so personable, I feel like adding her to my Christmas card list!
Now, I have to tell about the dessert....are you sitting down?  Okay, they make these brownie bites they lightly deep fry and serve with warm caramel sauce.  Yes, I said, deep fry!  These caused me to nearly faint from a foodgasm.
It needs to be said that the deep fried foods are NEVER greasy. The oil is absolutely fresh and nothing is cross-fried...the fish is fried separately from everything else and it seemed the brownies had their own fryer too.
It is definitely a local place with the customers well known and well taken care of and I'm sure a weekly, if not nightly destination.
I can't wait to go for Monday's special all-you-can-eat Chicken Fried Steak dinner!
Oh, my Weight Watchers leader is going to spank me when I get home, but it was worth the extra points/pounds!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave lengthy reviews, even for places slightly unenjoyable, but then I came here...

The margarita my wife ordered tasted mostly of triple sec, the texture became a more slimy feel as if was a premade mix that had been sitting. She sent it back for a Jack n Coke that was okay at best, pretty sure it was a well whiskey.

The chicken wings were served with sauce on the side so the wings were not tossed in the flavor.
The french fries tasted like Ore Ida brand microwavable fries, by the time they were delivered they were a bit soggy.

I know it's pretty common in most hole in the wall bars, but what is with all the taxidermy?! I'm not against hunting or anything like that, but seeing a fox stretched out next to my table with little lighting in the bar, or the tons of other animals on the wall does not really strengthen my appetite. Seems as if the main decorations throughout the bar was taxidermy.

I will give credit for one surprise enjoyment, I asked for jalapenos on the side and they were spicy as I had hoped.

For the quality of food I was shocked when the bill came and saw how much I was robbed. I felt it was my duty to leave this review for those like myself who see the 3 out of 5 stars and on the verge of risking your time."}
{"text":"Leslie was our waitress. very rude and condescending. I have been coming to this place for sometime now and I could see very few customers on this Friday night. Always this place use to be packed, but now you have changed the French Fries from shoestring like to Crinkle-cut, and that was a big turn-off (Crinkle fries were dry) Bring back the other. I believe other customers from whom I have talked to will not be back because of Leslie and the bad changes you have made on Friday night fish fry. Won't be back and I know for sure many more will be doing the same. If you don't listen to your customers...then you will not have any due to a waitress you is rude and food that is not up-to-par.

{"text":"Ive visited Q Bar quite a few times within the past 12 or so years. Im not a regular, but if I was I wouldnt be ashamed. This is a great local bar. It has a real friendly feeling when you walk in the door. The bartenders can be a little rowdy, but its always friendly. I recently discovered the Spicy Sicilian Sausage from a recommendation from a friendly regular customer, its really spicy! I had to revisit recently for the \"house wings\", there just like a perfectly seasoned crispy chicken wing. with light breading. Oh yeah, the fish fry is the best ive had.  Always consistently fresh with the fish fry. They sell alot of fish so you know its fresh. I also have to call out Mandy the bartender, she is very friendly and keeps up a banter with all of her customers. Top notch service from Mandy and all of the other girls always a good time! The restrooms are clean too which I really appreciate!"}
{"text":"Great little Bar & Grill.  a real Dive.  I loved it!  The place was packed but we walked right in and found an empty table.  We ordered the \"All you can eat fish\" and it was on our table before we knew it.  The wait staff was very friendly and prompt.  The drinks were cold, served quickly, and inexpensive.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a \"Mom & Pop\" type place full of locals."}
{"text":"Lived by and drove by this place for many years, didn't know such awesome fish could be served in a hole in the wall place, the Pollack is amazing, my go to place for all you can eat fish on a Friday night... 
Staff is very friendly and prompt...

~~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~~~~~

Very very very disappointed with this place,  the pollack was awful,  the more pieces I got the worse it got, the fries were like pieces of rubber.
Will probably never go back"}
{"text":"We have been going here for fish for years. We continued to go even as the price kept going up.  We went in this past Friday, July 25, 2014.  The fish was awful and at $13.00, no way, not even for free.   Not only was the food bad, it was just dirty.  .I know the tables are coated with something that makes them sticky, but not the menus and salt and pepper shakers...  Just gross.  Wow this place has really gone down hill. Very disappointing.  We will not be going back, nor will other family members, who come to find out had a similar experience a few weeks ago."}
{"text":"I really like the grilled cheese with the green chilies. Great bar food but you WILL smell like fish fry when you leave so not great for a date night unless you are already in that comfortable stage. Oh and the corned beef is stellar too."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very pleasant and easy to have conversations without having to yell across the table.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  The food was very good and a lot for the price.  

We had the \"All You Can Eat Fish Fry\" was very flavorful and filling.  We are going to go back on Thursday to try the pork chops..."}
