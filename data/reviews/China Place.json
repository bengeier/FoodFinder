{"text":"This place is the worst!!! We got take out from here last night and our food was undercooked and very greasy. It also did not smell too good either... won't be going here again... should have listened to my sister who said \"eww\" when I told her we were ordering from this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I get delivery from this facility all the time. We think it is great food and very reasonably priced. They are very quick with delivery and often times will offer free egg rolls which we love. We have never once had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place was horrible,  ordered take out combo platter with sweet sour pork which was extremely greasy even for chinese, only offered fried rice with egg in it, rice was the furthest thing from ftied, seemed more like steamed white with a little added coloring to give it the fake fried appearance, which failed miserably!  Egg roll was just ok. I picked up inside and guy had attitude to boot.  I'm surprised yelp gives this place a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"Ugh. Ate here because some coworkers said, \"You HAVE to try the bobo chicken!\". More like doodoo chicken. What the f$!% did I just eat?!"}
{"text":"We moved to this side of town 5 years ago and tried all of the surrounding Chinese restaurants in the area and did not like ANY of them until we found this place!!! The food is GREAT here and at a good price. We will never eat somewhere else. Im pretty sure even if we had to move far away we would still make the trip back just to eat here.!!! Also the staff is wonderful, it's nice and clean inside and very friendly. Feels like eating at home. All the delivery drivers are fast and friendly too especially Tony..... LOOK if you hate eating then try all the other places....... BUT if you love eating especially Chinese food like me then you should really eat here.!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. My fiancé ordered dinner. They delivered the wrong food and then continued to tell me that my fiancé ordered something different. I was sitting next to her when she ordered moo shoo (don't care about the spelling) chicken. Chicken and broccoli. Shrimp lo mein. All combos by the way with egg rolls. Fried rice pint. We received chicken n broc. Shrimp lo mein. 2 pints of white rice and some weird looking chicken stir fry. I called to tell them the mistake and the lady who answered the phone told me my fiancé ordered chicken gung kung pow or some bs. I was like no. We ordered this. And she told me I was wrong. I continued to say we ordered combos and she told me no, that again my fiancé ordered the wrong thing and ordered Al a carte. When I heard her order combos. I was so mad that they kept blaming my fiancé that I hung up. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since I moved to Peoria 5 years ago. The staff knows who we are and greets us kindly every time we come in and already knows what we want! They are very polite and the food is delicious. They have the best egg rolls and their crab puffs are to die for. They catered my graduation party when I graduated from high school and they gave us extra of everything! Haven't found a Chinese food place that's better than here yet!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese spots to eat food is always excellent"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food restaurant in the area without a doubt. I usually get delivery and the delivery time is usually very fast. Food always tastes amazing and very reasonably priced. Our favorites are the Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour shrimp and egg fried rice."}
{"text":"Most disappointing meal I've eaten in well over a year. I don't hold chinese delivery places to that high of a standard. The only part of my meal somewhat enjoyable (edible) was the egg rolls. I didn't know generals chicken or wonton soup could even be as disgusting as what they brought me. Wonton soup broth must have been pure water. Everything in it was flavorless. Generals chicken was between terrible and bland, mushy chicken. Fried rice was even awful . Not going to bother calling because I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Chinese food doesn't have to be rocket science.  The concept of English must be minimal.  I was charged for food I did not order and made simple requests that we ignored.  No mushrooms may seem a simple request however was beyond their comprehension.  Ordered spring rolls and they were cold.... which as nasty as that sounds tastes worse.  Asked for a receipt and their ability to understand English deteriorated rapidly so they could not process that request.  Will not be returning. Sad thing is that used to be my favorite place."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Chines places I've had.  Their food is fresh and tasty, not bland or overcooked.  The other day I ordered off GrubHub just to TRY another place, and will not make that mistake again, the comparison of the two was COMPLETELY in favor of China Place.  As long as I live in this area, my go-to Chinese restaurant will be China Place.  They have a permanent customer in me."}
{"text":"This place has always had fantastic food, but the recent order was not very good. I ordered delivery for my birthday and the sweet and sour did not come with any sauce, just fried veg and fried pork.  The teriyaki was very chewy and really salty. I could not eat it.  I splurged and also got some ribs,  I am sad to say most of the dishes with meat tasted \"off\". A pungent after taste and I am pretty sure that it was not the seasoning. The slight ammonia aftertaste .  Well,  I am disappointed. Usually I have received fantastic food. I am now wondering if they have a new cook. It was a little upsetting to go to sleep on my birthday hungry and alot of food in the fridge that was not good."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been eating here since I was very little. Food is always delicious and I love the staff. They always recognize me when I come in and when order delivery and greet me with a friendly smile. My favorite is mu shu chicken, spring rolls, war wong tong soup and orange chicken. This is my go to place for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever! I had ordered takeout from this place and when I got to my job (I was on break and bought food for everyone else) I realized that they got the order wrong. I wanted Lo Maine but got white rice instead. This wasn't too big of a deal for me since I also work in the food industry and realize that mistakes happen. I like white rice too so it's nothing to complain about. After none of my coworkers ate the food because it tasted disgusting, I sent someone to ask for a refund. They sent my coworker back without a refund claiming the food is \"as is\" which is completely bull crap. At that point I was pissed off and went back myself. I told them that the order was wrong and tasted bad and just wanted a refund. They proceeded to argue with me about how it wasn't their fault and that I placed the incorrect order. After arguing about that for awhile I told them that the incorrect order isn't the problem, the problem is that it tasted like crap and I demanded my refund. They tried telling me that if I don't like the food I can't ask for a refund which is a very stupid policy. Our policy is that if you bring the food back and only a little bit was eaten then you get your refund if the foods not tasty enough to you. They kept arguing with me and then finally gave up and gave me my refund. Take your money somewhere else! The food taste like crap and they have horrible costumer service"}
{"text":"Very standard Chinese takeout. They have lunch specials that are way better than buying dinner there. We've been there multiple times just because it's close to my house. 

The lunch special comes with your entree choice, a scoop of white rice, a scoop of fried rice, an egg roll and crab angel. I think if you eat in the restaurant it comes with a cup of soup, but I'm not 100% sure. 

I kind of like the hot and sour soup there. It's not overly sour. 

The wonton soup comes with wonton chips. It's average and kind of salty. 

Their food tastes pretty close to Panda Express. They have better take out containers though. I like them because they're reusable. 

I haven't been going here much since one of the workers made me feel awkward when asking if I had a boyfriend. I just wanted food."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how many people like this place.  Ordered food from them and after only a few bites me and my hubby where extremely disappointed and bummed out that we had spent money on this place. Our dogs however where very happy to get a special treat.  Guess it is back to the drawing board on a good Chinese place that delivers."}
{"text":"Today is 1/8/2014... I ordered my food from them via phone at 840 pm. The took my order and said it would be her in 30 mins. They immediately charged my payment card ( I was notified by my fanatical institution via text , $45.10). About 45 minutes later no delivery. I called to ask the status. No one was there the were gone like ghost. I am feeding my elderly mother, wife, daughter (age 3), and my self.  The food never showed up, never received a phone call or any communication.  It is now late my family is starving and china place stole my money. I do not know what to do. No answer at the place I am very upset and could use some help. I would never recommend this place to anyone. They flat out ripped me off and now I have to find something open that's not garbage.  I have never seen anything like this. If I could I would give this place negative rating. I hope they go out of business and they starve like we are tonight. All of the staff and the person who owns this place \"Steven Tee\" should be prosecuted for bank fraud, theft, credit card fraud. Please help shut this place down and force them into financial ruin."}
{"text":"When i order and drive through it is a great place. When i order for delivery it is so AWESOME!!! Tbe man is gracious of any tip you give him and i LOVE this food yummmm especially on the egg rolls"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. I took a gamble with only having 30 minutes from sitting down to paying the check. My gamble paid off. The staff was quick to get my order and 10 minutes later my meal was in front of me.  I ordered the bo  bo chicken and it was great. A light garlic sauce with big chunks of chicken. I would recommend this place for a good quick lunch."}
{"text":"Good food, abundant portions, reasonably priced, delivery, pickup, dine in and very large delivery area."}
{"text":"Went in today with some friends for lunch.  Place was empty.  An older man -maybe the owner. Very unfriendly, very inattentive.   Egg drop soup was luke warm, Beef/Broccoli - i'm sorry - just not good.  Service was VERY sub par, and I'm totally not a service snob.  Won't be here again - too many other chinese food choices."}
{"text":"After a long day at the lake , we decided just to get some takeout for dinner.  What a mistake!   They messed up our order so one of the items was missing then didn't even offer an apology.   
The yu sham chicken was supposed to have a \"hot garlic sauce\".  It was very sweet and not very tasty.  The broccoli beef dish was also sweet.  Maybe they used the same sauce?   The lo mein chicken had undercooked noodles and very bland.   The only thing that was halfway good was the egg rolls.  
We should have known the place was terrible when we saw the whole restaurant was empty so I guess it's partly our fault.  But now we know to NEVER come back here."}
{"text":"I am seeing a lot of mixed reviews. The 5 stars are for dine in and the 1 stars are for delivery. Mine is for delivery. The food I received was tasteless and my Lo mein had no sauce. The broccoli and beef that did have a \"sauce\" was still tasteless. When I called to tell them they made excuses instead of offering to make it right. Pricey too, I was not happy. Lesson learned- never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I'm so mad. 5 11 2018 Last night I ordered qty/ 3 of HOUSE LO MEIN, WHAT I GOT WAS CHOW MEIN, big difference in the noodle size. So I didn't notice the food until after the driver left when I opened the first container. I called the restaurant back and spoke to a woman there and I told her what the mistake was and she tried to play like she didn't understand me with the language barrier I spent $32 yes and did not get the food that I ordered I will never go back again and if I was you I wouldn't either because if they get your order wrong they're not going to fix it"}
{"text":"Only been here pnce but live right down the street so I will prob go here more. I only had lo-mein since i just had some teeth extracted but my boyfriend got some sweet and sour shrimp and it looked sooo yummy. Came with lots of veggies and rice and a yummy big egg roll, bf said it was reallly good, along with eerything else. It was nice to get a big order of lo-mein. i was starving for some real food and it was yummy! spec with a lil soy souce... looking forward to trying more.. very fair prices"}
{"text":"Yes the service is not great but they are really good at making food so if you want good food I recommend China place if u want to get ur dick sucked by the wait staff go to Red Robin."}
{"text":"I've been coming here ever since I was little and even though I moved out of Arizona for 7 years I finally moved back and the first place I wanted to go eat at was China Place. Their food is just as good as I remembered and the staff still remembers me and my family. We usually gets the house lo mein, sweet and sour shrimp (and walnut shrimp but I didn't see it on the menu last time I went :( aww ) and seafood soup with these deep fried wanton chips on the side to snack on. Food comes quick and hot. And if you get to talking to the owners, they are super sweet. They like keeping up to date with their customers"}
{"text":"Except for the egg fried rice the food is mostly really good; particularly the crab angels. The egg fried rice doesn't seem like rice at all it is as if they just mixed scrambled eggs with white rice. Everything on the menu is accompanied by either white or egg fried rice. 

As we wanted chicken fried rice and we didn't want to waste the rice that comes with the meal my husband asked for a substitution. The woman that answered the phone couldn't hear him so he had to keep repeating himself. When she understood what he wanted he had to wait for a manager to approve the substitution and tell him the charge. It seems that substitutions are unusual for this place and the fact that they have trouble hearing you makes them very complicated. We would want to substitute the rice every time we ordered, and it just isn't worth the headache. 

After we got the food I called because we didn't get any egg rolls. It turns out that they didn't come with our order but trying to learn this was very frustrating. I had to confirm my order 3 times before I learned that they don't come with large meals (only combos). As they didn't give us a copy of the receipt I have no way of confirming exactly what we ordered (I am pretty sure that we got a combo but will give them the benefit of the doubt). 

We order Chinese food when I am not up for cooking for the family. The terrible egg fried rice and the inability of the people to hear you have ruled this place out for us. 

ps: I know that it wasn't a phone reception problem because my husband asked about it. It is the noise at the restaurant that is the problem."}
{"text":"We order from here on a regular basis- pick up and delivery.   The food is really good and very reasonably priced.  They often throw in free food, which I've never seen at any other Chinese place.  Would highly recommend for take-out."}
{"text":"I got their menu on our apartment door so many times, and finally decided to give it a try today.
let's start with I've worked in Chinese restaurants before that does delivery, their delivery speed is reasonable, and the lady who answer the phone is nice. And these are the only two positive things about the whole experience.
I ordered a dinner size beef lo mein, a hot and sour soup and an egg roll.

Hot and sour soup - very sour. none hot. but they do give you shrimp and pork and some mushroom in it.
Beef Lo Mein - let's call it.....steamed veges with plain boiled beef and noodles.
Egg roll - I don't know, I throw it away after one bite.

ok, yikes. my husband had actually tried this place before without me, and he told me it wasn't good, and I think I should listen to him from now on."}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice is on point, drive through and delivery are both solid options.  Ive been here 4 times and the food was awesome every time."}
{"text":"I ordered Dinner A with Broccoli and Beef and Dinner B with Orange Chicken for the hubby and I. I ordered it through Door Dash because they had free delivery and I didn't know China Place delivered. We waited about 30 minutes and had a pleasant experience with the Door Dash driver. But when we started taking our food out of the bag we realized we didn't have the full order. We were only given broccoli and beef, orange chicken, and white rice (which we didn't order). The Dinner A and B were supposed to come with an egg roll, wonton, fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and sweet and sour chicken so we were missing quite a bit. I called China Place and after some confusion from the workers I was told someone would be on there way with a new order. About 20 minutes later, a delivery man knocked on our door with our entire (correct) order free of charge. He apologized and quickly left. Odd experience, but pretty good food!"}
{"text":"I had prematurely given China Place five stars, as they WERE pretty good until tonight, when the man who answered the phone to take the delivery order had the nerve to tell me it was almost TWO BUCKS for an extra soy sauce for the steamed dumplings - all of about two tablespoons worth.  He said \"the chef has to MAKE it!\", I say BS, they never charged me before for a tiny cup of soy concoction. 

So, a $67 buck order went out the window for China Place tonight.  NO way someone should be subjected to such highway robbery.  $2, to lose a fairly substantial order, that's their problem.

TWO stars.  The food's okay, while there's plenty of 4-5 star competition around who wouldn't dare gouge like that."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The waiter is very attentive extremely cheap lots of food for the lunch special. The best kung-pao chicken and lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Really great food. We order from them 2 or 3 times a week. The delivery service is prompt and friendly . We used to go to another place for any Years but after we found this place  this is our favorite spot."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Hey are super speedy with orders (delivery and take out) and the food tastes amazing! We try to get something different every time we order and so far we haven't had a thing that we didn't like!! My favorite is the Mongolian chicken and the crab puffs!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty basic mom and pop restaurant.  I've been going there for almost 20 years now, since when I used to work at Jiffy Lube next door.   Inside it is pretty small, but they are clean.  The fact you can call ahead for a carry out and they have a drive through for pick up is awesome.  Their dinners are OKAY, and their food is good, just not outstanding.   However,   I LOVE their chicken fried rice, egg rolls, and wontons.  In fact, that is all I really get there."}
{"text":"My kids went to dine in before 4 p.m a couple of days ago and since they are kids they took advantage of them instead of charging them and giving  them what they ordered which was 2 lunch specials and a small soup which would had been a total of under $17.00 they charged them dinner size and their total was $27.00 and my kids added $1.00 tip and now in my account it cleared for an additional $3.00 tip. We've been going here for over 20 years but that's it no more their food has always been fresh but after this stunt I have a sour taste and will not go back because after I noticed I went there and talk to the old lady in the front which was cold and rude she didn't care when I mentioned that I've been coming here for 20 years and she of course knew what was done and said there's nothing we could do because my kids had already ate the food and they should had notice the error and got it corrected.  So I will make sure this \"error\" doesn't happen again. You can imagine how many people I've referred during these 20 years no more. Now I have to tell you if you do decide to come and eat here just make sure that you are charged correctly specially if you come in before 4pm that's when they offer lunch prices. And Also initial your tip or better yet  leave cash and write tip on table so they don't alter your bill.  My kids got sick after they ate here only made matters worse."}
{"text":"Love this place been coming here for years never had issues the food is great good portions and the staff had always been friendly had their delivery before too and that was also good service again no issues. I love their egg drop soup haven't tasted better than here. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese delivery I've had.
Wonderful crab angels and egg drop soup. The shrimp was fresh and vegetables cooked the best way! I feel people always find a need to complain about things , so take old reviews with a grain of salt and definitely give this place a try. 
I did , on a very busy work schedule and too tired to cook lately and I'm very pleased with everything . free puffs and free soup really helps during the winter too. I like it more than panda express and that says A LOT considering I used to eat at panda at least 4x a week"}
{"text":"Orange chicken? Yes please! IT's so good here, and it's so much better when you eat it in there dinning room because it's SO good super hot. The only thing bad I'll say is there new delivery. I ordered lunch for my family on day and I called at 1pm. I called back 3 times after over 90 minutes waiting for my food. Like the idiot that I am, I still payed for it and tipped the guy..and only because there stupid orange chicken is so good...but I was really pissed that it took so long. So don't order in from here, make sure you eat it there!"}
{"text":"I had order two items to go. When I ordered the Bo Bo Chicken I had asked if the sauce was thick. The gentleman the immediately replied with, \"yes it is a thick sauce\".  When I got home I realized they forgot the sauce for one of my dishes. I called back and the gentleman advised if I could come back and pick it up. Gave me some free crab puffs for the inconvenience. After picking it up and coming back home, the sauce is like soup. Not thick like how the man told me. I called them and the man advised me that it was a miscommunication. Not sure how it was a miscommunication if the man TOLD me it was thick. So it tells you a lot about the service. They just say Yes to your questions. They don't listen. All I wanted from the person to know that the sauce is not thick but soupy. He then advised me they have been in business for so many years and sauce has always been light. I told him doesn't matter how long he has been in business as I don't eat there often to know what sauce is thick or thin and that is why I asked in the first place. The man continued to advised me it was a miscommunication. After 3 more minutes of me breaking down how it was not a miscommunication but that the wrong made up answer was given without listening to the customer. He finally accepted fault as he felt against the corner. Food is okay but service is horrendous. It's sad to see a business not take ownership of their mistake and attempt to blame me and I quote, \"you don't understand the menu\". How can any business owner not take ownership of a simple mistake and then attempt to blame me. 

Sigh... Vent over"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best chinese food restaurant you can buy. The food is a bit pricey but it is delicious and to die for."}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant but something has happend over the last few years that has made this place less desirable. 

I had the sweet and sour chicken. The breading and texture is crispy and tasty but the chicken looks mostly like dark meat and unidentifiable meat.

The fried rice is good.

I have also had the orange chicken which is pretty good and the sesame chicken which is probably my favorite. Both come in very small breaded bits that make for excellent leftovers. 

I gave China Place a three because no matter how much you order it never takes them more than 10 minutes to have it ready for pick up and most things make good left overs. If you were dining in without the aforementioned upside I would give it a two."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood across the street from this place, and so I've driven past it for a good year and a half. I had ordered from them a few months prior, but that was just wonton soup so I decided to go back and try the food. I got one of the lunch specials - sweet and sour chicken - and for $6 it was a TON of food. I don't know what they put in the brown-colored rice but it was AMAZING. I had enough left over for another meal (I could have eaten all of it then but I had to force myself to stop so I didn't hate myself later haha) With the lunch special you get the main dish, and then two huge sides of rice and those little cream cheese wonton things. I placed my order over the phone and they gave me a reasonable time frame. I like that they have a drive through for order pickups, because I can just see this tiny parking lot being a nightmare during busy times. 

If you go in here expecting super high class gourmet Asian cuisine, well you're going to be SUPER disappointed. For what it is, the food is great and pretty decently priced."}
{"text":"China place Was okay I liked the BBQ pork fried rice and did not like the sweet/sour chicken or orange chicken.  Egg rolls was OK as well.  Don't know if I will return the chicken was tough and overcooked."}
{"text":"I will never order from your company again I will never eat at this restaurant again this restaurant came out and they charged me $37 that's what I paid for at the door give the man cash for a tip the next hour so I found another church for $4.50 taken from my card and then after that the $37 charge was changed to $40 I have tried to email your company I've tried to call your company I have called the restaurant I've spoken to the manager and absolutely nothing has been done about this $8.50 might not be a whole lot to somebody like you or your company but it is to me and I will make sure that I tell all of my friends all of my family anybody that will listen not to use your company or this restaurant again"}
{"text":"I had \"the general's chicken\" from here the other day... Sorry... but this was horrible.  I'd rather have some Panda Express.  It was chewy and stale.  Not flavorful at all.  Bland and chewy is maybe a better description.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I called at 3:30 before I left home and verified that they served lunch till 4:00.  I came in and sat down at 3:50 and was handed a dinner menu.  After that I wouldn't have eaten here at all if I wasn't meeting someone for our late lunch.

The food wasn't anything to brag or complain about.  With the great selection of chinese food within two miles to the West, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my kid. We only get the fried rice, so I can't say much on the variety of the food or the quality of anything other than the rice, but most of the time it's spot-on, exactly as advertised, good ol' fried rice. Once it's been slightly undercooked, so it was just a tad crunchy in the middle of the rice grains, but that only happened one time, so maybe it was an off day.

A tip: If you order chicken fried rice, you'll get a LOT of chicken, so if that's what you're looking for, basically a 1 to 1 ratio of chicken to rice, this is the place to go.

The service is...spotty. There's one guy on the wait staff who's very polite and attentive, one who won't come over unless you wave, and then there's a woman who looks profoundly unhappy to be there at all. She's looked and behaved that way every time we've come in, and it's kind of off-putting, but she's never been outright rude, so at least there's that.

I'm giving 4 stars because, despite the occasional lack in social graces, this place is clean, fast, reasonably priced, close by, and the food is tasty (or, at least, the one thing I've eaten here is tasty)."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! The food was amazing but because of the 10 minute wait for drinks then no plates no rice and then the BILL I will never be going back!! I had to ask multiple times for the rice and plates!! After  we were done I had to wait another 10 minutes just for to go containers! Stay away!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! We came here for lunch, a recommendation from a friend. The portions are huge, especially for the price. The food tastes DELICIOUS & fresh. The service was extremely prompt. After we ordered drinks, they brought out soup. Before we finished the soup, they brought out  our food. We ordered the orange chicken and Mongolian beef (pictures provided). You should try this place out.... you will NOT be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but I decided I would order for delivery since my husband had been craving it for a while.  I'm not sure of i didn't order correctly but the meal delivered seemed nothing close to what i ordered.  Not sure if its because every chinese food place is different or maybe I'm just not familiar with the food itself.  Also, it was a bit pricey $$$. 
On the other hand, the delivery was fast. Which I am glad for."}
