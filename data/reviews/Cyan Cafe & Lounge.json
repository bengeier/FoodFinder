{"text":"I've never had better Mixed Grill in my life. The waitresses couldn't be more attractive too."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've ever been to. The owner is a complete crook and charged my group $140 extra on top of the bill. They said that we got food we didn't even order and when we fought them about it, the owner laughed at my face. I am a business professional and run my own business personally, and I WOULD NEVER laugh at a customers face and overcharge them. Also, my drink \"Russian red\" had old lumpy cream in it and the chicken fingers are cooked in fish oil..how's that for great food. DISGUSTING PLACE AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE. OH, and good luck paying for your bill..you have to wait in a lineup and it takes about 40 min to just pay for your bill."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere. They have a great selection of middle eastern food, I would recommend the chicken schnitzel. Greatly portioned for what it is worth, the seating can be a little awkward, but other than that, a great place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The place has been both excellent and awful during my three visits 

Service: not very good and very slow 

Price: decent 

Food: one time it was very good, the second time the portion got smaller with very little salad 

Presentation is not good at all. Though the lounge is beautiful and they could have done so much more with it, they don't care about presentation food and drinks.

Shisha: very good the first time and very bad the last time 

Worse of all is THE MUSIC!!! It's this loud rave music and is nothing but annoying!!! 

Overall, I must say it's been very inconsistent and the music and what they are showing on TV is not really relevant to a shisha bar..

I'd have to give it 2/5 :( although I usually give good ratings... They definitely have some stuff to work on.."}
{"text":"With so many great reviews I decided to give Cyan a try. How disappointing. It was not busy, I pushed the call button on the table and was greeted fairly quickly. And then my visit went downhill. Ordered the chicken schnitzel and asked for a glass of water. 10 minutes, no water. Another waitress approached and asked if I'd like to order a drink. Asked for water again. My food took nearly a half hour to arrive. The chicken schnitzel came with salad and fries. Salad is not what I'd call some cut iceberg lettuce on a plate. As for the chicken schnitzel, I've had a lot better at other Mediterranean restaurants. Don't see the value or appeal. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner after a recommendation by family members.  We arrived and were greeted at the door with a warm welcome. We later observed that a bell goes off in the back when someone enters and every customer gets personally greeted. 

The wait staff guys were so humble, polite and respectful. We were not bothered at all, having been given an innovative contraption with three buttons that is connected to the wait staff's watches. The buttons say \"call\" \"bill\" and \"water.\" All you need. The service was prompt and the Middle Eastern cuisine beautifully presented. 

The Kibbeh appetizer is a dough mixture of finely ground lean beef and burghul, shaped in oval balls, stuffed with ground lean beef and minced onion, fried until golden brown. It was a delight to our palates.

The Muhammara dip consists of Roasted red peppers, ground walnuts, breadcrumbs, olive oil, pomegranate molasses and spices. This generous, tasty serving came with several pieces of a thin pita-like bread and several thick pieces of delicious garlic bread.

I had the mixed platter and my husband had the dry spice shrimp skewers. Both came with dips and sides of Greek salad and blue coloured rice. I would recommend both dishes.
 
We absolutely loved the background music! It was a dance beat played at just the right volume. The atmosphere was so relaxing. We sat in comfy leather chairs with a coffee-table type table. 

The place is beautifully decorated with a blue waterfall at the front and the bar at the back was illuminated in blue. They offer hookah pipes, which are still allowed in York Region but no longer  in Toronto.

The steak skewers could have been more tender but, other than that, this was not just another dinner out. It was an adventure. We brought home enough leftovers for another dinner the next night and, including a couple of beers, the price was surprisingly reasonable. We actually checked the bill again to make sure they hadn't left anything off. It was a wonderful new  experience. We'll  definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is HORRIBLE!!! The girl with the long black hair who works here is an absolute nightmare. Beyond rude, attitude problem and a total mess. Asked for a fork waited over 20 minutes for it my food was frozen by the time. I got up and grabbed a fork myself....."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place to anyone. I ordered a White Russian and the cream in it was old and clumpy, yet I was forced to pay for it. My table ordered chicken fingers that tasted like fish! I'm assuming they used the same oil to cook fish and chicken in. We couldn't eat it, and we still had to pay for it. When we went to pay (which took 45 minutes by the way) we noticed they added items to our bill we never ordered. After going back and forth we were forced to overpay 140$!! Ridiculous! I have never written a review before but I think this'll help the next person thinking of choosing this place to go too. My birthday wasn't what I expected it to be."}
{"text":"Cake here after a weekend shift... Had the grape Mint sheeaha and the chicken kebab platter... Everything was brought out within a few minutes of ordering and it was delicious... The sheeaha came with a brand new plastic hose and 4 coals...which was nice Cuz every other sheeaha place doesn't give u a brand new hose.... The food was really good as well... Would come back here"}
{"text":"Bad service.  Rude servers.  Bad shisha. 
The owners are thieves.  Our group was charged about $140 extra of alcohol that no one ordered.  I Highly don't recommend this place.  This was my first and last time in this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the worst fuckin place in the world. If I could give them no stars I would. The service is GARBAGE. A good friend of mine lifted the hookah an inch off the ground to put it to his other side and one of their stupid waitresses told him it would break if he carried it that way, he said it was barely off the ground, she didn't hear him and told him \"I know you don't speak English but the shishas gonna break\" .... I've never heard such ignorance. Whoever taught your servers customer service is a fuckboy with no common sense or manners whatsoever. PLUS, when we left they told us a bunch of shit was unpaid for. If they didn't have a clown working the cash system maybe it wouldn't be so fucked up. On top of all that, I ordered a mint shisha and got a gum mint. I've been smoking shisha for 8 years I know my flavors and their so called \"manager\" is trying to convince me that it was mint. He tasted it, without us saying anything and said it was gum mint, after I said I ordered a mint hes like \"oh no this is mint\". Fuck this stupid shitty place, I will never fucking go back."}
{"text":"The staff at this establishment is absolutely terrible when it comes to handling its customers. I have been to this place at least 4-5 times giving them a few times to redeem themselves but my visit a couple days ago will definitely be my last. One of my friends did not have a proper ID as he was still getting settled into the country, but was definitely at the legal drinking age. For the first time in my life I saw someone get ID'ed for smoking shisha and when he told the employee he did not have it at the moment, the employee had the audacity to give him the option to \"sit somewhere else and read a book or something.\" How can someone even suggest that? If you wish to be mistreated I definitely recommend this horrible lounge. Their shisha is not spectacular enough to overlook their atrocious customer service. Stay away."}
{"text":"It was such a pleasant experience very friendly staff and quality food and Shisha so far the best ive visited in RIchmond Hill"}
{"text":"We heard a about the place, came to just see the environment but ended up sitting there for hours! Loved the food! Liked the management, however you need to remind the orders! Anyway it was nice to find a place that you can have both drink and shisha!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th visit to Cyan, they have a magnificent chef behind the seen food have a very special favour mix of Mediterranean middle eastern cuisine.

excellent, beverage, and atmosphere"}
{"text":"As the ?usual customer of this shisha bar, server put me on a ?simple chair with table, I asked for sofa place and it was not have so much crowd, so, as complimentary of usual customer, but got rejected."}
{"text":"MIXED GRILL is my favorite entree at @Cyancafe It is an assortment of skewers including beef tenderloin, chicken tikka and beef kebab, served with salad and a choice of rice or fries. Me & my friends upgraded the salad to the Cyan Mediterranean. The Beef Tikka is extremely juicy & flavored. This is a great dish to share. It is enough for 3 ppl if you order appetizers with it. 
More details about each dish in my facebook post hamsafoodie Instagram hamsafoodie"}
{"text":"Place: Cool theme with a great environment. Service isn't always the greatest. Music is alright too. 

Shisha: Unless you're getting an orange bowl with an ice hose, you're probably not going to enjoy it for too long. The regular heads aren't good and the flavours are limited (or not as exotic as other places)"}
{"text":"Came here after hearing a lot about it from my friends. Out of all the hookah joints I've been to in the GTA this place was by far the cleanest. The place was decorated extremely nicely and had a great vibe, there were lots of couches for sitting along with tables and lots of TVs as well. 

I ordered a kebab platter and the cyan special Shisha. The shisha was great even came with disposable pipes which I haven't seen before. The food was even better the kebabs were all juicy and tender cooked to perfection. The service was amazing too. Overall this place is one of the best hookah places in GTA and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"So I learned from my last visit and this time I decided to call to book a booth. Well this time it was a great experience!! Booths are really clean and comfy. Lots of wide screen TVs. We ordered shisha, Kubba, fries, and nachos. Some of us washed that down with tea while others decided to wash it down with beer or other alcoholic drinks.

Shisha was clean and a generous waiter kept providing us with charcoals whenever needed. Fries and nachos were pleasantly served on nice plates and it surely tasted great. I tried their chicken tikka before and they were amazing, but today we weren't really hungry. I surely recommend it if you are though. Compliments to the awesome chef :-)

Also compliments to the DJ for playing those great songs. We were hyped up. But too bad there was no dance floor. Have a dance floor or play lounge music (I prefer the former though).

We decided to end the night with salt, lime, and shots! Overall it was a great night."}
{"text":"not gonna lie, it was a fun time and I definitely will come back. had the beef kebab and the watermelon mint hookah with an iced hose! food was super delicious!

the only problem with this place was its service! I feel like the servers could be a bit more polite! my checkout experience was definitely not fun since the waitress refused to split our bills properly!"}
{"text":"Been there couple of times, almost a regular. Shisha keeps improving everytime i go there. Food is okay and prices are litte bit high. Over all its one of the rare shisha places in toronto that are actually decent and high end."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but considering the TERRIBLE treatment I got from this server, I have to say my piece. We had the female server and the whole night, she was giving us attitude. She also mixed up every order we put through and forgot to bring out a meal, which then came out an hour late! On top of this, she gilt trips the person who got the wrong meal late into not escalating his complaint. We were also told by this server that she couldn't split our bill (which btw other servers did for thier tables) and made us calculate our own portions. After paying the whole $350 bill, she runs out after us outside to say we need to pay $40 that's missing from our bill. She then threatens to call the cops, calls us frauds and tells us were dining and dashing (WTFFF...). After we go inside to tell the manager that we paid everything, she's yelling at us, saying  that were wrong and proceeds to call us \"annoying\" and \"bitches\" for talking back to her while she's STILL yelling at us. We came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and got treated like criminals and accused of dining and dashing before being able to talk out the situation. This is the kind of customer service you see on worldstar hip hop videos of people going at eachother and it's  disgusting that the server was the one who made this into this big of an issue. Im never stepping a foot in here and i advise you not to if you value being treated with respect."}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all costs. My friends and I have been going to smoke shisha at least once, sometimes twice a week every week for more than 8 years. We like to try different places and try different flavours and have to many shisha places.

I have never in my entire life witnessed worse customer service from any place ever.  Cyans employees and management are the rudest, most ignorant, condescending, and have absolutely no idea how to build customer loyalty. I would think they like to have no customers and would love nothing more to hire 8 people to sit inside by themselves alone with each other only for the entire night. 

The actually venue is quite nice, and this is not a one time bad experience it's the 6th time it's been bad. I had to express my discomfort in this \"business\"(trust me the quotations are generous). If this place will survive the employees and management need to learn what hospitality means. This place will go bankrupt in a few years, unless they fire the manager and hire someone who gives even the tiniest of care for human life."}
{"text":"A bunch of rude impolite people working here!!! I will never ever come here again they're disrespectful to a point that they turned their back on us while we were speaking to them TWICE!!!
The guy at the door has a nasty attitude so they prepare you for their nastiness.
If yelp had 0 star I'd give it to this place..!
DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.. you've been warned"}
{"text":"Cyan is a modern middle eastern sports bar. It's a bit far north but I would recommend it for large groups. 

There's sofa seating all around the edge, the back has large booths available for groups which fill up fast and I believe you need a reservation. 

One thing I really liked was every table has a button that can call, ask for water or ask for the bill from the servers. 

The food is okay in terms of quality, in my opinion it is not the best tasting middle eastern food but that's comparing it to my mom's cooking. We ordered a sample mezza plate which has 2 kibbeh's, spring rolls, and samosa's (not exactly authentic). We also had the blue rice, Sweet potato fries (very good) and the chicken fingers. We also ordered Kanefe (traditional Lebanese dessert) It was okay, very very sweet and nothing like back home. 

They also offer Shisha, I go for the traditional double apple or mint. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Garbage, service is awful! I was with a group of people and when we asked for the manager he gave us attitude and did not even apologize, save your money and go anywhere else"}
{"text":"3.5 because they actually card. 

They're clean, they're nice, ambience is trendy and modern. However, if you want a comfy lounge seat you'll need to book ahead on weekends. 

Food is good for a shisha bar. Service is good and wait staff are humble and attentive. They regularly bring us water and shisha is strong. 

They offer nicotine free, which is awesome. Solid place."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that this place is nice,  the service is absolutely bad.  
Went there with more than 25 people.  We got seated.  
This waitress was always on a rush.  
As the night goes I asked for a mint shisha.  When I got it it tasted like a gum mint.  So I thought that the shisha was used for gum mint and the head was mint,  but turned out to be fully gum mint as the shisha started.  I call the \"shisha manager\".  I asked to taste it,  he said it's gum mint,  then I told him I asked for straight alfakher green mint,  he tells me it's straight mint.  First he changes his words,  secondly he lies about it.  I have been working in shisha restaurants for the past 5 years and I make shishas my self,  and this guy trying to make me believe it's mint when it's gum mint.  We told him we don't want it,  he said we have to pay for it and we didn't wanna argue cuz we came to have a good time.  
As the night went on,  the waitress insults my friend when he lifted  shisha an inch of the ground,  and he was just trying to explain that nothing would happen and she told him he doesn't speak English.  What kinda of service is that?  
The servers kept on bringing items to the table that we did not order. 
When I booked the booths,  they said it will fit 24 and if needed more,  we can add chairs.  We had to squeeze uncomfortably so everyone can sit.  Because they won't add chairs.  
Some of us came from Waterloo which is around hour and half drive or more and the rest came from Mississauga.  
There are other places that we can go to,  but we chose cyan and I was really disappointed. 
When we were about to leave,  they tell us that there are some items that is not payed for.  
I called all my friends and everyone told me they payed for everything they got.  When I tried to tell the manager / Cashier he didn't understand.  I asked single person and everyone payed for everything,  so they made us pay for things that already got payed for or things we didn't get.  I am really disappointed and I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times this year and seems like the service has slipped a little. Feel like they are always one-person short and the staff there are running around to get your order taken care of. Either way, they have good food. Esp the kabab grill platter, burger, hummus and their orange head sheesha is good. Overall, still a decent place"}
{"text":"The shisha is fantastic! Try their ice hose, it betters the experience ten folds. The decor is equally as snazzy. Unfortunately, the food is subpar at best, if that. Stay away. Their service is at times slow hence only three stars. Bigger groups get tended to quicker than smaller groups and the few times I've been here, it's been a recurring theme. Expect a wait if you show up unannounced! While me and a friend stood in line waiting, a group of ladies showed up half an hour late for their reservations, and they lost their table. They only hold reservations for fifteen minutes, not a second more. Understandable as it's a very busy place. What's not understandable is the $25 per person fee you have to pay to make reservations on the weekends - including Friday nights - meaning, if you're a group of 5, be ready to pay $125 simply on the reservation. P.S., that is NOT including taxes and \"gratuities\" they expect you pay on top of the $25 per person. The staff becomes very snide and passive aggressive if you don't tip, as well. TLDR? Great shisha. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I can understand why this place gets crappy reviews. We drove an hour and half because we wanted to try a different hookah place. We got there & waited in a small line up only to be told the place was booked. The tables were empty tho ... more than half the lounge was empty. Not like we went in with a group. It was 2 of us. We asked how long and he clearly didn't want us to wait. 30 mins? \"No longer. I don't know\" 
Not to sound disrespectful but if you're not Arab you're pretty much not going to have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disgusting places I have ever been to ! Poor service ! Illiterate employees who can not even read let alone treat their customers right ! I will never ever come back here ! They are disgusting"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  
I visited cyan a couple of times and each time I loved it! 
I think they did an awesome job in designing the place, giving it a very unique, modern look!
I really like the different types of seating available, you can choose between dining at the tables or just lounging on the couches and enjoy their amazing shisha.
They have obsoletely the best tasting Mediterranean cuisine I've ever had (I've been to many places) 
I think this is a great place for Richmond hill. Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Went there after works a few coworkers on a Tuesday night.  One of the coworkes highly recommended it so we drove all the way from downtown.  

Food:
The food was amazing and really well priced.  for 20$ two people can eat well.  
We got hooka as well - mint flavored lemon was the best.  With a drink and everything, it cost 45$ per person.  Including tax and tip.  

Ambience:
The ambience was very relaxing.  The room looks like a lounge and has comfortable seats.  There were a couple of bar tables.  but most of the room is covered in couches with tables.  

Service:
Staff was friendly and helped set up the hookas.


I would suggest going there if you want to relax, have some good food and talk with friends.  There is light music in the background."}
{"text":"Buyer beware.

They tack on a gratuity charge, which is very hidden on the bill, and then happily accept the extra gratuity through the payment terminal option.

I wouldn't be as surprised by behaviour like this, but when in a party of two, autograt is really not appropriate, and not mentioning it is bordering theft. 

Really is appalling business practice."}
{"text":"Nice hookah lounge with comfortable seating. The middle eastern menu is fitting but is nothing special . Recommend to go for drinks and hookah with friends but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food and an extraordinary atmosphere. I really enjoyed dining at this place and loved the service."}
{"text":"Clean hookah bar with cyan-themed decor that really gives the atmosphere a much-needed chill vibe. The DJ on the weekends is great and does a good mix of English and Arabic music - so there's something for everyone! But, reservations aren't easy to make on weekends and the staff could come off as unfriendly."}
{"text":"The shisha is pretty good, the food and drinks are solid. The service was great. We went out for a smoke and they took all the drinks by mistake, when we came back they immediately without asking replaced everything with new drinks well done."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cyan cafe and lounge. If you like Arabic music, then you'll enjoy the DJ's playlist. He also plays Persian music here and there. I strongly recommend reserving a booth if you're inviting a big group, as  the place gets packed quickly at night. The music was overly loud and we were not able to hear each other at all! Even though there are buttons to push for calling the waitress, the service in general sucked. When we got there we had to tell our waitress to clean the table, as it was left dirty from the previous customers. 

The shisha was almost flavourless. My drink (the Cyan Martini had almost zero alcohol in it) and the people who got burgers told me that their food used to be much better before. 

I liked the vibe and decor, but was not impressed with anything else. Not likely to return here."}
{"text":"Initially I had a great experience with this place,, good atmosphere but unfortunately it became clear that the first priority for the owners is $$$ without concern for customer service and satisfaction. You can bring them a lot of people and they will treat you great on one night and like crap on another because there is only 2 of you. And even when you let the waitress know that you are not happy the manager/owner won't bother to come talk to you because they simply don't care as they think they are busy enough so don't need to keep everyone happy. I personally will not go back and I know my friends won't either. I will take my money where my business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are horrible..
Amazing and very fast waiters! 
The chicken tikka is amazing! 
Great shisha - especially with the ice hose!
A little pricey but that's what you get when your in a lounge bar atmosphere. 

There's a DJ after 1030 pm which is fun! He played all different types of music from Arabic to HipHop! 

I would suggest you reserve a table or booth ahead of time to avoid lines and waiting! They get packed quickly! 

The dress code is everything! I see girls in club dresses and heels and I see girls In jeans and a TSHIRT. Same for the men it's either dressy or casual!

There's all different ages but 19+ of course."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple friends. We ordered a shisha, some food, and some drinks. We got the bill and I paid on my credit card. I came back a week later, and as I entered the place, had 3 employees AND a manager come up to me and tell me I had \"dined and dashed\" last time, and I was not allowed in. I then showed them the receipt AND bank statement proving I had clearly paid, and instead of offering an apology they said \"Well, I guess since you have proof we cant argue with you\". WORST customer service and I will never be back, nor recommend this place to anyone. Disgusting."}
