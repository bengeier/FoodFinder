{"text":"i remember eating here a lot when i was a kid and always enjoying it. Has a very old school feel to it that is unlike anything else on this side of town.

I havent been here in over 15 years and cant wait to stop by next time im in town."}
{"text":"Now I'm not very old (25), but I have been going to Arturo's since I was about 11... I have always loved the food and now that I'm older, I also appreciate the good service. Chips and salsa are always fresh and tasty, and the prices are reasonable..."}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants with a passion. My husband and I seek out small, locally-owned restaurants exclusively and when we find a good one, we give them as much business as we can. Arturo's is one of our local West Side faves.

 I don't know how long Arturo's has been in business, but it definitely has the look and feel of a place that's been around since your nana's youth. In fact, it feels like maybe Arturo's nana may have started the joint and still cooks there. 

Definitely a family run establishment, Arturo's offers great homemade Mexican food in a quiet environment. A huge old mural of St Francis surrounded by his animal buddies (some of whom you're about to eat) covers a wall next to a row of extremely private booths. The menu is pretty typical Mexican fare, with both combo plates and a la carte options. Combo plates come with a side of refried beans and the best Mexican rice I've ever had. Service is fast and attentive. Prices are cheap. 

Skip the row of chain restaurants along Dysart and Litchfield and grab a bite at Arturo's instead. You'll save cash, eat local and leave satisfied."}
