{"text":"I went for dinner on Friday night with a group of friends.  We were seated at a table with 2 grills but were only allowed to use 1 because they said due to safety concerns, only 1 grill could be used for a small group of 4.   It was inconvenient to cook for 4 with only 1 grill so maybe it was the restaurant's strategy to minimize how much food we eat.    Although it was AYCE for $20.99, they do limit what you order.  With their limited menu, we ordered extra quantities of each item, but they would only bring us 1 serving of each, and some of the dishes had only 3 pieces of thinly sliced meat... which was not fine for a group of 4.  They had even conveniently forgotten to bring us the salmon and pineapple we initially ordered.  Over several re-orders, we would get the items we wanted, however, each subsequent orders would receive fewer servings.  It was definitely not AYCE when they continue to reduce what they bring to your table.    I also ordered the whipped cream, grass jelly dessert, and found it very bleh.    I've been to many other Korean BBQs and Seoul BBQ is not at the bottom of the list.  The service was not bad though.  The server was friendly and very chatty, and changed the grill often, and brought out the orders quickly."}
{"text":"The decor is a little dated, and the restaurant itself is a bit out of the way and on the bottom floor of an office building.   However, the service was lovely and the food was delicious. We had the japchae, the tofu stew and the spicy cod stew. They are very generous with the seafood and the fish in their stews, and the flavours are great.  Definitely a must try if you like Korean food."}
{"text":"I thought it couldn't get any worse than last time. Then this time we were eating late night, 1 hour before closing the waiter stood at our table and told us to hurry up because he wants to go home. We asked him for some side dish he says that he already packed the food and he's ready to go. We just rushed to finish, and still gave 20% tips."}
{"text":"We were disappointed that this is not all-you-can-eat, and the BBQ entrees require a minimum of two people (at around $15 pp). Seems a bit pricey when you can get BBQ buffet style for about the same price. We ended up getting a lunch box and a bibibap. The entrees come with more sides than other restaurants (miso soup, and about 4-5 kimchi type sides) so the portions felt quite generous for our entrees (at about $10 pp).  Restaurant was nice and clean, and service was great. But given the price point for BBQ, I don't think we'll be back unless we're really craving a bibibap (which was great; the lunch box was a bit disappointing as the chicken wasn't very flavourful) when we're in the NDG area."}
{"text":"The food at this AYCE Kbbq is great. Seasoning and marinate is terrific. The service is not the best. We had to reorder the same items 4 times. It could have a language issue..but the food made up for it. Atmosphere is decent and you're not cramped in like other kbbq places. The chairs are horrible and are sunken down due to heavy usage. Not the most comfortable.  Ask for the booth with the benches."}
{"text":"Food was okay but not great.  I went for a Sunday dinner with my boyfriend. I would say some staff were friendly and helpful but one waiter was very rude to us.  When meat was served we thought it wasn't flavourful enough to our taste so we wanted to get some soy sauce, since we didn't have a bottle of soy sauce on our table my boyfriend called the waiter over and asked him if he could bring us one, the guy came up with an attitude and an awkward look on his face for no reason, as if he was mad at us or something.  When we asked for the bill, first I asked the female owner for bill and as the owner was busy with something else on hand she passed my request to the same rude waiter, the waiter turned towards me from the cash machine and asked me if I needed bill, I nodded and said yes, he rudely signaled that I must go over to the counter and pay. I don't understand why as I observed most customers had their bills delivered to their table. Never return again if this guys still works there."}
{"text":"Having eaten at several Korean BBQ restaurants before this one, we thought why not try a new place.  Better to have not tried this one.  We should have known something was amiss when we slid to our table along super greasy floors.  Once we sat down, clue number two was evident as we sunk into the overly worn chairs.    The menu was standard, with enough choice, and we chose the more expensive one (only by two dollars), so we could try the \"special beef\". The meat was fine, though the heat rom the BBQ was uneven. (The shrimp took longer to cook than the chicken!!!)  We also ordered soup, which never came.   The interesting part came when the fire alarm went off while we're still eating.  The staff did nothing to inform us, or the other customers, about the situation.  We got up to look as a lot of smoke was coming from one table.  One waiter turned off the gas, though when the alarm went off the BBQs immediately stopped burning.  The alarm continued to sound as the customers left the restaurant.  After waiting for more than 15 minutes outside, we decided that was enough. No fire truck appeared, the alarm continued to sound, and they still wanted us to pay full price despite not being finished our meal.  We will not be returning to this restaurant, not so much because of the food, but because the service was so poor."}
{"text":"Good services. Nice food. Had a lot of fun grilling and eating."}
{"text":"The seafood pancake has no cabbage inside, like someone previously mentioned its like an omlette, no crunch factor at all. The chap chae was bland, no flavor. They did not have any other sweet dipping sauces for seafood pancake like other places . Dont know how this place is rated so highly, was really disappointed."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday morning. There was a little confusion about the opening hours that differed from the information found on the Internet. So, we had to wait 20 minutes for this restaurant to open, as it opened later than it stated on the Internet. This is not a problem because there is a lot to see in this neighbourhood and we walked around.   The restaurant was empty when we arrived and it took a minute before we were seated. You will notice that most of the tables for four were set up for only two place settings. What is more confusing was that they give you a pair of red tongs and a pair of black tongs. Since it has been so long since I have been to Korean BBQ, I didn't realize that the red tongs were for raw meat and the black tongs were for cooked meat. Please remember this for your own food safety, as the restaurant doesn't tell you this. Also, make sure your grill is clean, we noticed some residue on ours, but I wasn't concerned, as I knew that it wasn't something that someone would have touched. Also, the table had a slight bit of grease on it, which was a little bit of a disappointment.   We had the All you can eat Korean BBQ and we ordered some of everything because this was my son's first time. What we didn't realize was that the portions were huge, they offered two servings of everything that we ordered, except for the seafood. So, we set to cooking the meat. I noticed that there was not a lot of vegetable offerings in this. So, please keep this in mind.   Drinks are also relatively inexpensive, only $1, fountain drinks, all you can drink. It's at this point that you realize that your waiter barely does anything except bring you the food and take away your empty dishes.   Since there were two of us, my son grabbed a pair of tongs and I grabbed the other and we set to cooking. It is about this time, when visions of Chuck E. Cheese and the recently closed Woodie Woodchuck swirl in your mind. This was the point that I realize that I may have discovered Scarborough's version of Disneyland for pre-Tweens. Here's a kid that gives you the I don't know and Whatever answers to all questions who actually cracks a smile and is having a good time. The conversation even kept coming. Keep in mind this is a one hour meal, so, you have time. The burners weren't cooking very fast. But for a lazy Sunday afternoon, I was okay with that.   The decor was nice. The kimchi was good. The meat well seasoned. The drinks were plentiful. We had a good time. Periodically, the waiter did come by to check on our fire, which I felt was unnecessary.   However, like all good things, it must come to the end. The waiter made a comment that we wasted some food. This applied to the cooked food and not the raw food that we didn't cook. When I looked at the bill, I noticed that we were charged a service charge, which I suspect was for the wasted food. This was never fully explained to me. In fact, I think my bill disappeared when after I paid for it.   I opted to pay with debit and there was an issue with their machine. Did it ever work? I will not know until my next visit. However, this is not the only Korean BBQ in Scarborough. I had to leave my son and go to the convenience store to get cash to pay my bill. I will note that this irked me. I don't like leaving my kids anywhere. Had I been able to pay with the debit machine, you would have gotten my standard tip; however, because you didn't give me enough change even after I went to the convenience store, paid $2 for a debit fee, and charged me $3 service charge, possibly for uneaten food, plus the fact that as my waiter, you didn't do anything for you. The amount left on your tip tray was a lot less than you were probably expecting. Get used to it, as this is feedback from your customers.   Overall, I didn't mind the small stuff in the beginning. I had a good time, so did my son. However, your inability to finish the deal that was the transaction of my meal was the real downfall for me in this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. The food is great and the staff is helpful. It's almost as good as my moms cooking."}
{"text":"This place serves the best side dishes ever. The kimchi and cucumbers are so crunchy and fresh. The potatos are marinated in a delicious sweet sauce. Their dishes are pretty good also, such as their soup and their grilled meat.   The lady is always nice and friendly. They also have some private rooms if you want to host private dinners."}
{"text":"This BBQ is much better than the rest from toronto. Dinner delux is only 17.95 drink included."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon ; as luck might have it a whole tour bus full of Korean tourists had unloaded into the restaurant and they were packed with about 60 diners (good sign) but I could only see about 2 wait staff and was worried they they wouldn't even notice me waiting for a table, much less get served during a crazy lunch crush like this (bad sign?) Thankfully I was seated with a smile and quickly.  The decor is a dated, and not in a good way. Imagine a kind of Nouveau Palais decor but in a freeze dried museum way. A lot of light bulbs in the fixtures were dead, and combined with the tinted window and window dressings there wasn't a lot of light in the dining room in the middle of the day. Thankfully it was clean. But don't come for the decor or the atmosphere.  The food was thankfully good. The assortments of little dishes of kimchi, sprouts, potatoes were nice, though it would have been nice to have been served them after seating instead of along with the meal as other Korean restaurants do. The portions were very generous (good sign); the sea food pancake was more an omelette, and not particularly tasty: you could really tell the seafood came frozen out of a bag -- not recommended. The bibimbap only came in the dolsot variety, it would have been nice to have to option without a hot stone bowl on a hot summer day. The spicy tofu stew was alright.  Tip: the lunch specials are available on Sunday despite what the menu says. We would have ordered them instead of à la carte had we known; I pointed this disappointing error out to the staff so hopefully they fix that.  After the meal there was ample space for my two year old nephew to run around. Bonus. 7.5/10 would come again."}
{"text":"I went here with 2 friends on a chilly and wet November Saturday for lunch. I was really happy to try this place out! My friend and I both took the Bulgogi Lunch special box, which I supplemented with Beef Dumplings. My other friend took chicken with a kimchi pancake on the side.  We were quite happy and full by the end. I could have probably been satisfied with just the Lunch special box but everything was so good, so we soldiered on and finished it all.  Very homemade feel to the place, the service and of course the food.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and have driven by this place a thousand times, never giving it much thought because the surroundings are not the nicest looking. Boy was I wrong to judge this gem of a restaurant by its cover. While the view of speeding traffic along Cavendish, overlooking a parking lot across the street are gritty and not in a cool way, the food fully compensates. Who cares about the view really with food this good. And the interior is beautifully simple, and spotlessly clean.   Service was great - friendly, and fairly prompt. Minor disappointment with incredibly limited beer selection (only Sapporo) and having to pack my own doggy bag for the meal my daughter couldn't finish, but these are not that important. What matters is the quality of the food and this was there in abundance. We stuck to the BBQ (chicken, pork and beef). The bimbibop was sweet and tasty, the chicken and pork nicely spiced (one in our party found it too spicy but I loved it). Generous portions but not too much. Overall a very satisfying meal and a restaurant I will return to.   (For what it's worth, the other diners were either Korean or pregnant or both which I take as a very good sign.)"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Sunday evening. The old lady that was there was super nice and she gave us the menu right away. We ordered yukgaejang, kimchi pancake , beef Mandu and bibimbap. Once we made the order, she brought us water and the side dishes. The side dishes were very flavourful. My fave was the potatoes !! The yukgaejang was kinda bland but super spicy, the Mandu was decent but tasted like the frozen ones that you can buy from the Asian grocery store. The bibimbap and the kimchi pancake were the best part of the meal . The best I have ever had !!! The toppings and rice ratio of the bibimbap was perfect. I find that most places give more rice than anything else. The meat and the veggies were so good with the hot sauce. I can still taste it in my mouth LOL. The kimchi pancake was perfectly fried. The outside had the perfect crisp and the inside was super gooey , just the way I like it. Overall, I really liked this place. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and I'm never disappointed. The staffs are very friendly. It's clean and spacious. Also, they have small rooms for private events. During summer, the cold noodle dish is amazing! Refreshing and tasty. On colder days, I like to either take the bibimbap or the seafood tofu stew! It actually contains seafood unlike other korean restaurants where it is only some tiny shrimps. If you like noodles, their Jam bong (seafood noodles) is quite good too!  They are also very generous on their side dishes.  Decent price also!"}
{"text":"Very good Korean food!  Ordered the beef ribs and the porc.  They were from the BBQ section of the menu, but, opted not to cook it ourselves (we were lazy, and it was an additional $2 lol).  It was fresh too!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Whenever I crave korean food, this place is my first thought! Authentic korean Food. Their side dishes are great and they give u large portions too. I love their SoonDuBu  (Spicy Soft tofu stew) I like mine not spicy though. It's delicious! Bibimbap is delicious as well.  All great things to say about Seoul BBQ. definetly my favorite"}
{"text":"I really like how this place provides an Alert system... It will indicate you've successfully eaten[AYCE{1}] your share.  We ate countless rounds of Pork + Lamb + Beef + Shrimp. A shiny Moat of Animal Fat Drippings will appear under Grill. The Pool of Meat Grease caught on Fire and went auto-pilot. At which point, you may turn Gas off and take out Marshmallows{2}.  When you see this Bonfire Effect @Seoul BBQ.   That's the sure sign that you've RIP them off.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ {1} $15.99 Dinner(Basic) includes Drinks {2} Marshmallows are not provided as part of the Meal"}
{"text":"When Seoul bbq started it was a fantastic place to eat. Good selection, fresh and well marinated meats with a distinct sweet flavour. Now the restaurant is just a shell of itself when the new management came in. The meats now are poorly marinated(too sour or no marinade), meat quality has gone down drastically. And many of its hot side dishes now contain fillers. To add insult to injury the price is jacked up from 18.99 with tax in to 22.99!  This is generally quite sad and as a often going customer I will not come back again"}
{"text":"Do not go here, plain and simple. The grill was poorly powered, the meat had a rotten taste and smell to it, and there are hidden service charge fees that are not posted anywhere except for on the final bill. This is not how contractual agreements (which is what a restaurant transaction is) go on, and this kind of service fee is disputable. The only good thing here was the pop machine, and the kimchi. Stay away. Prices have been inflated from what was last posted on here. GO TO CHAKO!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner and really clean place. Nice service and pretty quiet place too. Food takes a little bit longer than what you expect but otherwise really recommended."}
{"text":"Whenever I have cravings for Korean food, I would come to this restaurant.  They have moved to a new location just across the street from their old one since last year.  The new place is bigger with more tables.  No waiting lines.  This is more of a Korean family style restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  Just good old traditional Korean food.  Their side dishes are awesome!  Way better than most others.  Last Friday, I came here and ordered the Jap Chae and Kimchi stew.  The food was so good and satisfying.  Not to mention how reasonable the prices are.  If I live in the neighborhood, I'll probably come to eat here at least 2x a week."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for the first time today and it was the worse experience I've had with a Korean BBQ. The fire from the grill was constantly going off and it was also very weak (the fire went out 5 times and the food took forever to cook so we were basically filling our stomach with tea) so we asked if we could switch tables because clearly there was something wrong with the grill. We asked several different waiters/waitresses for a table change but all of them ignored our request as if it was too much of a bother to clean up a table for us. And when we finally got our new table after the fifth request (and that's only because we asked to speak to the manager) they gave us attitude The food was average for a grill house but the pork was 95% fat. I also ordered some items that never came and instead of getting what we asked for, we got things we didn't order.  Also, the restaurant was not busy at all... you'd expect their service to be at least decent, but no. I've been to many other Korean BBQ's and have gotten a much better service. If you do visit this place, I advise you to not sit near the doors... it's probably the worse table there as the fire will constantly go off and you won't be able to change tables unless you ask for the manager or threaten them that you're leaving."}
{"text":"Too expensive, they raised their price again, now it's $20 per person AYCE Mon-Thurs. The flavour of the meat is either too salty or too bland. The portions are quite small so you have to keep submitting orders. When I was here on Thursday night they only had 2 servers so it was quite difficult to make extra orders and they them to change the pan.  Would not return..."}
{"text":"I came on the wrong day for lunch. Mon to Thurs their lunch special is $9.99 for AYCE. On Friday its $13.99 for lunch. Cuts of meat were decent at best. Many of the rib pieces were just filled with fat and uneatable. If you want lettuce wrap its $2 extra. There is a selection of side dishes (mash potato, seaweed, kimchii, radish, bean sprouts, miso soup). You can also get rice which is included in the price. Soft drinks are also unlimited and self served through a dispenser at the back.   If you are looking to fill that meat craving you have at a decent price then this is an okay place to do it. However if you are looking for nice quality cuts of meat then I would be looking elsewhere. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Still my favourite place to come for Korean in Montreal.  The place is seldom busy and the food is very authentic, flavourfu spicy and excellent menu selection.  On my visit I ordered the Mandu dumplings as an appetizer and then a Beef Bibimbap.  Bibimbap is he perfect meal for me on a cold winter evening as it warms up the whole body.  Nice and spicy with the red sauce and the bantam is always generous and very fresh.    Service was a bit slow on our visit but that won't deter me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was friendly and with a smile!! The Gal bi was some of the best I have had. The dumplings were hot and a great starter. And the kimchi that accompanied the meal was delicious. They lady at the counter, assumed to be  the owner, was so kind and made conversation, she had a demeanor that made you feel like family."}
{"text":"The service here was awesome! The staff was very attentive and polite. The food here is similar to food found at any other Korean BBQ. However, they have thinly sliced pork belly (basically bacon) that all of us couldn't get enough of. I highly recommend getting the daily dessert at the start of the meal (if it's still the coconut drink with a scoop of ice cream on top). The price here for dinner on a Saturday night is $20.99."}
{"text":"Have found one of the most adorable Korean places in Montréal West! The owner is so lovely and the service is warm and friendly. They treat you like a member of the family. The lunch service is both delicious and affordable. The kimchi pancake, however, was a little soggy. I also got the vegetarian bento box which was very good. They use only the freshest ingredients and this is the perfect spot for an affordable and satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Si, tout comme moi, vous êtes un fan de cuisine coréenne (et que vous adorez les Bibimbab), je vous suggère un arrêt chez Seoul BBQ dans l'ouest de l'île. À votre entrée, vous serez probablement déçu par le décor minimaliste de l'endroit. Les murs en contre-plaqué de bois vernis et l'éternel TV écran plat rappellent étrangement les bars sportifs de quartier. Mais ne vous laisser pas rebuter. Assoyez-vous à l'une des tables et laisser vous tenter par l'un des choix de grillade, de soupe repas ou de Bimbibab au menu. Pour ma part, j'ai choisi le Bibibbad au poulet épicé. J'ai eu droit à une portion généreuse et parfumée de ce plat national typiquement coréen. Le service est courtois. Le rapport qualité prix est très intéressant.   En résumé, une visite chez BBQ représente une très bonne expérience culinaire dans le genre cuisine asiatique. On regrette le décor un peu négligé de l'endroit et l'aspect peu accueillant de la façade, mais on oublie vite ces détails une fois servi. Je vous recommande fortement."}
{"text":"So good! Was my first time there and definitely not the last! Service was great too! Seafood pancake and a beef bibimbap and some sides plus 2 beers... $40! Best value ever! Plus I had some leftovers to bring back home, think it was even Better the next day! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are big on lamb and can't get enough of it, than this is the place to go. Unlike  other Korean BBQ locations, they provide dry spices to compliment the meat. I am a big fan of those China-Style BBQ lamb skewers and with the spices here, you get the exact flavor. The service here is exceptional. The servers are very friendly and they take their time to show you how to cook the meat to bring out the optimal flavor using the spices.  The quality of the meat is above average and lightly marinaded unlike some other places which heavily marinade their meats.  This is definitely not you typical Korean BBQ experience. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of friends. Food was good. Drinks - selfserve and far away depending on where you're seated.    In terms of service, it was terrible. Other than the initial pick up of our order form no one came to check on us once for the two hours we were there. And when we wanted to order more food/dessert no one was to be found. One member of our group got up to find someone and found all the staff hiding in the back (yes, I get this is a business strategy). Also want to add that the entire time we were there, there was only two other tables so it's not like it was too busy for them to check on us.   Lastly, there is a hidden tip charge added to the bill. All in all the all you can eat I felt was too expensive for what you're getting."}
{"text":"So all over the internet, with every mention of this restaurant, they boast about delivery services. I just called, since I cannot find any menu online, to see where I might view the menu. The lady quickly says they don't have delivery, that I must have wrong number. I asked if it was Seoul BBQ, to which she replies \"yes, so you must have wrong location\". I asked if on Cavendish, and I am correct again. No delivery people. False advertising.  I had to rate a star, wouldn't have given even 1, but can't post without."}
