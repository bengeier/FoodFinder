{"text":"Cannot say how this food tastes. We waited 2 hours for our delivery and it never showed up. Called several times to a very rude employee. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great stuff!   I had the pad thai, spring rolls and mango and coconut dessert. My boyfriend had the duck curry. It was delicious!   I have pad thai at every thai restaurant I go to and this was by far the best!! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavour was great.   The spring rolls were good, a little greasy- but hey, aren't most fried foods?   The curry was spicy but the flavour was awesome. You got the taste of the coconut milk and a nice kick at the end. The lychee was also a very interesting but complimentary flavour!  All in all, ready to go there again and again and bring everyone else with me!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot. Good Thai food. I recommend the Khao Soy and the green curry."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get some good Thai food in the west end of the city.  Food was great and service was polite and prompt.  Went in for a sit down meal but noticed that a large number of people walking in for take out and the delivery people for the restaurant would walk out with giant bags of food.  After seeing this and looking around at the premises a little closer I can see why.  The place is fairly small and the decor is tacky.  During the winter time it can get uncomfortable with the door opening constantly with the take out and deliver people and poor partitioning within the restaurant does little to remedy this.  Next time, I think I'm going with take out!"}
{"text":"Best white thai food in Toronto, it has good service too. No parking but it's worth it."}
{"text":"A simple neighbourhood favorite !  Fresh consistently tasty food.  Simple setting.  Courteous attentive wait staff.  Way to easy to stop here on nights when you mist don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Whoa!  Bua Thai, where have you been all my life?  Thai food lovers, this is the place for moderately priced, authentic Thai food in Toronto.  Had the Duck Curry (Kang Pad Ped), Pad Thai and Papaya Salad (Som Tam).  All of them were full of flavour, completely devoid of ketchup, and very reasonably priced.  Plus 1/2 litre of the house red (which was not terrible) for $12!  Sold!    So long Bangkok Garden and Mengrai Thai, it was nice knowing you!  If you're going to those places, you're really just paying for the pretentious ambiance; this place is all about delicious food."}
{"text":"Such a random location but so thankful for it too. There aren't many restaurant options in the area, especially in this price range. The roasted duck curry was bomb. The lychee adds a very nice touch to it!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Each dish we ordered was different from the other and we enjoyed a fantastic flavour melange.   Particular favourites were the fried snapper in red curry and the basil pad thai with tofu.  What would have been an excellent dining experience was overshadowed by some of their billing practices. Two items were listed on our bill for a couple dollars higher than the menu price and were corrected by our server when we brought them up.  Also, a 'service charge' of 15% was automatically added to our bill. While this may have made sense if we were a larger group, there were just 3 of us. The charge wasn't disclosed to us, and had we not checked, we would have been paying tips twice.   Would return for the food, and will be vigilant with my bill-check next time."}
{"text":"Recommended. Curry is great here. Pad Thai isn't particularly special, but decent.   I'm pretty sure this place changed it's name to Be Thai. No sign outside at all, so you need to know where you're going.   Rarely busy, but take out is really quick - 15 minutes max."}
{"text":"One of the Best Thai food in TO... So glad my office is nearby and I get to enjoy their lunch specials... Always look forward to their Friday special - Peanut Curry Chicken... MMmmmmMM.  For $10 (that includes taxes and tip) Peanut Curry Chicken - can't get enough of this stuff! Thai Hot and Sour Soup - BEST HOT & SOUR SOUP... EVER!  I would go here just for the soup. Spring Rolls - just the right side to fill you up.  Everything is served piping hot and O so Good! Service is fast and friendly - never had to ask once for a water refill."}
{"text":"Food is good. Me and my partner both had the Pad Thai, it was pretty sweet but tasted good. Satay was great (as great as one can expect outside of SEA). Desserts -- we had a mango sticky rice, great value, but God, it's a lot to eat..., and deep fried bananas. Those were amazing.  Not a fan of the 15% service charge, even for the two of us! Be careful if you're using credit as they bring you up to the front and you don't get to see your receipt until you're at the machine. You'll see the service charge in there at the bottom after the tax. Careful or you might tip twice!  Overall, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This review is for the takeout only. This was a last minute choice as the perennial fav for take out/delivery wouldn't deliver at the friend's place we were dinning. This place is right around the corner so we decided to pick up from here. Initial impression for the restaurant was pleasant and its a nice clean place with plenty of seating.  Word of advise though you they don't use the same names for the popular dishes so it is suggested one go through the description and the rice is extra. Pick up was easy and there is a discount if you pay cash. The food was packed well.   Here is a play by play Soups were good or maybe it was the cold weather that elevated the dish Mango salad good as well and better than the popular spot IMO Peanut curry (Panang) hmm this is a fav but was disappointing. The texture was of a cross between the satay sauce and curry sauce one associates with this dish. Hmm not pleasant at all. Young Coconut curry. Average and it was hard to identify the curry taste.  Red Curry was decent and much better than the other options here. Coconut shrimp were OK. Pad Thai. Below average. Hmmm with a standard being set high in Toronto for mainstream Thai take out/delivery I think they have their work cut out for them. 2.5 stars for the take out experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant is so highly rated - I pretty much compare every Thai place to Pai in downtown, which is both authentic and uses great authentic ingredients. I thought I'd try it out - so I ordered the Pad Thai, Red Curry with roasted Duck, and Tom Yum Soup.   First, the soup was really not that deep or flavourful. It wasn't really very tangy at all - the lemon and galangal/ginger flavour was pretty low. The soup doesn't even have any heat. There were also no sliced red chilis, tomatoes, onions, and the deep flavour of real lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and I suspect the fish sauce was on the low side - it needed more salt. Oh, the whole button mushrooms were actually wilted and the shrimp was rubbery - definitely NOT good. I suspect it was sitting in the soup all day rather than put in as the final inclusion. This was the most disappointing item on the menu. If you want Tom Yom soup, go to Pai and you'll never go back to eating this version of it.   The Pad Thai was better - it tasted good, but it wasn't really Pad Thai. The dish is still fine, but I don't think they are using Tamarind, and it's not as garlicy and savoury as a more authentic version. It was also pretty dry - especially the chicken, which was probably pre-cooked, drained of all of its savory juices and simply warmed into the stir fry. They didn't use Ban Pho noodles - they opted for more thinner noodles.   The red curry was pretty bland. The Taste of Thailand version is strictly superior. Theirs was creamy, but it just lacked depth and warmth, probably to not using a very authentic curry paste. What burns me is that store purchased ones are actually much better. It's not that hard to use the Maesri brand, which is actually quite good, if you can't make your own. I'm not sure what happened here, so I was also disappointed.   The portions were also pretty small. That is not something I would really mention if my mind was blown away by the quality of the food, but considering my other disappointments, it's also worth mentioning. I expect to have a lot of leftovers for the next day, but there is far less than half of the total amount of food for lunch.   I realize they really aren't that many great Thai places in Etobicoke - I wish Pai was out here instead of downtown Toronto - but Taste of Thailand, while not being authentic, is at least much more chefy and more flavourful in all aspects, and the prices are basically the same, you should probably just order from there. But if you really have time in your day, just go get Pai... it's SOOO much better."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place because it was rush hour. What a great decision!  i had cocounut soup, amazing! As well as tofu satay skewers, came with an amazing peanut sauce. I was satisfied, I will definitely head back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Decor very simple with classic Thai furnishings but certainly an inviting and warm charm to it. Professional Service.  Most of the usual standbys on the menu with A couple of interesting additions like curry with young coconut leaves Several of the dishes sweeter then I would prefer but I'm sure many people would enjoy Definitely worth the money spent and we will be returning Dinner for two under $60"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to place for Thai delivery for awhile now. It never disappoints. I've never had delivery issues (like some of the other reviews I've seen here), and the food always tastes amazing. Great value too, with very reasonable prices for a generous amount of food. I have a weak spot for their spring rolls too. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Was not too busy on a Saturday night. Curries were good. Had plenty of sauce."}
{"text":"This place is quick and delicious. I had the Pad Thai with shrimp (though light on the shrimp) and peanut curry with chicken with some appetizers. Spring rolls are good and crunchy and the hot and sour soup was delicious. All in all great experience for take out. Though parking is a bit of an issue."}
{"text":"They welcomed me by telling me the kitchen was closing and its last call. We had 35 minutes. Not welcoming, we are going in to enjoy food and socialize. All they care about is $$$. Customer leaves when they wish...."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch recently. From outside you expect an older place but the interior is actually trendy and very appealing with lots of exquisite Thai handicrafts.  The staff is very friendly and made us feel welcome.  Menu covers most if not all the Thai food that I've ever known and even introduced me to some new items.  Started with Chicken Satay and it was hands down one of the best Satay I've ever had even compared with offerings in Malaysia/Singapore! The peanut sauce was just right and not too nutty while the chicken was tender and juicy. Highly Continued with the pineapple fried rice with chicken which was very appetizing. Portion was just right for Lunch but for Dinner I'd say on the smaller side but still satisfying. The quality of ingredients they use is high as is evidenced by the taste of the dishes.  Presentation is also very good and gives that visual appeal to round up a true 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Love this little place, and I'm surprised it's not busier when the business crowd leaves for the day. Excellent selection of food and great service"}
{"text":"Go to place for delivery, it's a two black away from our house. Consistently good Thai food, never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite Thai restaurant in the GTA.  I have eaten here at least 10x, and have yet to have a questionable experience.  The service is warm and friendly, the prices are reasonable (kind of cheap, actually) and the food is incredible.    My favourite dish is the peanut chicken curry, which is a bit like red curry, but even better.  It's one of the Friday specials, but the cool thing about this place is that for an extra dollar or two, you have have the specials on the days when they aren't specials (if that makes sense).  Always be sure to specify that you want veg in your curry b/c sometimes it comes with just meat (weird, but whatever)."}
{"text":"I've only ever had Thai food once or twice before and had low expectations. However, the spring rolls, pad Thai and pineapple fried rice were all delicious. I would consider eating here on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent for Take-out or Delivery.  The food is authentic. The ingredients are incredibly fresh - a necessity in Thai cuisine.  The pad thai is perfect, the green and red curries are consistent and delicious.   Eating in, however, avoid it! The decor is dated and tacky, not a pleasant environment to dine, although the servers are all pleasant."}
{"text":"Great food, had pad thai chicken and a pad thai beef for takeout.  Both we very hot, very good with little nuts on top.  They did take a usa credit card, as I find my usa debt card not working in Canada."}
{"text":"I've been here about a half dozen times and have found their food and service to be consistent and excellent, especially for the great price!  This has been my go-to with co-workers for lunch on Fridays and is filling, delicious, and easy on the wallet!    The service is very quick, and the atmosphere and décor makes me feel quite comfortable here."}
{"text":"The sign outside the restaurant is ugly, but it's actually really nice inside!  The food was great. We had the veggie platter as an appetizer and then the peanut curry and veggie pad Thai. Everything was delicious and the presentation was nice.   We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The lunch special is definitely a bang for your buck. You pay $10+tax and you get soup, a spring roll, and your main. It's a lot of food! I alternate between their green chicken curry and pad thai. I feel like you can determine whether or not a Thai restaurant is good by trying their pad thai, and Bua Thai's pad thai noodles are so saucy, chewy, and overall delicious. It's often dead in the restaurant when my coworkers and I come in for lunch (around 12pm-1pm). They have very attentive service. My water glass is always full, and food arrives quick enough you're not questioning their quality. I've had Bua Thai 4 days straight once, and I would honestly have it every day if I could, but it usually results in a deep food coma at my desk."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been at the corner of Avenue and Davenport for a number of years.  I have ordered delivery from them a few times and was never disappointed. I went to the location for lunch once a couple years ago and although the food was very good the restaurant was indeed in need of updating.  I went there again tonight and to my surprise it in fact has been updated, has a very busy delivery and pick up business and the food is extremely good.   I had the shrimp spring rolls and there must have been five or six good size shrimp stuffed in the roll.  Another chef specialty dish had freshly cooked crispy noodles on top of soft noodles. Great crunch factor. And like other reviewer's I did try the peanut, coconut curry and  it was delicious with the right amount of spice. The prices are extremely good  and I think this restaurant definitely deserves more attention from those who love good Thai food."}
{"text":"Among the plethora of Thai eateries in this city sits Bua Thai, a quiet little spot just at the cusp of Yorkville.    The atmosphere is typical Thai, some silk here, some vases there, a couple of Buddhas thrown into the mix and the servers are ingratiating and kind.  Unlike most Thai restaurants that I've tried in this city, the dishes are distinct from one another and are quite fresh.  The eggplant is to die for and the broccoli with Tofu is my favorite dish.  The restaurant offers affordable take-out, and delivery and is even more pleasant to sit inside."}
{"text":"REALLY delicious food. Unfortunately our experience was completely ruined because of a scitzo-phrenic eating in the restaurant that started swearing and showing signs of possibly being violent, and nobody working there did anything about it. I feel like some sort of authority should have been called. Or if he was a regular, at least let us know that he's harmless."}
{"text":"Don't get here often, first time was great! Ordered  glass noodle salads, soups, another glass noodle dish  to go since I was having people over. Staff even separated the shrimps due to an allergy. Next visit, repeat the glass noodle salads, YUK!!! It was wrong,clumpy, too hot heat wise. Called to discuss the experience, person didn 't care much. Asked over  the phone for a manger, no straight answer, or not avaiable. Regret refering people. Party trays, only the manager can quote, not around  so never ordered. Service matters, i wanted 0 stars.Lots of good options elsewhere..."}
{"text":"Really yummy food. We ordered delivery and really enjoyed everything. We got spring rolls, mango chicken, and beef coconut curry. (As another reviewer mentioned there were no veggies in the curry so just ask for them if you want them.) I'm not sure what the exact name of those meals are- I called in a hurry on moving day and had them help pick for me what to order because I had no time to look it up online. They were nice enough to choose for me and the person on the phone was patient with me when my phone kept hanging up on him.  Delivery arrived quickly and everything was hot and yummy. I had the beef the next night heated up in the microwave and it was even really good the second night. Definitely would order again although for now am exploring the other options in this area, which is new for me. We may also consider eating in sometime."}
{"text":"Came for dinner at 8:30pm on Saturday with no reservations; got seats right away (there were only 4-5 tables full), and they close at 9pm. Service was friendly, but the girl who took our order was not very good at describing the dishes and got confused by simple questions. There was an older man who took a couple of to go orders, and he was much more informative. The food was excellent! We had the beef satay, spring rolls, wonton soup, basil fried rice, pad Thai and pad see ew. All had really good flavor, were really hot, and the spicy level was just right (always a challenge with Thai food). Prices were reasonable and portions were good size. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I was getting a quick lunch with a friend before heading over to a concert, and she found this place through Yelp. It's already been a month since then, so I can't really remember everything we ordered. I personally got the pineapple fried rice, and it was so good. The rice was so flavourful, and there were fat pieces of shrimp in it. You could tell they didn't really skimp out on the ingredients, because at the end I had more extra stuff than rice. It's also presented pretty nicely.   Service wise, they're okay. The lady who served us was nice, but came over to tell us the dessert we ordered was unavailable only to return two minutes later to say that it was.   They take cash or credit only."}
{"text":"I ordered from them this past Monday night and there was a huge knot of black hair in my pad Thai. Threw it out instantly. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Nom nom. So good! Love the Pad Thai. I come here often! Cheap and delicious. That's my thing. It's cozy, not a ton of seats but I always get a seat within a few minutes. Food comes out quick, which is perfect since I start salivating on the walk there just thinking about it.   Staff is not unfriendly but also aren't very talkative or expressive. But I forgive them. They bring me the cheap and delicious so that's all I need from them!  The spring rolls are to die for, although would I actually die I would miss those spring rolls so much.  The soup varies but is always good.  I find it odd that they don't take debit, cash or credit only. But not a problem because: cheap!  To be fair I only ever get lunch specials so maybe it's not all cheap.  They have those delicious teeny tiny fruit candies at the door. It's the small things like that, that make it great.  Decor and ambiance is ok but again we forgive its lack of fabulousness because (say it with me) - cheap and delicious!  Go! But not during my lunch, I don't want to have to wait for a seat."}
