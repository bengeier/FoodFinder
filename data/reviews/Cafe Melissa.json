{"text":"Great fresh food and wonderful vegetarian options. Service is great and they are very accommodating with children. Perfect local family restaurant with unique food and kind people."}
{"text":"On a family road trip from Vermont to California and back. We have eaten at A LOT of restaurants but this is the first time we have ever written a review.  This place has by far THE BEST kids menu choices of anywhere we have EVER been. As well as some incredible and tasty Gluten Free choices for all.  What a find! If your looking for good food take the time to get off the highway.  The only complaints the family has are the air conditioning was pretty chilly and there is a TV playing in the dining area which is a drag."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, and great atmosphere!  We just stumbled upon it because of it's name and loved it!"}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance and even greater food! Try the eggplant or the gnocchi you will not be disappointed! They have everything from wings, salads, chicken tacos, to steaks! Wash it down with a cold beer or a glass of wine while you're at it!"}
{"text":"I had the fried brussel sprouts as an appetizer and the roasted vegetable salad for dinner! Amazing!! Cool ambiance also!"}
{"text":"We tried the Avon Lake location for the first time today. We really liked the menu. Unique and imaginative.  What we we couldn't handle was the filth. Easily the dirtiest restaurant we've patronized in the last 20 yrs. The lamps hanging over each table were furry with dust. Spilled coffee stains on the window sills. The floors in the corners and doorway moldings were black with filth. I mentioned it to the server and she stated the owner comes in more often with the new menu. This place screams absentee owner. It's a real shame. This place has some potential with someone who really cares. We'll never be back."}
{"text":"Have to say I had heard really good things about this place and Sweet Melissa. I was really excited to try it for my birthday dinner. We started with the fried green tomatoes and Brussels sprouts appetizers. Heard from someone the Brussel sprouts were awesome. I'd beg to differ. They seemed like they were fried and very crunchy and hard. The fried green tomatoes were overly fried and I couldn't even see any tomatoes in there. There was supposed to be sauce, but only enough for a bit or two. Didn't like them at all. I tried the Butternut Squash salad, which wasn't too bad except it didn't even seem like there was any dressing on it. But the flavors in the salad were good. My main course was awful. I got the Short Ribs. There was one \"rib\" and it was like eating a leather shoe. Short Ribs I've had at other restaurants fall of the bone and are moist, this was like a rock. The cole slaw that came over it was drenched in dressing that didn't have a good flavor. It was truly disgusting. I was very disappointed. The service however, was very attentive and quick and the beer list was pretty good. I don't know that I'd go back again though, not by my choice anyway."}
{"text":"We love Melissa cafe. The brunch is great on the weekends and my family and I are obsessed with their burgers and fries. We have been there many times and always have a great experience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!   We had an 80th birthday celebration here over the weekend and I can't say enough good things. The food was delicious and everything went so smoothly. Special thanks to the staff for making it such a great day. They were all so nice and attentive. Would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Twice I have visited Cafe Melissa and each time, the entire party had wonderful meals.  The first time, we were there during a very busy lunch, and service was average.  The second time, we went on a Saturday afternoon and the service was fantastic.   This is the sister restaurant of Sweet Melissa in Rocky River.  While they are known for their pastries, I have never tried them.  The first time, I had a luscious bowl of Ciappino with its savory broth.  I'm sad to hear they no longer have it on their menu, however it now narrows down the items I want to try from 100 to 99.  The second time, I had shrimp with rice that was amazing.  The wild rice had pecans and dried fruit and I just couldn't get enough. Other members of my party had a brunch item, root salad, crab cakes, buffalo wrap and vegetable lasagna.  Everyone raved of their entrees.   Ambiance is mediocre, as it was a Donato's Pizza before.  I'm not holding that against them because AL needed a restaurant with entrees that were different and not boring.  If you like mundane, beef and potatoes, go somewhere else.  Happy, happy, happy for this addition to Avon Lake."}
{"text":"Great service, fast and friendly.  Breakfast dishes were tasty and unique.  Wish we had a place like this in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Thinking that I had just been there on a bad day the first time, I decided to give this place a second chance.  Sat in a booth un-noticed  for a good ten minutes while what seemed like the entire staff took a visible coffee break.  After we flagged somebody down, additional confusion ensued while the staff, clearly flustered, tried to figure out who had the honor of waiting on us.  Felt sorry for the poor young man who was stuck with this honor,  waiting on a now very agitated group.   It was Sunday brunch.  Ordered a concoction of hash with poached eggs.  Did you ever have a hard boiled poached egg?  Didn't  return the order knowing that we would have to wait an additional 30 minutes for another.   Lousy service.  So-so food.  Very disappointing. This is a shame because I have had several extraordinary meals at it's sister restaurant Sweet Melissa's in Rocky River.  My advice.... take a drive into Rocky River."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great food, great service and right around the corner from my house.  My entire extended family hates Brussels sprouts; I ordered anyway because they are so delicious and they all offered to at least try them.  Second order please!  I've never been disappointed here."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very fresh tasting . The fries were actually house cut and the arugula on the tender steak tacos were a treat . My girls shared a kids meal and she still brought out two deserts for them . My oldest couldn't choose between the brownie and choc strawberry so she gave them both ! Great service , fresh food . Not easily impressed but I am"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and creative.  This is my favorite breakfast place because the portions are large and always delicious.  Check out the Greek omelette, it comes with crispy red potatoes with a homemade ranch sauce..my absolute favorite.  Their pumpkin risotto is outstanding.  Or if you prefer something lighter the chicken salad sandwich contains grapes and walnuts but isn't slathered in mayo but rather a light dressing."}
{"text":"Melissa's was recommended to me.i wasn't a fan.The food was ok but quite honestly I thought the restaurant needed a good cleaning.I had the chicken carbonara.It tasted fine but I felt like it was missing something. They had some beautiful desserts in the case and a wide variety but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a handful of times and have had wonderful service and food each time. The staff is friendly, quick and their food is just delish!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favorites. Came here weekly, now has turned to monthly. Seems to be going down in the wrong direction or we have bad luck. Rapid decline, has been hit or miss lately. Orders also keep getting messed up missing item, undercooked or burnt. Wait staff has declined, just had our worst experience on top of bad food and we were 1 of 2 tables(manager, 2servers and 2 cooks all on the clock). I hope they get it back together."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! The folks are really friendly! The corned beef hash and eggs are deconstructed and were delicious, the brick chicken was too!! The deserts are fresh and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Everything here is done right.  From the ambiance, to the food and the service.  Stacey was our sever and she was very personable - going as far to introduce herself and ask us our names.  She was honestly one of the best servers I have ever had and I work in the service industry! The corn beef sandwich was outstanding! Every cafe style spot should strive to be more like these guys!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the best brunch here last Sunday! It's really hard to find a good, quality brunch in this area and we are beyond excited to have a new spot. Lisa was our waitress and she was absolutely fabulous. She was nice and had a great sense of humor AND she let me try a piece of their homemade cassata cake...OMG..... It was amazing! For breakfast I had the classic scrambled eggs, bacon... It was delicious but what really takes it home is their roasted red potatoes with homemade ranch dressing. My husband had the biscuits and gravy and looooved it. If you go on the weekend, ask for Lisa, she's the bomb!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of meals. However they got a new chef who gets confused if you modify your dish."}
{"text":"The waitress recommended the Caesar salad with blackened chicken and I expected boring...but I got super tasty chicken and a non standard Caesar salad with avocados and lots of flavor! Highly rec trying this special dish!"}
{"text":"The only difference I found between here and Sweet Melissa's in Rocky River is this location does not have a bar but they do serve beer and wine!   Our waitress Samantha was awesome! She was very nice and made good food suggestions. I ordered the Burger and a side of Sweet Potato Fries which were great! I don't know if they make their own pickles or where they get them but I think they are my absolute favorite restaurant pickles! They go great on the burger! My boyfriend ordered the Scallop Risotto (recommended by our waitress) and the scallops were cooked perfectly!  We will be back to check out brunch!"}
{"text":"Good service from pleasant staff. Airy environment. Nice menu with variety. Food was presented well and tasty. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I am a regular costumer and I love coming here because it feels so cozy and like home. And their food is amazing. I particularly like their chicken carbonara, and I get that almost every time. I love coming here and definitely recommend it to everyone else."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Great tasting and lots of healthy options. We usually bring visitors here first to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and never disappointed. Tonight we had a large group for a birthday and our service from Norah was excellent."}
{"text":"I gave it a second chance and wish I would not of. Service is horribly slow and you watch servers stand and talk.   I ordered the 2 dips app.and they were cold along with my not mashed ice cold potato's and over cooked short rib.   My boyfriend likes the pot pie.   I would not eat here again!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here 2 weeks ago.  Pistachio crusted fish w/butternut squash was very good as were the brussel sprouts appetizer.  My friend had the salmon and it was overcooked but the potatoes that came with it were very good.   BUT, the ambiance is really lacking.  Definately felt like I was eating in a converted pizza place; hence, the 3-star rating.  A few pictures on the walls and a bit of color would really go a long way."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed once again Poor service and poor food.  Served my wife fish and chips with fish way undercooked and raw. Waitress dropped a piece on the way to the table. The floor is where it belongs.  My Meatloaf sandwich was cold.  They remade the fish, took another 10-15 mins while I didn't want to eat in front of her. So we picked at some fries and chips.  Fish finally delivered with batter so thick it had raw gooey parts in it. At least the fish was cooked this time.  Waitress never refilled my tiny water glass.  So we ended up watching each other eat cold and crappy food. Kinda ruined the idea of having lunch together.  Top it off they charged us full price for both lunches.  Now hope we don't get any lasting effects from this lunch later."}
{"text":"The food is their strong point.  Diverse menu.  Always fresh and delicious. The booth we sat in was uncomfortable.  It rocked every time the diners in the next booth moved.  Tried the veggie lasagna for the first time and I'll order it again.  The desserts are definitely \"for two\" but are worth trying."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now and haven't been disappointed yet. The food is creative and delicious. Only complaint was one of the waitresses was wearing Steelers gear the day the Browns played them. She should know better :)  Make sure to save room for their dessert!"}
{"text":"excellent service and food!!  server was great.  food was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Café Melissa has a wide variety of food options, I have tried a lot of things on the menu and have not been disappointed! This location is pretty much identical to the Rocky River location far as the menu goes although the actual restaurant is a little smaller and does not have as many dessert options.   Brunch is one of the best things to come for especially since Avon Lake does not have that many options for unique, delicious brunch. They have a lot of interesting menu options and everything comes with a little scone and fruit, yum! Try anything with the potatoes...they are so so good!"}
{"text":"The environment and atmosphere are great...very \"beachy\" and light. It really feels like you're in a waterfront cottage, which is great. I've only been there for breakfast, so my opinions about the food are limited to that. And the food is generally just OK. Definitely overpriced for the quality. The bacon is way over cooked and too crispy- it literally just crumbled in my mouth. The omelettes were nothing to write home about. They were fine, but at the prices there I expected better. The kids had pancakes which were very good. But at the end of the day I don't know that we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its cover. It doesn't look all posh, but the food was amazing. I had the chicken carbonara and would definitely have it again. Most in our party had the lobster bisque as well. It wasn't as good as Salmon Dave's, but I would have it again.  Also had Dave Matthew's Crush wine. Yum! Good selection of wines you don't often see elsewhere. Good prices.  Another of my friends had the veggie lasagna and said it was wonderful. Another had the Panko crusted tofu and loved that as well, but she found the curry too spicy and had it on the side. I don't think there is a dish that would steer you wrong. Salads were amazing as well. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in cafe Melissa's. The soup was very heavy and my meal (shrimp tacos) left me craving flavor. And, at a cost that was not justified by the product."}
{"text":"I'm going to be straight up honest, I've been here when everything was spot on, and I've been here when my dining experience was \"meh\".  I come here though for one thing, that is consistently amazing - their fried green tomatoes.  Sweet Jesus, my Sicilian soul instantly turns southern when I eat these!  Perfection every time.  Food combinations are for the most part flavorful and portions are substantial.  Service has always been great.  Cute atmosphere.  I also love their kids menu.  Has recently gotten a bit more expensive, but there are a ton of cute dinner choices!"}
{"text":"First time here with good friends.  Everyone liked their entree, turkey burger, chicken salad sandwich and crab cake salad.  Then we all had dessert, also excellent.  Service was great - we definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good- I like it very much even though the menu is a little pretentious and not always accurate. They call omelets 'folded eggs' and toast 'mini scone'. I have been here four times now and each time my husband says he will never come back because the service and wait time from the moment you need seated to getting the check is stupid long. I dont think I will be able to convince him to try it a fifth time despite the good eats."}
{"text":"Attempted to head here for Brunch on a Sunday. Walked in waited a few minutes, party of 8 was told 15-20 minutes, they left. They sat an older couple of 2. Then us, party of 3. 30 minutes, with open tables around the place and no one else waiting. We left. Not exactly sure the reasoning. Just moved to the area and unfortunately will not be making this part of our dining options."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! Food was absolutely delicious and the service was awesome!   The food is so fresh and well complimented:) My friend and I went in for a Saturday morning brunch and the menu was inclusive without being too lengthy. We also had mimosas which were delicious--and had a great mix of juice to alcohol."}
{"text":"Met some friends at Cafe Melissa back in January for Lunch. Great place to grab a bite to eat. Sandwiches are really good and fries are awesome. Not a big place so seating is tight."}
{"text":"Awesome food in a great neighborhood. Fresh , farm to table with nice menu options. Salads are excellent, light and tasty. It was so good I went back the next day for the same lunch salad."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious:  blackened cod with risotto and spinach, perfectly done, pistachio encrusted grouper with side of butternut squash, deliciously seasoned, and chicken carbonara did not disappoint. Chefs Chris and Abei made themselves available, and we found them personable and so passionate about cooking special menu items.  Stephanie, our server, was enthusiastic, efficient and engaging. Only disappointment was the 3 cupcakes which were pretty but dry. Will definitely return and & highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant rolls, incredible. The noodles tasted homemade. My husband had omelet with chorizo it was also very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh food and service is great. Nice presentation of dishes. Portion are generous. Recommend meatloaf, grilled cheese, eggplant parmeasean and gnocci."}
{"text":"I went to Cafe Melissa last night with 3 friends. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. Fortunately, we got the last available table and was seated immediately. Our friendly waitress stopped by and took our drink orders and another server stopped by with a bottle of water and water-filled glasses.   Our waitress went over the specials (which sounded very good) and then gave us time to chit-chat while we made our decisions. I ordered the pretzel-encrusted Red Snapper special. It was served over redskin potates and spinach in a nice, light, lemon-butter sauce and was delicious. It had three nice-sized shrimp on top of the snapper as well which was a nice surprise. The sauce was light - which is the way I like it. Otherwise it can be overbearing and take away from the natural flavors of the food.The food was nice and hot and I definitely plan on coming back to try some more menu items.   My friends were all very happy with their meals - Portuguese stew - Steak - Gnocci. The salads were fresh, if a bit pricey, but that's pretty much par for the course these days.   One interesting note: their use of technology in ordering and paying for the bill (with credit cards) is innovative and probably shows the way of things to come.  All-in-all an excellent meal and a relaxed Saturday night out with friends."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast! It is packed Sunday mornings, I suggest coming late morning or early afternoons. The amount of food will hold you over most of the day. The service was excellent as well. A must try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"This new neighborhood joint -- an offshoot of Rocky River's Sweet Melissa -- has the same delicious food, and they've made the most out of a small, shuttered former Donato's Pizza.  Sure it's small, but it's nicely done.  The menu is pretty limited but ingredients seem fresh, and everything we've had has been delicious.  The menus is seasonal, so the server told us what we might want to order \"before it's gone\" -- nice touch."}
{"text":"I won't make this long and drawn out-we frequent sweet Melissa's very often and food is always consistent, fresh and service always attentive and quick. Cafe melissa on the other hand, I have been here twice and ordered the same salad-salmon salad which I love. The first time and the way it's supposed to be had a nice crunchy jicama slaw on top-this time had red bell peppers which were wilted along with the jicama wilted on top-I honestly thought it was cheese at first because of the texture! My daughter had chocolate chip pancakes for brunch and we love sweet m's pancakes-the texture was off on hers and felt almost hour old and not fresh. Super disappointed. Service at cafe melissa was the same slow service we had before and the same waiter. We were checked on once, never asked for our waters to be refilled and we were siting outside in the hot sun, I finally asked when they came back and it then took 15 minutes to return with no water but my check and then I was asked if I wanted water!?!? Service needs to be on point which it isn't and my friends who prefer to go to sweet Melissa's instead have told me the downfalls of cafe's food being inconsistent along with service but we were in the area and I wanted the salad I love-which I didn't love at this visit. Work on service-it was dead in there and it shouldn't matter dead or busy be consistent! Food needs to be exactly the same every time you order it. And another side note, in order dressing on the side and as I'm drizzling it on with my fork I have chickpeas and random food floating in the dressing container...Uggg sloppy details people!"}
{"text":"Great from beginning to end. Service and food were excellent. I'm not sure about all the reviews that compare this location to the Rocky River location, stated that Rocky River is better. Not sure how much better you can get beyond perfect!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy place (no more than 20 tables) serving similar food to Sweet Melissa in Rocky River--high quality diner food.  One thing I didn't see on the menu that I really liked from Sweet Melissa (though I see it taken off their online menu as well) are the whole red baby potatoes served as a side with the meatloaf entree.  And while Cafe Melissa has a small case with a couple of cakes and cupcakes for dessert, it didn't have the enormous cakes of its much larger, parent location.  The meatloaf sandwich was very good and the spice from the siracha added a little kick that was simultaneously mellowed out by the fried egg and cheese.  It is very filling: I ended up taking a nap after getting home.  The Reuben with turkey substituted for corned beef was not as well received, with the turkey coming out overcooked and dry.  This might be a warning for other diners to stay on script."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried so far is delicious! Great atmosphere inside, and convenient for carry out as well."}
{"text":"I found this place just okay. The fried avocados, and fried green tomatoes were just good, nothing outstanding. The fried brussel  sprouts were by far the best part of the meal. Outstanding. I had the blackened fish tacos and was disappointed, the fish was not cooked in the middle and way to many bell peppers. I may try something different next time I go. Just to give it a fair shake."}
{"text":"Delightful and charming place with friendly staff and delicious, inventive offerings. Their Butternut Squash salad is a must. One of the best places to eat on west side!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  Place was not very busy, but got busier during our meal.  Service was good...although there were a couple lulls where we were waiting for the server to come back to our table, she did a good job of keeping our drinks re-filled.  The food was decent, although my corned beef hash was not prepared the same way as when I had it at another location (on the east side).  The scone and fresh fruit served to us before our meal was a nice touch, too.  Considering the lack of quality breakfast spots in the area, I imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"Back again for the meatloaf lunch sandwich. Still very flavorful, with a little heat. Also ordered the buffalo chicken flat bread for an appetizer. Very good, and the blue cheese is not over powering; it was a nice balance with the other ingredients given. Will be back again, since there is a lot I have not tried yet. Plus, their service has always been great!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant as much as my friends do. Staff is wonderful and ingredients are fresh. The menu is very diverse. It is like comfort food with a twist. I sometimes feel like I am a judge on chopped and there is always one strange food item that does not belong. Had crab cakes and eggs for brunch recently, fried green tomatoes were just wierd. The chicken pasta with bacon and peas was a winner. I have been here about 10 times and the food is underwhelming. Well that chicken above was awesome. I will continue to go here with my ladies but not my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Don't judge a book by its cover because the food is great! We had a group of 10 and everyone loved their meal! But heads up, if you get the Ruben, it is HUGE! You are definitely going to be taking home some leftovers. I got the chicken carbonara, and it was really good! I would definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went here a month after they opened on a saturday night. they were full but we were ready to wait. So the family stood at doorway for 5-7 minutes as wait staff passed us by and said nothing. We did not know if we were to wait for a table to open up or if there was a hostess to seat us. And as I tried yo get someone attention they just ignored us. Needless to say no one said anything to us so we left and will never return. Too many other good restaurants on the west side to waste your time here."}
{"text":"It was good, I got the fajita wrap.  One daughter got the burger and the other a chicken  wrap.  Good food will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is nice. I am normally am a meat guy but their baked eggplant is really good. My wife enjoys the NY Strip. Had the fried green tomatos are really good and the wedge salad is tasty and fresh as well."}
{"text":"A small place but decor is nice. Everything I've eaten there is really good and they were super friendly to our kids which was nice for a change! They have a great priced kids menu but everything else is a bit too high for what they are offering...I'd go there more often if they lowered the prices a bit. We've even stopped by their for just their desserts given the reputation of the their sister restaurant but I was disappointed...the cupcakes had been their for a while..had that stale taste. We'll go back but I wish they'd make a few adjustments because it has huge potential!"}
{"text":"I previously had been to Sweet Melissa in Rocky River and figured this would be very similar.  It does have a similar feel, but the menu is very limited.  The restaurant used to be an old Donato's Pizza, so the restaurant has a very casual feel, probably best for a brunch or lunch.  My meal was good, but not nearly as good as Sweet Melissa."}
{"text":"Dirty, disorganized, and undercooked food. Wow was this a horrible experience.  While it's entirely possible that there were  staffing issues, the seating and bussing of tables was by  waitress rotation so people just stood at the door for ten minutes in confusion as tables were being attended too.  Most annoying was the manager who was expediting but wasn't busy. Instead of helping her staff, she just watched and bs'd with employees.   Had the manager helped bus tables and clean in between settings, it might have worked. Instead, the waiters and waitresses openly argued in front of customers about unclean sections.  Lastly we ordered two omelets that, while coming quickly, were under done and oozing with uncooked egg and unbalanced contents. Potatoes and bread were good but prefer not to have to step on them under the table from the previous occupants.   Have had some good meals here in the past...clearly just a leadership issue"}
{"text":"I loved the vibe of this place! It was a cozy cafe, with ALCOHOL! I ordered the Fried Brussels Sprouts which were phenomenal!! They were crispy, sweet and a little spicy all in one! I ate just the appetizer as my meal and I left satisfied. I can't wait to go back again and get more!"}
{"text":"Super good ... Super service!!  I highly recommend eating here!!!   Jeff had the Grouper with squash and I had a Vegetable Salad!!   Jeff had delicious Calamari, but I would'nt know!"}
{"text":"I have frequented Sweet Melissa in River quite a few times, and was sooooo excited to find out a second location exists in Avon Lake! It's barely noticeable off the side of a major road, but I am so happy we stumbled in one Saturday morning for brunch!   I love, LOVE, love a good brunch. Cafe Melissa hit the spot. My omelette was incredible! The sauce they put on the breakfast potatoes was so delicious as well. All brunches are served wish fresh fruit and a petite chocolate scone. I wish that scone would have been bigger cause that thing was so good! Similar menu to the River location, but a much more quiet ambiance. Service was good, food was delicious and SO fresh; all in all a really great local brunch spot! If you're on the west side and you want a more quaint brunch spot than somewhere at Crocker, I highly recommend this cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"I've had some delicious breakfasts here.  The hours are limited, and the menu for breakfast is a little small.  I don't always feel like I'm getting enough for the price. The last time I ordered the chorizo sausage gravy breakfast ... there wasn't a lick of actual sausage, and the bowl had about 3x the amount of sausage gravy necessary for the biscuit that was tucked underneath.  Nevertheless, the flavors are great - I always enjoy their take on breakfast.  While I'm giving them 3* overall, if I were to grade on taste only, it'd be between 4 and 5*."}
{"text":"Had a great takeout experience here - food was prepared quickly, friendly pick up service, and the meals tasted great! Their desserts looked amazing, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here while traveling in the area and had a nice lunch. Cute little restaurant with great service! We had the fried green tomatoes, crab cake, and ruben. All good, properly seasoned, garnished, and a nice effort with the plating. The crab cake tastes as it should with a red pepper bite and was served with avocado which was a nice touch. After we finished our appetizer, our entrees were promptly served and it seemed like the staff was really paying attention. We weren't planning on having drinks, but the happy hour deals were too good to pass up. This place was a cute date spot, yet at the same time there were families enjoying time with their kids which was also nice to see!"}
{"text":"Fantastic every single time. The consistency of the good quality is fantastic every single time. The service has always been good even when its busy! The servers ans the managers as well are always very attentive and the atmosphere is always really relaxing. The menu changes are seasonal it alwsys have good options as well. Not to mention the desserts they make are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is to die for, highly recommend the Grouper and the Reuben, my favorites. Welcoming and attentive service, the cute manager stop by and was very charming. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Brunch on Saturday & Sundays is a no brainer.  Tonight I went for a soup and salad. The warm goat cheese salad with chicken was AMAZING! I've never had anything like it! Service is great! Food comes out quick! The Matzo Ball soup is my fav."}
{"text":"This cafe has a wonderful, frequently-refreshed menu with a wide variety of entrees that will satisfy any pallet and a beer selection that will please even a beer snob. The brunch here is best in The county and easily matches up with the best spots in Tremont.  Today we arrived for brunch and tried the corned beef hash for the first time. Having snacked earlier In the morning, my wife and I chose to split the meal. The kitchen separated everything for us and provided a beautiful presentation on our plates.  The food was delicious and refined, with the corned beef seasoned well (but not overly so) and complemented with diced peppers. The eggs were topped with a subtle hollandaise sauce and accompanied with a slice of rye toast, reminding me of a common lunch sandwich pairing I love from Sliman's in Cleveland. Prior to the entree being served, we were presented with a small plate of fruit and a mini-scone.  Service was awesome. Lisa was very attentive and kept the coffee flowing.  When the kitchen was a bit slow with a kid's order of pancakes, she kept us informed and reassured us she was on the ball.  The kitchen is visible from the dining area and it appears well run. The guys were quick and efficient.  Others at our table were equally impressed with their meals. My sister in law proclaimed the waffles the best she's ever had. Not sure what makes waffles great but she loved them. The omelette was also complimented by our friend.   Great job overall!  Keep up the perfection. For those so inclined, they also serve mimosas and bloody Mary's for brunch. I don't often hand out five stars but this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, good food, and great service. Love this place. Also enjoy their rocky river location as well. It's bigger and also close to home."}
{"text":"Melissa's does a good job with a wide variety foods. The atmosphere is pleasant, cheerful, and bright, and the staff anxious to please. Nothing quite like it in Lorain Co. Open at convenient hours and offers vegetarian and even vegan options. Hard to avoid desserts- they are beautiful, as are all the presentations. As the Italians say, \"The eyes must have their part in the meal\"."}
{"text":"Do not get the chicken pot pie, wife got it this evening and for $13 not worth the money.  Very small dish with a little chicken and dough on top.  We go to Cafe Melissa quite often and usually happy with the meals offered."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! The facility definitely has great vibe and I love the decor/concept.  I've been here several different times and one thing that definitely stands out is the fried brussel sprouts. I am not a fan of brussel sprouts but a friend of my ordered them the last time I was there and they are delicious! I will be trying this place out again in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Delicious homemade soups... especially the tomato bisque.  Salads are very fresh and my husband loves the porkchops.  It was greatly needed in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"The food is prepared fresh and there are so many selections for everyone, including if you have any dietary restrictions.  The staff are very nice and accommodating.   I've recommended this restaurant to many friends and colleagues. The only disappointment comes with the sterile atmosphere.  It NEEDS warmth and different decor. We need more independent restaurants like this in Avon Lake and Avon."}
{"text":"I love Melissa. My husband loves Melissa. Even my kids love Melissa. The restaurant itself is a little odd (former pizza restaurant or something), but it's always very clean. Staff is always nice and food is quick. They have amazing specials, but everything down to the cheeseburger is outstanding. Matzo ball soup is wonderful, as is the Italian hoagie. Oh, and the risotto bowl is great too. You get the picture. Try it out."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch, lunch or dinner!   Recently, I was craving a chop salad and searched for where around me had one to offer. Salads are tough to-go orders for many places. But I took a chance. I ordered the chop entree size salad. Wow!! Talk about hitting your craving. This was a delightful salad. So many things in it- grapes, chick peas, green beans, feta, pecans, tomatos..to name a few. But with the dressing, it came together in a delightful flavor punch. Can't even write about it without wanting to order it again!!   My husband and I also enjoyed brunch a few weeks ago. We had checked out the menu online and were hyped for the crab cake- only told me told they were out. We chose two other dishes and really enjoyed the spread. The flavors were good but the omelette didn't feel cohesive. My husband said 'I feel like each component was cooked separately and then put on top of the already cooked egg.'  Not to worry though-- these were solid dishes and we will definitely be back for (hopefully with crab cake) brunch again! Coffee service was spot on with size and frequency. Nice touch adding a scone to each dish.  They have a diverse menu, service is good and they really care about the food they are making. You can't go wrong in dining (or even to-go) from this spot."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to cafe Melissa and I was very impressed...My server Norah was very helpful in helping me find the perfect meal. I will definitely be recommending cafe Melissa to all my friends!!"}
{"text":"First time here after driving by it for a year and I will say i really wish I would've stopped by sooner . The staff are so friendly . The menu is outstanding from the selection to the ingredients . Whether you're a vegan or gluten diet they cater to all . I can't wait to try more of the menu items !"}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a dozen times, and we've tried most of the menu. The staff is always friendly, and the food is consistenty well-prepared. We've even done carryout and used the drivethrough to pick it up, which is convenient, but it feels odd receiving nice meals out of a window. I LOVE their seafood stew and fried brussel sprouts!"}
{"text":"Fair warning, in any other location I would be giving Cafe Melissa a four star review, but because they are located in Lorain--a definite quality food desert, I'm going with a five star review. Location -does- matter.   Cafe Melissa is a cute, unassuming looking place off the side of a busy road and somewhat in a shopping mall. Inside though, it is really well decorated and a pretty, calm, and fun place to be. The service has always been good, the food has always been yummy, and the beer specials are super cool. (They have a selection of $2 beers all the time--awesome!)  My one real beef with this place is that it is an a la carte style menu, which I generally hate. Unlike most places that use it though, I really think that at Cafe Melissa you are getting what you pay for. Yeah, it can sometimes feel like you're overpaying by a couple bucks, but then you eat your food and you decide you're okay with it.  Over the times that I've been here I've probably sampled about 40% of the menu because I'm generally always there with family and I try everything on the table. I love the fried green tomatoes and the goat cheese gnocchi. The stuffed artichoke hearts are a great idea but the filling needs a bit more 'punch' to it. The Portuguese stew is very yummy and exceedingly generous in its portions of fish. The steak on top of mashed potatoes are -amazing-. And the garlicky spinach is basically manna from heaven.   The only thing I really dislike about this place is that the booths are done with a completely straight back. If you have any back or shoulder issues at all, it will be torture to sit in one of those. I have no idea why anyone would put that kind of booth in--it might look ascetically pleasing, but it's physical torture."}
{"text":"So happy to have Cafe Melissa in town! Always a great spot for friendly, consistent and nicely-priced options. For me, the take-out window is perfect for taking home dinner after work or to supplement food for parties. The chop salad and chips and dip and mainstays for me to accompany a main dish."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up and while the food was ready quickly, it was underwhelming plus we also got a wrong entree which we didn't realize until we got back home. The food was not all that hot anymore and was just not what I expected. I have dined in at Cafe Melissa many times as well as Sweet Melissa and enjoyed my experiences with great food and drinks. This experience with carry out food made me feel like the food quality has gone down hill a little bit. Maybe it's because it was carry out but slightly cold food and a wrong entree was not the best for a night in. I'm sure we will try dining in again one day but this time was not so satisfying."}
{"text":"My mother and I stopped into Cafe Melissa today for a quick lunch while running errands in the area. Our server, Lisa, was outstanding. She was so accommodating, attentive, friendly, and sweet. I had the blackened shrimp salad. The shrimp were cooked perfectly; they and the dressing both had a nice spicy kick. The flavors in the salad were vibrant and although it was pricy for a salad, it was satisfyingly filling.   I also ordered a coffee...the mug was as big as my head! I hadn't had my daily coffee yet, so its arrival was like seeing an angel float down from heaven. Lisa was even kind enough to send me off with a cup for the road. My experience today was great. I would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"Went there before and had a delicious salad. I was looking forward to trying some of their sandwiches and entrees--big mistake.  I ordered the steak tacos.  They were way too spicy. I have had tacos in Mexico and the southwest that were less spicy.  The sauce overpowered the steak and vegetables on the taco, all you could taste was your mouth on fire. My daughter ordered the chicken risotto. That was way too sweet ironically--more like a brown sugar oatmeal or bread pudding than a chicken risotto.  Not something you want for your main dish. Neither of us wanted to finish our meal. I did take apart my taco and put the steak in with the risotto to try to cut the sweetness/spice. It helped, but was not great or worth finishing the meal. My other daughter got a buffalo chicken wrap and said it was good, but nothing special. So disappointed. This was our last meal together before my daughter had to leave town for 3 months, and I was hoping to take her to a nice lunch place. This was not it. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My first time here, the staff comes by and sprays and wipes down the table.  Awesome, oh wait towel was dirty and now the table is sticky. Good try  Ordered hot tea, water was warm and oops no tea bags.  Service was slow With that being said FOOD WAS AWESOME  One person bathroom ok Six in our party and tip was automatically added, please leave that to me, or are you afraid your service is such your people will not get paid? Best time to go when their slow Frank Sturbleng"}
