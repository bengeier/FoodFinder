{"text":"We had a group of 8 for Friday night.  Showed up early and our table was ready for us.  Jenny H did a wonderful job of going over the variety of choices on the menu and sharing some of her favs.  She and the team provided outstanding service throughout our meal.  Lots of variety on the menu, we all enjoyed our pics.  The portion sizes were pretty big and tasteful.  Thanks Jenny for wrapping up our to-go stuff!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fantastic atypical Mexican food made with fresh ingredients and incredible flavor. My favorites are the stacked enchiladas and the chimichilada with mushroom enchilada and amaretto cream sauce. They do great steaks and their in-house salsa is absolutely the best! Staff is fantastic and they have live music a couple nights per week. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We arrived on 2-17-18 about 4pm for an early dinner. There were about 4 tables with diners. We waited for quite a while waiting to be seated. We were finally able to get the attention of a young woman at the bar who had seen us walk in. She seated us and brought drinks. That's the last time we had contact with an employee. A waiter walked by several times by we could not get his attention. We waited for approximately 30 minutes and finally decided to leave."}
