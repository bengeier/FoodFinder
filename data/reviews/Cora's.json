{"text":"I am a regular customer of Coras. I absolutely love that location. People are friendly, fun to talk to and they serve fresh orange juice. Not only that, the portions are huge.   Their salmon Benedict is just astounding. There's nothing much I can complain about the place. Oh! And the bottomless coffee.. MM mmm"}
{"text":"I could say I'm a regular at this location. Food is fresh, service is usually fast, the place gets packed rly fast on weekends. I definitely recommend the egg Benedict's. 2 eggs r usually what I order.  It's absolutely delicious. Best restaurant in the loblawz plaza."}
{"text":"Cora is for people who want to get quantity and NOT quality food.  The coffee taste horrible, if I can describe it I would say it tasted like stale plastic. I even asked the waiter to changed it and the second cup tasted the same.  I cannot same much for the food either, I had a couple of eggs and it tasted like slough, prison food (from what I imagine prison food would taste like).   The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Went there few times with a friend. Of was amazing, food is very delicious and menu is huge. Prices are expansive but it's ok if you want to treat yourself once in a while. The commute there is not very convenient. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be the weekend without Cora's.  The food is always excellent and the staff are welcoming and efficient.  The tough part is deciding whether to go savory or sweet.  The loaded potatoes and fresh fruit are the perfect accompaniment."}
{"text":"Guy was very rude on the phone when trying to hold a table for 10min with a newborn. Told me to go elsewhere so we did!"}
{"text":"We use to go to this location for several year, I love their food and warm service which feel like friends. Price r reasonable with quality food. Will keep going."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the eggs here, everything else was OK."}
{"text":"I recently came to this Cora's with a friend of mine and we received excellent service. The host and waitress (Jordan and Deepa) were really nice and efficient. We got a seat and had our food ordered quickly and the two of them made sure we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal. The food was really good and filling and it was cool seeing my friend Juliana and the other cooks making and preparing our food in the kitchen. Overall great experience and I would come again."}
{"text":"Had Eggs Benedict. They were miniscule! And cold....did I mention that they were cold?! Very overpriced and I am really surprised that they have lasted!"}
{"text":"A disappointing dining experience. Typically I enjoy a Cora's breakfast, but today I dined here for the last time. Our coffee was never refilled, our breakfasts were mediocre with bread that wasn't toasted, medium poached eggs that were actually hard poached and burnt potatoes. Not once were we asked how our meal was when we were eating, but that would have required our waitress to return to our table.  When we complained at the register, our waitress told us she was busy. No attempt of an apology. So many better places to eat breakfast!"}
{"text":"Cost: Expensive Quality: 70% Decor: Average to nice, family friendly Staff: Very friendly, good service - 85% Value: 60%  Why do I keep going back? Just for the kids, definitely not the rubbery crepes, I would rather grab one and run from Crepe de Licious."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place around! Nicest staff, fairly quick service. The ONE time my order was slightly wrong they took it back and came back with a completely fresh plate made to my liking just minutes later. If you visit often they make an effort to create a relationship with you, remembering what you like to drink and bringing it while you decide your food order. Food is delicious and always good plate presentation. Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I heard of places cheaping out on stuff but this place went a bit too far. Watered down syrup for the pancake?"}
{"text":"Having never been to a Cora's before, it was a pleasant surprise.  I found the service and presentation of food superb. The food was good as far as breakfast can be.  The quality of fruit is what I found differentiated it from the other 'breakfast joints'.   On my short visit to Calgary, I found myself wanting to go back for another try. If you have never been before, give it a try."}
{"text":"Worst Coras you can possibly go to. This franchise changed management last year and have to say since the change it is absolutely brutal service.  I won't get into line up cause lining up is part of the package with Coras. But the service at this location is absolutely brutal. Expect to wait 30-45 mins for just the food. When I told their manager the bad experience, I might as well have spoken to a brick wall.  They obviously receive a lot of complaints and don't really care.    At this location expect to pay Coras $$$ and receive Soup Nazi service"}
{"text":"The Egg Benedicts there, it is one of the favorites.  I like the presentation and each plate comes with a lot of fruits.  It is good to have something different at lunch."}
{"text":"This is the best Cora's in the GTA with impecable service and very consistant food. Most Cora's I feel seem to not have enough staff working and feel very disorganized. Anyways I highly recommend and I personally eat there every week."}
{"text":"Downtown Calgary is a tough place to find a good spot to eat - so thank God for Cora's. You can escape, grab a very reasonably priced meal. Good service. Great food. Halelujah!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Cora's in quite a while, and was excited they had opened a location downtown.  I met up with 3 friends for lunch, and we were seated right away. Drink and food orders were taken promptly - and our server was able to answer any questions we had about the menu which was great.  I ordered the mushroom and baked brie eggs benny and it came out with a huge serving of fruit - super delish.  Since I'm downtown for work, I will most likely be back since the service and food were great"}
{"text":"The service has always been great.  Sometimes I find the fruit is not always the ripest, but I'm happy to have it. I generally eat the Penelope which is a vegetarian option and I've enjoyed it every time. Hash browns are always consistent but could be crispier."}
{"text":"I really wish they had an IHOP in Calgary...Cora's is not bad, if you love fruit.  My crepes were a tad bland but I did get them quickly. If you like crepes, I suggest you check out Melrose for their brunch."}
{"text":"I met a friend from college at Cora's the other day after hearing so much praise for it and was not disappointed.   My friend and I agreed that the decor felt like a kindergarten classroom, but in the best way possible. The service was efficient and made the perfect amount of trips to check on us. Score 1 for Cora's.   I got a Benny and was advised by my friend that the highlight of Cora's is all the fruit that come with the meals. Now, I'm not usually a big fan of fruit at the best of times but the server also let me know that I could get a hazelnut-chocolate dip for my fruit. Essentially, I ended up having a chocolate fondue for breakfast. At most places I normally I devour my potatoes and Benny and push an orange wedge around my plate but I can't even remember what this Benny tasted like. I was too busy enjoying my huge serving of fruit. Well-presented and fresh. Beautiful.   Consider me converted."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a restaurant. The paint is peeling off the walls. Needs a renovation. There was a beetle on the table that I sat at. The knife had food on it. My paper mat that all my food went on had food stuck to it. My fruit looked rotted, and the watermelon slice I was served looked like a piece of uncooked meat, it flopped everywhere and was soft beyond imagining. I order a strawberry banana smoothie, and the half strawberry that came with it was wrinkled and shrivelled. I ordered the burrito, and the sour cream that came with it was hard. Best part about the meal was the half orange that came with the smoothie, and the burrito. Never going back again. Every year this place gets worse"}
{"text":"Our group meets every Tuesday morning. Breakfast use to come cold and slow. I politely spoke to the server and explain the problem to her. For the last month our 10 to 14 breakfasts are fresh, being served on warm plates with hot coffee. Thanks for the good service."}
{"text":"This location is the best I've been to. The portions are large and the service is personable. I've been here a couple of times, and the taste and quality of food has been pretty consistent. The wait time to be seated isn't as ridiculous as some of the other locations, and there seems to be more elderly people here than small kids.   Tip: Take note when your waiter asks if you want add-ons with your dish (ie. sauteed mushrooms, cottage cheese..etc) because they don't specify it's for an additional cost. When they take your order, they ALWAYS ask you if you want add-ons. I was stupid to assume it was included in the price of my meal."}
{"text":"The service is horrible.  Server is no where to be found.  Eggs were partial raw.  Very underwhelming.   Disappointed in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Cora's in downtown Calgary is always packed. But don't let the long line-up fool you -- the staff here are adept at turning over tables. You'll get in, if you're patient.  And when you do get in, your breakfast choices are vast and varied. I've been to Cora's in Toronto before, and I was glad to see it's got locations in Alberta now. While Cora's probably won't knock your socks off, you're guaranteed a meal that definitely beats Denny's or IHOP.  If you get hashbrowns, definitely have them put cheese on it. Makes a good dish great!"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend for some brunch ~  The food was pretty much the same as any other Cora's. What disappointed me was probably the sausages. Taste like crap. Honestly, doesn't even taste like English sausage,regular sausage or any type of sausage. It taste like uncooked disgusting plastic meat that was artificially made somehow... Not to mention COLD.   The rye toast was delicious though, it was definetly fresh and was so hot and just delicious. The cafe latte was so-so, not something I will be getting again for pretty much $5.   The service was efficient even when they were on lunch break.   - price is on the expensive side, I paid $37 for 2breakfast combos and a drink.  Overall I will probably be back if I have no idea on what to eat for brunch."}
{"text":"I do like this place for breakfast. All Cora locations are good. Portions are huge here. I like the pancakes, french toast and the Cora's big breakfast. Line ups can get big on weekend mornings so I try to arrive early or late. Service is usually pretty good but can slow down during really busy times. Prices are slightly above average but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The breakfast selection is abundant and the choices all look good. If you don't want the typical bacon and eggs they have a healthy selection of choices with fruit. Service is excellent with a free refilling of coffee.  Be prepared for long line ups on weekends."}
{"text":"The only advantage of this place are the low prices. The food is way below acceptable average. Honestly, I would prefer to cook myself than to return to this place. Potatoes were not fresh tasted as if they were reheated in a microwave. My muffin was poor quality."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Wife and I come here at least every weekend.  Service is outstanding and the food is consistently yummy.  The owner usually remembers us and even the staff recognizes us.  Maybe we go here too often.  Naaaa......"}
{"text":"Great and welcoming service when we walked in. It was amazing their portions are generous."}
{"text":"I just came back from eating there .... it's okay my bf got 3 eggs came with 1. The maple syrup is so watered down because some was on my hand and it wasn't even sticky LOLL.... there food expensive and not worth it. I would rather go up street to 3 coins. Cheaper and bigger plate. Also ya coras has a lot of options but like I said $15 would get u breakfast for 1"}
{"text":"I LOVE CORA'S!! I started going here when they opened the own down south, as I lived down there. Being a new breaky place, it's always busy, but so worth it!  I had never gone to this location, but being the weekend, I figured it should be less busy than the other locations, and sure enough...no line! It was busy, but not packed and no line, so that made us very happy, especially my hubs who wasn't feeling stellar that day.   I found out they serve buckwheat (which is actually gluten free, even though it has wheat in the name) crepes. So I was ecstatic. I had the stuffed buckwheat crepes, which were delicious, and the fresh fruit, which is the main reason why I go here.   The hubs had the Surprise, which he said was good too. And we got the fruit cocktail (as always). It was a perfect Sunday brunch, I will definitely come to this location more on the weekends."}
{"text":"Decided to come here, as we were shopping in the same plaza.  I haven't been to a Coras for over 10 years because service is crappy, food is overpriced and not particuarly good.  When we walked into this location, these bad memories came flooding back.  There was a large group of people waiting to be seated, all crammed into the front entrance.  Nobody acknowledged us for at least 5 minutes.  A lady came over and just asked, who ordered take out?.  Really, you see a bunch of people at the door and just ignore them?  If I wasn't with my daughter, I would've just walked out.     Eventually, we get seated.  We wait another 5 minutes to see our server.  In the meantime, it gave us a chance to choose from the menu.  I was eyeing the lunch menu, but then got told that they DO NOT serve the lunch menu, on weekends.  Why did you leave the lunch menu insert in? I'm here on a Sunday, you should've not handed it out yesterday.  Or are you hoping that I would return here again for the same crappy experience on a weekday?!   Our food actually came in a timely manor today.  It was your average breakfast foods.  I wouldn't really recommend coming here and I doubt I'll return.  Unless I get amnesia and forget about all my bad experiences, at this chain."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast.  Food was prepared with care and lots of healthy options.  We will be back for sure.  It was fairly priced."}
{"text":"Had the nicest waitress who was very patient and generous and had brightly colored hair (green and blue if I remember correctly). The menu is huge and all the dishes have fun, creative names. They've got all the standards: eggs benedict, waffles, etc. Had the French toast with bacon and potatoes plus a kale smoothie. The food is fresh and delicious (but could have gone for more French toast than potatoes). The large restaurant was very busy for Sunday brunch with families and groups of friends. Will definitely return for brunch again!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about it but timings are weird.  Either keep it consistent or stay out of business, Never really got the experience, cuz when it's open it's too crowded."}
{"text":"Cora is one of the few franchises in the city I will eat at. It is fresh, lots of fruit, acceptable coffee, and great presentation. The owner of this location (they also own 130th/Shepard) are a husband and wife team and are very nice people who treat their staff well.   Sat/Sun expect an hour line. It is worth it though!"}
{"text":"Lovely place for breakfast/brunch! They've got quite the variety from super healthy to hearty and comforting. Been here with friends and family on multiple occasions and every time it's been fantastic. The service is magnificent as well."}
{"text":"I recently went for brunch with my friend and our 3 small children.  It took them a while to get us seated even though they were not busy.  As soon as we sat down we are accounted by our waitress who demanded to know what our drink orders were.  We had barely gotten the kids in their highchairs.  My friend asked for waters and I asked for a few mins and she literally rolled her eyes and pointed out that our little ones had water bottles so was it necessary to get us all water.  The food took a long time to come out and when it did it was disappointing.  We got literally one slice of Orange on our plate as fruit.  The only good part of the breakfast were the home fries.  The highlight of our meal was when our waitress exclaimed loudly that she couldn't believe the table behind us had not tipped and that she had worked so hard for nothing.  She was complaining and using language not appropriate for small children to be hearing.  Over all food was lacklustre and customer service was terrible save your money."}
{"text":"OK, relax people. Seeing as Cora's is new to the West, I understand the excitement, but you will soon learn Cora's is good-- not great.  Cora's originated in Quebec and has a lot of locations throughout La Belle Province and Eastern Ontario. I'm from the East and have eaten at Cora's many times. Now that there is a Calgary location I had to try it and I can inform you nit much has changed.  The upside to Cora's is the abundance of fruit, crepes, smoothies and other healthy options on the menu. It truly is packed full of fresh items.  Another plus is the different bread options and the family style way the bread/toast is served.  Where the restaurant falls short are the basics-- they tend to be bland. The bacon, the bologna, the sausages, all the meats lack flavour and seasoning. This has always been the case. I find the same with  their omelettes-- they are slightly disappointing.  Beyond that, Cora's has the semi-retro farm motif in all it's establishments.  The Calgary location is still working out the kinks in the service area, but it will soon be a good breakfast/brunch destination in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Okay, I am officially in love with this place. I can't believe as an urban breakfast-obsessed person I've not been there until just recently!  There was a huge line-up, but I am OK with breakfast line-ups for some reason. I think it was, in this case, because the service was so friggin' friendly! The staff was walking up and down the line making sure they had us all noted and the line did go really fast. When we reached the front, another happy server already knew our name and escorted us to a roomy table.   The menu was huge and everything looked incredible. It took the three of us a long time to choose and the servers were very welcoming and attentive during this time. The coffee was hot and refills were never more than a few minutes away.   The food arrived (I got the Cottage Cheese, Fruit and Poached Eggs, my sister got the Spinach Omelet and my mom got some form of Benny) and the food was creatively plated, and served promptly, despite the insane amount of people there. (Granted, it WAS Mother's Day.)   We finished our food, paid (and the bill was not hard to swallow either!) they offered us some free fudge and validated our parking pass and we were off, the three of us in better moods than we entered with!  It's a bit out of the way, but you MUST get to Cora's if you like Breakfast at all."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I feel like the food at Coras is under some of the well known brunch spots in Calgary but I love the atmosphere here. Come here almost every Sunday with my family. We usually have the same waitress and it just feels like we're at home. Really nice staff and food is always comforting. Love the pancakes and the potatoes the best. Rosemary Sunday is always a good bet."}
{"text":"I used to remember Cora's being a pretty good breakfast joint.   I'm not sure whether the quality has gone down, my tastes have changed, or maybe just this location sucks; but, I haven't exactly been wowed the few times I've visited the location in Bow Valley Square.   At noon on a Thursday the restaurant was maybe only 1/3 full. Despite the fact that there weren't people waiting, service felt rushed. On this visit, I had one of the lunch combos which came with cream of bacon soup to start and then quiche and house salad for a main. All the dishes were pretty meh. The highlight of the meal was the day's fruit cocktail which was accompanied by a slice of pineapple and honeydew.  The only thing I can't complain about is the pricing. The soup/main/salad combo was only $9 plus tax. Once combined with a coupon for a free beverage with meal purchase, it was less than $25 including tip for two people to have a full meal with drinks."}
{"text":"Brunch with the fam at Cora's is always sweet.   If I could give this place a 3.5, I would. We came in around 12pm on a Saturday and the place was busy. We had to wait about 10 minutes to get a seat but we were able to look at menus while waiting. The staff was friendly and checked back often and we were served food within 10 minutes of ordering.   We ordered Bluberry Fields, the Western Crepeomelette, and Cora's Special. Bottomless coffee is $2.45 and cappuccino is $3.25.  I had the Western-cheddar Crepomelette ($12.15).  It was pretty good. The serving looked small when it arrived but it was filling. Keep in mind that you get buttered toast (your choice of toast - we ordered whole wheat) and jams on the side and a small fruit arrangement (strawberry, cantaloupe, kiwi, pineapple,  grapes) with the order.  I liked it - the hollandaise sauce on top went really well with the ingredients of the crepe - eggs, onions, ham, peppers.   My brother ordered Blueberry Fields ($10.75) - a stack of four blueberry pancakes with a sweet cream glaze and blueberries on top. It was delicious - not too sweet but definitely packed with blueberries.   Dad ordered Cora's special - 2 eggs (your choice), bacon, ham, sausage and crepe with roasted potatoes and toast, and, of course, some fruit (pineapple,  strawberry,  cantaloupe). For the price, $10.95, it's filling and has good value.   Overall, service and atmosphere is wonderful - a nice comfy place to have conversations over. It's definitely more of a sit-in and take your time type of breakfast restaurant but it opens at 6am (M-Sat: 7am on Sunday, closes 3pm everyday) for those who have a bit more time in the morning before work to grab a well-rounded and filling breakfast. For the food, it's good, about average, nothing extremely amazing with the taste, but the fact most orders come with fruit is a good way to ensure that you're getting a healthy and well-rounded meal."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Wish I got something with eggs though. Next time!"}
{"text":"Cora's a good chain! They deliver what they show on photos and it's tasty too! It didn't take long for food to come. I got the crepe with ham, egg and cheese with a large side of fruits! I'm impressed with the variety, amount and freshness of the fruits! They don't skimp on it. It's a good portion too. My his and got the one like hot dogs. He liked his choice but it felt a bit heavy toward the end of his plate and he felt the taste got a bit boring by the end. It also wasn't as appealing as my dish because his was just brown. His potatoes were good though! I much prefer Cora's than IHOP, which is greasy and I feel ill after eating IHOP."}
{"text":"I was so excited when they opened this location. I had been going to the Unionville location for  almost 6 years. Same owner operator so what could go wrong?  I have been given wrong orders, over cooked crepes, dry overcooked potatoes. they can't make hollandaise - one day it's dark yellow and like paste the next it's yellow and done right. Don't bother getting cheese on your potatoes - they always ask, but never mention that it costs more than the price of the potatoes itself. I've been given regular coffee when ordering decaf (while pregnant), and really slow service. I always ask for no peanut butter brought to the table or included in my take out because my 4 year old has a peanut/nut allergy - but it's always there! The quality is nowhere near the quality as the Unionville location. I have given them so many opportunities to make it right and it hasn't happened. I no longer eat there anymore. Makes me wonder if it's the same owners as before and if it's not - then it's time for a change. Not very kid friendly either with 3 options for kids while the rest of the menu is HUGE! Also not a fan of their lunch menu - which always is made wrong or with something missing. Save your money & eat next door at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I had some truly fantastic dining experiences during a recent week in Calgary and the surrounding area, and Cora's was a comfortable and quaint kickoff. It wasn't the best breakfast I had in the city (that honor went to nearby Vendome Cafe - http://www.yelp.com/biz/vendome-caf%C3%A9-calgary-2), you should pay Cora's a visit if you're in the downtown area.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  This Cora's location (I'm lead to believe it's a popular Canadian chain) is located in the ground floor of an office building, which made for a quiet atmosphere on a Saturday morning. Nonetheless, service was fast and friendly, and you can't ask for much more than that. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  It's a rarity, but I didn't log my specific dish or the price, but it was a carnivore omelette of some sort that included various meats, toast, and potatoes. It was a hearty portion, and the price was under 20 CAD. No complaints. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Good? Yes. Unbelievable? Not quite. The quality was certainly there, and the bacon in particular (which I'm usually not a huge fan of), was truly excellent. Nothing exactly blew me away, but I can't come up with a specific complaint. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  As I've mentioned, there are better breakfast spots in the city, but Cora's is worth it if you're in the area. No Star Granted."}
{"text":"Huge buzz about this place. From its humble beginnings in Montreal to its monstrous lines that circle every location, Cora's has hit the big time with the success this franchise carries and the long lines that ensue, even in the suburbs, I was excited to try Cora's. Sadly, I left disappointed. Something was just missing. There was no charm, no finesse, no umph! You need that umph especially if it's for brunch. Brunch places should have the ability to kick your ass and jump start you towards your day or at least have you look forward to doing a slow nothing. I want my face blown off with great crepes, omelets, and Benedicts that were all present but they didn't live up to the Cora's hype. It was all text book. Crepes were lifeless, omelets were huge but missed the mark on flavor, and the Hollandaise was just.... average! It's not that Cora's wasn't good, it just wasn't great and definitely wasn't worth the insane line.  Staff was nice and worked as quick as they could but you can sometimes see they are rushed, understandably so as there is a huge line out the door with cranky people that have yet to eat all day. This is definitely not a place where you can sit around and talk for a bit after your brunch as a voodoo curse will be dispelled against you to make you move. I look at this place like a slow fast food restaurant. Yeah, the food is fresh, unlike fast food, but you eat and then you get kicked out. No time to enjoy this place, we need those tables or the Italian lady in the mink is gonna beat you with the complimentary fudge by the front door.  Decor is something else. Lots of paint on the walls of awkward cartoon characters and dish names all over. It was like eating in a toddlers room that had free reign with his crayons and only knew how to spell names of brunch dishes. Besides the paint the decor isn't anything memorable. Normal tables, banquettes, and chairs.... is there such a thing as Normal tables, banquettes, and chairs? There is now and you can find them at Cora's.  Overall, brunch here was good. Service was relatively quick, considering the packed house, and food was fresh. I did enjoy how the fruit was cut into shapes but I'm a child at heart. Apple stars are cool no matter where you're from and if you don't like them, tell me and I will help you look for your soul. Food was good and prices were just a tad expensive for what you get but you will leave full as the portions are huge. The wait is dreadful, even in the dead of winter people come here and line up outside. I just don't think it is worth the wait and hassle but being Richmond Hill, your options are slim."}
{"text":"Cora's is a chain I've been going to for a while. The food is good but a little overpriced. There are very many options for savoury, sweet, or mixed meals. The manager went above and beyond to accommodate my lactose intolerance which was kind of her to do. The restaurant decor is cute"}
{"text":"I think I just went on a bad day but wow the service was ridiculous. First the place was crazy busy on a Friday morning and they were definitely not handling things well. We sat down and no one took our order for 15-20 mins. Once we did order... we waited ONE HOUR before we actually got our food... something was wrong in the kitchen cause everyone's orders were delayed. More than 4 groups of people left cause they waited more than an hour to get their food. We went in at 10 for breakfast and ended up eating at 11:15 Or so it felt like brunch! Nonetheless,when we got the food it tasted amazing. The waiters were also nice. The manager of this place needs to appoint staff and not let their employees struggle on busy days!"}
{"text":"The only problems are : Sometimes the fruit is dried out & usually the potatoes aren't crisp, or even browned.  This place is the devil. It lures you in with amazing food and touches your bum as you pay. Great quality. Be careful. Most of it is incredible, well-made, high quality, so delicious, affordable, great service, feed it to save people you love, carry-on sentence, top-notch food."}
{"text":"I tend to go savory for breakfast, but every so often something carb-fully sinful piled high with fruit and whipped cream calls out to me, and I just can't say no.  Easter brunch was one such occasion.  Usually I regret my decision and curse my weak nature about half-way through, but Cora's Raspberry 4 Lucie (Crepe filled with raspberries and cream cheese with raspberry coulis, honey and English cream) had me at hello and never once gave up on me.  It was to die for.  The whole menu is intense, and if you're terrible at choosing between delicious meals, then buyer beware: this might take a while.  Also, everything comes in super double extra large.  I hope you can exhibit more self-control than I did.  Or dine alone and save yourself some embarrassment."}
{"text":"last resort here after my guests passed my first 2 choices. service here just...ok. food pretty good tho and will probably not return. my club sandwich is really good however. fried taters sure good also. yeh..I would return"}
{"text":"This was my last visit to Cora's downtown. A former favorite place, has dropped so low. The service and quality resembles a roadside diner more and more. The staff were amateurs, rude, forgetful and extremely slow. The previously marvelous fruit smoothies tasted like milk powder.  What a pity."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Cora's a lot.  She always orders some healthy wifey type breakfast...I don't know, I'm always too busy shoving my face in the Cora's Special breakfast with a side of baked beans.  The variety of breakfast selection should satisfy a wide range of breakfast goers (crepes, eggs, pancakes, waffles, omelettes, benny, fruits, sweet, savoury)  If you have never been to this place start off with the Banana Strawberry Smoothie. It's good...very good.  I don't always give out 5 star ratings but when it comes to consistency of quality of food, service and value they deserve it.  However, I'm not a huge fan of the lineups on weekends or the lack of free parking at this particular location (road work blocking parking entrance)."}
{"text":"I have never been to Cora and I see it in the US all the time. So got my manager to bring us here. Well she wanted to bring us to the other breakfast place. The other breakfast place tastes way better. She was right about that.   So I got a salmon egg benedict and I have to say the plate and everything looks really pretty. But doesn't taste like wow for that price. Very colorful plate. So its great for picture taking. I find the egg benedict a bit off but not sure what is off. Maybe its the hollandaise sauce. Yeah maybe its that.   Came here in the morning and its pretty empty with I say 5 days max. But again it is on a work day.   I think I will refrain from coming back to this place. Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Checked out this Cora location while in YYC with some co-workers. We were all fairly hung over from the stampede events of the night before so Cora really hit the spot. It was just what we needed. Food. And lots of it. This is definitely the place to hit up post-hang-over. Good service, great food, and quick! Give it a try =)"}
{"text":"Completely over hyped, not a good breakfast place at all. Can't disagree some things are good but when it comes to a simple eggs and bacon with a side of home fries it cannot even compare to no name breakfast diners."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous that they do not substitute meat for a vegetarian option here because of \"head office\"  rules. Literally the only place I have ever been to in my entire life that does not let you substitute. I highly recommend avoiding this place if you are vegetarian.  Also the theos skillet is gross. They must have changed it but it's mostly frozen vegetables now."}
{"text":"We've been to Cora's many times and this one had the best service we've received among the others we've been. We were served by our waitress Cindy who was an absolute pleasure! She was extremely friendly, explained things on the menu and was very proactive with bringing things to the table. We didn't have to ask her once for anything.  The food was great and portions were huge. Everyone has a variation of the Cora's Special which came with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and a crepe or pancake. The bacon was crispy and not overly greasy, potatoes were lightly fried and the pancake was light and fluffy.   With so many Cora's around, I'm definitely going back to this one. It is a bit more expensive compared to other breakfast restaurants but the service alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Usually, Cora is a good restaurant but you should avoid this one. The worst egg benedict I ever eat. The fruits weren't fresh, food was cold/not cooked enough."}
{"text":"I've had Cora's a few times in Montreal, QC and always loved it. Every time here in Toronto/Markham it's been disappointing. Super slow waits to get a table (even though there are dozens of tables ready), long wait for food, food was meh and just a bit over warm, and even paying for the bill was painful. Lining up for 10 minutes is not cool to pay a bill. The staff was slowly blowing up some balloons and did not have any sense of urgency. Whatsoever.   And they don't take Amex.   Gave it 2 stars because at least the food was edible."}
{"text":"Came to this location on Sunday morning. Had to wait for 10 mins to get a table. There is nothing special about this place. You pay about $20/person for breakfast. Food and service are okay. Guess I go there because there isn't else around. I would give it a 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Cora improved their menu, added some options and specialty coffees so i give them 3 stars instead of the 2 i gave other location in the past. The problem of very greasy food and bellow average service is till there. I'll give them another chance when i'll be in the area."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Amazing service, all the servers here are very kind and they always make sure your cup of coffee is never empty"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice in a few weeks.    First off, Cora's menu is front loaded with fruit included with - if not all, most menu items.  As a result, if you come for merely an eggs and bacon meal, you will be paying more for the fruit alone.  Twice I have had the Jo Construction - 3 eggs (your style), 3 sausages, 3 bacon strips, potato wedges, assortment of fruit, and two slices of buttered toast (white/wheat/multigrain/rye).  They also bring an assortment of spreads for your toast.  I liked the potato wedges - not huge and fried up well.  Fruit has been good overall - everything appears fresh.  No complaints in this regards.  At the time of this writing it is just over $10 for this item - based on the item count - not bad.  On the negatives - the coffee is $2.40 for bottomless.  Granted the last word, but still $2.40 is rather high and a deterrent for me.  In the US (sorry I must digress) my equivalent restaurant of course is IHOP and their bottomless comes in your own carafe and $1.95.  Not that I would get it at IHOP (sometimes yes sometimes no) but still feel $2.40 in the GTA is high.  It is what it is.  FWIW - Coffee + Meal errs on the side of the $11-$30 per person IMO.  The men's bathroom - twice there is a bit of an unclean odor.  Looks clean otherwise but they need a better cleaning.  When you pay - they give you the bill and you are to pay at the front.  They do not take AMEX.  Probably more of a 3.5 but cannot give it a 4 at the moment.  May change."}
{"text":"Good food, massive portions.  Do not come here on the weekends during the hours of 11AM-1PM.  You won't get a seat, and even when you do get a seat, your food will take forever to arrive because of how busy this place gets.  But I guess it's busy because people like the food here."}
{"text":"I am glad that Cora's Breakfast and Lunch opened up at this location... It is right across from Eggsmart...talking about being close to your competitors.  I love Cora's hour Monday to Saturday from 6 AM.... .. Yes Some people needs to work Saturday bright and early!  I almost thought Cora was closed when I got there at 6:15AM.. I am the first person to show up for the day. I had other experience at Cora's location when it took over 15 min for food to arrive..... If you are in a hurry, don't go there!!  Fruit Magic Yogurt ($10.45) - My favourite healthy choice in the menu.. love the fruits selection: Starfruits, Kiwi, Berries.... - Multigrains bagel nicely toasted - Beautifully presented.....  Theo Omelette ($10.45) - Omelette with Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, red peppers, green peppers, tomatoes, a really healthy choice, really light in taste though..  Though the food is excellent here, but I don't think too many people has close to 1 hour for breakfast on a workday??  Services was lacking.. so lacking that we could not find someone to pay our bill with credit card.. Ended up just leave the cash on the table and left the empty restaurant.. with no server, no cook..and no one in sight!"}
{"text":"If you like Denny's, you'll like Cora's. The food was barely satisfactory and over priced for the quality. Stay away from the turkey sausage. The only good thing they had was a fruit smoothie."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place they have lots of options and EXCELLENT service! The server was super friendly and accommodating! It took awhile for our food to come out, but it was worth the wait. I got Peggy's poached and it was delicious! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Cora's was all right for me.  Went there at lunchtime with my good friend.  I had the Mollie's Crepe - Spinach and Cheddar crepe made from a blend of regular, whole-wheat and buckwheat flour, filled with bruschetta topping and I held the crispy bacon.  It came with a green salad that looked a little sad.  The dressing came separately in little packets in a big brown box like those teas that are presented to you in a fancy restaurant.  I took the Balsamic Vinagrette.  I liked the crepe lunch item as it also came with the soup of the day which happened to be tomato or tomato juice.  I picked the soup.  Now, the soup I was really impressed with.  Very tasty tomato soup.  Also, the price was a big factor for me - $10.95.  Now, if they can work on the green salad a little bit....  My friend had the crepe panini and a huge fruit salad.  She liked it lots!  I'll leave it for her to yelp further."}
{"text":"I mistakenly ignored the other 1 star reviews and I must say, STAY AWAY from this place unless you want to pay a lot of your hard earned money for small portions and crappy food. Order 3 items one was gross with sour/ bitter fruits, another came with a small amount of burnt fries and broken soggy crepes, and the last one came with black fries and dry chewy crepe wrap. Portions were smaller than a box of Kraft Dinner. Even the tomato juice that was given was watered down and not filled fully.   I would go to the eggsmart across the street. It's A LOT better. STAY AWAY from this Cora. I had already warned my family and friends. Bad quality food and horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast options! I always order their smoked salmon eggs benedict and it's amazing! Their blueberry pancake with cora cream sauce is delicious! They also have free coffee refills."}
{"text":"Okay so I have been going to Cora's multiple times in different locations and they all just seem to be lacking on service speed, it's a big problem. Every single time I go, the wait is longer than 20 mins and usually I order something super ordinary like French toast or an omelette with spinach. They don't even bring some bread until we already have our meal which I don't understand. The bread should come early to sustain the customers. Also, although the food is usually mediocre, one time I just buckwheat crepes that were just awful. They looked days old and were sour and not sweet at all. Just some advice for incoming customers!"}
{"text":"When we came in Ashley put us at our table but before we were seated, standing behind her she was asking if we wanted beverages but we couldn't hear her because she was facing down at the table putting menus down. I said \"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you\" like I said we were still behind her not even seated yet but she was talking to the physical table not us. She was annoyed right away. I try to remain animal free with my food choices. Most places can accommodate something. I'm perfectly okay making adjustments and accommodating my lifestyle around the way the rest of the world works. Unfortunately Coras does no substitutions so it was going to be $15 for a plate of potatoes or fruit and toast for the same price. I get that I have to make adjustments. I'm totally okay with this but the no substitutions thing is frustrating. Ashley didn't even make a recommendation. I said I try to stay away from dairy and eggs and said \"I do t see anything\" she said \"okay, are you sure\". Umm you are the expert. Make a recommendation. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've never heard of Cora's as I'm pretty sure they don't have one in Vancouver.    But after a recommendation from a friend I came here.  Being that it's in Downtown, it was somewhat convenient.  The food is interesting.  They have the most interesting fruit creations I've ever seen used in breakfast.    It's somewhat pricey, but you will probably not find so many creative breakfast dishes in one place like Cora's."}
