{"text":"Here currently. To start off this place is a small fast food place. There are no more than 10 tables and the outside is pretty sketchy. This is more of a 2.5/5   You wouldn't see the place unless you were really looking. I'm pretty sure a lot of people pass by. Though I must say that it's average at best. The service is quick and friendly but the food that I did try was basic. I had the fries and cherry milkshake. The fries were salty and my favourite; crinkle cut. The shake was THICK. It reminded me of peters drive in, like REALLY SIMILAR. For $6.99 you get a basket of fries and I SWEAR with the tasty THICK milkshake and Buckets of fries, I left heavy. I must say that the onion rings were 99%. They were crispy and yummy.   The service was amazing. They brought the food over to us and I must say that it was not needed but greatly appreciated. MY ONE COMPLAINT is the machine ride elephant. At least 4 kids went on and it was the most annoying thing ever.   If your in the area sure but never drive more than 10 minutes for this"}
{"text":"I first are here in 1996 or so after crashing at a fellow soldier's house following a course party; we had just graduated a driver's course. I consequently don't remember much about that meal other than one of the girls that drove me home remained unconscious for the entire meal...  My visit today is much more firmly etched in memory, and it seems my experience was the same as Kyle M's and some of the others. The interior was clean, though a bit cramped; people were trying to maneuver around some decoration in the middle of the floor that really seemed to be wasting space. The service was only okay; I had to repeat myself a bunch and they seemed distracted, perhaps by the loud 80s music coming from the speakers. Not a complaint; I'm as big a fan of \"Stuck In The Middle With You\" as anyone.  The food was unremarkable. Crinkle-cut fries, as others have noted, were smothered in seasoning salt, and, I suspect, store-bought frozen. The hamburger was skimpy on a plain white-bun just a little too big. Soda was served in a cup without ice. (It was not hot today, in fact, it was raining, so I doubt there was a malfunction in the refrigeration equipment...) For a comparable price I could have probably gone to A&W and had something much tastier.  Well meaning and inoffensive, but could have been much better."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars. Burgers made to order, with various upgrade options & drink/shake combos. Regular bakery buns, decent meat, tasty burger sauce, rough cut fresh toppings. Regular burgers are in the $5-6 range, so it's not bad value. The only real shortcoming is the lack of explanation of the toppings on the assorted named burgers on the extensive menu. Asking the staff didn't clarify things much more for me...maybe there are some really great options I missed due to this. Largely a young clientele. Don't go out of your way to eat here, but it's a reasonable choice if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I used to live Inglewood years ago, and would walk or drive by this place all the time. It was dilapidated and sketchy looking.  However! It's a whole new experience now. I decided to stop by the other day and give it a shot. The interior is new, the burgers were awesome, and the service was exceptional.   This is truly a gem hidden in plain sight. AND it's an original Calgary business, that has been around since the 50s - not too many of those around anymore. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First the good. Quite pleasant inside, appears to have been painted cleaned and updated from the first set of reviews here on yelp. Service was quick, and friendly, and the kid's elephant ride in the middle of the room is a hoot.   Food wise though, this place was only 1 for 3 today at lunch, and sadly the only thing that wasn't average or worse was the ice cold Coke.  Crinkle cut fries were diner standards, if I was back again I'd probably ask for them extra crispy. I would definitely also ask them to back off the ridiculous dousing of seasoning salt. This addition completely overpowered the fries (and everything else) and left my fingers a powdery orange mess.  The burger similarly was just not quite good enough to be any better than average. The premade patty was thin, bland, and tasteless, and while the toppings on the bacon cheese burger where nice (soft bun, fresh onions, great pickle) this isn't enough to carry the meal.   The menu does offer more (dogs, chicken burgers, shakes & onion rings), and that picture of the loaded chili fries above looks great so I'm sure I'll be back to give them another chance, I just doubt it will be any time soon."}
{"text":"Newly renovated Inglewood Drive Inn is always a good place to stop if your brain starts craving crispy french fries. Or if your cerebellum chemistry has you hooked on the ecstasy of fat (not always a bad thing if it is in moderation - right) then one of their bacon cheeseburgers will be the fix. We often walk down for some ice cream and stop to watch the lawn bowlers across 12 th Ave SE."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there since last year, when I promised I wouldn't go back because it seemed over priced, burgers weren't great and milkshakes tasted really artificially flavored...  After seeing renovations done to this spot in Inglewood, we decided to give it a try again... burgers were super tasty and shakes too! the place looks very clean and certainly more inviting, and staff is very friendly and helpful.  If you don't want to be inside, the park is right behind it, good option to walk by the river while you eat a yummy Bonfire burger, my favorite!  Yes, I am a fan now and will go back there whenever I have the chance!"}
{"text":"Everything you're looking for in a greasy spoon. It's very tiny, but the food packs a wallop. Booth seating inside, and a couple picnic tables outside. They've recently installed digital menu boards with great descriptions of their burger and hot dog toppers.   Primarily serving burgers and hot dogs (of which they have a huge selection), they also have fish and chicken variations. I got the fish and chips. The batter was flaky and the cut of fish was thick. The chips were crisp. Frozen crinkle cut, but who cares when they are cooked and seasoned right. Husband and son got burgers. 100% angus beef, in shop made patties. Gorgeous looking and delicious tasting. The veggie toppers were fresh and vibrant. We wolfed everything before I even thought to take pictures. Their shakes are otherworldly!! We didn't even bother with dessert, that's how good they are. But if you're just looking for a treat, they have soft serve ice cream, and a variety of in store made treats on a stick.   I highly recommend making this your stop before heading to the zoo. Much much more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I've eaten here SO much in the last few years. Clean place with decent prices for the neighbourhood (which for the most part is a little costly to eat in). The food is made to order, served hot, brought to the table. Menu is tasty, though straightforward, no trendy toppings or duck fat fried this or that. Just classic junk food."}
{"text":"Usually people put reviews down when something was bad. I am writing this because this place is continuously been amazing. The food is fresh, tasty and gorgeous. It looks like a photograph of the perfect burger and it tastes like somebody just BBQed a great fresh burger for you. The fries are never stale and the experience is always amazing."}
{"text":"I was having a really really bad day so it was suggested I go try the Inglewood Drive In and get one of their milkshakes for lunch.  The restaurant had blocked parking due to a garbage truck that was sitting there through my entire lunch, so I had to park down the street at the park and walk back.  That was not a bad thing considering the weather, but I can see it being troublesome in the winter.  I ordered a hoedown combo and the guy at the till accidentally almost charged me for two burgers, which is okay but his English wasn't very good and he should probably learn the menu a little bit better.  I asked a couple of questions about the food and he had to go to the back to answer and some of the questions were never answered very clearly due to language issues.  Luckily whomever was cooking did better.  The milkshake was the special of the day and was nicely thick and flavourful.  I don't remember what the flavour was at this point, but I would go back just to try another one.  The burger was great, with enough sauce and fresh toppings to make it filling.  The patty was juicy and lightly seasoned and the fries were freshly cooked, really good with the drips of barbeque sauce.  I'll go back to try more but the kid on the till needs to slow down a little and learn more about the menu."}
{"text":"I've driven and walked past this place a hundred times and never given it two thoughts.  However today my wife and 2 kids and I decided to give it a go.  The burgers are great!  Come in double or single fashion, and the fries are old school crinkle cut.  Everything was cooked perfectly, and the buns were absolutely stellar.    This place is a hidden gem, give it a try you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Ok lets get this straight first, this is a small hole in the wall diner that serves burgers, hot dogs and ice cream. Like a little greasy diner from the 50's. Its in Inglewood So if you go there expecting beautiful vistas while you delicately nibbling on monk fish in a seaweed wrap, you will be disapointed If you however plan on messing your face hole up with a chili cheese dog, onion rings and a maple walnut milkshake on a sunny park bench you will be super pumped on what the inglewood drive in has to offer. I have been pleased multiple times there"}
{"text":"Cool place, awesome service.  I order ahead for take out so I don't have to wait in line.  Love their fries, with seasoning salt."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy yummy!  Got it?  Delicious old fashioned double cheeseburger hand made and a chocolate shake. Just go. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The perfect comfort food on a cool day. Ordered the bacon and cheese burger combo and happy to say that it was one of the best burgers and fries that I have had in years. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place changed ownership some time ago and since then it's a completely improved drive inn. The service is friendly and fast, the restaurant is clean and the price is right for tasty reliable drive inn food"}
{"text":"There's something romantic about the setting of the Inglewood Drive Inn on 12th, perhaps it is the view of a sweet little steel bridge that leads you to the zoo across the river?  Or perhaps the nostalgic feeling of the building itself, like an ice cream shop out of a 50s movie.    There is nothing romantic about the interior of this place however, it is like a Chinese restaurant in a very small prairie town gone bad; Paint peeling off the walls, tacky decor and a very dirty floor.  With some love and a new paint job I am sure the owners could bring back some of it's charm and character, but for now it remains depressing and void of ambiance.  The menu features breakfast and lunch; there are omelettes, pancakes, wonton soup, hot and cold sandwiches, chicken wraps and burgers.   The burgers range from 2.50 to 6 dollars depending on how many patties you want, but are made of processed meat.  The burger lives up to its 2.50 price tag, it didn't blow me away and is what I expected for $2 and odd change but I don't really think that says much about the food quality in this joint.    The only redeeming factor I see about the Inglewood Drive Inn is its potential and the sliding window that acts as a takeout order option outside."}
{"text":"Well, it certainly ain't no DQ. I'd say that's a compliment. Not that there's anything bad about DQ, but the fact that I can get a Brain Freeze that's as thick as any Blizzard, yet support a local shop is pretty awesome-tastic in my books.  The interior of the Drive Inn isn't much to shake a stick at. It's got a few fast food-esque booths lining the walls and a kid's elephant ride in the middle of the floor. But it's clean, the service is friendly and it was quick enough.  My Crispy Crunch Brain Freeze was plentiful. A small was just over $5 (if I recall correctly) once the tax was all added in. It was more than enough to fill me up, but then again, ice cream tends to fill me up pretty quickly.  They've got some burgers and things on the grill. Not sure what those would be like, but I imagine they'd do for a quick meal on the go."}
{"text":"Great fast food. The cleanest fast food place in Calgary! Their burgers and fries don't make you feel like you just ate a pound of grease. Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"The first two times I went here with Rob, I didn't like it one bit! I could see their \"drive-in diner appeal\", but once when I ordered a hotdog there, specifying no relish, it came with all the toppings anyway and made me feel queasy :( This kind of thing upsets me since I am sensitive to green foods and seldom give any place [that ruined my order] a second chance. However, I am happy to report that Inglewood Drive Inn has been bought under new management, renovated and cleaned up (I agree with Dinah G. on the ambiance thing). Their menu has changed slightly for the better, too. Now I actually enjoy it a bit  more when Rob takes me there, and he can pig out as well. Yay!  P.S. I remember a child's elephant ride being installed there, so bring some coins if you're bringing kids with you."}
