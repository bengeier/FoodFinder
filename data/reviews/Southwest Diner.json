{"text":"Good food, coffee and prices...:) Great French toast. All in all a solid place to start your dam day."}
{"text":"Great find on our way to Hoover Dam. The burgers were delicious. One person in our group had the chips and salsa. The salsa was super fresh. Worth the stop!!'"}
{"text":"This place is ok, but only when you order old fashioned specialties, like pot roast, potato pancakes, meat loaf.  The fresh banana bread is excellent.  Lately, I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was the worst I've ever had.  The sauce must have been Ragu from a jar.  The service is consistently mediocre, and like another reviewer says, there is a sense that nobody really cares that much.  That is the typical attitude in Boulder City restraints, which is why we usually drive into Henderson to eat out."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back to Oklahoma from Las Vegas. The food was all very good. The three adults all enjoyed breakfast while my 13 year old son ate About his twelfth cheeseburger on our trip to California. Everything was fresh and homemade which is always preferable to remade or frozen. We will come here again next time we visit."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on our way back from SEMA and let me tell you it was the perfect way to get the Vegas out of our systems. Cozy atmosphere, good coffee, great breakfast food and the gravy with big chunks of sausage? Amazing. Our waitress was also sweet and helpful. Definitely going to make coming here a yearly tradition. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. We take out of towners here to eat! Can't go wrong with anything on the breakfast menu, especially the giant pancakes (add chocolate chips, they're even better!). Also the pot roast sandwich, Mick sandwich, fijita burrito, and chicken fried steak are all good! Not to mention the pie! Staff is friendly and attentive with a fun country atmosphere. There are also TVs for the sports fan. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I think that was enough. I had the Western sandwich which the menu described as barbecued beef, pickles, and onions. They failed to mention the substitution of cowboy boot for beef. I chewed and chewed and chewed, and chewed some more. My jaw was quite sore by the time I finished.   My other gripes:  It took two requests for some salsa, the place had an off smell, not sure what it was, our waitress tried to give our food to another table, really? There's only two other tables with people at them, how hard can it be? $2.65 for a soda??   I'm a big fan of mom and pop places but mom is aloof and pop is out to lunch.   On a positive note, the taco salad looked really good."}
{"text":"Obviously a lot of thought and caring goes into everything at this place. The food was very good as was the service.  If I lived in Boulder City it would be a regular stop."}
{"text":"this place is really, really great. stopped on a whim coming back from Lake Mead to Vegas. Great pie, nice people, super big portions, and anything with green chile is off the charts. inexpensive, too. or maybe everything seems inexpensive after Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a Las Vegas local, and I travel to Boulder City quite often. I have been to The Southwest Diner twice and I will not be going back. The first time I went, was a few months ago in the Summer and the food was pretty good and so was the waitress, but my second time there was not what I had expected. My boyfriend and I woke up early this morning (around 6:30am) just to go have breakfast there before we ran errands/went to work. We walked in and the greeting was not friendly, but mediocre. The greeting waitress (tall blonde) walked us over to a table where we waited to sit until the other waitress(petite brunette) wiped off the table. So they sat us down at a wet table. The service was just getting off to a rough start. I then went to the WOMENS restroom to wash my hands, and the toilet seat was up and un-flushed! The sink was also very dirty. I did not feel comfortable even washing my hands, much less using the facility. We then ordered some burgers from a waitress (tall blonde). She brought out our food and then we realized she didn't even ask how we wanted our meat cooked! We ate it anyways. While we were eating we noticed that ALL of the workers(blonde, brunette, tall young guy w/ curly hair, and older woman w/ braid) were standing around the counter area talking and using their cell phones. We couldn't even enjoy our food because we were so annoyed with them. They were very unprofessional in everything they did. Just to act as if they cared, they came around a few times asking \"How is everything?\" Then as we were still eating, the waitress (tall blonde) brought our bill w/out even a word. We paid our bill and did not leave a tip. We will never go back to this restaurant again.   I highly suggest that the owners spend time reviewing their employees and hire some people who have respect and actually care about the dignity of the restaurant. Boulder City does not always get a lot of tourists/visitors, so every business should realize how important customer service is and make it a priority. Maybe that way people will actually want to come back to spend money. I manage a family-owned retail store in Las Vegas and every employee we hire knows that the customer always comes first. We give the best customer service and we always get return customers coming back for our service and products!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I suppose I was expecting a bit more of the homemade dinner selections - back home in the mountains of NC a home cooked meal just seems to have a little more love in it. Don't get me wrong, the staff was amazing, the food was pretty good and the homemade soup was awesome! My bf had the homemade meatloaf and it was a lot more bland than expected. I have the pot roast - it was pretty basic, salty meat, gravy - nothing special. Next time I'll go with a soup and sandwich or some breakfast and maybe try a homemade pie which seems to be one of their specialties. I will def eat here again but not until I try out the Coffee Cup and the Dillinger first!"}
{"text":"This is the place to come eat when stopping by Boulder City!       First of all the place itself is really pretty with an outside patio that has fans for the heat and heaters when winter time. It a very cozy country old style diner. The place does not justify. I am a fan of all homemade pies they have and they're amazing omelettes. I had a corn beef hash with scrambled eggs and it was Delish! I love their banana cream and triple berry pie :) service is amazing and everyone is welcoming and friendly. When coming to eat here I LOVE to use their hand soap which is an exfoliating salt that leaves your hands nice and soft. I couldn't resist and bought a lavender with a homemade soap! Over all a five star for me"}
{"text":"Another one of the top 3 diners in Boulder City.  You just cant go wrong at any one of them and we have always enjoyed our meals here too.  I have to say we have only had breakfast here, not lunch or dinner.  But I dont think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chili Verde was awesome!!!  The Boulder Burrito was fantastic.  They were accommodating with kids orders.  Breakfast served all day, so glad, it was delicious!!!  Would have given 5 stars but french fries served with The California were just ok.  I would have liked to give 4.5."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way to the dam. Service and food was excellent. Potato pancakes to die for. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Orgasmic French toast; best ever! Excellent bacon. Great cut, great taste, perfectly crisp. Staff is great too. If the world ends, I'll rush here for breakfast before the sky falls."}
{"text":"Like many others, we stopped here on our way to Hoover Dam from Las Vegas.  The diner looked like just the kind of place my family likes and tries to frequent-- local, kitschy, and busy but not packed.  These are usually signs of a good restaurant.  The place was about 3/4 full, and most people were finishing up.  We were seated quickly and our drink order was taken right away.  However, the hostess had to  come back THREE times to clarify our drinks (there were only 4 of us), then got ALL of them mixed up when she finally brought them.  We waited 15 minutes for our waitress to take our food order.  She had passed our table many times, and could have at least stopped to say she'd be right back.  Nothing.  We might as well have been invisible.  By the time we got our drinks, many customers had finished up and left, so it wasn't particularly busy at that point.  I understand that places are short-staffed, etc., but a little acknowledgement of customers' presence and an apology for the delay go a very long way.  We got nothing.  I was so impatient I walked outside, and saw one of the other waitresses taking a smoke break.  I guess they weren't too busy then, huh?  Our food did arrive quickly, and it was fine.  It wasn't great, it wasn't bad-- it was just fine.  Unfortunately, the food didn't do nearly enough to ever bring us back again.  I'm pretty sure I saw several other cute, local places nearby, and they'll be getting our business next time."}
{"text":"Will never come back here again.  The food we decided to order was burnt and disgusting.  They charged us $4 for a tiny cup of soup instead of waiving it for the inconvenience.  Then after that, we could plainly hear them talking about us from the kitchen. Heads up...when you're in that tiny of a building and there's nobody else dining in,  don't talk crap about your customers."}
{"text":"Food was good, service is ok. Waitresses seem a lil dingy. Overall nice place to eat for breakfast. Just got eggs and potatoes. Me likey"}
{"text":"the breakfast here is very good, the green chile is right on. homemade breads and cornbread too. But I had dinner here and it was average. If you go for dinner, stick to the chile dishes and meatloaf and pot roast.coffee is ok."}
{"text":"Forget Vegas, stag here!  Incredible food and drinks, fast friendly staff, and close enough to still go gamble if you get a hotel here!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Followed Yelp's recommendation and visited with my family during our vacation. Great food and friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Eat Here Regularly, it's a must for any foodies out there Try the Southwest Potato Pancakes & my All Time Favorite chili relleno casserole is awesome ,  and on very rare occasion they have A coffee cake French toast totally Mind Blowing Delicious (Please bring this back) Friendly Staff Love this place and you will too :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I believe in supporting community business so we decided to stop here for lunch,,on our way back from Las Vegas.  My husband had the Fish Tacos, which he said were very good. I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, lacked some seasoning but tasted fine. The grill marks on the Chicken breast were not very well marked which should have been a tell tale sign that maybe it was not cooked to the proper temperature.  I spent the late afternoon to 1 am vomiting and ended up in the Emergency Room of Sunrise Hospital. After the doctor\"s evaluation, he said  it was some bad food. I had danish and coffee for breakfast and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich was my first full meal of the day.  I believe the Chicken was not cooked properly. In all fairness, my husband did not get sick and we did love the homemade lemonade. We even bought a homemade apple pie to take home, which I could not even look at without dry heaving."}
{"text":"If you're leaving Vegas for Phoenix, wait to have breakfast until you get here. Awesome! Good is so good, portions are huge and the staff are very friendly. You can not do better in Vegas. The Italian omelette is fantastic. The hash browns or Those Potatoes are great! Best part, prices are awesome too."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Food.  We were on our way to Hoover Dam and wanted to find a local restaurant, this one was a great find.  I had a Chili Verde Burrito, one of the specials of the day.  Great flavor, great price."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner on a day trip to the Hoover Dam from Las Vegas in March 2015.  It was excellent.  There was so much stuff to look at on the walls while we waited.  Our waitress was friendly and everyone's food was tasty and hot with good sized portions.  If I lived in Boulder City I'd be a regular!"}
{"text":"Had a 6am breakfast, came back the next day for more. The foods and the service was great. Offered to refill my coffee for free to give me an extra boost for the day. Highly recommend, 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"If you stop in Boulder City, need some grub. This is the place. Food was hot, drinks in a mason jar. Customer Service was awesone. Price was way good. Nice, clean, quiet Great diner! We will go back."}
{"text":"We ate here on 10/14/16 for dinner.  My b/f and I were VERY UNDERWHELMED by the quality and quantity of food - the prices were ridiculously high.  We ordered nachos, with melted cheese on them and a small salsa came with them.  Very generic.  We both got Enchiladas - 1 spinach and one shredded beef, each - came with beans and rice, which were both bland and no more \"homemade\" than the Canned Mexican food aisle offerings in your Wal-Mart.  The spinach enchilada had a very good flavor - well, the little amount of filling in it, and the pulled beef enchilada had stringy, chewy beef.  I should also mention that the appetizer (nachos) and the main course arrived at the same time - this to me is a major dining faux pas.  Very mediocre and unsatisfying, not filled up, so at the checkout I bought a slice of apple strudel, and that was just as mediocre - One small bit of apple in the whole thing, dry, crumbly and not very fresh - I'd have to admit it would be a toss-up between this offering, and a Little Debbie cake!  This will probably do for the tourists who come through Boulder City and know no better, but as a Boulder City resident, I can think of other places in town that are a heck of a lot better.  Must say that the young guy who waited on us was nice, but I'm paying for good food; \"nice\", is a bonus."}
{"text":"My husband and 2 of our friends ate here. Everyone's food was horrible. The Chimichanga's were flavorless and cold. The fish in the fish tacos were so hard you couldn't bite into them. The service was poor. We sat outside and the table was gross. It hadn't been wiped or hosed off in a long while. I would give this zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Cute little unique diner that reminded me of the Cars movie.  Really good fish tacos and cheese nacos with salsa.  Waitress was so sweet!"}
{"text":"We accidently stumbled onto this place when driving back from Vegas and boy am I glad we did. Small, Charming, Quaint.  Coffee was superb and served in cups that resemble plant pots. Iced tea was stellar and served in mason jars(Texas style)  Chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly. I ordered the gravy on the side with fried eggs, white toast and potatoes. Food was served promptly. Everything was hot and delicious.  This will be our normal stop every year when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Diner food, great breakfast, attentive service,  amazing pie... can't miss if you are visiting Boulder City..."}
{"text":"Interesting, simple restaurant with very good Southwestern food."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The sizes are perfect. The place is decorated with lots of antiques what makes it an unique place. The staff is friendly and willing to guide you trough the menu. Absolutely delicious food."}
{"text":"Just awesome!  Let me start out by saying I was on a road trip from Texas to Las Vegas and my car broke down right here in Boulder City.  Had to stay the night at a nearby hotel, was not a happy camper.  Woke up really hungry, hungry for anything.  This diner was the first place I saw, didn't have any expectations whatsoever.   Gosh was I surprised!  Coffee was great and served in a large mug.  Potato pancakes were so different, spicy and moist and almost blended, if that makes any sense.  Applesauce was chunks of apples which were delicious.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"\"meh\". The food is good, but not worth the price when there are MUCH nicer restaurants in the area. Also, the service isn't that great either and the diner itself is pretty cramped..   ....but the food is good, so beggars can't be choosers."}
{"text":"Good, friendly service and fantastic food. What more can you ask for? :). I had the waffle which was tasty, the bacon was done exactly the way I like--crispy but not too crispy. My husband got the Chili Relleno breakfast which was phenomenal!  Very unique and so so good!  Check it out--you won't regret it.  And then, to top it off, there is a cute shop next door that sells funky yard art. I found about three things I wanted, alas it wasn't open... next time!"}
{"text":"Tried it once the worst service ever!! Sat down ordered coffee that took forever to get. Then she goes what do you want! that would not have been so bad if we Had a menu!!!! The food was ok , but they are more interested in buses not locals."}
{"text":"My dad is a fire fighter out at the test site and one of his friends family owns this little diner and let me tell you after living out here for a few years we decided to trust my dad and give it a shot and let me tell you the food is excellent! I don't like to eat out with my kids because their kids but we gave it a shot and it was so good! We tried a few things (trying to get my kids to try different stuff) and everything we got was excellent ! Thanks to my dad Larry who recommended this awesome place!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get breakfast! The Italian omelette is to die for. Budget friendly. Over the top staff. Always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Was on vacation in Boulder city and Vegas two weeks ago and stopped here twice for breakfast because it was so good the first time, we had to go back! Their omelets are outstanding. Just make sure if you like your peppers and onions cooked you tell them that otherwise they put them in raw. Their homemade banana bread is also very good. Service was great, the location was right next door to where we stayed, the El Rancho Boulder Motel (also highly recommended) and the view was gorgeous. We ate outside and we loved that it was pet friendly!  The locals were also very nice to us! We absolutely loved everything about Boulder City and especially this Southwest Diner!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for breakfast and what a treat. The decor is fun. The staff is most excellent. And the food was great. I had the French toast and it was good. Hubby had the pancakes and he couldn't finish them. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Quaint little diner typical of Boulder City - think golf shorts, glitter, and shotguns. Seemed spunky but will leave any retiree in cardiac arrest! Ask for plenty of water and coffee as you'll be swimming in a salty sea of \"All American\" flavor, so much that they have fruit flavored salts to emulsify your body with, in the bathroom - which of course are shamelessly for sale at the counter.  Tip well and thank the kitchen staff, as the establishment likely pays a \"competitive\" wage and garnishes gratuity for salon days. Yeehaw!  UPDATE! Yikes! Blaming the kitchen staff was not what I had in mind."}
{"text":"Stoped here for brunch/lunch on our way to the Grand Canyon. Cool spot with fantastic service and great food.   Turkey club was exceptional--they use real, fresh turkey pulled off the bone. Breakfast items great--everything is truly homemade. Portion sizes are huge.   Servers were all attentive and incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"If the weather is nice, I'd recommend eating your meal outside. A cute area with tables and chairs. Usually, around 7ish am, a tour bus will pull up and the place gets really packed and pretty loud so we ate breakfast after the bus rush. The menu is easy and the service is good. There's always fresh homemade pies that's VERY tempting but breakfast first. Great coffee!"}
{"text":"This little gem on the way to The Grand Canyon was the best part of our trip! The food was SO good and seasoned so well. It was also a lot cheaper than the other touristy restaurants on the way. So glad we made a detour into this little town to eat here. Service was friendly and fast too. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Nice stop on the way to Hoover Dam. Very reasonable and very good food for breakfast. Veggie Omelet and Boulder Burrito were delicious.  Banana Bread was fresh and made in house.  Great coffee too. Service was great.  The pies looked awesome but breakfast was too filling to go on to pie!!!"}
{"text":"Last Monday 6/23/2014.. We were on our way to Hoover Dam and then on to Grand Canyon. We had to drive through this little city to get to Hoover Dam. We found this interesting restaurant and we stopped for a quick breakfast. I got the usual breakfast.. 2 eggs over medium with bacon and potatoes with white bread toast. The eggs were done perfectly, the bacon was too die for, the potatoes was fabulous.. My favorite part of the meal was the bread. It was the best white bread toast I have ever had. My friend got the breakfast burrito. He said his was very delicious. The atmosphere was very friendly. The staff was EXCELLENT. I couldn't ask for a great start of our adventure to the Grand Canyon. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is really a hidden gem - we found this place after visiting the Hoover Dam and it was a perfect spot for a quick and filling lunch. Great simple, flavorful cooking and incredibly friendly service. Would definitely recommend this one going to or from the Vegas Strip and a nice change of scenery."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my babe ...excellent food great people.He had the steak and eggs served with hash browns  I had the chile verde omelet with hash browns and the oooh sooo good home made banana bread"}
{"text":"I don't usually do this because I am very easy going and not hard to please, but going to this restaurant last weekend gave me the worst dining experience I have EVER had!!! The hostess/waitress/cashier lady was the rudest meanest snappiest person I have ever encountered! We left after waiting for over ten minutes to have our order taken  (they weren't even that busy!) When I asked her for the check for my kid's juice and my Mother's coffee, she shouted \"WHAT!!!\" and stomped up to the cashier stand. it was terrible! walked up a bit further and ate at a family owned restaurant named Mel's Diner, what a difference!"}
{"text":"My husband, our two daughters, and I stopped for dinner after visiting Hoover Dam and Lake Mead today. The restaurant was rated well, and it looks really cute and unique on the outside, and we are on vacation. What we liked: fun decorations, big Mason jars of ice water with lemon slices, clay pot coffee cups, good meatloaf, decent chef salad, tasty French fries, and our friendly waitress -- also generous food portions.  But the chicken with dumplings soup was horrible -- no broth at all, just big tough doughy dumplings, with pieces of chicken, and a couple slices of carrot, all of it was totally tasteless. Mashed potatoes were also without any flavor, and they were stiff and dry, inedible. My husband told me his enchilada was the worst enchilada he had ever eaten, and his chicken taco contained no chicken. My daughter's sherbet was inedible -- not sure what flavor it was, but it looked like raspberry but was bitter like grapefruit. We would never eat here again."}
{"text":"The Southwest Diner is in an eclectic little building filled with antiques. The waitresses are friendly and efficient. My friend had homemade Tripleberry pie (one of 10 varieties of fresh baked pies). I had the homemade chili with cheese, avocados and onions. The food was excellent. I'm sorry to be passing through because I'd love to eat here again."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Waitress did bring the wrong drinks, only three other tables full at the time. Drinks served in a mason jar, which I love! Kids ordered spaghetti, had a very weird flavor. Lots of garlic, but they liked it. Chicken fried steak was good. Gravy has a good flavor. Southwest breakfast burrito, huge burrito! Good flavor very, very greasy! Had to disassemble burrito just to eat it, over all was good. Had to wave waitress down to refill drinks. Small town restaurant with small tow service."}
{"text":"Very good service. Great diner food. Thirst quenching drinks served in quart Mason jars. Save room for pie!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick breakfast on our way to Hoover Dam, the restaurant was packed but we only waited about 15m for a table. My wife and I ordered omelettes and those potatoes, the servings were massive. The banana but bread is also fantastic, as were the peasant servers."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Decorated for fall and with attention to detail. The food also shows attention to detail. Coffee was excellent. The Santa fe burrito was apparently delicious because my husband ate the whole thing.. But I really enjoyed their specialty: homemade chunky applesauce, homemade banana bread, and perfectly browned lightly spicy potato pancakes. Thank you Yelp users for recommending this place. I loved the ambiance and the food!"}
{"text":"Floors were filthy, windows were filthy, menus and condiments on the table were filthy. And not like \"oh they haven't cleaned today\" filthy, more like they haven't deep-cleaned that place in many months, or even years in some corner areas. I keep reading this response:\"We're sorry you didn't like the establishment. We strive to have the highest standards...\" but I don't see them changing, given that the reviews that say the place was dirty has been made 9 months ago. Many of the tables have scrunched up wads of dirty paper towels underneath the legs, as if they are trying to fix an uneven table or who-knows-what they're trying to accomplish with that. Not to mention old crumbs of food everywhere and the windows and blinds have caked-on grime. It's just plain dirty. Hopefully they hire a professional cleaning crew to come and do some much needed deep cleaning."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner/breakfast here! Pot Roast melted in our mouths and breakfast was scrumptious. Service was excellent and definitely will be a place where we will come again when Boulder City. Highly recommend that everyone tries it"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat!  Service was just as good as the food!  I would eat there everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Dissapointed...expected home cooked food...got Costco pot roast...good home made mashed potatoes...chicken enchilada good, but I had better...enchilada sauce totally bland...out of the jar salsa...refried beans out of a can...Mexican rice OK...beef taco OK. Ordered a Cadillac Margarita with an extra shot of Grand Marnier, got an extra shot of tequila. All on all, a disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day breakfast with family there. Short wait. Good good fast service crowded but we all got our order very quickly. Large portions. Kids even ate most of their breakfasts.  Would recommend it. Small but comfortable."}
{"text":"I live in Boulder City and have been to Southwest Diner many times.  My family and I always enjoy delicious food, great service and the wonderful, cozy atmosphere.  I'm partial to their scrumptious breakfasts, especially the omelets but don't forget to try their homemade pies!"}
{"text":"Best place ever!! The BLTA is one of the best meals I've ever had. The staff is super friendly. The baking there is also very good."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from Austin, TX and ran across this place for breakfast. I had the BEST breakfast burrito here! I loved the ambiance of the place. We went back another time for lunch, good specials. Would love to visit again if I didn't live so far away!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place to stop and have breakfast on the way to the grand canyon. The servers were super friendly, sweet tea was very good, and the food was awesome. I had the country fried steaks w/sausage gravy, scrambled eggs, and those potatoes. Also, the banana nut bread was very good! I definitely suggest stopping by this restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've always looked forward to visiting this diner when in Boulder City...until now. The sandwich was good, the onion rings were too greasy and inedible,  then I fond a rusty bolt at the bottom of my iced tea. I asked for the meal to be comped (because I was nauseous at this point).  They took the $2 iced tea off my bill, but I was still charged for the meal. The waitress argued that they had no idea how the rusty bolt got in my drink.  I was nauseous the rest of the evening. Never again."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant on the way to The Hoover Dam! Okay here's the deal, we booked a vacation to Las Vegas to relax after a successful year in business. We sort of forgot or didn't know that it was cold in Vegas compared to usual. We also didn't know that Las Vegas is now gouging and totally taking advantage of its tourists. It's actually quite disgusting so instead of eating at our hotel, Caesars Palace for $35 per person for the buffet, we decided to try a little restaurant outside of the strip. Wow do we hit the jackpot! Not only is this place authentic but the food is amazing and the service was fantastic! I got the vegetarian omelette which was a modest $12.99. I would say it's actually worth more but I'll take it! Full of awesome vegetables, tons of eggs, amazing hash browns and their sourdough toast is incredible! I opted for the banana bread and it wasn't bad but not amazing. My wife's banana bread is way better. I found the piece a little thin and slightly dry. Go for the toast! The coffee is great too! So in summary, our breakfast ended up costing $34 instead of $35 per person at the buffet at our hotel on the strip. Beware people: Vegas is over the top expensive now! The cheapest part about it was our Uber rides. LOL"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is phenomenal! This place exceeded all expectations. I highly recommend coming here and sitting outside during sunset. Not only is it cooler temperatures, but you get a front row view of that gorgeous BC sky. The kind of service you'll receive when coming here is hard to find nowadays. Everyone is so genuine and kind. As far as food goes, all I have to say is...amazing. I got the hot dog with grilled onions. It has that true homemade taste that can't be beat! And the best part? They serve your drinks in mason jars. Any place that serves me my drink in a mason jar is a winner in my book. So. Cute."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Friendly staff. Good eats. Neat decor. Clean. What more could you ask for.?"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best hamburger must have been cooked hours ago and kept in warmer. Mexican food is of poor quality and tasteless. Staff was unprofessional and NOT interested in serving the customers. Reading reviews on this page, sounds like a real hit and miss place at best. I can confirm they use mason jars...the staff attitude is your bothering them. Won't eat here again. There are great places for eats in this town so do stop again and find another place."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Generous portions for a great price. Food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Wonderful surprise .  Home town diner. Friendly staff and a great breakfast.  Omelet was so big My wife didn't finish.  Banana bread was homemade and very good.  Price was comparable to restaurants at home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is as cute as Boulder City itself. Although it's on the main drag, it also seems like it's off the beaten path.  I went to lunch with two girlfriends, one of whom lives in Boulder City. It was her suggestion to eat here, and it was a good one. We sat on the patio, which was a great place for people watching. Also saw some awesome old cars pass by, and many had out-of-state plates. BC is the place to be!  I had the avocado BLT, and it was delicious. Even more delicious was the cucumber salad on the side. Creamy and sweet, just like grandma makes it. I had a Bud Light, which was a little pricey ($4.95). But my food was reasonably priced and filling. My friends each got hamburgers, one with fries and the other with curly fries, with iced tea and Bloody Marys, which were served in mason jars. Cute, and tasty to boot!  Service was excellent. Everyone was so friendly, and it really had a small-town feel. Although I love living in the big city, I'm envious of my friend and her laid-back life. And while I am excited to try some the other restaurants in town, I know I'll return to the Southwest Diner. That cucumber salad can't be beat!"}
{"text":"great food, great staff, treated to the best meal of my entire vacation. will stop every time I am in their area, a drive from down town Vegas is worth it!"}
{"text":"One of most unhealthy menus I've seen in a long time. Poor food quality. Poor service to boot! I couldn't get out of there soon enough."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after going to the Hoover Dam tour. We found it on yelp. It was ok. I got a burger and my husband got the the westerner. My husband didn't care for his sandwich. My burger wasn't good or bad. We wished we had gone to another local place instead that we hit up for breakfast the next day. If you want to know where we ate for breakfast, read my other reviews for the Boulder City area."}
{"text":"We took a drive out to Boulder City for a late lunch and I can't wait to come back!   We stopped at the Southwest Diner. The place is very cute inside. Red gingham tablecloths blanket the tables and signs with funny sayings cover the walls. There is a large display separating two dining areas where a homemade coconut scrub is being sold. You can test the scrub in the bathroom and it's heavenly. Finally the place sells homemade pie so you can take dessert home if you can't find room for it.   We were dining with our baby.  These days when it comes to eating out, she's like a box of chocolates, we never know what we're gonna get. I was very thankful when the hostess sat us an area sectioned off away from the other diners (place was quite busy at 2:30pm) near the cash register.  The hostess, who doubled as our waitress, promptly took our drink orders and left us to review the menu.   The menu is large with sandwiches, Mexican food, and breakfast foods. My husband asked the waitress for some advice and she recommended the Chile Rellano Casserole and the Westerner sandwich.  We ordered both and the chips and salsa. My husband chose the cucumber salad as his side and I ordered \"Those Potatoes\". Additionally, my breakfast came with banana bread.   The food was excellent. I was a little worried when I saw the plates as it's obvious the cook doesn't place much importance on presentation.  Those worries evaporated immediately. My husband loved his sandwich and his cucumber salad. The Chili Rellano Casserole was fantastic and the signature potatoes, which were breakfast potatoes seasoned with onion and peppers, complimented it perfectly. Lastly, the banana bread stole the show. It was perfectly moist and just the right amount of sweet. My only critique of the food were that, while the salsa was good (nothing to write home about though), the chips were a little stale.   All in all, this was a very charming diner with a quick, friendly staff and excellent food. We will be making the drive again to try it again  and suggest you do the same!"}
{"text":"Ok breakfast but nothing special.  Burrito needed some sauce very dry.  Will not be going back"}
{"text":"We were on the way from Las Vegas to the Grande Canyon and stopped here for a late breakfast/early lunch.  The wait staff was super friendly, and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast & lunch. The Avocado BLT sandwich was excellent."}
{"text":"I Have NEVER rated with a 1 star but this trip deserves it! My family and I have come here every year for breakfast after Santa train. It has always been good except for today. Our waitress was ok other waitresses were more attentive to us.  The eggs were brown and almost burnt. Unless you specify you don't want them brown.  The French toast tasted stale and rubbery.  The chicken tenders had a strange smell and chewy consistency.  The upside was the cute mason jar cups and salt and pepper shakers.  Other than that you can tell they are just trying to push people out fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way out to the Hoover Dam.  He used to live in Las Vegas and was familiar with this awesome breakfast spot.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and cannot wait to come back and have them again, simply amazing."}
{"text":"This place gets it right. Excellent food, friendly and prompt service and very reasonable prices. You can get American diner comfort food or Mexican and both are done well.  And, the best is that a scoop of ice cream comes with dinner entrees. Try to Avocado BLT!  We come here every time to Boulder City and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"This is only my second time here. The first was 2 years ago. Since that time I have literally dreamt about the chile relleno casserole. It did not disappoint!!!! You cannot go wrong with anything  on the menu, but that casserole -OMG!   Now, about the place itself. It's perfectly charming. The epitome of what you would expect of a small town diner. The staff was awesome, with a special shout out to Sara. Everyone was friendly and had plenty of smiles to share, even in the midst of a rush.   Glasses were never empty and everything was plentiful. The decor was wonderful too! Antique appliances and barn windows ... just charming! (I said that, didn't I?)  It was obviously a place where locals call home, but as an outsider, you don't feel like a visitor- they treat ya like family.  This is worth the drive and more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for pie. Very excited as their board listed 9 flavors. They didn't have the triple berry as listed so I ordered cherry instead.  My husband had the pumpkin. We had a bite of each and tossed them. The worst pie we've ever eaten. Expensive at $5 slice too."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, great service, and even better PIE!!!! The chile relleno casserole, cucumber salad, and creamy lemon chicken soup are some of my favorites!"}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place? Great kitsch decor, super friendly staff and great food. I got the chili dog  - the best I've ever had. chili was full of red beans and meat..  The person sitting next to me got the patty melt and declared it perfect. High end, it ain't. But its a great place if you are headed to see the Hoover Dam and you're hungry."}
{"text":"Well I missed the turn to go to Hoover Dam but I ran up on this jewel. The food was so great. The service was excellent if you are in the area do yourself a favor and stop"}
{"text":"Definitely deserves 5 stars! It's worth a stop on way to/from Hoover Dam.  Their breakfast menu was extensive and apparently \"Those Potatoes\" are their trademark.  We ordered a Pork Green Chili Omelette with those potatoes (grilled with onions & green peppers) and banana but bread. We split the order and it was more than enough - split plate fee was only $1 - well worth it.  Staff was extremely friendly and very attentive.  Even prepared a take-away coffee. We much prefer a local place to try out new places when on the road. Place, bathroom very clean - another plus."}
{"text":"Rode in on my bike from northwest Las Vegas, the ride was great. Once in Boulder City, stop by to have breakfast here. The service was great, a total team effort. They were attentive and polite, food was great and prices were good. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boulder City. Keep up the great work guys. Thanks"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! I brought 12 of my friends from Australia for breakfast. The service was outstanding, fast, friendly and very welcoming. Food was delicious. Everyone loved their choices. Thank you so much. As the local, they made me look good."}
{"text":"How this restaurant receives an overall four stars amazes me! Our experience started off negative. The hostess wanted to seat us at a table that had bikes propped against it...and immediately told the owners of the bikes...\"you have to move these bikes\". We didn't want to sit at that table as it was in the shade and it was a bit cool and windy. We asked if we could sit at the round table in the sun and were told \"no...that table is for bigger groups\"...it seated four. The hostess then moved us to two smaller tables placed together that seated four people, which was still in the shade??? I ordered iced tea with NO lemon...when my drink was brought out it had lemon in it. The waitress asked who had the tea...I said that I did, but did not want lemon. She started to lift the lemon out with her fingers and hesitated and took it back inside to remove the lemon (with her fingers???). The seeds were still in my glass, which is a mason jar and the coffee cups are flower pots with handles. I had the chicken burrito with chips and my husband had the Colorado burrito with chips. The chips were not fresh and the burrito was so salty that I couldn't eat it. The more my husband ate of his burrito he said it seemed very salty too. The waitress did offer to bring me something else, but after all that had gone on I didn't have a good feeling about the place. The waitress did take the price of my burrito off our bill...which we felt was over priced...$10.50 for a burrito and a few chips...no rice or beans. There are plenty of other places in Boulder City to eat...choose carefully!!"}
{"text":"We have stopped here for breakfast on our way home to Tucson several times. The food has always been wonderful. I had the Chile Rellenos casserole and it was great. The banana bread is also delicious. The only reason it's not a 5 is because the coffee is kind of mediocre--plenty hot but not too flavorful. But I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I'm glad we found this place. The food and service were good. You can sit inside our outside. I had the Chili Size with fries and a side of ranch. The chili had a good taste and the bun help the burger and chili well. I'd order this again no problem. The fries were good and the ranch just might have been homemade... it was real good. Solid place for good and affordable grub."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Great staff. Fabulous fluffy pancakes & biscuits and gravy, good coffee. If I'm ever back in this area, we are coming back here for breakfast. Came with our toddler and service was fast and efficient. 2 parents, 2 teenagers and a baby had a nice, relaxing, awesome tasting breakfast. Good job SouthWest Cafe. Customer service is rare these days. You nailed it!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop between Las Vegas and Hoover Dam. The atmosphere is quaint and nostalgic and the food is delicious. The chili relleno casserole is yummy!"}
{"text":"We just happened upon this little gem on or way back to Vegas from the Hoover Damn.  It's so cute from the outside and even better inside! You can really go wrong with red & white checked tablecloths..so happy we stopped!  The menu had a lot to choose from and some specials. I had the avocado Blt and my husband had a salmon salad...both meals were delicious! I also had a cup Of the veggie beef soup...outstanding!!! And everything is made with such love!  We finished with the chocolate cream Pie...it's and absolute MUST have!!  The staff was also super friendly!  Highly recommend this spot and make sure you save room for pie!"}
{"text":"Homemade food with a very homey & cool atmosphere!   Would you drive to Boulder City for some breakfast for dinner? I would! For starters Boulder City is only half an hour from the strip & sometimes it's nice to take a relaxing drive. Sunday's are perfect for a quick trip to the lake & downtown Boulder City!   We've been coming to this diner for a few years now & it's our favorite spot here. It's our favorite because we haven't tried anything else! I tell myself each time that we need to try something new & then we see the cool retro sign & can't help ourselves! The decor is really special & it feels like you've stepped back in time, love it all!   All of the servers are awesome & the food tastes great, very fresh & everything I've tried I've liked a lot! Let's begin with a simple breakfast - everything is cooked to perfection & the banana bread is always fresh (off the hook). I've also tried the southwest potato pancakes that are very unique with an awesome kick & the BBQ roast beef sandwich on a French roll is to die for (comes with bomb curly fries). My man has had the liver & onions which he loved and steak & eggs. He's also ordered soup a few times that come in cute little mason jars and all the soups have been great.   Let's not forget about the homemade pies here! Holy crap they are so good. We've had apple, blueberry & peach. They come out warm with ice cream.   There's something special about home cooking and they do everything right here. This place is a must if you're ever in Boulder City!   Almost forgot! They have salt scrub in the restrooms! They are always different & today it was coconut! It smells like heaven & leaves your hands feeling ultra soft. What a nice touch!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The decor is so cute, I always make sure to stop by when in Boulder city and it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Great nostalgic type of diner with outdoor seating.  Had the potato pancakes which were good not excellent and my friend had a big portioned chicken parmesan which was very good.   As a side, we had some tasty out of the oven tortilla chips.   Service was almost  attentive and polite.  Would have liked to have seen a more refined menu."}
{"text":"The pie is amazing,  and i highly recommend the southwest potato pancakes.  This place is a staple of boulder city.  For locals and tourists,  and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Super cute place. Service was friendly and fast. We were in and out in 20 minutes. Food was hot and delicious. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The service we got there was great. The food was well worth it's price. The food taste was very good. The time it took to get our food? WoW. Impressive!  Very quick. Talk about good food,prices and service with a smile .  I really like this place. I sat outside first breakfast. Then took my wife with me next day for breakfast. Both times were excellent.  Wife was impressed. I was happy.  Our belly's were full . Thanks Southwest Diner.  Will be seeing you again.  Need to try your lunch and dinner plates."}
{"text":"Loved it. It was like I went back in time or I was in some old movie. Such a cook place to eat, proportions were huge! I wasn't expecting such a big meal. Who complains about too much food?! Only supermodels I guess and I ain't one, so this place was perfect. The sweet tea hit the spot!! This place is on my list of favorite places!"}
{"text":"Picked up dinner from here one night... food was good but was probably a lot better fresh on the table, instead of driving it back to Henderson.  the girls were friendly and the food was large, but next time i think i will just eat it there!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service.  Highly recommend plus they have the best pies in town."}
{"text":"Great little diner! Very family friendly! Our waiter Kaleb was very courteous, quick, and personable! Some of the highlights were the cucumber salad, avocado burger, banana bread, and strawberry rhubarb pie! Will def return on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast with my puppy. They have tons of outdoor seating right out front (in the morning it is shady) where I could sit with him and get waiter-service. They even offered to bring my dog a bowl of water. As for the food, I opted to try something a little different from what I usually order - the potato pancakes which came with eggs and a side of spiced apples, and banana nut bread!! It wasn't quite what I expected, it was like eating mashed potato balls for breakfast. It was tasty, but I think next time I'll try something different. I was debating between 3 and 4 stars - but with good service, dog friendly, and a banana nut bread option for toast - I'll round up."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 different times. Each time is the same.. just so-so..We have been both when it was busy and quiet.  Food was just OK.  In the Fall I had pumpkin pancakes, they were just OK.  I have had their burger.. again, nothing memorable..  The french toast was OK too.  I wish I could say Go here, you will love it.. but it is just OK."}
{"text":"I got the Chili Relleno Casserole. I love the traditional dish, but this hit the spot. I couldn't finish it all so I had plenty to take for a snack later on. Good atmosphere and they were on top of the service. I was checked on by 3 people at various times, but it wasn't over the top. The price was right too!"}
{"text":"The BEST Bloody Mary's around.  Everything is fresh and the portions are perfectly satisfying!  This is the spot we'll keep coming back to even after our move to Ca.  The staff are great and welcoming too!"}
{"text":"Excellent home town diner--everything is good on the menu...their banana bread and potatoes are unbelieveable as is their frisco burger and chicken nuggets.  They do it all well!  (Excellent friendly staff, especially Caleb!)"}
{"text":"I ordered some take out food from here when i stayed in boulder city on a road trip.  I had a chicken fajita burrito. The chicken was so salty i could only eat a few bites. I was so hungry I some of my buddy's chili cheese fries which were ok, but we had to pick most of the onions because they pretty much sliced up a whole onion and threw it on top of the fries.   The server who took my order was painfully polite and unnaturally cheerful."}
{"text":"We have stayed in Boulder many times over the last few years, great place to relax in the winter time. I can not believe we had not tried this place. The service was extremely friendly and fast.  The food was excellent and there was plenty , we found this hidden gem on our last day unfortunately , but, we will be back.   It is sad to say, but friendly service seems to be a thing of the past. Try this business if you would like to revisit small town dining, along with great food and courteous service."}
{"text":"After driving 4 1/2 hrs from cali, it was great to be greeted with warm smiles on this cold morning! Our host quickly brought us our menus and took our drink orders.  Tanya our server and James the busser were great! It was our first time here and we brought visitors from China. The staff were patient when I was explaining the food to our foreign friends and didn't bat an eye when our guests asked for warm milk and a Hamburger for breakfast! I loved my country fried steak! Although there were 9 of us, our food came out timely."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now after staying in Boulder City on our way to AZ. The breakfast here is fantastic! Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Five stars. Absolutely wonderful food. And the service... well the service was exceptional, exceptional squared. So exceptional that I literally felt like I had a food receptionist sitting next to me. Like this woman was practically staring at my glass sweating with anticipation of asking me if I wanted a refill. I feel like these people wake up from dreams of servicing.   If I had to take a guess I would assume there is someone with a whip sitting in the back of the restaurant threatening these people with their lives if they don't work quicker.   Like someone call the police.... Now I'm scared for them. This could be serious guys."}
{"text":"Good food Good service Great people Repeat for sure  All the items on the menu are good.   Its old fashioned good food."}
{"text":"This place offers good food at a good price, and we were delighted to find it.  Driving through Boulder City, on our way to Hoover Dam, we were looking for a place to have breakfast - and couldn't find much of anything until we stumbled upon this place.  There were several police cars parked nearby.  It is always a good sign, when the local cops eat there.  We had eggs and 'those potatoes' (fried potatoes, onion and greeen pepper) - a very good meal.   If you're in the neighborhood, I recommend that you stop by."}
{"text":"Small old fashioned diner restaurant we tried for breakfast on our way to Hoover Dam. Eggs and bacon were good as was the fresh banana bread. Husbands pancakes were huge but very heavy and not fluffy. Pancakes weren't to his liking and sausages were well done. Coffee was terrible. Service was good and fast. I would have to give this place a 2.5 if I could."}
{"text":"Since I found this little gem last year I can't quit it! My friends and family make it a point to come here when we are in town!  Their everything sandwich is delicious and addicting! Their bloody Mary's are huge and yummy!  And their coffee cups are oh so cute!"}
{"text":"We had a nice breakfast there on the way out of town. We arrived just after they opened.  The server (an owner) was quiet but gave us great service. The food was excellent. We would have eaten out front, but it the dining area there was being washed down, but as it was so early, eating inside was quite nice and quiet.  Our food arrived fresh and hot. Make sure to try their specialties. The biscuits and gravy were great!  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60881-d922986-r553275457-Southwest_Diner-Boulder_City_Nevada.html#"}
{"text":"Amazing food, did not leave a single crumb on my plate. Both shepherds pie and blackened liver were outstanding. The cherry pie was simply delicious: sweetened just right and flavorful. That's how an American diner should look like."}
{"text":"Looks like a great mom and pop place. Passed by there several times and decided to stop. It was a Sunday around 2 pm so it wasn't as busy as it could have been but still fairly busy. The service was decent. Took them a while to even come and take our drink order.   I assume if you get there early you can have whichever pie you want but by 2:00 on a Sunday they were all gone with a select few.   The fries were not good. The carrot cake was average, nothing better than a box would get you. The pie was average. Nothing was bad there but nothing was great. I doubt we will eat there again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is excellent from the outdoor seating to the service to the food. The service is quick & everyone is friendly & knowledgeable. We had iced tea which arrived in extra large mason jars with plenty of refills. My brother had the taco salad & I had the Fajita salad. Both salads were very fresh with large portions. They have homemade pies so we tried the triple berry pie a lode which was awesome & only cost $5.50. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"You need to get you some potato pancakes!!  Yes, they are massive gut bombs, but dang they are creamy with just the right amount of crispiness on the outside. Add some sour cream and salsa with a glass of the orange juice ( which tasted better served from a mason jar) and you are in business. The coffee was industrial tasting and forgettable."}
{"text":"We decided to take our daughter (15 mos) to Boulder City to see some sights and get a bite for lunch. We passed Southwest Diner on the way in and thought it looked really cute and busy, which we take to be a good sign about the food. I'm sad to say that we didn't even get to try the food because it was the worst service we have EVER encountered since becoming parents. We had our stroller, so we offered to leave it outside, but they offered to put it in the back. We agreed, but instead of putting it in the back, they asked us to put it next our table. Again, no problem. We know they're cumbersome and just wanted to put it somewhere it would not bother anyone. They took our drink order and then a waitress seated the table next to us, took our stroller and rolled it so that it was LITERALLY up against the back of the seat of the customer who had just been seated. We were horrified. The customer was clearly annoyed (with good reason) but was trying not to be rude to us. We got up, took the stroller, offered to pay for the iced tea and left. We will not go back. It's fine if you're not kid friendly, but please tell us you don't want a stroller in your restaurant when we ASK you if it's okay."}
{"text":"Today was the second time in as many days we ate here. On my first visit I had the Santa Fe potato pancakes and today I hate the avocado BLT. Neither disappointed. I shared some of my husband's coconut cream pie which was definitely homemade. We are trying to time our trip back from the Grand Canyon to Las Vegas to eat there one more time before we leave. Gr"}
{"text":"So glad we finally got a chance to try this little diner. Everything tastes homemade. I had the chili relleno casserole and was great for $9.95 and even comes with fresh baked bread. The service is friendly and fast. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group (20-30 people) and they made room for us.  Service was quick and food was good."}
{"text":"Awesome fast breakfast diner!!! Had to give this place a 5stars for the Corned Beef hash alone!!! Homemade with real meat!! Best I ever had!! Great service! Fast and cheap!!! Will definitely return next time thru!!!"}
{"text":"Okay. Breakfast all day. Everything is with a Mexican flare. I love the carne asada tacos and nachos. Th portions are hefty so bring your appetite! They are not in a rush there so be prepared to take your time. It is worth the wait. They have a quaint and eclectic interior but I love the outdoor seating. It is located near the center of the old part of town so you get a nice chill vibe.  The staff are awesome! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Trip to the Hoover Dam always builds up an appetite !  This little diner was a great lunch choice!  The portions ordered were huge and worth it  They also have homemade pies, and hand scrubs"}
{"text":"Three stars for being not good, but not bad.  If you're in a bind and are hungry, it's a place to stop.  Drink service was fast, but waitress took a while to make it to the table.  Was more interested in talking to other staff than helping customers.  The hostess said we could have breakfast, lunch or dinner - \" everything was available\", so when my husband and I tried to order soup and sandwich, we were told soup wasn't ready... at 11:00AM.  At least the delay seems to have been because it was homemade.  The San Francisco sandwich was pretty bland - burger patty was a bit too well done and the grilled sourdough was very greasy.  Not much flavor in the thing.  French fries were ok, but definitely not made on site (and maybe the frozen variety...). They came with a mystery sauce that seemed to be sour cream and ketchup stirred together.  Overall, pretty bland.  Again, not too bad, but just kinda ho-him."}
{"text":"A gem!  Stopped after a day at Hoover Dam and wasn't disappointed by the recommendation of other Yelpers. Ordered the everything sandwich and it was delicious! Service was friendly and quick. The decor was quirky and fun."}
{"text":"I LOVE this little town and this restaurant is fantastic! Classic breakfast food. Sweet service and a darling town!"}
{"text":"Wasn't here today but I forgot to check in the last time I was here.   I was with my brother who was visiting from Europe. I heard about this place on tv.   Portions are exceptional and friendly service. Quant little place that has that home cooking feeling but it still manages to attract the kids from Vegas.  Cool place. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Horrible place to eat. Over priced and not very good.  I'm a local and I won't eat here.  It's totally a  bouldercity tourist place"}
{"text":"Ordered a chili size.  Unfortunately, the  \"Chili\" was more like beans.  The soup was not hot.  My wife liked the chili verde omelet.  It is pleasant to dine outside, though."}
{"text":"Good breakfast fair prices I liked it !"}
{"text":"We came here for a late breakfast one morning. I wanted a chili verde burrito. Very tasty and was just what I wanted and more.   It was so big but I kept eating until I just had to pour the salsa on the rest of it to keep me from eating the whole thing! Hahaha (we weren't going home afterward so I didn't take the leftovers)   We will be back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Usually a great place to eat and I hate to put in this review. But I have to so that future patrons have a better experience. This is a regular stop for us when passing through boulder city.   This last time though I don't know if it was the server but the banana bread was stone cold. It looked great but isn't it supposed to be at least room temperature?  I ordered the Chili Relleno casserole. It was burnt on the bottom and what I can only imagine was at one time either salsa or enchilada sauce on top now tasted like burnt tomato paste. I don't know why I didn't just return it. It was $11 and I only ate a few bites it was so disgusting. I felt obligated because I ordered it on the waitresses recommend.   Afterward I thought, who puts red sauce on chili relleno?"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as we were heading out of Vegas & onto our next stop Phoenix. What a great recommendation from both Yelp & the local gas station, this is definitely a gem that's off the main highway. This is a local spot as you'll notice but there are also a lucky few such as I who must always try something other then your horrible chain!! The service was great with zero complaints, we chose to sit outside on the covered patio which was very nice with a calm breeze swaying past us. We both chose the fresh brewed iced tea which of course were rightfully served in their respectful mason jars, lol!! We also both had the bacon cheeseburger made with angus beef. Now I'm normally extremely picky with my burgers & the quality of beef that they use, therefore I rarely order one when we go out but this gem just gave me the feeling that I wouldn't be disappointed!! Well let me tell you I don't give five stars without good reason & this local spot earned every bit of that rating & then some. So so good with just enough bacon, lettuce & tomato also. They know a thing or two about making an awesome burger. The ambience was just as great as there was actually a table of bikers sitting right besides us who were as friendly as could be. Note the picture I took pertaining to bikers. These guys were talking shop about AC work & systems which is my hubby's field & I just chimed right in & they ended up talking with my hubby for a good 15 minutes asking our story & why we chose to relocate. Who'd see that every day a table of bikers shooting the s**t with some black guy & his white wife without a single thought to it. With that being said don't judge a book by its cover & I can't wait to come here again!!"}
{"text":"Had great breakfast. Chili Verde omelet was delicious+ those potatoes are good. We were there in the morning so they still had pie. Peach pie was very good and be sure to try their sea salt soap in the bathroom. Makes your skin very smooth and feels good and smells like coconut"}
{"text":"Had a very tasty breakfast burrito here.  All three of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Staff was super friendly and the outdoor seating was perfect.  Pretty much the epitome of the classic American diner.  If you're passing through Boulder City, or just want to take a quick drive out of the flashy flashy of Vegas, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Aubrey G. for steering us here. We were seeking breakfast on our way back to Tucson and noticed one of our favorite Milwaukee Yelpers had visited this spot in 2012, and most importantly, enjoyed it. We had the same stellar experience. I absolutely love old diners like this and this spot didn't disappoint. Great food, big portions, and friendly service! Lots of the menu has a Southwest flair; my partner loved his potato pancakes with corn and green chiles. I was impressed with my extra crispy hash browns and WHY OH WHY doesn't everyone offer homemade banana bread instead of toast? So delicious. Next time we drive to Vegas, we will most certainly be back. That pie board is calling me.  PS The coffee mugs are flower pots with handles. How cute is that?!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service on Sunday mid morning... food fresh and  deliciously cooked. Coffee is fresh and bottomless . They even filled my cup to go... Banana bread was plentiful and we had slices leftover for the road to go with our coffee.. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Road trip breakfast...loved the chili relleno casserole with fried potatoes and fresh banana bread...service was excellent and the cost was minimal...definitely recommend if you are in Boulder City...stop by and see these folks"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was good, but magical but good. Prompt servers, good came out quick. Didn't try the banana bread, but still make sure to next time. Cute atmosphere and I love the jar glasses. Very cozy at home cooking feel."}
{"text":"Awesome food and amazing service!  Be sure to check this place in Boulder City out, perhaps on your way to or from Hoover Dam.  My daughters and I had breakfast there and couldn't have been happier.  Great menu selections.  I had the chili relleno casserole, which was truly delicious.  My daughters had a breakfast burrito and one of their breakfast sandwiches and really enjoyed them.  The wait staff were very attentive and couldn't have been friendlier.  Great place all around and especially convenient if you're staying next door at the El Rancho Boulder."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and enjoyed my food both times. First time I had \"The Westerner\"; the roast beef was delicious. Second time I had vegetable burrito which was also very good. The only thing that turned me off was when we sat outside; tables had food on them and they did not wipe them off between customers. We will be back but will be sitting inside."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars but the decor needs to be freshened up. The service is friendly, fast and efficient. The menu has some old fashioned goodies as well as some Tex Mex entrees. Very generous portions with very reasonable prices. Chicken fajitas is my \"go to\". The caramelized onion and peppers are so delicious! It comes sizzling hot on a cast iron skillet that continues to cook and caramelize while you eat. The leftovers end up being even more fantastic. P.S. Save room for the pie, any pie, they're all scrumptious."}
{"text":"I'm small and it's always been hard for me to finish ALL my food (except for that one time that I went to Olive Garden and I inhaled my plate like I was fighting for air, but I digress...). I ordered the BBQ sandwich here because if there's BBQ on the menu, I need to try it. And the saucier the better. And if it's spicy then amazing. MAJOR bonus points if there are pickles, which there were. I give this place four stars...not five but only because the service was a bit on the slower side and there weren't many customers. But I do recommend the food and if I ever visit this place again and the service has gotten better, I will definitely update my review."}
{"text":"When I come to town to visit I eat here nearly every morning. Best breakfast place in town! Potatoes are so good and they always have the hot tea I like. My daughter always gets the waffle and it's so yummy every time!"}
{"text":"My wife and i stopped in early one morning on our way out to Hoover dam. I had a bowl of chili and a hotcake; my wife bacon and eggs. You just can't find chili like this in California; it's tops! All the rest is #1 as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast after heading out from Vegas to Hoover Dam.  We all were hungry!  My husband and I own a burger spot, so we can appreciate good food.  He ordered French toast and biscuit and gravy, I had the Spicy Potato Pancakes breakfast.  I have learned to order food we don't make at our spot.  He enjoyed his breakfast, meaning he ate everything, as did I.  The sausage patties on the kids plate looked crisp on the edges, but I didn't taste them.  My niece said her bacon was not the best she has had and her \"those potatoes\" could have more flavor.  Overall, we were satisfied with the service and our food.  We know everyone cooks differently and we certainly appreciate made to order food!"}
{"text":"I am contemplating 3 stars versus 4 stars. Nothing bad happened, so I will go with 4 instead of 3. Usually when going to Boulder City we hit one of the other well known breakfast joints but we wanted to switch it up this time so we went with Southwest.  Cute, small, restaurant with minimal parking up front and a bigger lot in the back. Although that lot does fill up quick in busier hours. The décor is all Southwest, old school diner feel. It somewhat felt like I was at my grandparents house. They seek out antique stuff for design. Absolutely love the interior.  As soon as we walked in, I could tell this is a place locals frequently dine. We were obviously outsiders, but we usually are so we were ok with that.  The waitress promptly sat us and took our drink order.  Instant love when I see the OJ comes in 8oz, 16oz, or 32oz. My bf and I always want OJ and he loves a larger juice, me not so much since I usually drink coffee too.  (They also offer bloody marys, and one day I am so doing a BOULDER CITY BLOODY MARY CRAWL!) Anyway, he ordered the French toast and I ordered the everything sandwich that includes avocado, bacon, cheese, eggs, and green chilies on some freaking awesome sourdough bread. My sandwich did not come with anything else though, like potatoes or fruit. Weird, it should have.  Overall, we were fed, full, paid, satisfied, and out the door within 45 minutes. I will return, but only every 4 times I come to BC, because I still have a few other diners I enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom while she was visiting. The food and service were awesome. An older woman actually fell and had to be rushed off by an ambulance so it was kind of crazy but we still had a good time. Be careful in the front when walking in, there's a yellow painted single step that doesn't stand out. That's were the older woman tripped!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite dinner in Boulder City! Every time I eat here, I am extremely happy! The staff is friendly and efficient, prices are reasonable, and the food is comfort food goodness. Plus they gave the best from scratch pie ever! Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Pretty quaint little place up in Boulder. The staff is friendly and its clean. The prices are average and there's a large menu with lots to choose from. I ordered the French toast which was pretty ordinary. I will probably stop by again to try a more stunning dish."}
{"text":"Passing through, super cute place. Food was amazing! Large portions, so beware."}
{"text":"The Chile relleno breakfast casserole is to die for. Super cute place with outdoor seating. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"if i would have rated this off my first experience it would have gotten 5 stars. the first time i ordered the chili verde burrito and it was delish.. my girl got the huevos rancheros and was very satisfied as well .... followed by their fresh strawberry pie ... i was very very satisfied ( as was my friend) . the service was good it was slow so the waitress was attentive. a few weekends later we were in boulder city for the spring jamboree so we stopped in again being it was so good the first time.... ehh ... the service was not very well... my friend ordered rancheros again and barely touched it.. i tried the fajitas and my kiddo got a grilled cheese... my food wasn't bad but i was given 1 tortilla and enough meat for 3 fajitas ... i asked for another and didn't get it til i was ready to leave.. my kiddo said the grilled cheese wasn't good either and idk how you can mess that up.. the final straw which deducts an additional star was watching the hostess wipe up a table drop food on the floor pick it up with the same rag and go right back to wiping the table... she said she was new but c'mon  would you want to eat off that table ??? if we ever go back it will be to get a strawberry pie... to go"}
{"text":"I can make better food at home. Wait staff was slow and didn't know specials or if they had items on their menu. Pass this place up. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Love the chile relleno casserole, the pies are great, corned beef and cabbage on St Pat's Day was the best I ever had. Nice, homey atmosphere and helpful wait staff. One of my favorite restaurants in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"We arrived at the diner this morning around 1020 and only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. We got our beverages pretty quick despite the place being extremely busy, unfortunately the waiter took almost 12 minutes to take our order and took another tables order first, even though they were seated well after us. I ordered the chicken fried steak which is always cooked and served perfect. Except for this time, the eggs were not hot, nor were the hash browns or chicken fried steak.. the gravy was almost to the point of thickening. I told the waiter that the food was not acceptable and he was very apologetic and asked if I wanted anything else of which I declined. My wife was well into her breakfast and to be quite honest I had lost my appetite due to the bad experience. He took my order off the bill and again was very apologetic. Even with this bad experience we will still go there as we have for several years now as the food and the service is usually outstanding. This is by no means a review to stop anyone from eating at the fine establishment. I don't consider one bad experience in all the the years that we have been frequenting a reason to stop. We will be back. Thank you for being an excellent restaurant with fine food and service"}
{"text":"After three years as a resident, we just discovered Boulder City's gem. On the main street, you see a cacophony of unique stuff out front and the sign that promises Southwest Cuisine. We were in time for lunch, not so crowded on a Thursday as we expected, but busy nonetheless. Greeted by a pleasant waitress, we were seated and visited three times by three different people for our drinks. The staff is very attentive. We ordered Spinach Enchiladas for G-man and the Chili Relleno casserole for me. We were not disappointed! Flavorful with out being too spicy. Took half of mine home for supper. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have never been here until today. The food was delicious. We had the chicken fajitas and Bacon cheeseburger. Burger was cooked well, and the chicken was tender and tasty. The tortilla was homemade and light. Not only that, but they had two large parties and our food came out FAST. We will be bank. Great place, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"That small town feeling is immediate when you walk in.  You are greeted by fabulous customer service and a fun atmosphere.  You are seated quickly and the kids menu and crayons are provided for the little ones.  The food is very good and comes quickly. The banana bread is not only tasty but soft and flavorful.    Overall, a fun family dining environment.  Truly enjoyed my conversation with the hostess and the kindness they provided to my children."}
{"text":"I love drinking out of huge Mason jars, instead of glasses.  I don't remember the name but have the sandwich that is basically just grilled cheese with pot roast on it, AMAZING.  It was not only a good grilled cheese but also had some delicious pot roast!"}
{"text":"I make one annual road trip from Phoenix to Vegas every September for a bicycle race called CrossVegas. For the last 3 years I have burned rubber out of Vegas early in the morning to have breakfast at THE BEST diner that is NOT VEGAS. Classic American breakfast fare. The Corned Beef Hash is definitely NOT from a can but actual slow stewed shredded corned beef. Standard breakfast breads for toast include banana bread. Standard bottomless cup of coffee fuels my drive for hours."}
{"text":"Went to Southwest Diner for breakfast.  Sat on the patio and table was dirty (not a big deal, we sat down as soon as someone left).  When I asked the bus-girl if she could wipe it off and pick up the food from the prior customer, she gave me a dirty look!  Then we ordered coffee, creamer, and water from her.  She brought the coffee, but no creamer and no water.  When our waitress came to take our order, I told her we had no creamer or water still.  She looked at the bus-girl and asked her to get our creamer and water.  Waited another 10 minutes and still nothing!    I finally walked inside and spoke with our waitress and 2 other servers standing there and explained our frustrations.  Of course they apologized, and then I learned that the \"bus-girl\" was actually the owner's daughter and she was new!    We have been here multiple times and never had a bad experience.  I understand being \"new\" but this girl had a major attitude and we were extremely disappointed.  If the owner wants to hire her own daughter, she had better find someone who is willing to train her daughter AND not be afraid to complain about her if needed.  It seemed as if the other employees were afraid to say something to the owner.    Food was so-so, coffee was terrible, and there were bees flying all over the pancake syrup that the staff leaves on the patios outside."}
{"text":"After eating expensive breakfasts in Vegas the whole weekend we went looking for a good breakfast away from the strip. Found this place thru yelp. It's a small diner with outside seating. Coffee was great and loved the flower pot mugs. Breakfast was good I had the French toast with bacon and my other half had ham and eggs. Service was excellent! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the cutest diners we ate at on our road trip. It is located six miles from Hoover Dam and in the direction towards home so we had to stop. The food here is good and they people are lovely.  Everything Sandwich: Bread, healthy serving of avocado, egg and bacon (minus the cheese)... Everything I want in a sandwhich!  Chicken Fried Steak: Super hearty/heart attack. Tender meat, think delicious gravy. Definitely and awesome indulgence meal if you can afford the calories.  Santa Fe Potato Special: The best I can describe it is potato pancakes with corn and cilantro served with sour cream and a side of spiced apple slices (sorta like apple pie filling but not soggy and with a little crunch). Eat it however you want according to our server!  Peanut Butter Chocolate Pie: like a peanut butter cup but airy! And in pie form.   Super cute diner - would come again if I'm in the area.   *they change their decor based on the season*"}
{"text":"Awesome find for us in Boulder City. We were not eating bread of potatoes, so no comment on them.   However, everything was awesome. From the greeting, service and staff.   Amazing bacon and food as well.   Loved their coffee cups so much we got two."}
{"text":"It's kind of a time warp thing whenever I come here, because everything in Boulder city seems like you cruised in with a DoLorean from the Back to the future, and Southwest Diner is one of those place that epitomize that feeling.  Service is very attentive staff, and helpful.   I had their Meat loaf, and it was pretty good, but  I have to say, their Chicken tortilla soup is one of the best soups I had in Southern Nevada.  This became my favorite stops in BC,  sorry C.C, but your service is horrible."}
{"text":"Very average food. Barely adequate service until the 3 women working became involved in a captivating story. I never got any more help. Wanted a take out box cuz I hate to waste food but after waiting and trying to catch the wait persons eye and getting no response. I walked to the register and waited. Cashier came over and looked at me but I had no receipt to hand her. \"well, what did you have?\" fajitas. WHICH fajitas, dinner, salad?!!! She asked nastily. I paid and left a very small tip... And I'm usually very generous. Cute exterior and clean inside; I expected better food."}
{"text":"We did a get away from las vegas. Wow. Make you feel like home dinner. Everyone is nice. Good food. One of my new fav places. Will be coming back on next trip"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place....but the food was very underwhelming.   Patty Melt was a frozen burger between two pieces of rye bread. Rye bread was good.  Chimichanga meat was like jerkey. Tough to eat and swallow.   Onion rings were good but greasy.  Service was great. Very fast and polite.   Won't return.  Food was awful.  We should have tried the pie."}
{"text":"We had a pretty good meal here after checking out Hoover Dam. We kept it simple with burgers and such.  Food was good, and service was friendly. Our only challenge was if we asked for something, the server took off like a bullet without even asking if anybody else needed anything, and they did! So we felt bad asking for things. We could never finish the sentence of a couple things we needed. It was weird  Besides that, it was fine and we worked it all out.  The homemade guac was awesome! Food was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Just because you're famished, doesn't mean you should ignore the reviews.   Came to the Southwest diner after a long hike at Lake Mead and needless to say I was starving. I was greeted by the hostess and quickly sat down outside. The patio is here is solid for Boulder City people watching. I haven't seen that many cowboy boots in a while. I ordered the, \"Westerner\" a basic pulled pork sandwich with barbecue sauce, pickles, and onions. I was offered the option of fries or cucumber salad. I opted for the cucumber salad, figuring why throw away a three hour hike for some delicious fried potatoes.   The sandwich was ok, bread was soft and the meat was tender. I was upset by the lack of pickles, but I didn't feel like asking the server for any, so I suffered in silence. I also didn't like the fact that the onions were served raw. Come on, at least let him hit grill before adding them to the sandwich.   When I saw the cucumber salad, it was a major WTF moment. I was expecting sliced cucumber with some, olive oil maybe vinaigrette, with salt and pepper. Nope, what I got was cucumbers swimming in mayo and vinegar. Seriously, why the hell would you do this to veggies. I did try one and it was gross. Mayo is just plain gross.   Note to self: Next time order french fries.   \"Good service. Ok food. Southwest Diner\". Boom, there's their new slogan!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service .... little place but very good. Everything was Tasty ! Onion rings cowboy sandwich and the patty melt ! They service breakfast lunch and dinner all day."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant. There is outdoor and inside seating; the outdoor seating has misters for hot weather. Service is prompt and friendly. The food is great - you can tell its made fresh. Portions are good as well - definitely not skimpy. Parking is on the street. There is a back parking lot, but its easier to park out front on the street. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had a good breakfast here.  Just eggs, bacon and hash browns, but it great! Service was also very good and the prices weren't too high.  I'd go back if I'm ever up that way again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop. Good portions. Excellent service. Reasonably priced. The personal touches of an interested owner are evident everywhere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I can best describe it as very average. Good prices but the food is just okay.y fiance had a roast beef sandwich and it was dry. The service was also slow but maybe they were having a bad night?"}
{"text":"The Menu has several style food, Mexican, Southern and Lite. Enjoied talking with the Staff about the area and things to do"}
{"text":"Always busy but the blackened salmon salad and homemade soups are our personal favorites... always perfectly cooked snd good portions!!! We eat here at least three times a week, love the family atmosphere and friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"I was driving and couldn't look at the Yelp app for restaurants in Boulder City so my mom and friend looked out their windows until they saw a unique, quaint restaurant on the corner of the street. We had to stop because of how adorable their decorating was on the outside.  The restaurant was packed for lunch but there were a couple more tables open and we were seated immediately and promptly served water in quart size jars. The inside was just as cutely decorated as it was outside.  The food was actually the best meal we had eaten since flying into Vegas four days earlier. We ordered one cheeseburger, fries, and drink combo ($8.55), one avocado burger, fries, and drink combo ($9.70), and an avocado BLT ($7.95). We had the option of 1/3 lb vs 2/3 lb burgers and the 1/3 lb was plenty big but we ate most of it since we wanted to avoid taking leftovers to the hotel. The fries looked like McDonald's fries but tasted better and the fry sauce was the perfect dip for them. Our drinks also came in quart size jars.  After visiting the Hoover Dam we decided to return later that day for homemade dessert pies. We ordered two slices of apple pie a la mode and a triple berry pie a la mode ($4.50 ea). The pies looked better than they tasted. The crust was bland and flour-like and it was the majority of the pie which overpowered the flavor of the apple filling (see photo). The vanilla bean ice cream helped offset that blandness some but not completely.  Service, however, wasn't bland. We had two or three servers at once the first time around and each of them were friendly and attentive. Overall, our first impression of Southwest Diner was a positive one. We'll just go somewhere else for dessert next time."}
{"text":"Michele was a fantastic server.  We stopped by on way to Hoover Dam and were delightfully surprised by how fresh and home made the dishes were!  Be sure to have the pie for Dessert."}
{"text":"What a great treat. There we were in the middle of nowhere, we thought, and we made a choice. We decided to try the Southwest Diner. Our small group of eight adults who are normally difficult to please were all thrilled. These people really took care of us. In a flash they rearranged the seating to suit us, at a busy time of day. We were pleasantly surprised with the food and the service. Being just day trippers made no difference to the management. We didn't really expect to be treated like royalty. The staff couldn't have been nicer, the food was excellent. The regular local patrons contributed by being so friendly. One big happy family. Even if you have to go out of your way, just do it. This is all about what American hospitality is."}
{"text":"Was delish! If you are in the area you must stop by! The only thing I was not a fan of was \"those potatoes\". They are homemade breakfast potatoes. Felt they were bland and lacking in flavor. Everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"After a few hours at Boulder Dam in 109 degreee weather, we stopped at Southwest Diner for lunch and any cold drink we could find.  Got seated right away at a rickety table.  There were dusty flags on the window and lots of flies.  Took about 10 minutes for the waitress to notice we existed.  Ordered our food and drinks and waited about 15 minutes.  No drinks, no food.    The waitress finally delivered the food and RAN from our table as if we were contagious.  NO DRINKS.  Finally, another waitress delivered our drinks.  The only reason this place is getting a 3 is the food was good.  Fresh and tasty.  And to top it off, waitress delivered our check but never asked if we wanted some of their famous pies.    Get the dusty decorations, flies and staff problem fixed I may return"}
{"text":"If you are on the way to the Hoover Dam and face some hungry kids and adults.  This is a great place to have some local food. We had the quesadilla, burrito, and the cowboy sandwich.  A must try is the home made banana-nut-bread, it is really delicious."}
{"text":"My 3 kids, wife and I loved this place. Service was impeccable, the food was just what the doctor ordered from a classic American diner and the ambiance was classic. There were several touches, including the beverages in the mason jars, fry sauce and tin plates that made this place unique and definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD what a FANTASTIC random stop for us,  Las Vegas locals went and visited Hoover dam, stopped here after and had the best burger and strawberry rhubarb pie of my life. I'm always searching for a great burger and this was perfection.  The pie? Perfect.... amazing crust flavor texture everything.  Must check out!!"}
{"text":"Great Southwest breakfasts! Today's special is the carne asada omelet with pico, avocado, jack cheese potatoe, homemade wheat toast."}
{"text":"Nice people good food, a banana bread is an option instead of toast. My wife liked the decor. And it's not that far out of Vegas but the prices are reasonable. Home cooking is good when the cook knows what they are doing and they do."}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but the pie was incredible.  My wife had the strawberry rhubarb and sis had the blueberry, just  homemade awsomeness."}
{"text":"Good food,large portions,very friendly staff.Works for me.I will definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here by happenstance and couldn't be happier. Everything is homemade (honey mustard dressing was excellent). We had eggs and bacon, fajitas, Chile rellenos, and chef salad. Everything was fresh and delicious.   If you're going to or from Hoover Dam, stop here. It's on the way."}
{"text":"Southwest Diner is our favorite breakfast spot. We live in the Frenchman Mtn (more commonly; and incorrectly, known as Sunrise Mtn) area and we drive the 35 minutes regularly to eat here. The Biscuits and Gravy combo is my favorite. What is especially nice is that I can ask for my bacon crispy (the right way) and I actually get it crispy. Not one half crispy the other half flimsy, not burnt edges, not slightly more done than limp, but actually crispy. A concept chain breakfast spots just can't comprehend. I am by no means a coffee snob. I'll drink anything except Starbucks. But the coffee here, is exceptional. Very smooth and I almost always have two cups. The orange juice is to die for. On the pulpy side, which is fine with me, but if you don't like a lot of pulp, you've been warned. The eggs are always made exactly the way I ask them to be made. I always get \"Those Potatoes\" simply because they are awesome. Not a ton of seasoning, but cooked perfectly every time and such good flavor, they'll have you walking away saying, \"Man! Those Potatoes.....!\" We absolutely love Southwest Diner and will continue to make a special trip just for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times and always liked the food and service. This time however the staff must have had a bad day and my steak sandwich was unedible. The staff wasn't friendly and my $14 steak sandwich ended up in the trash as it was all fat. I don't know if it was a cost cutting measure, that is why I never order a steak sandwich except here at Southwest Diner. The owner must have taken the day off."}
{"text":"What a gem in the desert  This place is an old south western cafe in Boulder City Nevada.   Food: Pork chili verde is the bomb!, put it on everything. All the food is made from scrap.  Freshly baked deserts are available after you eat.  Atmosphere: They have inside and outside dining. There is never a long wait.  Service:  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Simple food served hot in an unpretentious environment for a reasonable price. I  heartily recommend Southwest Diner  if your near Boulder City.  We had eggs(fried and scrambled with chopped ham), \"Those potatoes\" and banana bread. Water served in LG ?jelly glasses...nice  touch. About $15 including tip."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good little diner here in Boulder City.  Pop in here for lunch on a Saturday and went with the green chili verde burrito. It was super filling and seasoned to perfection. Don't worry it's not a spicy Verde concoction. But it does deliver well on taste.  The service was spot-on and there was plenty of room inside. For dessert I opted to go with the peanut butter chocolate cream pie which was out of sight for the filling but the crust tasted a little stale.   Definitely a place you want to stop by if you're passing through the area."}
{"text":"The everything breakfast sandwich with chilies, avocado, bacon, and eggs on sourdough is so yummy, I would probably get it for breakfast/lunch every day if I lived in Boulder City. Boyfriend had an omelet which was tasty. Coffee was good.  Waitress was nice but rushed. Oh well, it's a diner, so I guess that's to be expected."}
{"text":"A wonderful diner next door to the motel we stayed in (highly recommended, the El Rancho Boulder Motel). My kids raved about the food, and deservedly so. Try their banana bread, potato pancakes, and omelettes.   We give this five stars for a diner. Four if it were a different kind of restaurant, but five for a diner. It was good eating!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! All four at our table were satisfied. I got one of their specialties - the southwest potato pancakes with apple, eggs, and pumpkin bread, and it was fantastic! The decor is fun - it's filled with all sorts of fun antiques - though a little cold to us. I heartily recommend it!"}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this place they premix their margaritas the chips and salsa taste like it's out of a can in package my mom's burger looks good but I didn't have any.     Experiments at your own risk"}
{"text":"Have eaten at the restaurant many times but this will be my last.  The wait staff was horrible except for the buser/hostess  they were rude and lazy.  I was there with my parents and 3 kids and it took forever to get service.  Our food sat in the back under the warmers for a good 7 minutes they waitress had no clue and were just standing around gossiping. Once we were served our food 2 of the meals were cold and we had to send them back.   Nothing like being put in the microwave to reheat it. People would walk into the restaurant and the staff would just walk by them and no one one sit them I was in shock.  I will never eat here again and honestly the way the wait staff was I am afraid to see what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on our way back from AZ. Its a nice cozy country setting. The service is good and staff is friendly. The food is really good and no waiting. Parking is a little tight but I can deal with that. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It's a quaint diner in Boulder City that serves an excellent breakfast.  It has both your basics as well as some more fun menu items along with a nice lunch menu too. Definitely a must stop if you're hungry. The coffee is OK and could use a step up but it's acceptable.  The server is really good and attentive. Price is a decent value too.  Me like this place."}
{"text":"Im going to have to disagree with Dover's review. Probably one of the cutest little diners I've been to. We were greeted immediately and asked what we wanted to drink. My parents got coffee and my brother, boyfriend, and I got cold drinks. The coffee cups were adorable and cold drinks are served in mason jars. All staff were quick to ask if we wanted refills, even with less than half the drink gone.   I got a breakfast burrito and it was huge, I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend got chicken friend steak and it's the best I've tasted. My brother got pancakes, he was going to get a full stack but it was recommended by the waitress to get a half stack. Good recommendation, he was stuffed. My parents split an omelet and couldn't finish it because it was so big.   All of the staff we encountered were beyond amazing. This was a quaint little place with great breakfast and exceptional service."}
{"text":"This was such a challenging review for me to write.  I was so torn by this place.  It just had me becoming wishy washy about what to give it.  So I opted for A-OK and here's why:  Atmosphere:  This place reminded me of a cross between a mom & pop shop, a diner and an eclectic hole in the wall.  It was just a mish mash of ideas and didn't leave me with a specific theme to describe it.  But it was clean, so guess that counts for something.  3 star worthy.  Staff:  Very friendly and welcoming.  The first young lady didn't know much and tried to answer questions, but eventually asked the lady cooking to come out and describe things to us.  This lady was very helpful in the decision making process by giving well defined descriptions of what the items were like.  4 star worthy  Food:  Here's where it gets tough.  Most of this stuff you could make at home for sure and it would be about the same or maybe better.  Chips and Cheese - just that.  Chips out of a bag, topped with shredded cheese and put in oven to melt.  (I've done this late at night in the microwave after drinking)  Really??  Don't bother.  Nachos - they were OK, but again - could make this pile of chips at home.  The meatloaf was not of good quality at all.  I was frightened of it when it arrived in front of my friend.  He agreed.  Just a dried up piece of sad meat smothered in some dark brown thick glop of 'gravy'.  The home fries; however, were \"the best I've had in a while\" said my man.  And he also really enjoyed the cucumber salad.  The salmon salad special was just typical as well.  Nothing special about it: romaine lettuce, chopped tomato, etc.   Based on my dishes a 2 star, my man's a 4 - so here we go with a 3.  But let's be real here ... unless my man was dying to have those home fries again, I doubt we'd ever come back.  I don't know why this place is listed as such high ratings.  I'm going to guess maybe breakfast and pies are off the chain, but that will be the only second chance they get with me (if I'm ever back in the area)."}
{"text":"This establishment is in direct competition with the Coffee Cup here in boulder city...I know the signature dish there and should have asked here ( Chile Relleno Casserole) do yourself a favor and ask for it.... we have a variety of food here, but none too exciting...mind you we came on St. Patricks day.. and there must have been a function in the city....friendly confines and wait staff, but this visit was not the most successful....."}
{"text":"I really wish I loved this place..it looked amazing online. I got the waffle & it was a little hard & the batter was super sweet, but the banana bread was tasty. We waited for napkins for about 20 minutes or so & then had to hunt someone down for a coffee refill 20 minutes after that.(The first & last refill of the entire meal & it wasn't by our server.) Coffee was a bit weak. On the bright side, I got a rose for mother's day & the atmosphere wasn't too terrible."}
{"text":"When the Coffee Cup is packed, this is another great place for breakfast and lunch!    Plenty of outdoor seating.  The weather was great today, but we were hungry and didn't feel like waiting for outdoor seating, so we ate inside.  Lots of antique decor.  If you need an escape from Las Vegas, you will feel like you have stepped back into time here.  Also, their coffee cups look like planter pots.    I had the lluevos rancheros and tried their belgian waffle.  Both were amazing dishes.  The lluevos rancheros had juicy tender pieces of pork carnitas with green chile verde sauce (or ranchero sauce), cheese, pinto beans, potatoes, and tostada.  One of the best places to go for lluevos rancheros.      Dog friendly on the patio.  Their dishes taste like it's freshly made.  All of them.  Even looking at the hashbrowns from the other table looks like it was freshly made.    Great place for brunch prior to the Hoover Dam Tour.  Also, check out the 1937 Ford pick-up on the side of the place."}
{"text":"So I'll start off positive, the food is great! Had the spinach enchiladas and I'm actually pleasantly surprised. Now for the bad. I started off with ordering a Bloody Mary. Took about 20 minutes to get and I ended up with my food before the bloody Mary's which ended up not very good and I love bloody Mary's. The staff is all friendly and I actually would love to come back for these amazing enchiladas!"}
{"text":"Great little breakfast and brunch place. We stopped in Sunday morning on our way out of town. The place was pretty busy, there were a few tables open inside and outside on the covered patio. We were seated right away and looked over the menu.  My wife chose the breakfast burrito and I decided to try one of their burgers. Our food was delivered quicker than anticipated. My burger came with fries and a drink included, it was huge and it was only the half pound! They also offer a double (or 1 pound.)   Everything was very tasty, needless to say I didn't eat the fries.  The prices were reasonable, each of our meals were less than 10 bucks a piece. Service was quick and efficient, this is a good place to stop"}
{"text":"It's a throwback restaurant way out in Boulder City. If you are on your way out to Hoover Dam make sure you stop here for breakfast or lunch. You can't miss the place, they have an old school Las Vegas sign out front.  Its a simple diner littered with antiques everywhere. They have an antique washing machine, tools, Raggedy Ann dolls, roller skates, etc You have a choice to eat inside or outside.  They serve good ol home cooked food. We ordered the chicken fried steak, patty melt, and a huge slice of apple pie. The chicken fried steak was delicious, it had a good breading and they put a good amount of gravy without over doing it. The patty melt was on point. We recommend it if you love burgers. The apple pie was good too. They make huge pies, we couldn't finish the slice.Another cool thing is that they serve their iced t and water in mason jars.   They also have a chalkboard on the back wall that they write their specials on.  Check out Southwest Diner If you're ever out and about in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Came in with my sister, her fiance and my wife back in January. This place is great. Their food is really good and not overly priced. As a treat, my sister purchased one of the coffee mugs they sell. Will definitely come here again next time I am in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"As a resident of Boulder City, I can say we eat here often and it is always good food.  Sometimes the service gets overwhelmed but its understandable.  We really enjoy the breakfast."}
{"text":"Beside it being a kitschy kinda throw back to the 50's, 60's, I noticed the portions arent on overload. I liked that. I also liked the chile verde burrito with just the park, chile verde and cheese. It was simple and good. I also sampled Kris. bbq beef from her sandwich and that was the best bbq beef I had a long time. Good service. good find!"}
{"text":"I spent the day in Kigman, AZ and have had a major string of bad luck finding edible food there, so I wanted to scout out something it Boulder City on our way back to Vegas. I looked around on yelp and there were actually a few places that looked good in BC, but they closed by 2 or 3 pm and we would be back through after that time. I found out that Southwest Diner would be open until 8 pm, so I figured we could give them a try.   Walking inside the place was about half full and we were seated right away. Phillip, our server took drink orders right away and checked on us throughout the meal. They serve breakfast all day here and I was torn between that or a sandwich. I kept seeing soup being delivered to tables, so figured I should give it a try. Priced at $7.95 I had a \"Avocado BLT\" and it also came with my choice of side (soup included) so I had \"Cheesy Bacon Potato Soup\" which sounded too tasty. The soup was just that... tasty! it had nice big chunks of potato and a wonderful flavor. I do wish it had cheese on top or something though to live up to the \"cheesy\" part in the name. This soup would be very comforting in the winter and came inside a cute little glass jar. My sandwich was good. The bacon was thick (fatty at times) and the amount of avocado, tomato and lettuce was fair. The avocado was fresh and good! The drinks here come in either flower pots (made to be coffee and OJ cups) or really big mason jars. I was happy with the service and food and will be back to try out breakfast!   They also have a decent amount of outside seating if you don't want to eat inside."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  The waffle was very good and so was the chicken fried steak.  Coffee was mediocre but the service was friendly and quick.  Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Great stop! Down home cooking and fresh baked goods made my morning. I have to say that they have the best waffles I have ever had. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"An excellent place to stop if you're on your way to or from the Hoover Dam.  Much better to stop here for a down home meal at a reasonable price rather than going for fast food!    We both had their pulled pork sandwich special.  It was ooey-gooey awesome, and you have to eat some of the meat with a fork first before attempting to pick up the sandwich and eat it with your hands.  Fries were excellent, and the cucumber salad was \"meh\".  Our drinks came in great big mason jar glasses.  Got a glimpse of one of their soups at the next table.  Looked yummy!    Clean and kitcheney decor.  Lots of interesting antiques to look at."}
{"text":"This was an excellent random stop.   After a trade show in Vegas, we were headed back to Phoenix and stopped for a bite about 4:30pm on a Thursday. The avocado burger and a chicken sandwich with avocado were tasty and the drinks were large. (I don't know why I adore those large Bell jars so much but I do!) The fries are not ones I normally like, but they were tasty and the dipping sauce (ketchup, mustard, and buttermilk) was an excellent addition.  Dad and I rounded out the meal sharing a piece of apple pie that felt like it was a quarter of the pie tin! Yum! The service was good; the place comfortable. There wasn't anything over the top, but it was exactly what we were looking for. I will definitely stop again."}
{"text":"Always love heading to Southwest Diner in Boulder City. This family run breakfast diner is a unique experience in the desert city of Boulder where there is a rich history from the construction of the Hoover Dam and the workers and families they brought with them. When you walk into this diner you immediately feel how local the spot is, and the careful care it is run with.  The food is truly home cooked. The banana bread and house specialties quickly give you a taste of what they are about. Always check their specials of the day as there is always a gem or two on the menu - we had pumpkin pancakes last time we went and suggested they add chocolate chips to the batter. Their breakfast burritos are also excellent.  Definitely recommend taking the time to head to this desert gem."}
{"text":"Decided to leave Las Vegas for a little drive to Boulder City and eat at the Southwest Diner where we have eaten at least 10 times in the last 10 years.  Love the quaintness and the local feel. Prices are always reasonable especially for a little tourist spot their prices are good for the locals. Couple months ago when we visited we saw the same health code violations as we experienced on this Sunday brunch Trip.  Servwr a white male with a long beard who was at the bar wrapping silverware but we couldn't figure out what he was more focused on playing with his facial hair touching his face, mouth, nose or the silverware... it was a draw. Hand to beard ..flirt with the other server... wrap silverware... hand to mouth... talk to another server ...wrap silverware.  When it came time to exchange money with another server touch the dollar bills ... laugh ... hand to beard wrap more silverware.  It was pretty gross.   We did bring it to the attention when we asked for a manager, there didn't really seem to be one... no one knew who to ask to come speak to us.  The burger was okay, u could tell it wasn't homemade.  Justa frozen patty.  Bathroom is disgusting. The picture ledge by our table caked with dust.   You get the local joint feel, but restaurants when it comes to health code and cleanliness need to stop operating like a mom and pop.. I want my dining room and kitchen and health procedures to come first.  It worries me when you glance into the kitchen what you might find.  For that u get a one-star,  freshness of the food unique flavor a two-star only because the chili was homemade. Price is very fair... 3 star. Atmosphere for a local Diner a 4-star."}
{"text":"There's a lot of things I'll miss about going to Las Vegas; this is at the top of my list.  It was so unique...and just, original. Staff was pleasant and the food (I had flautas) was amazing. I'm a sucker for drinks in jars and the menu was fantastic; just like the decor. If you're going to or coming from the Hoover Dam, you have to stop here.   Even if you'll be nowhere near the Hoover Dam or Boulder City, stop here."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was not the best. And the celing fans need to be dusted. Badly."}
{"text":"Fast fabulous service and delicious food. Very filling. Kids loved the quesadillas, tacos, and chips. Homemade salsa chunky and fresh. My salad was so big I couldn't finish it. Delicious. (They don't take Discover but it was worth it)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service for a good price!  Carne asada omelet was the best omelet I've ever had. So much food"}
{"text":"Avocado BLT was delicious as was the strawberry rhubarb pie!  Great service and cute diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't come here. People are assholes. The hash browns look and taste like raw fettuccini noodles. If you don't want hash browns they will offer you a side of tomatoes......  No one cared or apologized that I was leaving unhappy."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's super cute inside and the waiters/waitresses are always so sweet. Every item that I've ordered here has been great, I love the avocado burger. However, my friend did order the nachos once and he was completely not pleased with them. So my suggestion would be, order a burger not nachos. :)"}
{"text":"Our usual place was busy, so we gave this sunny little diner a shot. I had the biscuits and gravy.  My husband tried the breakfast burrito. We were both very pleased with our meal and especially pleased with the fresh brewed iced tea and the friendly service.  This is one of the few places in the area that really gets the breakfast gravy right.  The gravy is white, fluffy, and has large chunks of sausage.  No tiny fine sausage.  This is hearty gravy!  The biscuit was fluffy and soft.  They were kind enough to accommodate me with a half order, so I really appreciated that as well.  Definitely recommend this diner as a good stop in Boulder City."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good. People were enjoying their food. Now why did I gave it only 3's, the men's bathroom was filthy and not one day filthy. I'm sure an employee must of looked at it. Not sure if I would be back."}
{"text":"Omg homemade corned beef hash!! Great staff, delicious food, and a pie list a mile long! Don't miss this adorable spot."}
{"text":"Great food. Real southwest cuisine and very large portions. Susan was full of personality and as sweet as they come.  Sit outside and don't  miss this gem"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend and I have to say it was pretty tasty.  Inside is very cramped.  We chose to eat outside even though it was windy. With that being said it made my fries cool off very quickly. They have beer and wine.  I had a cheeseburger which claimed to be the juiciest and beefiest around.  First bite and BLOOP! grease dripped onto my shirt.  Maybe I didn't read the menu well enough I was making sure no mayonnaise came on it but it came with onions, tomato and lettuce and glop of mystery condiment which I scraped off. I didn't know all that stuff came in it or I would have asked for it plain. My friend had a patty melt and he liked it.  It looked delicious.  The service was good, our server had to take our order not facing us because of how windy it was so that was kind of funny. I didn't like the dessert selection. Lots of pies.  So if you are a pie person this is your place."}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast spot that everyone now knows about. Came on a Sunday morning and it was a long wait. We had already driven there so wait we did. Now the reason for 3 stars only was the mistake after mistake on our order.    The food was delicious. I would try this again if I lived in the area to give them another shot but I don't. It was good that I received extra food but it was a pain having to get them to correct two different plates due to mistakes."}
{"text":"I've passed this diner many times on the way to explore other hidden gems in Boulder City.  However, this trip into BC was all about Southwest Diner and it's delicious offerings.    There is a small lot located behind the restaurant to park and we found interesting knickknacks and antiques throughout the interior and exterior of the space on our walk to and fro.  This restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating (complete with misters).  It was pretty hot out, so we chose to sit indoors, but there were a few tables of diners enjoying their meals al fresco.    We were greeted and seated immediately upon entering.  The larger dining room was full, so we were seated in the smaller cash register side of the space.  Seating is a little tight in spots at these 4 tables, but everyone was friendly.  I even got some unsolicited advice from a regular at the next table on what to order.  Side note, they have their full menu available all day, every day, so you can order pancakes for dinner or soup for breakfast if that's how you roll.  The diner does offer cocktails, but I ordered a very good iced tea in a giant mason jar and the BF got a coffee in the cutest flower pot style mug.  He said the coffee wasn't that great, so he switched to an Arnold Palmer after the first cup.  But I bought a couple of the mugs for $10.95/ea because they were darling and will make nice Christmas stocking stuffers.  For my meal I ordered the Chili Verde Omelet with \"those potatoes\" and the banana bread.  The green chili was very good and the omelet had a nice mix of flavors.  The potatoes, mixed with green peppers and onions, were good, but lacked salt.  The banana bread was amazing!  Moist without being oily, with big chunks of walnuts.  Good thing you only get two slices, because I could have eaten the whole loaf!  The BF ordered the Special #3: 1 egg, sausage patties, and pancakes and he added an additional egg for $0.50.  I tried the plate sized pancakes and they were good, but the batter lacked something I could not pinpoint...maybe a splash of vanilla?  I also picked up a fresh whole housemade triple berry pie to go.  We had company for dinner and this made a perfect dessert.  Everyone basically licked their plates clean.  This thing was sooo sinfully delicious.  I would definitely try their other pies on our future visits."}
{"text":"Good for what it is; reasonable, tasty food in a kitschy atmosphere...not healthy by any means, but why would it be?"}
{"text":"Get there burgers!!! Bring everyone you know. It's great, old school charm."}
{"text":"We intended to go to another restaurant based on Yelp. However, despite Yelp saying it was open, they were closed.  Lucky for us,  this was just down the street. We sat outside. Service was excellent. The chili rellano casserole was outstanding. And where else do you get banana bread with your breakfast? Highly recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great place.  The Californian was very surprising.   Did not want to stop but wife insisted.  Glad she did.  Would easily stop here again and recommend to anyone on the way to/from Hoover Dam"}
{"text":"Really good food. And the chocolate cream pie was to die for! Great food and good pricing ."}
{"text":"I have been getting together for lunch with a friend who moved to Nevada this spring.  This time, I made the drive easier for him by meeting in his hometown, Boulder City, at the Southwest Diner.  We were immediately greeted and seated.  Our two iced teas were brought in alrge Mason jars and we began to talk about hikes and bike rides and dawdled with the menu.  Our server came back for the order and we were at all ready.  Time to get on task.  When she came back the second time, we were ready to order.  I went with the California sandwich which the menu describes as fresh turkey, bacon, tomatoes and cheddar cheese on grilled sourdough.  It comes with a choice of sides and I stayed with the traditional French fries that I normally get.  We didn't wait very long when she came back with our sandwiches.  I liked that the sandwich was made with pulled apart turkey rather than being made with some lunch meat turkey.  These were serious pieces of cooked turkey.  The sandwich was good.  I was pleased that we had chosen somewhere different because I've been at another BC restaurant a whole lot of times and it was good to have something different to choose from.  I like the bric à brac that decorate the walls to give it an old time look."}
{"text":"We love this place! So friendly & good old home style food, fresh & hot!! The pies are sooo good!  We've have breakfast, lunch & supper....all were fantastic & filling! The portion sizes definitely offer an option to share... Then you can eat more pie! They sell this amazing salt scrub too, it's from heaven!! Caleb was our server & he was super polite & efficient & the other wait staff would check on us as they walked by!"}
{"text":"Nice wait staff super fast food but it wasn't very good . And the coffee tasted burnt and old. They seem to rush you they want you out right away. The food was room temp not hot and I didn't like their version of potatoes. I won't go back"}
{"text":"Excellent!!!  I highly recommend the Chili Verde Omelet!"}
{"text":"Food is typical and good service.  I don't feel there is anything special on their menu I couldn't get eleven.  The vibes are good between the decorations and the staff.  I don't refuse to go again, but not my first pick."}
{"text":"I've only tried this place once.  So far the chili verde burrito is very good.   Service is a little slow.  The menu is a little all over the map.  American and Mexican dishes.  More like a diner than a burrito place.  $10 for a burrito is a little steep, but I have to admit it's better than most I've tried.  Next time I will try a different item and form a more broad opinion.  The pies in the case looked really good.  Only negative is the parking which is basically in a back lot."}
{"text":"I love kitschy diners, and Southwest Diner has all the bases covered in that department. Adorable decor, super sweet waitresses and stick-to-your-ribs food is what you will find here.   My first visit to to Southwest Diner was for dinner and to be frank, it was pretty unremarkable. I decided to wait until I visited a second time to post a review,  and after having breakfast at Southwest Diner this past Saturday with a couple girlfriends, I have come to the conclusion that breakfast is what people should come here for.  Southwest Diner serves up basic breakfast fare, as well as a couple daily specials. We decided to split two meals between 3 of us: The corned beef hash daily special which was good but not great. The waffle we shared was the star of the meal, perfectly cooked and fluffy, all three of us raved about how tasty that waffle was. We also shared some eggs, sausage and delicious homemade banana nut bread.   Prices here are very fair for what you get. Southwest Diner is a solid choice for breakfast in Boulder City."}
{"text":"If you are heading to the Grand Canyon this is the perfect stop for breakfast. The atmosphere is really cool and Boulder City seems like such a quiet small town. My wife and I were there way before any rush so we sat on the patio and really enjoyed it. The pancakes were huge, fluffy, and sweet. The syrup was very good too. My wife had a avocado meat and egg sandwich and it was amazing. Very fresh ingredients and bread. Those potato's were delicious. Great way to start our long day trip to the canyon. Also, one of the last stops for any real good home cooked food before the long day. The Canyon has basic carnival food that you kind of have to eat unless you bring you're own food."}
{"text":"The staff were great and our chile releno casseroles, potatoes, and banana bread were excellent.  The bloody mary was also very tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and we weren't very pleased. First of all, the price was more than what we added up from their online menu. We asked for a total before getting off the phone so we could have the exact amount ready. We couldn't figure out why it was more than their online prices but since it was only $4 we didn't worry about it much (and yes, we figured in the tax). When we went to pick the food up, the total was even MORE than the quoted total on the phone. What? Why? She said it was because we substituted something but we did that when we ordered so you would think that it would have been added in when we placed the order. Weird. Plus, when we ordered, every time we had a question, we were told to hold on and she would check. It would take several minutes for her to come back with the answer. They weren't hard questions either. It was stuff like, what pies do you have or what's the bread of the day. It's stuff she should have known.   The food looked good and was still warm when we got home to eat it.   The cheeseburger was good. The meat patty was thick and cooked perfect.   The beef fajita salad was pretty bland. It needed something to kick up the flavor.   The tacos were ok but here's the kicker...we paid for a three taco plate but only got two tacos! :(   The fajita chicken was ok. The chicken breast was large and had a good amount of peppers and cheese on top. It needed salt but that's fixable.   The cornbread was really good. It was nice and dense which we really liked.   Get this though...the substitute that we had to pay for, wasn't even included!! We were supposed to get mashed potatoes and gravy with the chicken but asked for the cucumber salad to be substituted. We didn't get the salad! Super annoying but we didn't have time to drive back to get it.   The peach pie and ice cream was amazing! The pie was for sure the redeeming item of this meal. I would go back for the pie but not the food because I can't trust that it will be made right and be the price that's stated."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped In for a late lunch before going to  Art In the Park.  Our first choice was The Coffee Cup but the wait was too long so we decided to give Southwest Diner a try.  What lured us in was the homemade pies sign on our drive into town :) Items ordered: Chili Dog with Fries, Steak Sandwich with Fries, Bacon & Eggs with Hash Browns & Banana Bread, Banana Cream Pie and Peach Pie. Everyone enjoyed their food :)  Restaurant Is cute. Service was fast & friendly."}
{"text":"The chili relleno breakfast casserole is to die for- with those potatoes and the banana bread!! If you have room for your sweet tooth must try the strawberry rhubarb pie! Also my favorite server, Sara never disappoints! I love coming in for breakfast, and always order my pies for the holidays! Such a warm cozy place, great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing food every single time we come here. Try the pie, corned beef hash, pancakes, burgers...try anything at all and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"The sausage gravy/ biscuits were very good. Eggs we're fresh . The omelette was also very good. Homemade banana bread was great"}
{"text":"Very great establishment in the Boulder City Area. We have been going here for a few years now. GREAT restaurant and GREAT food. Lots of great staff and good location"}
{"text":"Working in Boulder City, I've had the opportunity to eat here on multiple occasions. The selections I've tried have been hit or miss. Pumpkin pancakes were dry and tasteless. BUT, the blacked salmon salad is amazing. It's my go to option. Staff are nice and old fashioned atmosphere makes it a cool place to have lunch."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I'm not sure how our family's dinner experience could be so different from everybody else's. Everything came out cold and looking as if it came from a can. The toast came our burnt and very cold and soggy. I would not go back. The server was great no complaints there, the good just wasn't good. I only gave 2 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"Staff seemed friendly to my party and the food came out on time. I was pleasantly impressed with the fish tacos. The bathroom is kind of scary. The doorknob has a weird lock that you have to figure out on your own. Traditional locks are the way to go."}
{"text":"You drive through this tiny town and it has good, cheap food that was as good as the so-called best restaurants in Vegas.  I had a seven dollar breakfast burrito that had more flavor than my $27 eggs bendict (in Vegas).  The breakfast burrito is huge--lots of peppers and eggs but I wanted to make sure I would not be hungry on the way to the Hoover Dam and during our tour there so it was more than enough food.  They have a good salsa to go with it.  My friends had other eggs dishes and liked them.  I felt like I was in the middle of a small town and often there is no good food or terrible touristy food and this place was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time we visit we have to stop by and sit on their patio for some coffee and a slice of pie. The whole menu is delicious, you won't be disappointed if you decide to try something different every time! I highly recommend the triple berry pie!"}
{"text":"Whoa, Nelly!  Okay, so, my California sandwich was pretty tasty. Our had some of the best bacon I've had in a sandwich, ever.   The fries were good. The fry sauce was thin and left a little to be desired. Now,  the chocolate/peanut butter cream pie was effing delicious. EFFING DELICIOUS.  If it comes to your table looking limp and lame, don't let that fool you. It's crazy good."}
{"text":"We eat at the dinner every Sunday morning and sometimes for lunch or dinner!  The food is delicious. The staff is wonderful. Best bet if in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Great stop on the way to grand canyon..almost gave up and went to jack in the box. YELP saved us!! Great food and great service!!"}
{"text":"Meh.... nice service by really weak coffee.  Spicy Potato pancaked ended up being grilled mash potatoes.  Large pancakes were ok. Homemade applesauce were really just sliced cinnamon apples slightly cooked so don't call it applesauce please.  Expected more."}
{"text":"Southwest Diner is a cute and quirky place. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the server was very nice and attentive. However my lunch was just OK. I ordered The California turkey sandwich and it wasn't that flavorful. My dining companion had a chili dog which he liked just fine. Since we were traveling we weren't able to take our leftovers home. I really liked visiting Boulder City and next time we will come back and try the homemade pie."}
{"text":"We drive all the way from 7 Hills to eat here.  Don't make the mistake of ordering a full stack of pancakes...TWO will be plenty!  The maple syrup is excellent and the milk or soda comes in a large jar so you get plenty!  The pies are made there and are worth the trip just for dessert if you are so inclined."}
{"text":"Sometimes you wonder...when you're really hungry does the food taste better....no it doesn't...this place is nothing short of phenomenonal...great service, amazing food..worth the detour of the highway..I recommend the Santa Fe Potato pancakes..."}
{"text":"The outdoor tables were covered in dried food goop on our last visit.  When we asked if it could be wiped down, the busboy explained the establishment doesn't clean the outdoor tables they just clear the dishes.  Pretty gross."}
{"text":"Was in town for a meeting, and we found this place on the main drag. They had a lot of options that looked really good. They had enough places and was t over crowded at 1230 for lunch. I had a great bowl of chili to start off but I could have just eaten that. I got the special Tex mex salad because I saw someone else with it. It was really huge and amazing flavor. They give you drinks in big maso jars which always seems to make something taste cooler and better. They had several pieces of pie but was too full to try them. I was very disappointed I didn't get too go back the next day for try something else and get pie. Wait staff was very nice and kept our glasses full. It's definitely got that small town diner feel too it. It had great food and that family welcoming atmosphere. If I'm in Boulder City again, I will definitely stop in even if it's just for s snack of pie."}
{"text":"This is nice small restaurant  on your way to the Hoover dam. It is very unique with great decor and good food. The service is superior and very fast. I had the broccoli and cheese omelet and my husband had the Denver omelette. It was a big portion with hash browns and bread on the side. See photos. The prices are good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch while exploring old downtown Boulder City.  They have a fun country diner decor with many collectibles from days gone by.  The staff was friendly, but they were very busy and our waitress was a bit scattered.  There were quite a few staff working together to make sure all the tables were covered.  I decided to get the breakfast potato pancakes.  I love German potato pancakes so this was a logical choice.  It came with 2 eggs, cinnamon apples, banana bread, and sour cream.  The eggs were good and cooked well as over easy.  The banana bread tasted good as well.  The cinnamon apples were cold and undercooked.  The potato pancakes were not what I was expecting.  They were basically balls of lightly seasoned mashed potatoes with not much flavor.  They fell apart like mashed potatoes and didn't really meet my expectations for a potato pancake.  The iced tea was served in a mason jar and they stopped by to make sure it was full regularly.  The prices were all over $10 for most all items on the menu and on the specials board."}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this place. The front outside shaded seating is perfect for breakfast. Bloody Mary's, delish!  Servers were so nice! Breakfast Burrito, French Toast, those Potatoes, bacon, fresh orange juice, coffee, all so great!  This is our new Vegas tradition!"}
{"text":"Great place to dine. Good food, friendly service and dogs welcomed on the patio. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"With its hiking trails, charming downtown, Lake Mead, Hoover Dam and bridge to Arizona; Boulder City is the Gateway to Adventure. The best part of setting off on the adventure is a delicious Boulder City breakfast.     When it comes to delicious breakfast, you could litteraly say that Boulder City is eggcelent. Before starting off on recent Boulder City adventures I had the good fortune of dining in the Boulder Dam Hotel and the Coffee Cup a few times and Mel's Diner. They all served good food. Before my two most recent Boulder City adventures,  I put the Southwest Diner to the test.    Southwest Diner is off of Nevada Way where the roadside motels merge into the downtown historic district. It is a small historic building that reminds me of a US 66 diner.     The diner itself is decent sized. There are two rooms with sufficient tables and there is outdoor seating overlooking Nevada Way.  Unlike the Coffee Cup down the street, there was no wait. Just like the Coffee Cup, it was service with a smile. The best way to describe the interior is to visualize a cozy cottage.    Now I'll talk about the food. On the first visit, I ordered the 3 eggs with \"those potatoes,\" and toast with coffee. The eggs were good but nothing eggcelent. My minor gripe was that I failed to find a breakfast combo that came with bacon and eggs. And regardless that \"those potatoes\" were good, I don't know why they'd be famous as their website boasts. The Boulder Dam Hotel and Coffee Cup had equally good potatoes. The second visit I ordered an avocado blt. Believe it or not I have actually had pathetic BLT sandwiches in recent times. However, the Southwest Diner avocado BLT lifted my tastebuds far north. The sandwich featured a nice amount of bacon and avocado. It left a decent aftertaste toward the restaurant. The fries were likewise tasty. As far as their coffee, it was not bad and not fantastic. It was drinkable.    Southwest Diner is one of the mom & pop restaurants in Boulder City where you can end an adventure. They close at 8 p.m. unlike Coffee Cup and Mel's Diner that close in the early afternoon. Looking at their menu, chicken parmesan might be the perfect ending to a future Boulder City adventure.  3.5 stars = :)"}
{"text":"Great pies and( I think pie specials near closing time!) But, for breakfast, the corned beef hash/eggs/ potatoes are my favorite with the homemade sourdough toast! The coffee is always fresh too. My husband likes the meatloaf for dinner. Cute indoor/outdoor dining atmosphere and I've never had anything but great customer service there."}
{"text":"Came here once... Loved it.. Repeated and loved it again!  At the beginning of the \"strip\" in DT Boulder City so you miss the chaos of just a block or two down  Great patio, quiet minus the roar of the awesome bikes riding in and out  I got the \"Everything\" Breakfast Sandwich.. Added onions as well as a side of great Hash Browns.. With onions  The male server was actually excited about my order- making me confident I made a good choice.. I did  He was attentive but never pushy and knew when to check up and when not to  Great service with great food. 5 Stars!  Added a large Southwest Special which is like a Vodka Cran OJ or something. Refreshing - not strong but just right  Not sure they use real Vodka as I think it's beer n wine only.  Might wanna Chk Into that   Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"First time through Boulder City and stopped here. Bright, comfy atmosphere inside, but also outdoor seating. Nice selection of breakfast things, sandwiches, and other plates. Beef barley soup was GREAT! Could have eaten another bowl but had to save room for pie. Thanks everyone at Southwest Diner. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place in the whole area to eat.  Not so now. For the third time, I have asked for rare and gotten well done.  The first time my hamburger steak was spectacular, rare and juicy; the second time was a 1 pound hamburger steak, well done, after returning it once.  The second was the same - why I did it I don't know.  The third was tonight when I wanted liver and onions, rare.  Guess what - it came out well done, and previously cooked at that. It was like cutting into leather, dry, tasteless shoe leather.   My wife had meatloaf, which used to be a 3/4 inch slice of the best home made meatloaf you ever had.  Now its a 3/8 inc slice of frozen meatloaf with gravy.   I'm quitting this place. Sorry, wish it was like it used to be."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast diners in the Las Vegas area. They have suite indoor seating and a large sidewalk outdoor seating are. The menu is limited for breakfast lunch and dinner, but the quality is excellent. With the lone exception of their bread for toast, everything is made fresh. Furthermore they offer selections for vegetarians.   The best breakfast dish is the Chili Relleno Casserole. It is delicious. Also food portions are reasonable not too much and not to little. Solid four stars. The ONLY issue we have is finding parking because this place is always packed and parking is sparse. Be prepared to take a stroll after you park and before you eat."}
{"text":"What a lovely little diner. The place is clean and so are the bathrooms. This small diner is normally busy but the staff is super friendly and always tries to accommodate my party of 6. My children enjoy ordering breakfast for lunch. I like Les Club sandwich. It has fresh chunks of roasted turkey that most places don't have. Great favors and great people. This cute little diner also has nice patio seating if you'd like to enjoy the 8 - 9 months of the year that the temperature is below 100 degrees. I always enjoy stopping off here whenever we get to Boulder City. Parking is on the street out front and on the side as well. Additional parking directly behind the diner too in a small parking lot.  Debbie was amazing and oh so nice. She makes this place feel like home."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. We came here yesterday after the Hoover Dam for brunch and had to come back for dinner from Luxor before we had back home tonight!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! From being from the south we where very happy to find the place. Sweet tea outstanding"}
{"text":"First time here. Great good, great service. Tried the Everything Breakfast Sandwich....amazing!! Don't miss this place.  Charming!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Fresh and well perportioned,great service as well. We will be back next year"}
{"text":"Salty diner food that oddly has very little actual taste. The vegetables are canned and the food is bland. It is a bit dirty and ugly inside but really the food is the standout for why I would not go back. The service is good and friendly and the dining room is alright if dated but the food is really not good. The amount of salt made my hands painfully swollen and the taste is just not worth the pain. It is not disgusting food so that is why I will give Southwest Diner a 2 star rating"}
{"text":"My girl and I stopped here on our way back to Vegas from the Hoover Dam this afternoon. We picked this place kinda randomly, and we're glad we did. We were seated right away and our server, Kaleb, was pleasant and attentive... always a plus, in my book!  The sandwiches we ordered were generous in size, very tasty, and served fairly quickly. The cucumber salad was particularly enjoyable, and the prices reasonable (especially compared to the outrageously inflated Vegas prices!).   The bathrooms were also pretty clean.   If this place was local to where I live, and I wish they were, I'd be a regular customer.   Recommended, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Disappointed buy the prices. The flies outside. If there's flies outside there's flies in the kitchen. Waitress was mumbling not speaking clearly and just not personable. We wanted to try something different. We ended up leaving after we ordered drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way to Flagstaff.  Wanted a local place.  This fit the bill. Food was good and the prices were reasonable.  I had the chili burger and the wife had the avocado BLT.  Sit outside and enjoy the weather. Best damn restaurant by a dam site."}
{"text":"What a great place! \"Those potato's\" are awesome must haves!  Great breakfast items and lunch , first class service ! Fast food and friendly service."}
{"text":"First time in town. I had just finished a local run and decided to head over for a small bite to eat. The place was a little busy but we were able to get a table out in the patio. Our waitress came by and grabbed are drink and food orders. It was s beautiful day to sit ourself! Our food came relatively quickly given how busy they were. The food was great and received a generous portion. Far too much for me to eat after a run so I ended up with a to go box. If I am ever in the area, I will stop by and try something else!"}
{"text":"After numerous less than stellar meals in Las Vegas my girlfriend and I decided to eat at a local smaller town restaurant in Boulder City on our way back to AZ.  Once we walked in and saw the quirky decor and were greeted right away so pleasantly by the staff we started to get our hopes up for good food!  They have the best chicken fried steak I have ever had!  The food was quality and fresh yet very affordable.  It's obviously not a filet mignon from your favorite steakhouse, but was a way better dining experience for me than most places I've been to.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling through Boulder City, you won't be disappointed.  The server there was also very friendly, yet not too friendly to where he was annoying.  He had a great mix of service and verbal banter which is hard to accomplish as a waiter. Kudos to you waiter who's name I can't remember you were awesome!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and not quite sure if we will return.  The service was ok and the food was good.  We were able to sit outside with our dog which we loved.  If you are looking for a diner type place, this is a nice choice.  Prices are a little bit more than Denny's but it was ok."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times for breakfast and have enjoyed.  The prices may seem hi, until you get your food.  The omelettes are generous and tasty.  The pancakes and waffles are both good, and filling.  They know how to make \"home fries\" here.  Good coffee, good people.  Clean and inviting.  A good down-to-home place to start your day.    Dont forget to look for the daily specials on the board towards the back of the cafe!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax and enjoy great homemade small town southwest food. Ask for Susie, she won't steer you wrong. Personalized service with a constant smile.  Margaritas are excellent."}
{"text":"So the food here is descent but so covered in flys that I  couldn't eat my food .  mentioned it several times to the staff and they are like um yea. $30 breakfast. That i didnt eat. Oh and no working bathroom. Bring raid...js"}
{"text":"I wanted to give it 5 stars but had to stop at 5. Has to do with \"pie\". But first, the place is great.  The food is good, reasonably priced and very high quality ingredients.  The service staff very friendly, professional and quick. I will definitely return and recommend it to everyone...with a caveat. If you want pie, get there before 7pm.  They run out. Evidently, all the time. I don't understand this kind of business model.  But this is what I witnessed. While I was finishing my dinner on a Saturday night, the people at the table next to me wanted to order pie. The server was apologetic and said that they were all out of pie. She then told them that they run out of pie early EVERY DAY. So there were two people at the table next to me who wanted pie. I wanted pie.  There were several other parties in the restaurant. Did any of them want pie too?  See what I'm getting at? The diner just lost sales. All they had to do was have a couple extra pies on hand for the pie hungry customers.  Maybe just one fruit pie and one cream pie.  Southwest Diner goes a little out of their way to advertise their pies too.  There's usually a chalkboard sign in front advertising and banners on the window.  If they are going to make such a point of advertising their great pies, why don't they make sure to have them? Hey, I'm still a huge fan. And the truth is my waistline does not need pie. So I guess its a blessing in disguise with the pie shortage situation.  But one of these times, I'll get there early. And I will have pie."}
{"text":"We were in crappy boulder city and looked to Yelp to help us find somewhere to eat that wouldn't kill us, ended up at SW Diner. It was kind of dirty, kind of run-down, servers were obese and indifferent, food was just blah, tables were grody, just all around depressing, much like boulder city itself I suppose.  Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Lunch was great! Good portions. HOT and yummy food. Laid back vibe. Serve breakfast at lunch."}
{"text":"Worth the drive from Vegas! I had the Mick Sandwich. The sandwich had the freshest wheat bread and avocado I have ever had! \"Those Potates\" though were really good too. But the best of all was the banana bread. It was the perfect  breakfast dessert! It was moist with the right amount of sweet. Definitely worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love good home cook'n and lots of it - I LOVE this place. Nothing fancy but everything was excellent. Fresh, hot and unlike most Diners they do not think that salt is the be all and end all of cooking. Great flavors produced by great ingredients. Service is awesome and OMG save room for a piece of pie! The blueberry was out of this world and I also heavily sampled my GF's cherry pie and it was just as good. GREAT Place!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to see such negative reviews.  My family and I have been coming to Southwest Diner regularly for the past 4 years and we have nothing but good things to say about this establishment.  In fact, Southwest Diner is one of the reasons we decided to move to Boulder City.   The food is always on par and the service is excellent.  The Southwest Potato Pancakes are amazing.  The plate comes with 2 large jalepeno enfused potato heaps (this is a compliment :)) and a delicious side of homemade apple sauce. And let's be real...it's really huge chunks of apples with lots of cinnamon and sugar. Love it!  I tend to get an extra side of sour cream (it normally comes with one) just because I like a lot of sour cream. Corned beef hash...hands down the best we've ever had. Service is really quick and we always order our 2 year old's food first since he's such a heathen lol (With that being said, thank you to all of the patrons and staff for not shooting us dirty looks (directly) when our child of the corn threw (throws) a fit.  We really appreciate that.) And to whomever said thier coffee is bad, boo to you!  Southwest Diner has the best coffee I've ever had! Now that we're going to be permanent residents, we look forward to enjoying more wonderful meals with our family :)"}
{"text":"Had two breakfast burritos one veggie and one meat both very tasty and filling. My sister got a side salad that was tasty and fresh defiantly worth a stop if your in the area, the service was very good and not over priced"}
{"text":"I cannot believe what luck we had finding this place! The chile relleno casserole was delicious. They have about 8 types of homemade pies, milkshakes, breakfast lunch and dinner. My green salad was better than expected. Green and the balsamic was fresh made.   Great for kids!!! My kids lived their fries bacon and hot dogs. They have milkshakes also and will gladly split for kids.   The decor is fantastic. The owners really did a great job making this a rustic \"hometown\" real diner.   I also purchased the sea salt hand scrub which they have samples of in the restrooms. It is really great here. Highly suggest after a day or 110* at Hoover Dam.   Just to note after spending a ton in Vegas...what a treat to get out of town for just an afternoon for great home cooked food. Trip Advisor rated 4.5 and an A rating for Nevada Food Bureau. Not to be missed!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets four stars for being an outstanding diner with great food and service.  We were here on Monday, 5/21/2012, while enroute to the river for a day of boating and jet skiing.  Of the five guys I was with, only one of us had eaten here before.  Breakfast was excellent. Outstanding omelets and choices  What was very special for us all was that as a choice for toast (or instead of toast):  Banana bread.  Wow.  So good!  I'd go there for just the banana bread, honestly.  When the server heard us talking about stopping at a Subway sandwich shop to buy sandwiches to take on the River for the day, she told us they could make sandwiches for us to take.  We agreed and were glad we did.  They did a great job packing up the sandwiches and potato chips.  Sandwiches were better than homemade, too."}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner there after visiting Hoover Dam. The food isn't complicated, but every dish was well executed and the wait staff was very friendly. Cute decor, looks like it serves a mostly local crowd."}
{"text":"Was seated but then waited 10-15 minutes while the wait staff expertly avoided making eye contact with me.  Gave up w/o ordering.  Place was less than half full and there were 2 servers plus the greeter working.  Can understand a wait at a higher end place- but this is diner fare."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Love all of the antiques around the restaurant. The chips and salsa was yummy. The salsa tasted fresh. I had the fajita quesadilla which was awesome. Filled with lots of chicken and veggies. The husband had The Cowboy pot roast sandwich with onion rings. He loved it. Huge sandwich with lots of meat. The kids shared a cheese quesadilla and was big enough to fill them up. We were too full to try the pie but they looked gorgeous and delicious. Next time for sure! Service was great. Our waitress, an older Hispanic lady, was very sweet and happy. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here when my family took a wrong turn cruising through from Vegas and found this cool part of town with this diner. The burgers were so good I didn't even notice they had no ketchup or sauce. I for sure will come back another weekend."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast on our way back to Arizona from Las Vegas. I had one of their special which was corned beef hash and eggs. Great home made hash my wife had chicken fried steak and eggs. They were about 80% full! but service was prompt and friendly. Nice small diner atmosphere, with great food and fair pricing. Hey I don't care if they ever have ANY pie. Wonderful food + good service = 5stars."}
{"text":"Great service. This place is a hidden gem. Food is delicious. They have a lot of choices. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. They have a nice patio  and nice breeze. Breakfast burritos, sandwiches and breakfast plates are very tasty. Pancakes are huge."}
{"text":"A great brunch stop on the way to Hoover Dam from Las Vegas. Popular with locals -- it has a great patio and yummy banana bread. Highly recommend the Chile Rellenos breakfast casserole. Would have given it 5 stars except the coffee was weak."}
{"text":"On a Saturday myself, Jessie and Ife all had a girls day in Boulder City. Ife had only been to BC a few times and had never been to SouthWest Diner. Jessie and I knew Ife would love their unique and funky vibe they have going on. Plus, their food is always tasty.   It was pretty busy because it was prime brunch time, but we were seated quickly. No wait at all! We contemplated sitting outside on their patio since it was such a nice day, but we wanted Ife to see all the cool antiques they have to look at inside.   I love that their cold drinks come in mason jars and their hot beverages come in clay flower pots with handles. Southwest Diner also always has specials on their chalk board. They always sound good! All three of us wanted breakfast and since I can't eat very much these days we all split two things. Which worked out perfectly! We ordered their breakfast special of the day which was Corned Beef Hash. It came with two eggs (which we ordered over medium) and hash browns. The second thing we ordered was their Waffles with a side of scrambled eggs and link sausages. We also had a side of banana bread.  Our food was out fast and wow did we immediately dig in. So fast that we all actually forgot to take pictures!!! I had a taste of everything. The waffle was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. It was a perfect tasting waffle. They syrup! It comes in a huge kinda wine bottle. It's serious stuff. The sausages were really good and not greasy at all. The Corned Beef Hash was a little burnt and lacked some flavor. I did enjoy that they had huge chunks of beef in it. You could definitely tell it was homemade. The banana bread was delicious! Mmmmm just thinking about it right now makes me want some.  Our waitress was friendly and quick with our orders. I've always had excellent service here at Southwest Diner. Their menu is loaded with tasty items. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also have Bloody Mary's and cold beer. Plus, I've heard they have pie that is a can't miss.   What a satisfying meal. The waffle was the best item of the day. Southwest Diner is one of my favorite spots to visit while in Boulder City. Make sure you check them out on your next visit."}
{"text":"This place was great ! Food was excellent. Service was exceptional. Real down to earth delicious food."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed our meal at this neat little diner in Boulder City. We went on a Sunday morning for brunch with my aunt from out of town. They were really busy but we got in and out fairly quickly even when we chose to wait a little longer for a table outside. The food was very good and so was the service. It was a beautiful day and the patio is a great place to eat on a day like this. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast on the way through. Order chorizo eggs and those potatoes. Food was just ok, potatoes way over cooked almost burnt. My man had chicken fried steak, his was good. Also got the banana bread it was not good at all, think they forgot to add real bananas."}
{"text":"Food was average I don't mind a older place but when you look around it was dirty and old"}
{"text":"After visiting the Hoover Dam, I was hungry and this little diner, smack-dab in the middle of historic Boulder City did the trick.  I had the meatloaf dinner, which believe it or comes with a ton of food.  In addition to two hearty portions of meatloaf, it came with mashed potatoes, corn, fresh cornbread and ice cream...all included!  You also have the option to add a soup or salad for $1.50, which I opted for.    This place is cooking up some of the best country cooking and if you don't visit, then you are doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"After a 4th visit I feel I can leave a well informed review. The food: The 1st visit was just for pie. They have very good homemade pies. And very fresh. Second and 3rd visits, the food was good. I don't remember what we ordered on the second visit but on the 3rd I ordered a Denver Omelet and my girlfriend ordered the chili relleno casserole. But were also cooked well and very tasty. My girlfriend described the casserole as amazing. The 4th visit my girlfriend ordered the chili relleno casserole again because she liked it so much the 1st time. This time it was a over cooked on the bottom (a little hard for the butter knife to cut through) but she said it still tasted good. I ordered the pork chili verde omelet, and to me it is the best tasting thing I've had there. A little on the runny side but I didn't mind. Had a side of potatoes which were also a little over cooked this time around but still good. The place:  A cute little southwestern style place. Tables on the inside are slightly overcrowded but not horrible. There is very nice patio seating for those wonderful weathered days. The place seems to be clean. Bathrooms are clean. The service: On each of the 4 times we sat right away even though the place looked rather busy from the street. The staff is very pleasant and the food seems to come out to us in decent timing. On this visit I decided that this restaurant is my preferred place to dine in Boulder City. And I've been to other popular cafes in the area. I've read another reviewer give a bad review of this place because they had to wait 20 minutes without being acknowledged. That's too bad but I'm sure doesn't happen a lot but this person isn't willing to try Southwest again. But they'd rather go wait for up to 45 minutes wait at another popular cafe in Boulder City."}
{"text":"For the most part this place is fine. The pumpkin pancakes are wonderful. Breakfast is great. The fries are the shoestring skinny kind so I never get them.The pasta dishes we tried were gross. Packet sauces that weren't even blended properly. Some dinners are outstanding and some we have sent back. Depends on who is cooking.  Their pie is not as good as the sign insinuates. Some of the pies are fabulous and some are not worth the 5.00.  At 2pm they have cheap dinner specials, actually they have board specials for all meals. The menu has a lot of fatty bad for you foods but there are salads.  The prices for the most part are ok if you are careful not to order too many extras or be mindful of the actual charges. The drinks aren't cheap.  I would give 3 1/2 stars if possible. It is worth going to at least once for the cute shabby chic décor. I have never seen it dirty in here personally. It is just a vtg building.  The service is ok. Never outstanding but good enough not to complain.  Cute antique shop next door too.  We go here at least once a month."}
{"text":"Found them by mistake the first time and they were just as good the next time.  Have to look as they are not with other touristy places.  Best biscuit and gravy I have had in a long time.  Great ambiance, wonderful service staff that isn't afraid to jump in and help another waitress.     Resonantly priced and be hungry...be very hungry!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, as was the service. Kitschy decor was cute.  Adequate experience for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way back to Phoenix, service was phenomenal.  Food was delicious the biscuits and gravy were amazing.  This will be our new stop for breakfast on our way home from Vegas"}
{"text":"My son recently moved from Las Vegas to Boulder City (25 Minutes from my house).  Every week when I come out to visit him I drive right by the place.    So today I picked him up and we decided to go eat here.   We both thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, ambiance and prices.  Everything was great and we will probably be making this our father-son breakfast place very often from now on.    The steak and eggs was a great tasty meal and he enjoyed his breakfast too."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, had dinner with friends last week, the pot roast and apple pie were wonderful."}
{"text":"On our way to Boulder City today for breakfast we decided to try this diner instead of The Coffee Cup. The food was reasonably  priced  and the menu had ample choices. My problem with this restaurant was the cleanliness factor. The things we noticed were dead flies littering the window ledges, dust - dirt on the tops of the salt and pepper shakers. No it wasn't  pepper it was grime. A couple came in after us and sat behind us. They left a few minutes after being seated. Wonder if they were turned off by the lack of cleanliness. We are not going to return although the food was good. Back to the Coffee Cup for us."}
{"text":"I absolutely love to eat here!  Everything on the breakfast specials menu is amazing! Their waffles and french toast is perfectly cooked. I love how you can ask for well done hash browns, crispy outside, tender inside and still never burnt!  We love their kids portion of grilled cheese and french fries for lunch.  The service is amazing.  Oh and the best part, is there homemade apple pie hot with ice cream! Be prepared to take home leftovers because the portions are large!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Stop here instead of some over priced Vegas restaurant or chain place on the way to Hoover Dam. I got the pumpkin pancakes (on special) and the hubs got eggs and sausage. That plus two coffees was around $25."}
{"text":"My husband got the Club, big portions. I got the special Southwest Potato cakes w/eggs Apples and Banana bread. Potato cakes were cold, banana bread was dry. To say the least I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend and I just traveled in from California and we're looking for a place to eat. We walked in minutes before closing not realizing that they were about to close, but they were gracious enough to take our order.  We experienced the best meal! This place is a small town jewel.  The food was spectacular and every ingredient was fresh. We decided if  we come out to Vegas, we'd take the 30 minute detour just to eat here again. Thank you for making hungry travelers feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Only reason for two stars is its cute atmosphere and friendly wait staff. There were 6 of us having breakfast and lunch and only two of us could even eat the food. My Frisco burger was ice cold, the meat was strange and a bit gamey. Salad was wilted. Another had the French toast and it was soggy and under cooked. At the end you have to go to the register to pay rather than having your waitress take your check. So you end up standing in line waiting to pay as others are also waiting. While you are standing there. there is only about 3 feet between tables and the wall on the other side. That's where you stand to wait and pay. This is also the only space where the staff can access the kitchen. So you are constantly trying to move out of their way as you wait in a 4 person deep line to pay. I'd never go there again."}
{"text":"Came here after the Hoover Dam and the place was good. The menu is fairly large and there's something for everyone. The kitschy decor is cute. I had the fajita salad which was pretty large, but it tasted slightly old. If you're looking for a family restaurant in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"I would recommend the French toast. It was good.  Their denver omelet was also good only con it had too much onion. Another person in our group ordered a waffle which looked good. The only thing that is strange and our group was not happy about was the orange juice cups. It went from one extreme to another. They use the small mason jar for a small cup. But the large is a huge mason jar like at lucielle bbq restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our place for breakfast/lunch. Food is always good at a good price and speedy service"}
{"text":"I'm a Boulder City first year resident and Southwest Diner is on my short list of favorite eateries. Indoor and outdoor seating is a feature. We tried outside once but the flies drove us inside. Certainly not the diner's fault. The staff is incredibly hometown friendly. Portions are large enough that you can plan on taking half home for a second meal. My favorite is the one pound hamburger steak smothered in onions with mashed potatoes and gravy. Very few people like, or have tried, liver and onions. It was especially good. Breakfast dishes are very, very good and the stack of pancakes can feed a village for a week. Prices are low for the quality and quantity. The place is always packed so parking is sometimes a concern. Oh yes, be sure you try the Sea Salt-Mineral Oil hand washing compound offered for free in the rest room. Worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"If you have just finished a rainy cold half iron man and you want the perfect recovery meal you can not ask for a better experience so worth taking a short detour past the exit to fill that empty feeling that you know gnaws at your hungry body.  If you skip the pie you have missed a gastronomic explosion of flavor and sin. The albondigas soup is fantastic and all the specials are a taste sensation of epic proportions."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here . Lovely , delicious cucumber salad !! In obsessed with this salad !!!!  We both had the angus burgers on sourdough =very good ! I love this place when I am in Boulder City . The pies are amazing ! They are very generous with the slice size . The strawberry rhubarb is delicious !  I love the mason jars and pie tins . Even the salad is served in a small jelly jar. All very quaint . Very helpful, nice wait staff ."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning at 615am had eggs and those potatoes both my cousin and i have the runs and he just threw up not good will never go back"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great decor, friendly and attentive staff, and delicious food. Santa Fe potato pancakes"}
{"text":"This place makes pancakes just like my momma used to make -- burnt, uneven and too dry.   I keep coming back though because the first time I came in I liked it so much. I don't know when I'm going to give up.   Three times I've been here and asked for scrambled eggs \"soft\" and \"wet\" and \"not too cooked\". I don't know what terminology will get the message to the cook that dry browned scrambled eggs aren't my favorite.  I have even sent them back only to have similarly overcooked eggs returned.   The coffee is good. Service is friendly if not especially good.  Prices are meh, ok if the food was decent."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp going from Vegas to Hoover Dam.  So tasty and quite a find.  We had the fajita salad and shredded beef burrito.  Generous portions, great prices and fabulous food! Cute coffee cups too!"}
{"text":"I loved the food . And when I give stars I do it on comparable  places and as far as cafes and dinners this is one of the best. So if you are going to Hover Dam. I would recommend not taking the bypass and driving through Boulder city on the way their or on the way back. Besides the food tasting good they have huge portions ."}
{"text":"Had an avocado BLT.  It was excellent.  Asked if I could change my fries for beans and rice.  No problem and NO up charge.  Beans and rice were excellent. Drinks (both tea and water) came in massive quart Ball mason jars.  If you're not used to the heat these were very welcome. Finished up with strawberry rhubarb pie. Flavor was fantastic! Not too tart.  Crust was very good and was browned to perfection (not white and pasty).  Service was reasonably fast and friendly.  Overall nicely done."}
{"text":"The food is below average, pancakes were rubbery and ultra thick, biscuits tasted stale, I just didn't enjoy myself. The staff were not very friendly. Took forever to bring the additional items we requested, like syrup for the pancakes and hot sauce. I don't think I will ever dine there again."}
{"text":"The only times I've eaten here is at breakfast. The food is GREAT!! After..you could take a stroll beautiful downtown Boulder City!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Boulder City after visiting the Dam, this is a fantastic little spot to eat!! Those potatoes are really good, the bacon broccoli cheese omelet was real good! Everyone was super nice. Include it in your plans!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast in the whole state of Nevada especially if I want a piece of pie."}
{"text":"So good!! A real country diner with fresh food and generous portions. the staff was warm,attentive and very friendly.  I loved my poached eggs that they served in a little mason jar! My husband enjoyed \"those potatoes\" while he watched the game. Great location and parking too!  I even took a fresh baked pie to go!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. We waited for over 20 min and still had no service. It's unfortunate because I heard they have great food. To bad we'll never go back and try it again. Don't waist your time just go up the street to Coffee Cup."}
{"text":"Completely surprised.  We found this place by accident and were not disappointed. Must have the banana but bread!  Service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"We've been there 20+ x's over the last 10 years. DOWNHILL for taste/quantity...UPHILL for the bill.  LOUSY (weak & tasteless) coffee at $2.50 a cup, even with free refills. Desparation would be my only reason for my return. Sorry."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Sunday morning on our way home from Vegas. It was pretty busy around 10am and we had to wait a short time for a table. Once we were seated things went pretty smoothly. The service was decent the only thing I thought was odd happened when we first got there. I The guy taking names almost made me feel like we should leave because of the 20 minute wait. After watching for a bit I think it may have been because of all of the rude responses he got from people when they found out they had to wait. Get over it people.  The food was good and the coffee came in cute mugs that looked like planters. I would come back to next time I am going through town. It was also really easy to get back to the highway."}
{"text":"Fast service, nice waitresses, plenty of good diner food, highly recommend it. We enjoyed the French toast, omelettes, great hashbrowns, huge pancakes, and quart mason jars filled with ice water on a hot day."}
{"text":"Delicious meals! We ordered pancakes (soft and fluffy), chicken enchiladas (very flavorful), nachos (wonderful), breakfast burrito (huge and flavorful), fajita salads (chicken was decent, steak was slightly salty), coffee (decent), and virgin bloody Mary's (spicy and delicious). Wait staff was very attentive and friendly. They have indoor and outdoor seating options. Unique decor and gift shop items. We plan to go back tomorrow to try the pumpkin pancakes and corn beef hash."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff..... Clean and Fun atmosphere..... However, food was terrible. Ordered a Chile Relleno Casserole w/ \"those potatoes\" and Banana Bread. Those Potatoes were full of NO flavor. Bland and cold. Banana Bread was rubbery and cold. Chile Relleno Casserole was cold and NO Chile Relleno. It was canned diced green chiles. The cheese wasn't even melted. The salsa was bleh. Even the coffee was not good. Look I don't write reviews very often but, this I couldn't resist. I have lived in Boulder since August and this was my first time there. I usually give restaurants a try twice. But I will not be going here again. Staff was attentive and friendly. I still tipped 20% as the food was not the waitresses fault. Not sure if this was a bad timing thing or if it is always like this but I was not impressed. Visit The Coffee Cup or Boulder Dam Hotel for great breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has an amazingly huge menu! And we haven't found anything they don't do well. My new favorite is the flautas. Crispy, tender and tasty. Drinks are huge; in large mason jar glasses. Breakfast as always good. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"We didn't get a chance to eat, but the Bloody Marys are awesome. They sell cute little tchotchkes and skin care products. Mexican and American food are available. The staff were also all very sweet and helpful."}
{"text":"Well, the pictures of the food on their site are what inspired us to visit. I had a beef quesadilla and it was good. My husband had a hamburger steak dinner. The carrots were over cooked, the potatoes were instant, there were too many onions on the meat and the gravy was meh. We shared a piece of peach pie alamode and the ice cream was good. Lots of crust and not a lot of peaches. We should have had breakfast for dinner. We got some chocolate candy at the gas station to get the taste out of our mouths. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very good corned beef hash. The banana bread is great too. Thus is our go to Boulder brunch. Couldn't tell you if every thing else is good. I get the same thing every time. No, wait, the pancakes are also good. We like to eat outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"This is a cute little diner! We were on our way to the Hoover Dam and stumbled on this place and we were hungry. There is a small parking lot in the rear, the restaurant itself is rather small, but it was packed!   I ordered a breakfast burrito that was really, really good. They also have really good pancakes there. Service was pretty attentive. Would definitely dine here again in the future if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"This place is probably going to be a new local favorite when going to Las Vegas, its a quaint little diner that has great food! Been there twice and will definitely go back again! The food is good cookin' and the service is great as well!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I eat here a lot when we're visiting the in-laws who live in Boulder. The food is quite good, well portioned, and fairly priced. Everything is made from scratch pretty much. You can't go wrong from breakfast to lunch to dinner. Ask for fry sauce if u get french fries."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! It's a must for me now, the food is amazing and I love the salt scrub that's in the restroom!! I also love the city where it's located, Boulder City is so quaint, finding this little gem changed my life forever!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way to the Hoover Dam while visiting Vegas with family and what a gem of a place. The service is excellent and staff were very friendly. The food is absolutely delicious and portions were very generous. Had a couple mimosas as well and they were just as delicious. You definitely get bang for your buck here. Very well priced. Definitely coming back if I'm ever passing through."}
{"text":"Well we stopped here once. We figured it was a diner so we could grab a cup of coffee and maybe a little something to have with it. We were greeted as soon as we went in. When I got my coffee it did not taste fresh at all. Like it was sitting for awhile. And my husband had the ice tea which was served in a mason jar. My coffee was served in a cute mug that looked like a pottery mug I posted the photo of it, I didn't feel like anything but some soup, So I ordered some clam chowder. My husband had a piece of pie. Well my soup was not that great, It tasted like Campbell's soup out of a can. His slice of pie was a joke very small. We are so glad we dd not order anything else. Service was good but food was not so great. Would we go back? Probably not. There are other places in town that are much better."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Service is  just ok.  Great vibes but standard breakfast and food items. Would not return."}
{"text":"Southwest Diner in Boulder city Nevada was a delightful surprise. Fabulous food, attentive staff and funky, diner decor combined to make for a memorable dining experience. I highly recommend it and plan to make it a regular part of future eating out adventures"}
{"text":"I ordered a patty melt, simple right? Not at this place. When the server asked me if everything was ok, I said no. I then showed him the inedible burnt micro discs of what might have been hamburger patties. He then said, \"Oh, a little too well done for you\"? Shocked by this I replied that it was was burned and inedible. He repeated the well done comment and I repeated that it was inedible. He then proceeded to walk away. I thought he would take it off the bill, but no, all $10.00 was still there. I didn't say anything because I was with a group of family members and they were paying but if you want to eat in a clean, upstanding restaurant - save yourself some trouble and skip this place. See above burnt offerings  Dear Cindy,  Your statement \"over cooked, in your eyes\" completely negated anything else you stated in your reply. Please see the attached picture. Burnt to a crisp, in anyone's eyes."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the food that was prepared with skillful competence this would be a 0 star. I had breakfast with my family 3 kids and 2 adults. We were seated our drink order was taken and after our drinks were delivered the service came to a halt. I took my son to the restroom and realized the woman waiting on us an owner there were pictures on the wall of her I can only assume. If those were family photos they should realize that's how people want to be treated in s diner establishment like family and not given the cold shoulder when asking to refill my child's chocolate milk. As it turns out the party sitting next to us was family and treated a whole lot differently the server was attentive, prompted and friendly for us it was more like she didn't have the time of day. We will not return to the Southwest Diner."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their outdoor tables and a huge pour of their chilled house white wine. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered what turned out to be a very large plate of cheesy nachos. Their french fry order looked huge too, so be warned."}
{"text":"It's a good thing no one reads my reviews lest my lotto-playing secret gets out. Buy your tickets in Arizona. It's a much nicer drive than racing down to Primm and there are no crowds.  On the way back, a stop for breakfast in Boulder City seemed in order. I was hesitant to try any place after our disappointing experience with the overrated Coffee Cup.  If Coffee Cup is the best place between Henderson & Kingman, what were the chances we'd find a decent place for breakfast in Boulder City?  We pulled up to Mel's Diner, which has evidently suffered a well-deserved demise. I hate to say this about a place where people tried to earn a living, but too many eateries are just poorly conceived and executed. They've lost any sense of their real purpose:  to deliver customer delight.    We took our chances with Southwest Diner.    I'm happy to report that Southwest Diner is way better than Coffee Cup or Mel's Diner starting the moment we walked in.  It's a quiet, inviting space with no blaring TV or stun tunes. The staff makes an effort not to make a racket.   I wanted to try the chile relleno casserole but I've learned to stay away from anything offbeat in a basic eatery. The probability for disappointment is very high. Don't expect any artistry in the cooking. This is stick-to-the-ribs grub. I went with simple crispy bacon & eggs with \"those\" potatoes, lightly scorched home fries with peppers & onions. Banana bread is a nice change from toast. Lucinda was happy with her burger. Nice & juicy she said.    We visited on a Wednesday morning around 9.  By 9:30 the place started to fill up, which is never fun.  No, I didn't win the lottery."}
{"text":"Don't come for breakfast on a Sunday unless you want to be very aggressive and grab the first open table as if you were playing a game of musical chairs. Putting your name on the wait list is apparently an inside joke with the wait staff.  Don't know about the food since we left after watching new arrivals rush over to open tables before they were even cleaned. We bought a piece of coffeecake for the road. It was dry. Funny though, The owner wasn't even aware of the wait list, which is understandable since it was written on a single ketchup stained sheet of crumbled yellow notepaper.   So sharpen your elbows and lace your sneakers if you plan to give it a try."}
{"text":"What a find! We go to Las Vegas a couple of times a year and usually eat breakfast in Vegas before heading home. This time we just figured we would find something on the way home. Thought Boulder would be a good place. Finding a place was not as easy as I had thought. We passed this place and drove on into town. Not finding what struck our fancy we turned around and head back the way we had come. This place had an interesting decor. The parking was not easy as it seems to be a popular eating place for local people. We sat outside and had an excellent breakfast. Very friendly people and great service. This is the place we will be stopping on our next trips."}
{"text":"When driving from Hoover Dam back to Vegas for our flight iut, we decided to stop local for dinner. Thanks to Yelpers for great reviews we found the Southwest Diner in Boulder City. As soon as we drove up we knew we would love it. Everything is home made and served with a smile. Portions are huge, so we left full. I had lemonade - yummy and not too sweet. Drinks are served in quart mason jars. My honey had the 'Cowboy', a grilled roast beef sandwich served with fries (the picture only shows half the sandwich because i forgot to take the pictures at first). I had the shredded beef burrito, served with fresh tortilla chips and delicious salsa. There were lots if specials and lots of choices, it was hard to decide! We loved it, and so will anyone who is tired of cookie - cutter franchise food."}
{"text":"We took a trip to Las Vegas from Houston, TX and decided to visit Boulder City to check out the Hoover Dam... When arriving to Boulder City I checked out on Yelp to find a place to eat and Southwest Diner was on the Top 10... So I took my family there... Loved that they served you drinks in a Mason Jar!!! They had a large variety of food choices on the menu... My family picked a different plate... And everyone was Satisfied!!! Large servings... Country style like Texas... The pies were phenomenal!!! Pricing was great!!! Next time I go to Boulder City I will stop by and eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for her birthday after a little antique shopping. The service was great. I had a caesar salad (which came with tomato and olives... weird) but it was great. It was a large serving and the dressing was on the side. I didn't ask for that, but I appreciated it since I am trying to eat healthier and the dressing can pack on the calories."}
