{"text":"Public is an ok place with your average Italian  food - we mainly chose to dine here because we were able to score a table on the patio near the Salsa band at the Taste of Little Italy. 

We started with a bottle of Pinot Grigio and the bruschetta appetizer - the bread was soggy, and the tomatoes were tasteless. Service was slow, confusing (I've never before been told by the waitstaff that they can't take food orders yet because the kitchen has put a *hold* on orders; why couldn't the waitress just take our order and put it in the order queue for the kitchen to get to it when they could?) but friendly overall. 

My gnocchi entree was pretty good, with a very cheesy and creamy alfredo sauce.  My friends were less than impressed with their penne a la vodka and linguine primavera orders (and instead dug into my dish; good thing the portion sizes are huge). 

I don't think I would go back for dinner again - though drinks on the patio I might do."}
{"text":"Good food, great patio.

The husband and I went here on a whim, we were looking for a patio, we were looking for something a step up from Utopia/Cafe Diplomatico and we stopped here.

Inside, it's very swanky, outside, there is a great patio where you can watch the goings ons on College or at the patio of Cafe Diplomatico.

The service was great, the guy was friendly, funny and quick (it probably didn't hurt that we were one of two tables in the place at 6:30pm). 

We started with Crispy Shrimp appetizer, which was 5 large pieces of shrimp, panko breaded and served with a horseradish aioli. I LOVED it. Nathan had a lamb burger, which he thoroughly enjoyed, with fries that I thoroughly enjoyed. I had lamb chops, which were a little bland, but came with a fantastic grape tomato/olive/red onion salad. The salad was probably my favourite thing on the place.

Altogether, a nice dining experience. I liked the fact that they had a small menu, it makes me think that they might actually put some thought and seasonality into what they make. A little pricier than what we were hoping for, but worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Public for two reasons, I had a Groupon and it was close to my home. On a typical night, College Street is flooded with night owls and drunks. Most College bars, lounges and/or resto-bar-lounges are filled with customers, except for Public. I didn't get it, the ambiance looked nice from the outside-in and the food on the chalkboard sign sounded good too. Although this specific spot on college had been plagued by bad businesses over years, I didn't think Public deserved it.

To my surprise, Public was indeed good. I sat outside on the patio with fellow yelper Bijan V. (ohhh shoot, name dropping 101). The waitress was nice, happy and attentive. The food and drinks were also great. Authentic Italian or not, the portions were large and tasted good. I think sitting inside the restaurant opposed to on the patio would have been equally enjoyable although seeing Bijan's eyes sparkle in the moon light was the best part of my evening.

For the price, Public is a restaurant to consider along College. If you're tired of everything else along this strip, i would recommend you try Public. But like everyone else it seems, I would suggest venturing further west and hitting up Utopia or Vivoli instead if you haven't tried them before."}
