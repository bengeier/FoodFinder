{"text":"I did not read any reviews before going to this resturant for CNY dinner.  Very economical!  We had Peking Duck (2 style), Lobster, steam fish, veggie and a soup, tasty and good price.  If I were to compare the food with Yang's (which cost $$$ more), this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by most of the reviews received on this restaurant. My experience with Lee Yu Mun has been pleasant so far and my family eats here on occasion. Their seafood is fresh and of good quality, and they have fresh roasted squab on special (my favourite) and overall the price for dinners here are very reasonable considering the service, quality, and the atmosphere. They also have a BBQ shop inside the restaurant that has delicious roasted duck as well!"}
{"text":"The place is small. So cramped, you can smell your neighbours at the other tables. No room to walk. There's no room to walk or can you sit comfortably.   Service. None. You only get 1.5 hours, even for big groups. They'll rush you to finish and keep reminding you the time remaining. Even if you plan to order more stuff, they'll discourage it because of the time or you'll have to beg to order more.   Rude. Yes. Not worth your money.  The food is avg and not cheap. You are in the GTA and there are lots of better options.   Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came to Lee Yu Mun a couple of times over the holiday season with my in-laws and extended family and wasn't particularly impressed. The decor and lighting reminds me of the type of Chinese restaurant my grandparents would go to every weekend for dinner back in the 80's. Reservations are recommended for dinner on weekends.  Their claim to fame is their seafood dishes - and to be fair it's not bad. We ordered the \"may geet\" lobster, which was decent. Grandma said \"it wasn't as good as before\" and said that she had heard that the chef/ management had been quietly changed. Since it was my first time here, I had nothing to compare it to. The baked crab on rice was delicious! Grandma complained it was too \"wet,\" but I found that was what I liked about it - it wasn't like a regular (dry) fried rice. Their other dishes were standard, but nothing that would bring me back here.   Washroom was a bit gross - one of the 2 stalls had no toilet paper, and the floor was sticky.  They accept debit, Visa and Mastercard on bills over $10 (so, bring cash if you're having lunch)."}
{"text":"Came here for CNY dinner and was completely unhappy with the overall experience. I know it was new yrs but this place was a zoo and dinner service was a complete disaster. we recieved dishes belonging to other tables, we recieved all our entree dishes at once then the soup arrives at the very end, the food was really not up to standard with even average chinese restaurants. the seating arrangement was so uncomfortable ever time a waiter passed by; you would get a  physical nudge like you were at some college nightclub. Waiters were trying to help each other out but there was total miscommunication and chaos. i imagine the trading floor of the New york stock exchange in sept 2008 was similar to this."}
{"text":"Lee Yu Mun Seafood Restaurant just opened last week in the sea of Richmond Hill Chinese restaurants.   I don't expect that it will be perfect as it just opened a week or so and there are a lot of things that kitchen and wait staffs have to fine tuned as it is so new..  However, this place does not look too promising..  Lunch menu is different than the dinner menu. Lunch menu is similar to what Congee  Wong or Congee Queen offers. Congee, soup noodles, stired fried rice/noodles and others snack item. And the prices here is inline with other popular Congee restaurants.  Shrimp and Scallops Congee($4.95) - A OK. The congee based is dense and smooth... The shrimps are fresh and have good texture and bite!! Scallops though not too many are fresh and sweet...  Singapore Style fried Turnips ($5.95) - Really small order for the price we are paying VS Congee Wong. Though it is not too oily but there is something lack in the dish... Curry is just in the form of yellowish colours with hardly any taste to it...  Chinese Veggie ($4.95) - We were looking at this small dish of greens... half the size of what Kenny's noodle order. The veggie is quite good.. but if you are into oily food, not a trace of oil.. Hey This is call \"Oil Veggie\" where is the oil?  The freaky thing was there was this half elastic band still wrapping around the stem of the veggie?? -1 star  Interior decorations here is NON existence!! Just like they just paint the space and put the tables and chairs in... But with the prices they are charging, I do expect a little more!  Waitress still in training. They do apologize for the elastic band and offering us 10% off dinner next time. But do I want to come back for dinner?   They accepts Cash only!"}
