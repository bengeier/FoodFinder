{"text":"I was recently in Toronto and stopped by this place.  I was skeptical at first but don't let the appearance fool you.  Usually the places I go to back in the states are dirty and the people are rude.  This place is clean.  They have a good selection and the prices are great!  The people here are friendly, helpful, and courteous.  What more do you want!"}
{"text":"Paper thin slices of meat in the assorted ham banh mi. Inconsistent assembly, some had red onions in them some did not. Never going again, avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Worst Vietnamese sandwich place ever. If they don't think you are Vietnamese or your young and naive  they'll overcharge you for their side appetizers since they don't have proper price stickers on their items. Sandwich itself is plain and their pate has no flavour or smell. No good."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwich/sub, then you definitely have to try out Banh Mi Que Huong. No offense Banh Mi Boys, your banh mi sandwich/subs are amazing but most people in the Vietnamese community will agree with me that they are not your traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwich/subs but more like banh mi sandwich/subs on steroids.

They have a fair range of choices to choose from, that all cost $2.25 tax included.

1. Assorted
2. Grilled pork
3. Grilled lemongrass beef
4. Nem Nuong (Vietnamese pork meatballs)
5. Vegetarian
6. Rotisserie chicken
7. Stewed mackerel fish
8. Beef and shredded pork
9. Satay beef
10. Satay Chicken

I'm probably missing a few but they don't have a website to confirm all the choices, I only listed the ones I could remember.

They use a fresh baguette and they use traditional vegetables (sliced cucumber slices, shredded carrots, red onions, pickled radish and cilantro) topped with oyster sauce, optional hot sauce and sprinkled with soy sauce. I normally order the grilled lemongrass beef which is amazing.

They also sell a variety of Vietnamese desserts like most Vietnamese banh mi stores but people come to Que Huong for the banh mi sandwich/subs and not the desserts. Most people order at least 6, that's how good they are.

The only reason why I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because even though the store hours list them closing at 8 pm each day, they often sell out and end up closing early. It's happened to me a few times. So I recommend trying to get there before 6 pm if it's a weekday."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were reasonably priced and tasty. $2.75 for an assorted banh mi sub sandwich. The bread was fresh and the prep ladies were very polite. Most of the menu is in Viet but there is a menu of all the subs in English.

It was a great sub and went nicely with coffee.

The spicy satay beef was good. Definitely going to be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall. I just read the review from yelp and decided to try the place. I ordered the chicken satay bahn mi and requested for more cilantro and peppers. I like my subs hot and spicy. It was good. But what's more worth mentioning is the shrimp paste with pork. It's packaged in a small container,  so unassuming. Good thing I asked Hong, the lady owner. She said it's best to eat with rice and cucumber. I didn't have any cucumbers so I ate it with rice. I was in heaven. How I wish I had green mangoes to dip in this. Would definitely come back and try their other items on the menu. Next one: grilled beef bahn mi :)"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another try, and I'm glad I that did! I was greeted by a friendly lady speaking a Hue Vietnamese dialect; it reminded me of home because my family is also from Hue. 
I got the assorted banh mi, steamed buns and Hue style sausage. The banh mi was generously portioned with aromatic meats, and they didn't forget the mayo and pâté this time!"}
{"text":"Someone was extremely kind and bought us some banh mi from this store so this is for a take out review.

Oh boy, there is some good banh mi going on at this Vietnamese store baby!  I had the \"Rotisserie Chicken Banh Mi\" and it was fantastic!  The bread must have been baked in store as it is so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  At some places the bread is almost too hard to chew... not this sandwich people!  The chicken was nicely shredded and tender, the do cha (pickled vegetables) were beautiful done and tender along with the fresh cilantro and cucumber and red onion mix, but the butter mayo the highlight in my opinion.  It was outstanding!  Much richer and creamier then most places.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did that in house as well.

My only problem is this place is out of the way for me, but next time I'm in the area, I definitely going to seek this place out to try the other subs!  What do I think about these banh mis???

Nom, nom, nom!!!"}
{"text":"There are a slew of Vietnamese Sandwich joints all over the city. Seeing as I was in the north end, I decided to give the place a try on the recommendation of a friend.

The decor is dated and the place a bit run down, but clean. I was there quite early in the morning so they didn't seem to have all the to go items they sell out on display yet. No matter, I was there strictly for the Banh Mi sandwiches.

The entire menu is in Vietnamese, but the lady at the counter was very nice and spoke English.

Banh Mi is a Vietnamese Sandwhich in a French inspired Vietnamese Bun. There are many types, from assorted (deli style cuts of pork), to shredded chicken, to seasoned grilled pork chops. I kept my order simple and stuck to the classic assorted sandwich.

The sandwich is layered with pâté on the bottom, butter on the top, 3 types of pork (sliced), and topped with a carrot and radish mix, cucumber, cilantro and chili peppers if you like it spicy. Like many places now, the radish all but disappeared from the carrot/radish mix. This part was a bit disappointing, but radish tends to sour more quickly, so if you're turnover is not high enough, there's a lot of waste.

Vietnamese Bread is my favourite. Inspired by the French when they occupied Vietnam, it's light and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The crust is not nearly as hard as a baguette, rather it's thin and crispy. The inside is not chewy or doughy at all, just absolutely delicious!

Over the years, Banh Mi has cheapened to the point that it's no longer worth buying, but if you have that craving, you're just going to have to pay the piper. Most places will allow you to double up the meat for $1 for all you carnivores out there. While the meats are pretty standard, and the ingredients of every sandwich consistent, the true rating comes down to the bread.

The bread at Banh MI Que Huong is fresh and meets my standards for how Vietnamese bread should be as I noted above. 3,5 stars. However, as I've also mentioned above, over the years, the sandwich as a whole has degraded while the price has increased. Hence 3 stars overall for Banh Mi Que Huong.
