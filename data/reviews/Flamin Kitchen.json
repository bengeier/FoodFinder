{"text":"We've eaten here several times a week since they opened.  Best bahn mi sandwiches in University City area.  Haven't tried the \"flamin' seafood\" dinners, but they seem to be very popular as well when we've gone."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent!  Food is very authentic.  Would highly recommend to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after seeing posts about it on Facebook. I wasn't sure what to ordered at first so had some help from our waiter. I ordered the udon noodles with crab broth and shrimp, which turned out really good! Loved the bits of crab pieces and the noodles! We also ordered the Bulgogi bahn mi which was excellent! Only thing that could've been better with the bahn mi is a little more meat and extra extra veggies. The meat and veggies barely made it half way on the sandwich. I also ordered the golden milk tea which was good but I wish they would start putting tapioca on the bottom. The place is kind of tight, need some more space but I did like their playlist. Only downfall was that we sat there for 10 minutes needing a drink refill. Needless to say, we will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I usually don't take my time out to write a review but...Oh my god. So disgusting!!! The place was empty when we came in to eat, I asked for the lychee drink. They were out. Asked for oysters. They were out. Wanted clams. They were out. I ordered pho with tai, gan, sach and bo vien....there was no tai!! How do you make a bowl of pho and forget the main meat?? The pho didn't even have any flavor or even remotely taste like pho, it tasted like someone dumped a whole container of salt into it. The crawfish were mostly dead so half of it was pretty much thrown away. The seasoning was bad, we didn't even get the mussels in our combo! And on top of that, the service was shitty too! Definitely will not be coming back here. Btw..I went home and was sick all night!"}
{"text":"Mai was friendly & attentive. I'd give service 4/5. I give fresh spring roll 2/5. My boyfriend gives pho 3/5. We also got green tea milk tea w/ mochi & green tea jelly. It taste great, so I'd give it 4/5. Overall, I'd rate this place 3/5 & would come back again. I wanna try the crawfish next time!"}
{"text":"Serves: Was okay. We walked in and the waitress looked at us like \"what do you guys want?\" (Face) but I understand I'm a waitress myself so I totally understand, but that's not the reason for the 2 stars. When we were seated the waitress came up to us and literally said \"what do you want?\" With an \"I don't care\" face. They dropped of the food and never came back, I guess I should be lucky I got my food quickly.  Food: I got the crawfish, mussel and shrimp. Compared to Cracking Crawfish, it was salty and sweet which was a really weird taste to me. I personally love cracking Crawfish. I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Not worth it. Food taste nasty and service sucks! Crawfish was hard to peel out  flamin crab banh canh didn't have any crab maybe one shrimp, after half way eating then they brought out the vegetables, no bib or gloves til we were half way done eating as well. Long as wait and it's their grand opening week and it's not even busy at all... we got cream cheese jelly with our milk tea and it was only TWO piece in my drink, haha funny right?"}
{"text":"Pho size on small size but decent taste.  The sauce for crawfish is great! Would go back-maybe not for the pho but their other items..."}
{"text":"Loved it. Hot sauce on the side! Yum, Korean ban mi was too die for. Had to order an extra for later."}
{"text":"I have my favorite pho restaurant that I go to all the time but it's about 25-30 min away from home. I don't mind the driving but sometimes I do when I want something quick. Luckily thanks to this spot I don't have to drive far anymore. The service is great and the pho is delicious. I love eating pho all the time, especially on a rainy day or when I'm sick. The broth is super flavorful also. I'm actually craving some pho as I write this. Try this restaurant out if you love pho and you won't be disappointed. My husband ordered a Banh Mi and also loved it."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Im a food snob. Especially when it comes to ethnic foods.  Great services. Food was spectacular. Might be my new fav place!!!!  I had chicken pho and the calamari.  Five stars!!!!"}
{"text":"WELCOME BACK!!! How do I contain my excitement in writing this review.. okay I won't. I was SO OBSESSED with Flamin' when they were at their first location by Montford. They had to close that location and I've been yearning for them to come back ever since. Finally.. HERE WE ARE! I believe they've been open for less than a month now and I've been 3 times, possibly 4. If they were closer to me, it would probably be most of the week. I will organize this review based on types of food and my recommendations! Let's go!  Seafood Boils (Crawfish, Crab (Blue, Snow, and Dungeness), Mussels, Shrimp, Clams and Lobster): My FAVORITE part is definitely the seafood boils. Step one is pick your preferred seafood. They are priced by the pound (MP). Decide how many pounds you want, then choose the flavor and level of spiciness! I alternate between crawfish or shrimp, but I always the Flamin' Special flavor, Hot on the spicy level and a side of rice to eat with the sauce. It's amazing! I've also tried the Garlic Butter flavor and it's delicious.   Soups: I haven't had the chance to try their pho yet, but I have tried a couple of their soups. My favorite is the Banh Canh. I would also recommend the Canh Bun. Both are traditional Vietnamese soups and they do a good job with both.   Fruit Teas & Dessert: They have a wide variety of fruit teas with bits of jelly and fruits throughout the drink. All very delicious and also very refreshing! My favorite is the Passion Love and Mango Madness. They also offer milk teas and dessert drinks. The dessert drinks are traditional Vietnamese desserts (also known as che). My favorite is the Che Thap Cam which has red tapioca, grass jelly, pandan jelly and coconut milk. YUM!  A couple of kinks: slow service and a long wait on food. They did just open a month ago and have a huge influx of people that come through, so it's understandable, but I believe I waited 45 minutes last time for food after ordering. They do run out of various things throughout the week, but I'm giving them time to adjust. I believe in you and naturally, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is our first time eating here. We ordered flamin wings with sweet/sour sauce,  pho dac biet and bun dac biet. Everything was great and authentic. This is probably the most Vietnamese restaurant we've eaten. Will definitively come back"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the BanhMi sandwich. It comes in second to our other favorite place. They don't cut the sandwich in half. I know this may seem small, and it is in the grand scheme of things. However, that's a long sandwich and having it cut in half makes it easier to eat.   I want to go back to try the seafood and I would get the sandwich again."}
{"text":"Mama Loan's guide to feed a family of 6 for $40!  I've been battling this annoying cold that I got from my coworker since Tuesday, and you betcha that nothing treats a bad cold better than a hot/steamy bowl of Pho! And if you know me, I eat like a lil bird....small portion at one sitting, but many meals thru-out the day!;) And with  my cold at its peak...Pho is a must for tonite! So, without further ado, allow me to introduce to you our dinner for a family of 6 for $40...seriously, a guaranteed yummilicious dinner   - $4.95 Grilled pork sandwich: Daddy David been craving for Banh mi - $11.95 Banh canh: Ayden and London's fav dish, and it's a big portion, so it's enough for 2 - $5.50 (children's size) x 3 Combination Pho: for mama Loan, grandpa and grandma. We eat light at night, so this is the perfect portion for us. Even though it said it's children size, but it's plentiful, sometimes I couldn't even finish it...I called it the 'LIGHT' portion for those Carbs counters! - $4.75 Che dessert: and of course, sick or not, I'm always in the mood for Che   **Total with tax included: $40.76**  I also loved it how they packaged the food, ready to eat no matter where you are...all the noodles in the bowls, just heat up the broth and pour them over! If you've ever ordered Pho at work, you would understand...they give you noodles and meats in a to-go box and broth in one of those tall, plastic containers. This makes it almost impossible to enjoy a good bowl of Pho at work.....but with this prepackaged bowls, I can now eat pho at work (or anywhere) and still enjoy it almost like I'm at home    So, I don't know about you guys, but if I were to cook dinner instead of eating out, I don't know if I could  get it under $40 while still giving everyone a variety of choices. And not to mention, the time and water wasted cooking/washing the dishes afterward! WINNER DINNER!!!#flaminkitchen"}
{"text":"Re-opening with Flamin' Crawfish at night and Flamin' Kitchen Pho by day. I remember my first time going to Flamin' Crawfish when they were at their old location. I love the MyTeas and you can even get a fruit and milk tea in one now with a split cup.   I'll start off with the Flamin' Banh Canh. I do recommend getting this, since you rarely see many Vietnamese restaurants have Banh Canh on their menu. They broth is very delicious and the crab legs are fun to eat and drenched in broth. I believe it's supposed to come with shrimp patties, which I got none in my broth if I remember correctly. There is TOO MUCH broth however. All you see is liquid and it's like fishing for fish in a steep, murky pond. There is a lot of oil in almost everything though.   On to the seafood! The crawfish was overcooked causing it to be mushy and easily breaks the meat into small pieces. I got the $44.99 special and was notified that there was no blue crab left (which I noticed as a common theme throughout my experience here). The Flamin' special sauce is a little sweet, but once again, a fountain of oil. Maybe get bread to dip in the sauce.   We tried to order Chicken Banh Mi to-go and they were also out of chicken like they were out of blue crab. Does this happen every day? As a foodie, hearing someone tell me they're out of something makes me incredibly sad. I do understand that stuff can run out, especially seafood, but CHICKEN???   The meal ends with these coffee jelly desserts. The coffee flavor is very light and I'm not sure what the liquid is, but I think it's coffee creamer or maybe some kind of sweetened milk. In general, a very innovative idea!   As one of the only seafood broil spots in Charlotte, if some improvements were made, I can guarantee it will be a big hit in the years to come."}
{"text":"Came to this place for pho. It's a cool hippie joint. It's not the best or worst. So on to the review. The pho I got was ok-good. One size only, good amount of meat. Other than that good service. It's a joint where I probably wouldn't come back to to soon."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the Pho, but once I get on a Pho bender I'm set in my ways. I could eat it for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Bottle the stuff, I'll come runnin' to buy it!  So I'll admit, I'm real keen on the 'other' Pho guys closer to W.T. Harris and Tryon. I've been generously visiting 'em for nearly a decade. So to give another place a try was challenging. It seems like a lot of places are offering the dish now and I hate it when it just becomes another thing that's thrown on the menu with little thought or respect for the process. Flamin Kitchen has Pho right on the front of the building, gotta be good right?  Ordering to-go, still got a sick girlfriend at home and the power of Pho can make anyone feel better. There isn't much to the dining area, but clean and bright. Nice, friendly hostess got me my food (which was ready 5 minutes early!) and I was off.  First off, lets talk about a quick technical detail: They give you a tall container with the pho broth and a soup bowl style container with the meats and noodles separately. I love the fact that this bowl is big enough for all of the broth! You would think it's a no brainer, but I've been to restaurants where I guess they assume you'll place everything in your own bowl. Not only does this dramatically cool down the food by putting it in a new vessel, but you're going to spill broth, no doubt! A nice touch for sure.  Pho itself, was borderline divine. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT forget to add the sriracha and the hoisin sauce! Rare beef sliced thin and flank steak had awesome texture. The beef meatballs, firm and savory. I'm a real fan of the tripe and tendon, you're missing out if you forego these yummy morsels. The broth had this fragrance that if the lid wasn't airtight, you'd pull over on the way home to drink it. Great onion and beef body with subtle licorice notes from star anise and a great pungency from the ginger. The sriracha rounds everything out so nicely, please don't skimp out on this!  They've got a whole menu to explore and judging from the broth, they know what they're doing! From Crawfish Boil to Bahn Mi to Viet-style smoothies and teas, I'm a believer and they've successfully broken me free from my one-pho ways!"}
{"text":"love the banh canh n canh bun. the my teas are good also. service is still new so please be patient. crawfish were a little small but what do u expect the season is basically over so u cant get a good size every time,but sauce are great!! it's grand opening week so your gonna expect long waits and forgetful stuff thats in any business thats new so he patient. overall its good,try it!!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim after a work networking thing. Was hungry and hadn't eaten all day and it was a little chilly out so perfect soup weather. Got a kids pho (don't judge me) and a Banh Mi. So good fresh and fulfilling for just $11. I didn't even doctor up the broth at all with the usual sriracha, hoisin, and fish sauce. The sandwich was warm and had the perfect ratio of meats and veggies with a chewy crispy bread. This place is close to work and will be a hotspot of mine for dine in or pickup lunches and I will be back!"}
{"text":"YEAH WHAT IAYA SAY Not worth it. Food taste nasty and service sucks! Crawfish was hard to peel out  flamin crab banh canh didn't have any crab maybe one shrimp, after half way eating then they brought out the vegetables, no bib or gloves til we were half way done eating as well. Long as wait and it's their grand opening week and it's not even busy at all... we got cream cheese jelly with our milk tea and it was only TWO piece in my drink, haha funny right? AND NO BEER THAT PART"}
{"text":"I think this deserves a 4.5. It's pretty new so I feel it may get better. The menu isn't updated so everything in the red part they don't have. The waitress we had was new and wasn't trained I guess. They didn't tell her much about the details and she didn't know the menus that well. The food though is great. I got a bun (vermicelli) with pork and an egg roll. It was great. Also got sweet potato fries, but they didn't have anything for them like honey mustard or glaze. Just ketchup. Its American food at a Vietnamese place, I think it's out of place. I mean that's not that big of a deal but it just seems like they need some more time to get things organized. They where missing small things like splenda and sweet and lo packets at the tables, the honey mustard, and just little stuff. I say in a month they'll be ready. The place has a lot of potential but it's not ready yet."}
{"text":"3/4 stars I couldn't decide but I settled for 3 because they \"ran out\" of half the menu items! How do you run out of chicken AND blue crab?? I did enjoy their drinks especially the mythai milk tea. I had the seafood bun rieu it was okay, I thought there's was too much oil in the broth. But on another note I'm so happy this place decided to reopen again! I'm a sucker for seafood broil so you know I'm probably going to return again"}
{"text":"Yeah that pho is bomb, service good too. Haven't tried the seafood yet, but it looked good. Probably gonna be back for more soon."}
{"text":"The broth was tasty and the noodles were cooked very well! The meat that was included with the dish was also well seasoned and was a good portion size!"}
{"text":"Save your money. We were so excited to hear about a new Vietnamese spot in the area; however, the food was so disappointing we'd rather drive further away for better food.   My husband ordered the Flamin' Banh Canh and the broth was just terrible and there was hardly any crab or udon. Poor guy left hungry.   I ordered the Pho Combo and if I didn't know better it tasted like someone added soda to the broth. The noodles were clumped together and the meat didn't seem fresh.   We really wanted this to be our new spot for Vietnamese, but the cost and quality of the food is just too disappointing."}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight to try out the new restaurant in our area. We really enjoyed it and thought that the food was very good. We had banh mi, bun dac biet dau hu ky tom, crawfish and shrimp. We liked them all. The house sauce that they steam in (Flamin Special) has just the right amount of heat to not overwhelm the flavor of the fresh seafood. The banh mi baguette was crispy and fluffy, just as it should be.  The YELP reviews are kind of mixed, so we were skeptical to give them a try as they might still be working out the new restaurant kinks. We are glad we went and recommend you give it a try. It's a welcome change from the same old places, it's a mom and pop business, and we hope you'll give them a taste. We will be going again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Decent lunch place to get some banh mi or a bowl of Pho. The staff here is super polite. The food comes out fast, so if you need a quick meal, this place will work. The pho was great. No complaints on the pho. The banh mi was light on cilantro, a little light on flavor, and the bread was off on texture. The banh mi was good, I've just had better, but i would still recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Vietnamese lunch with good service, fair prices, and good food."}
{"text":"This place is new so the service does seem to be a little slow. However, the food is very flavorful and decently priced. The only downside is they don't have any vegetarian options and their menu is impossible to find online."}
{"text":"First time here, but definitely not my last! I had the Flamin' Bahn Canh, which is a seafood based soup. Very tasty! The lychee tea was excellent. Can't wait to try the bahnmi sandwiches."}
{"text":"We ordered cajun crawfish and clam there. The Flamin sauce was on point! It's a good recommendation for people who enjoys median hot . It was fair price and great taste"}
{"text":"Eh! It was just okay. I probably will not revisit as long as Crackin Crawfish is in business. But I'm from Southern Cali so my expectations of boiling crab/seafood dinners are pretty high.   I ordered $80 worth of food (3 lbs of snow crab, 1lb of mushy shrimp and some corn, potatoes and sausage) in Medium and Mild with the Flamin sauce.  The sauce was TOO sweet and the medium wasn't spicy at all.  It was missing that Cajun kick!! Knowing I'm picky with sauces, I asked if I could taste it beforehand and was told no, it was made to order. Eh! That should've deterred me.  The crab legs were not cleaned very well and the shrimp were EXTREMELY over cooked which left them mad mushy!  Overall it wasn't horrible, but I don't have to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"This was the best Vietnamese we have had in the Charlotte metro.  Restaurant is in an old hamburger joint - so not a lot of atmosphere, but the food - wow!!  Staff is very friendly and everything was fresh, delicious, hot .... perfect!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place replaced the five guys so that explains some of the interior design. The staff was friendly and it's currently still new so I'm sure they still have a lot to work on.   The banh mi was pretty big. They weren't stingy with all the meat and veggies which is great. It was super filling but I think it's partially because the bread is a little bit bigger than usual. The calamari was actually pretty delicious. However it was pretty much all stuck together so you had to tear them apart from each other. The sauce that comes with it adds a perfect touch.   The MyTEA and the che trai cay came with a lot of ice. Every time I tried to take a sip out of the cup or even eat some of I would end up tasting the ice and not the actual dessert. I literally took all the ice out of my che and that took about a third of the cup. For the MyTea It took almost a third of that as well. If I were you I would recommend less ice just to have it cool and refreshing and at the same time get the most out of them.   Right now they have a promotion if you eat the pho or the banh mi you also get a free soft drink."}
{"text":"Of all the Vietnamese restaurants in University City, this one probably has the most interesting menu. I was very impressed with the crab banh canh, and I plan on coming here regularly. I look forward to trying the bun and hu tieu."}
{"text":"I have been here only once and that is enough. I was sick all night. I will not be back. 2 stars will be for location convenience and staff"}
{"text":"I can't obsess about this place enough. I have yet to try any of the dishes on the main menu but my first time I got 1lb of the fresh crawfish in Flamin Sauce, Medium. It was INSANE. The flavors were so complex and the level of heat was pleasantly tolerable (though I was sweating for sure). I've also tried the golden milk tea and green tea milk tea and they're both delicious. I've been back several times in one week and I can't get enough!!!"}
{"text":"Came back for bun bo hue because I was craving it allllll week! I asked for pork blood but they were out  i was disappointed that i hardly got any green onions/toppings this time too. My boyfriend got the combo 1 seafood boil and the shrimp was over cooked. It was so hard to peel the shrimp. The sauce was very sweet and salty that it wasn't very good at all. . We got \"flamin\" and it was not spicy. We did get the couples drink and that was refreshing as always."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I have a new favorite place to get fresh summer rolls when I'm craving it! Chicken wings were nice and crispy but inside was a little dry like over cooked. The meat of the snow crab legs were perfectly cooked! And it's super meaty! Got it with the flamin sauce, tasted too sweet tho. Milk teas were yummy! Wasn't too sweet which is good! Also got an order of pho Togo but didn't come with any hoisen sauce or sriracha. Would be better if it had came with it especially for people who doesn't have any at home. They forgot to pack us veggies as well  when the bags came out but our waitress asked if we wanted any. Our waitress was great btw! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Take me to your pho.  It isn't the only thing I love about Vietnamese places but it is the most important menu item for doing cross comparisons.  Flavor is good, but not the best in this part of town.  Price is about average, but the volume you get doesn't keep pace with the reigning value king in this department.  I ordered the tripe, tendon, beef ball etc., the beefy grab bag or P1 on the menu.  The brisket was good.  The meatball had a very strong taste but had too much of a potpourri flavor to it for my tastes.  There was only one piece of tendon, the right amount of tripe, and plenty of the other meats.  I will be back to try the vermicelli and probably another item.  They have tons of seafood and I think this is their specialty.  This specialty doesn't make this my go to pho place, so purely on that dimension see some of the places I have 5 stars.  They are fast here, faster than the higher rated places I chronicle.  I will have to flesh out more of the menu, but my preliminary ruling is that this place is fine, good even, but with its superior location I will still be taking the extra ten minutes to go to my favorite place when I need some pho food healing."}
{"text":"Ever eat pho at a five guys?  Well now you can!   A little weird that they didn't change the decor except for uncomfortable chairs and a lobster tank.  Pho was really good tho, and that's what ultimately matters."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some seafood so we decided to make the 30 minute drive just to go to this place. I got the seafood combo 1 which came with 1 lb of crawfish, 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of clams. We opted for the Flamin Kitchen sauce medium spice. I like the sauce, it's sweet with a good kick of spiciness for us. The clam was good and so was the crawfish. The shrimp on the other hand was over cooked so it was hard to deshell and once you were able to deshell it, the shrimp was tough tasting so my son and boyfriend didn't enjoy it. I had the sweet tea and it's not your normal Louisiana sweet tea, it was like a jasmine sweet tea which some folks aren't used to so they didn't like it but I didn't think it was that bad. We also had the Cajun Fries which came out right away. It was nice and crispy. Helped with the spiciness of the meal. I'd go again just for their Flamin Kitchen sauce but maybe will stay away from the shrimp."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience here. Food is flavorful and good portions. Found it by just driving around and was a great find. Had the pork bun dish and the pho. Our son had a steak Bahmi sandwich and everything was delicious. Next time I'm in town definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this spot last weekend. At first we thought it was an odd combination to have a restaurant that serves Vietnamese and Cajun food, but we were wrong. It was delicious! Their bahn mi is a good competition to Le's, which I used to swear by up till now. This changes everything for me because all this while I could only get bahn mi on weekends due to their timings. Also, the crawfish was delicious and very flavorful. I will probably pass on that in the future though, since it's such little meat for so much effort in peeling. Going to try more seafood there."}
{"text":"Didn't try their Vietnamese dishes so I can't give an opinion on that however I had a array of seafood that I will review here.  The set up is like the other Vietnamese owned Cajun restaurants where the seafood is steamed then doused in the sauce of your choice and served in plastic bags tied at the top so the flavors of the sauce steams into the seafood.  My girlfriends and I shared bags of crawfish, shrimp and crab legs in the Flamin special sauce. I loved It! The sauce is very strong and kind of takes away from the seafood's natural flavor but I like It that way. There's a sweetness in the sauce and a very subtle flavor reminiscent of Thai coconut curry. It was so delicious! I ordered Cajun fries just so I'd have something to dip in the sauce - it's that good!  There are heat levels you can choose ranging from mild to hot. Being Asian, I love spicy heat and throw Thai bird chilies in pretty much every dish I eat. I even have a jar of my mom's home dried and ground Thai bird chilis in my office drawer to add to food while I'm at work. Eating so much peppers so frequently, I like to think I can hang when It comes to spicy peppers. Which is why I ordered hot.  Most places don't have heat levels high enough for me to feel the burn and Vietnamese food isn't really spicy - or at least not as spicy as Thai and Korean dishes.  Boy was I wrong! It's so spicy that my cheeks were a vibrant shade of red, my fingers were sore and I was literally crying tears of heat at the table. I loved It!!! Like I seriously felt euphoric eating the seafood.  I'm giving only 4 stars because as great as the seafood was, the drinks were not good at all. I ordered mango tea with boba and ended up throwing It away. It wasn't sweet and there's a bad kind of bitter aftertaste you get when tea has been steeped too long.  The next time I go, I'll only eat the seafood and save my money for the teas at Tea Fusion instead."}
{"text":"Heard so many great things about this place but I was so disappointed last night. First off, when I walked in they looked at me like \"what do you want?\" Uhmmmm... I need a table for 5 cuz we tryna eat? Duh.  They ran out of shrimps for my spring rolls . That's like chick-fil-a running out of chicken. Wtf. But that wasn't the only thing they ran out of... basically half the menu they couldn't make because they \"ran out\" which was disappointing because I really wanted a dessert drink. I got the \"flamin banh canh\" which wasn't bad but I wouldn't get it again. Then the waiter told us the kitchen is closing soon so he rushed us to put in the rest of our order (he was young, it was a Friday night, he was tryna leave to party, I get it) but 3 mins til closing someone walked in to put in a to-go order and they accommodated her. Isn't the kitchen closed??   And they still dipping me out on my change! lol I remember at flamin crawfish they would take my change without asking and they still doing it here at flamin kitchen. Smh It wasn't much that they took but I felt like it was extremely rude of them to just take it.   I will try to come back one more time for a dessert drink but other than that, I wouldn't sit down to eat at this establishment again. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte I can go spend my time and money at."}
{"text":"Weelllllll.....i consider myself a pho enthusiast, so when i saw there was a new place i had to try it. Now, all in all i was underwhelmed. The broth to me is the most important part and here, it wasn't too flavorful. The ingredients and noodles were cool but the broth was a no for me. Which in turn made the whole thing not so bueno. Maybe i caught a bad batch."}
{"text":"We always love a good Vietnamese plave, and this was no exception.  Don't let the interior fool you, as it clearly used to be a Five Guys.   We got the eggrolls to start, and they were very fresh, hot, and crispy.  They give you a healthy portion of warm fish sauce to go with it  (yum!).  I tried the very berry fruit tea, which was delicious.  I like that it was made with crushed ice, and I loved the chunks of berry and jelly.  It was very sweet, and refreshing.   I got the pho ga, and my fiancee got com dac biet.  Both portions were huge.  The broth in the pho was very flavorful, and there was a great amount of white chicken meat.  I do wish there had been more onion slices. I also prefer cilantro on the side, versus basil. My fiancee enjoyed his dish, and commented that it was the biggest portion he has ever seen of that dish.  He also liked the fried tofu and the generous amount of fish sauce that came on the side (he usually has to ask for more.)  The waitress was very pleasant, and very attentive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service (2 stars ) - When we came in and ordered, they \"ran out\" of a LOT of stuff. No blue crab, no sweet tea. The server told me one of the items on the menu wasn't available, \"We don't have it\". Unless you get water, they bring you styrofoam cups that are smaller size than a small at a fast food place.   Food (2 stars) - The fried calamari we got had a nice texture, it went well with the sauce and wasn't too crunchy. The banh canh (udon) had good noodles, the soup was alright. The bun thit nuong had good grilled pork, but no egg roll and not much variety in vegetables. My hu tieu had super chewy, undercooked noodles and I didn't enjoy the soup at all. I think they had to rush it since everyone else got their food before me. The seafood combo was disappointing for the price it was. The crawfish were tiny and mussels/crab weren't that good.   Overall (3 stars) - This is a fairly new place, so maybe they need just need some time. They had a nice, chill atmosphere and young, but hard working servers. Gave an extra star for that bomb calamari and they had corn in the seafood combo that tasted good with the spicy sauce. They also gave you gloves and little plastic bag bibs if you wanted to avoid a  mess. Kudos for that :)"}
{"text":"THis place is not bad.  The pictures of the seafood boil, however are a little confusing because I don't think they offer this anymore at their new location, but I'm not sure??  I got the Tofu Pho and it was really good.  It took a little while to come out when I ordered it at lunchtime, which was fine.  The soup was hot and fresh.    I also ordered the pineapple tea, which was better than some places I've tried.  It was a lot sweeter and offered more flavor than previous ones.  I asked for mine with less jellies, because I am not sure yet exactly how I feel about them.  The service was excellent.  The waitress was informative and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"When I saw that a pho restaurant was opening in the shopping center across the street from where I live I was so excited. I normally get pho from Saigon Bay, but having it this close would be so convenient. The restaurant used to be a Five Guys, and I was surprised to find that they had barely changed anything about the appearance of the restaurant to distinguish it from the fast food burger joint. I was leery about the food from the appearance but I decided to give it a try despite my instincts.  I ordered the Pho Ga was very disappointed. The broth had no flavor whatsoever, and I had to use the entire cup of sriracha they gave me to make it worth eating. The chicken meat was a mix of light and dark, and the dark pieces were very veiny and sinewy. I feel like I have wasted my money (despite the low quality, the price was about the same as anywhere else at $11).   Hopefully they step their game up or they're replaced by a Mexican restaurant. This shopping center needs one!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Probably the most authentic Vietnamese  food in Charlotte, it's a great place for lunch it you work by the area.. the staff is also always very nice"}
{"text":"Holy crap!  Come here.  Trust me, I came three weeks in a row when I was pregnant.  This place be poppin with flavors!  There is plenty of parking, which is awesome!  Okay, when you come in, you can definitely tell it used to be a Five Guys, but don't let that turn you away!  The staff here is really friendly and will help answer any questions you have, I know because I had a lot.  There were some Vietnamese dishes I wasn't sure about, hence the questions.  Definitely try their seafood, I recommend the shrimp cause it's easier to peel.  Make sure to shake the bag up good so the sauce gets everywhere!  I ordered the pho with this too because...pregnant.  My husband had ordered B1and that was banging as well!  I want to try all their food, I just have to trek over there again (which will be soon!).  Come and try this place out.  The flavors and service will definitely bring you back."}
{"text":"The pho broth was yummy, the garlic butter seafood combo was simmer to perfection. Service a plus also."}
{"text":"Love this place, we had 1 lb shrimp and 1 lb crab legs with the Flamin Special sauce -added corn, sausage and potatoes. So good, that sauce is the best!!! Can't wait to go back and try their Banh Mi sandwiches for lunch some day!!"}
{"text":"Soo freakin' happy that they are back! Teas are great. Banh canh is delicious. Seafood boil sauce is the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Easily the best pho around the University City! I love the proportion between meat and soup and the broth was so dang flavorful. I got the kid size and wasn't even able to finish it, so... there's your answer for the question of \"Is there a good amount for the price?\".  I also got a couple's cup--for myself, of course-- and I got the Jasmine Milk Tea and Lychee fruit tea. It was sooooo good and I will be coming back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Great overall presentation. Friendly staff, great food selection. Just had the pho noodle soup for their soft opening and it was delicious. Just needed more flavor in the broth and separation of the noodles if you ask me"}
{"text":"Pho is meant for rainy days! So today for lunch decided to try this place out and I wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered the Shrimp Pho and my only complaint is that the shrimp still has the tails on it but other than that the broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. It was a pretty big serving too because I thought I ate half of it and I almost filled up the togo container, yes to dinner! I also ordered the spring rolls that were a good size with lots of fresh flavor.  The service was fast and friendly. There was only one young lady working and even with 6-7 tables she didn't miss a beat. There was a gentleman as well helping her bring out food but other than that she was taking care of everything.  Can't wait to come back to try a seafood boil!"}
{"text":"Best Bun in Charlotte! I got the F2 Bun noodle soup with Water Spinach, Crawfish and pork blood. So unique and tasty! Pho is also delicious! Jasmine milk tea is like heaven! Will come back to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an exceptional pho shop. Other dishes are good, too.  Generous portions and very reasonable prices. My new go-to for fast Vietnamese food!"}
