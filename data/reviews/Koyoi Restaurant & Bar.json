{"text":"I went here last week with a group of 7-8 people, and I was pretty impressed. To be honest, this was my first true Japanese cuisine experience, aside from the occasional sushi place. We ended up ordering a bunch of stuff, and passing it around the table to share. The beer was cold and the food was hot. The chicken and the pork were both delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place. Kinda hard to find. Food is great and less noisy than Guu."}
{"text":"BEST izakaya in toronto! I love koyoi lots of sakes and beers to choose from and food is amazing! Love the patio as well!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with friends here. I had sashimi dinner. It was fresh and portion was big, not like some other sushi restaurant they only give you very small and thin fish. The price was good too. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has different menu than the rest other Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Food is pretty good, service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Overpriced. They claim to have a 'home style' izakaya flare. It's just gross. Period. You can't disguise poorly executed dishes as home style and pass it off to the public. 

From what I can tell most of the patrons are the owners' friends. Which is indicative that they don't have much of a fan following or that most of the cooks just go there to drink as a watering hole. Explains why the staff aren't welcoming at all."}
{"text":"I came here after dinner with a friend for dessert but we couldn't help and tried some of the dishes as well. The curry udon was very authentic and strong flavour. Yummy black sesame ice cream. We didn't try a lot of the dishes, I'll definitely be back to try their other unique dishes and check out their happy hour specials. The staff were all very nice and the atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"They offer one of the most authentic tonkutsu ramen in Toronto. If you're a ramen fan, I highly recommend it.  A limited number are offered on Wednesday so get there early to try it and order the beef tataki as well :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident, but we were glad we did. Nice patio outside on a secluded side street, really interesting menu and a wide array of beer, wine, cocktails and sake. Staff was incredibly nice and attentive, and perhaps best of all the prices were absolutely reasonable. Will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"An update after almost a year---------
I came back to this place because the great memory on the salad and beef tataki, plus there seems to be some good looking new dishes according to pics posted by yelpers.

So they've changed the menu, there are still very few options for ppl who want authentic traditional-ish Japanese food. But it's okay, there are always ways to fill yourself up when you are in a restaurant.

Then the main reason for them to lose one star- our waitress, came. She's very beautiful, but with less smile and distant gesture. I ordered choya (plum wine), she asked if I wanted it on the rock or with soda, I said no, I just want it with itself. Of course she served the drink on the rock. It's okay it happens, so I started to take the ice out to my plate, at that time she was laying dishes on our table so I assume she saw it. But she neither offered to take my plate away nor ask me if I didn't want the ice, and she walked away. I had to ask another waitress to give me a new plate, she was much nicer, but for some reason she left that plate of ice on our table. In fact that plate of ice stayed on the very edge of our table till we asked for the bill.

Okay the food. I liked their beef tataki before, and it was still good, but not as good as Guu's. So it wouldn't be a very strong reason for me to go back.
My favorite Koyoi salad was okay but not as good as they used to be. The worst part was that they took out my favorite, healthy crispy lotus roots and put chips instead.
Ankimo, 4.99 for the quantity they are giving is a bit ridiculous, I don't think it was very fresh because some of the pieces were \"collapsing/melting\" and it taste fishy as well.
The grilled eggplant was plain and mediocre.

We were planning to order more, but we couldn't find anything else we really want to eat. As I said, it's a restaurant, you can always order more food to feed yourself, however, considering the service, we decided to move to Zakkushi for a second meal instead.

Asked for the bill, our beautiful waitress came back, still not so happy, which made me feel I made the right decision of leaving and never coming back.
------------------------------------------------------------

A friend is a big fan and expert of Japanese food, so we try different places almost every week.
The place was overall good, but it's a small place and can be crowded, therefore not very comfortable to sit.
I like the beef tataki but just as the same amount I like it anywhere else, and according to my friend, they are normal. The ankimo was good and fresh, it's good that they make it themselves, cuz some place just buy them from suppliers.
The Koyoi salad, my favorite salad of all time, while my friend only rated it as ok, I am still willing to go back just for the salad. The mixture of ingredient, the sauce, really showed they put thought in the dish.
The dessert I had was good too, but I am ready to try something new on the next visit. I'm also craving for their winter hot pot, but need to make reservation for that before two days, oh when will I be able to finally have it."}
{"text":"They have some real authentic stuff here that are perfect with a few drinks, like raw baby squids-these go great with alcohol. They also have traditional -style oden! I didn't get to try these, as there's a lot to try. 

Lots of yelpers have raved about their karaage. At the end of the day, it's Japanese-style deep fried chicken, so I didn't find myself having to wipe a tear of joy as other yelpers made it sound like I would get when I take a bite, but yes, it was good traditional karaage. In case anyone's wondering how karaage is different from American deep-fried chicken (if you already know, skip to last paragraph), here's a quick summary; they take the flesh off the bone (usually thigh, as it's very juicy and chewy), season lightly Japanese-style, and dust the chicken flesh in starch instead of plunging into a batter, so it's a much lighter taste that lets you taste more of the chicken, and it's still crispy and juicy. They do not have 50 different kinds of sauces like wing places; they always serve with fresh lemon for you to squeeze over the hot karaage, and if you pay just a little more, you can have it with mayo.

Overall, I had a great time. The place isn't big, and there were many groups of 4 people or less enjoying the food and each other's company. I saw people who got off work, students, people on dates, a nice mix. I'd say party of 8 or 10 is the biggest you should have here without booking out the whole place. They have well-priced drink specials on the weekdays. Yes, it's on the pricey side for the portion, but it was worth it for the authentic taste and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Stopped into Koyoi while on a business trip in Toronto and was very pleased.  Overall, the atmosphere there is great and is very much like a little diner you would find in Japan.  I sat at the small bar and conversed back in forth with the staff while drinking a \"nama beeru\".  I was there on a Wednesday and their special was Tonkatsu Ramen.  Although it didn't match up with what I have had in Japan before, it was tasty.  The other great part was Koyoi had oden, of which I tried and loved the daikon.  Great place!"}
{"text":"With the explosion of ramens and izakayas in Toronto, it has been quite a challenge to find new Japanese culinary experiences. I was introduced to the hidden gem of Koyoi by my friend and was greatly looking forward to it. Entering the restaurant immediately transports you to Tokyo in the 1990s with a hint of Lost in Translation with the nostalgic ambience and furnishings. 

For an intimate space like Koyoi, reservations in advance is definitely a must to avoid disappointment in the wintry cold. We started off we hot Japanese tea to whet our appetite and warm us up. To start, we had the beef tataki where the generous portion of grated daikon and green onion combine well with the perfectly executed slices of beef well-seasoned with a secret sauce that includes ponzu and mirin. 

In the manner of Japanese tapas, we had the chicken karage where the skin was crunchy and the meat moist and juicy. Still craving more chicken, we ordered fried chicken Okinawan-style with special tartar sauce which was a great delight as the flavour profile was refreshingly original amongst the many variations in other Japanese izakayas.

Reserving much room for the dessert course, my dining partner and i ordered the matcha green tea cake which was a delight as it was served with a vanilla gelato sprinkled with crunchy cereal and fragrant matcha powder. And ending the izakaya experience is the apple and cheese tortilla with ice cream. The tortilla texture was crisp and aromatic from the light cinnamon dustings and yet different from the typical Canadian crepes. And when combined with the richness of the cheese, this dessert is a true triumph for this nostalgic izakaya."}
{"text":"Everything that we tried was really delicious.
It's not as glamorous as Guu but that's the charm. It's a laidback, unpretentious place with down-to-earth people. When you want to have a few drinks with friends and eat a neverending supply of cozy, well executed Japanese bar food, it's the best. 

Delicious salmon ochazuke: fluffy rice, not toasty or oily, ribbons of seaweed and spring onions expertly cut. looks beautiful and tastes cozy at the same time.

okonomiyaki: large, light but filling, savoury and salty. 

chicken karaage with salt and lemon: ordered twice because of yumminess. much much much better than the chicken at kinton ramen. chicken with skin fried with a light, crisp outside. the outside is very light-coloured and textured, not dark and overfried and oily. lemon and salt flavours are perfect and refreshing. somehow tastes peppery too.

I want to try the green tea cake, ramen, salad, tataki and tofu in the future! Well, ok, pretty much everything."}
{"text":"I was always a fan of the food since Im Japanese and looking for more interesting food. Monkfish liver, chicken gizzard karaage is great!
Owner is great guys too"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced!! The waitress was so rude. Im not going to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Yes, thank you. I miss izakaya and this was the place that brought me back to days in Tokyo. Not Guu.  Most patron were Japanese, so that should say something. Yummy food, relax environment and good value. Nice patio during the summer days.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"When my DC and I didn't feel like cooking on Sunday night we decided to try Koyoi, which was recommended by a friend. It's an izakaya, like Guu, and run by actual Japanese. They have a smaller and more tame menu than Guu, but the prices are cheaper and the atmosphere more subdued - a completely different dining experience.

We ordered:

Deep Fried Chicken with Spicy Onion Sauce
 - Ddelicious, would order any of the deep friend chicken dishes

Koyoi Salad
 - Also a great choice, filled with all sorts of interesting items including fried lotus

Grilled Beef Tongue
 - Some was great, some was a little chewy. Enjoyed, but could have been better

Beef Tatami
 - My favourite item of the night. Chilled beef with a bed a noodles and several other items I'm not familiar with. Great taste, very fresh

Rice Ball Soup with Marinated Plum
 - The plum had a very strong and interesting taste, very tangy. It was difficult to spread the taste around, but maybe I just didn't know how to do it. The broth was pretty bland.

Slices of white fish paste (special)
 - Not a fan of this one. The fish paste was chewy and flavourless, it was just a way of conveying spicy wasabi-laced soy sauce into your stomach

Pickled Vegetables
 - Exactly what you would expect. We couldn't tell what some of the vegetables were (novices!) but they were all nicely pickled and had a good texture.


Koyoi is a solid choice if you're craving traditional Japanese izakaya but don't want to deal with the madness or prices of Guu. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for this authentic izakaya which caters mostly to Japanese clientele.  Staff is courteous but may have some ESL issues.  

Other than a few (perhaps too few) daily specials, Koyoi's menu hasn't changed at all from last year. This is why I deducted 1 star. 

All my Japanese friends highly recommend this place for comfort food.  They all prefer Koyoi to Guu for its authentic setting and ambiance.  Motsunabe (hot pot with leeks, cabbage, burdock, deep fried tofu and pig offals) is back and will be offered till Feb.  $15 per person (2 ppl min). ??/add udon or rice for $2.99. Perfect for chilly autumn evenings!  Limit 10 orders per night. 

Our all time fave is the Koyoi salad. Must order!  In fact, we've tried all of their staff picks and liked them. These are highlighted in their new menus (yes, new menus but with the same old menu items though!)

Easily accessible by subway (just north of Wellesley station)."}
{"text":"great foood!
- okonomiyaki / fried chicken / beef tongue !!
great service!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Dishes are small but cheap so you can order a few different ones to mix and match your meal. I love pairing the curry rice with a fried chicken dish.

The place is also very inviting and full of Japanese students."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken gizzard, beef steak (cube) & grilled beef tongue. Great food, portion typical of a Japanese restaurant, well worth the price though.

I will be back !"}
{"text":"Koyoi, unlike the regular Japanese restaurant, is actually opened by Japanese people. They serve smaller dishes, have unique food not found in a regular Jap restaurant and each dish is also priced reasonably. The food is well made and needless to say, the service was also good. That being said, going to Koyoi cannot really satisfy my voracious appetite without spending quite a bit."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night mainly for ramen, but was informed that they no longer sell it (not on the menu either). This place is alright. The menu to me isn't that interesting.

The most interesting (but not that tasty) dish we had was this raw small squid dish which was reallllyyyyy salty.

We also had the udon which was good, nice chewy noodles in a clear broth, the fish cake that came with it lacked texture and was really salty though, but the noodles and broth was good.

The spicy french fries was a surprisingly large portioned dish for an izakaya place, it was alright, not bad but nothing to write home about, but good bang for your buck.

I liked the beef tataki, nicely portioned and flavorful.

Service, was meh, the waitstaff was not that welcoming, no goodbyes when we left, no thank you when we paid, I guess from other Izakaya experiences, I expected more friendliness? They are the take your order quickly and rapidly drop the food on your table types.

Overall, I paid about the same amount as I would pay at Guu for a meal for two (around $50-$60 for 2 people) but I find the service and food much more inferior in quality and creativity. There are many better options in downtown Toronto, Guu, Kingyo, Hapa, so this place is definitely not my first choice."}
{"text":"What leaves people flocking to koyoi on any day of the week? Its their great sapporo on tap and cheap tasty food. Its your local izakaya that you would like to pop in daily for a some good japanese beer, chicken karagae, beef carpaccio or their special pork hot pot at the end of a long day. The ambiance and set up is low key and nothing spectacular. You come here for the cheap eats and drinks."}
{"text":"love the food here! simple but delicious japanese tapas. decent prices and portions. atmosphere could be better but will definitely return for some good eats"}
{"text":"I must first admit that Japanese tapas is not my cuisine of choice, which partly explains the 3 star rating. I prefer full meals when eating out, and the small dishes seem a little gimmicky to me. My friend, who is a Koyoi regular, raves about this place so I thought I'd give it a go. 

Overall, I still maintain my stance on the food, HOWEVER I do love the ambiance of this little place. The staff is extremely friendly and everything was beautifully plated and very instagram worthy =P We ordered the beef tataki, torched mackerel (not actually sure what it is), chicken cartilage, okonomiyaki, and curry fries. None of the dishes stood out obviously as the clear winner, but I definitely wasn't a fan of the cartilage. I enjoyed the fried batter around the cartilage, not so much the texture/crunchiness of the actual bone. 

I would come again with friends for the amicable atmosphere, perhaps try out different dishes in hopes to find something to change my mind. Koyoi is definitely a unique meeting place for friends to connect over food and drink :)"}
{"text":"I have fallen in love with Japanese food again ever since I've been back from Japan. I especially like the Izakaya type places, where it serves small dishes of food for sharing. My friend and I ordered a lot as we were stress eating. It was a hot day so eating inside was very stuffy, it took a lot of cold water before we cooled down.

We ordered these dishes to try:
- Beef tataki - very fresh with radish and green onions in sweet ponzu sauce

- Scallop carpaccio - with seaweed and salad, scallop were fresh but not much taste to it

- Deep fried chicken - very juicy meat in the inside while crispy on the outside, delicious

- Grilled Ox Tongue on hot plate - served with bean spouts, love the hot plate but need to eat right away so the beef doesn't cooked too long and the tough to bite

- Okonomiyaki - this is the first I've had found in Toronto. They don't cook in front of you but they serve it done on a hot plate. It was delicious with cubes of octopus.

- Sukiyaki - with beef, tofu, mushroom, cabbages in hot pot. I love the soup, very tasty. It was a small pot, wish there was some udon in it.

- Green tea cheesecake with ice-cream - after eating that, there is still room for dessert. I like just about anything with green tea so a cheesecake is no exception. My first time having a green tea cheesecake, its good, not sweet and have flavours of green tea. A good light dessert option.

The place is decent size but the tables are pretty cramp together so not very comfortable. Not here for the ambiance. Noisy as in you can hear clearly the conversation next to you but not loud that you have to scream at each other across the table. They have a variety selection of alcohol too so if you want to chill in the patio for drinks, its an option as well."}
{"text":"The matcha cheese cake and apple crepe dessert are amazing! I would rank it as the best \"quality to price \" Japanese restaurant in downtown."}
{"text":"I walked by Koyoi a few months ago and looked like a lot of jap ppl in there.  Made a mental note and checked it out.  It didn't disappoint me, very authentic jap izakaya.  I like it better than Guu/Don Don.  So far I tried quite a few things on their menu:  Beef tataki, okonomiyaki, Koyoi salad were my favs.  

Of coz, to complete a meal, we gotta have desserts: Greentea rare cheesecake is a must try and their black sesame ice-cream was good too. 

It's definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Just a quaint little place to enjoy a nice dinner with friends. I suggest the steak cubes w/ fries, the chicken gizzard and grilled beef tongue topped off with a Sapporo. Patio is great, waitresses are attentive and helpful. Second time here, last time was two years ago and it was still great."}
{"text":"Cozy small Japanese izakaya place without the loud noises and fancy flare. They have interesting cocktails that I've never seen before .. like the choyu with (hand squeezed- literally squeeze your own) citrus fruit ! Lol choose from a half piece of grapefruit, lemon, lime or orange :) and add it to your iced alcoholic drink. 
They also had a wide selection of food and snacks. Overall it was nice and quiet . Great for conversation and not as rowdy as other izakayas. :) I also saw some people on their laptops there at 1230am."}
{"text":"I love koyoi! It's a smaller izakaya off of Yonge St with a patio.  It's definitely cozy and doesn't seat too many but their food is delicious with a wide range of drinks & sake.

My personal favourites to get whenever I go: takowasabi, udon, fried chicken & fries, beef tataki.

It's a good place for a date as it doesn't get too loud."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick izakaya meal on Yonge!

Casual enough that I showed up after a spin class in my gym clothes and I didn't feel underdressed.  

The restaurant is small and simple and it was super busy for a Tuesday evening.  We ordered some of the more popular items... and then some others.

* Koyoi Salad
This creative Japanese inspired salad was completely exciting!  Topped with bonito flakes, there was leafy lettuce, deep fried purple yam and yellow yam crisps, tofu, with a delicious vinaigrette dressing.  -- We could have ordered two of these!

* Fried chicken with mayo was a great choice! 
The batter was crunchy and crispy.  The chicken was super moist and juicy dark meat.  -- We could have ordered two of these! But two orders of fried chicken makes you feel a lot worse than two orders of salad.

* The beef tataki is an izakaya staple. It was good but not spectacular.

There are some items I probably could have done without.

* Cow tongue came as five thin slices on a hot plate.   Chewy, a bit bland, not as interesting as it could have been.

* Grilled eggplant takes 20 minutes to make.  Decorated with loads of bonito chips, this dish still lacked visual appeal.  As for flavour, all you could taste is ginger and more ginger.  Skinless, colourless, mushy, and a complete disappointment.

*The shrimp sashimi and little cold squares of tofu came smothered in hot sauce.  I didn't think there was very much shrimp.  The hot sauce was overpowering and much spicier than expected or required for such a light dish.  You almost felt like they were covering up something.  This cold dish was a cold and spicy  fail.

*Onigiri  - The rice and seaweed was as satisfying a bowl of plain white rice.  There was a rectangle of seaweed, rice, with a tiny spoonful of fish flakes and mayo.

There were two servers one attentive and the other one was complete horrible.  Which I guess averages out to...  well, the service sucked, ok?

Our first waitress was very impatient and distracted.  She didn't give any type of suggestions when asked and looked rather annoyed.  Perhaps she didn't speak English.  Okay, at least smile and nod then.  GRrr.

I had a very mixed experience here.  There were some fantastic dishes and then some completely mediocre items that I wish we didn't order at all.

This place is great for a light meal, but definitely not as trendy or high energy as Guu.  If I want a more traditional place for izakaya, there's always Ematei.  If I want a cheap and quick izakaya snack in sweat pants, I'll return to Koyoi.

There were two items I wanted to try: Duck and the okonomi... which were sold out.  They do have $5 happy hour specials (when you buy a drink) and I do like happy hour. =)"}
{"text":"Excellent! We had a variety of dishes and they were all great! Today's special was baked scallops which were perfect and wonderful. Great, attentive service. Place packed... Reservations a really good idea."}
{"text":"On a random trip to Toronto, I had the pleasure of stumbling upon this restaurant with my friends on a Friday night. We ordered one of everything on the menu and the only thing I regret is that we weren't able to finish everything (we did finish all the pitchers though I'm not crazy). The waitresses were super attentive and the ambiance made me forget I was in a bustling metropolis."}
{"text":"My favorite dish is their salt and lemon fried chicken. I grt it every time I go. The udon soup is also wonderful. Recommend their black sesame mochi ice cream dessert. This place is very authentic and a great place to go if you crave japanese food but want to get out of the sushi zone."}
{"text":"Chanja tofu was so good I think my spirit left my body for a few moments. The ankimo was also great as was the service and the prices. 

Pop in and try something!"}
{"text":"Having been to Guu before, I found this location to be of a much different feel as other Yelpers have already indicated. I went for a quiet dinner with the lady friend and I have to say, I was quite impressed!

The menu is much smaller than Guu's but with no wait time, larger portions, and better prices. 

I particularly enjoyed the yuzu-takowasa (takowasabi with a yuzu sauce), the crunchy okonomiyaki, and a great helping of duck breast that was meaty, rich, and topped with a small onion and garlic mixture that added an extra depth of flavor to the dish.

For a full review, check out my blog, conveniently located in my profile. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had some of the best ranked items like beef tataki and chicken karaage. They taste good but not amazing. if these are the best dishes then I don't feel like going again."}
{"text":"Decided to come to this place the day of and table  reservations had entirely been filled, got seats at the bar instead.

Staff were friendly, ambience is very cozy since the restaurant is relatively small compared to Guu. It seemed like this place caters more specifically to a Japanese community-- noticed all of the customers spoke Japanese. 

So did it live up to the hype?

I found the menu choices much more limited than other izakayas. Items prices are reasonable. We ordered the takowasabi for $4.50; the grilled scallop with cheese, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, garnished with anchovy for about $10; and the kaarage for about $10. Kaarage was excellent, one of the better ones I've had. The scallop was a special dish I didn't see elsewhere, and the anchovies gave it an interesting kick while the cheese made it rich in flavour. Takowasabi was alright, met standards but average.

Overall, the quality of the food met my standards but the limited menu choices and overall (under)creativity of the menu led me to decide on three stars for this one. I may come back to try the hot pot next time though, since it is popular for Japanese guests."}
{"text":"My favorite of the izakaya restaurants that I have tried to date. 

Very good food, nice low-key environment where you'll find the jeans and t-shirt crowd next to a table of young Japanese couples in traditional attire. Not a bad sign that the patrons are a good 70% or more Japanese. Nicest servers in the city. Good prices, great food! Everything is very well presented.

When my husband and I say 'izakaya' we now are only referring to this one. It has reached a status for us of being synonymous with the entire class of restaurant."}
{"text":"I really wish this place lived up to all the rave I read about here on Yelp. A tiny shop that's got a simple Japanese tapas bar setup with a diverse menu and a full house! I was shocked by the number of people here in the middle of the week for dinner - it wasn't even warm weather that day.

My friend and I were eager to catch up over a few shared items, so we grabbed the agedashi tofu, grilled eggplant, okonomiyaki, karaage, and an udon bowl. It didn't seem like much but it was plenty for our small appetites. She doesn't eat raw fish, so sashimi and tataki items were out of the question. Normally, this is totally not a problem at a location with this kind of menu, but it seemed like that was what everyone was talking about here at Koyoi, or there's been a lot of changes to the kitchen since those amazing reviews.

Overall, the food was nothing to write home about. Everything was just ok, if not worse. I struggled to give three stars but wanted to give the benefit of the doubt that we just didn't get their signature items. The agedashi tofu had a stubborn sticky coat that refused to separate with my bites, which ruined the experience. The eggplant was accompanied by bonito flakes - the flavour combination was poor and my eggplant was way overcooked. Everything else was passable, meaning I could go elsewhere for better.

There was also a lack of ventilation and sitting near the back beside the washrooms and kitchen meant odd odours wafted at us all dinner. Not the greatest, but something attributable to our poor luck. 

For the price, and the location (so close to so many other options!), I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I was craving izakaya food and found Koyoi on Yelp. We walked in on a Friday night and were lucky enough to grab two of their last few bar seats. I would recommend making reservations here if you don't want to wait. Upon entering the restaurant we heard a lot of Japanese dialogue - definitely brought us back to Japan! The space is small and cozy, and by no means extravagant which we thoroughly enjoyed. Compared to an izakaya like Kinka or Guu, Koyoi is much more toned down and less lively.

Great selection of shareable plates! Between the two of us, we had:

1) A bottle of Sake - Why not?
2) Beef tataki - Good, but a bit on the sour side from the sauce (which I personally didn't mind)
3) Scallop carpaccio - Scallops were so fresh and I loved the salad & dressing!
4) Deep fried oysters - Crisp batter and comes with a pink tartar sauce
5) Chicken karaage - Not too oily, tasty after squeezing some lemon juice on top
6) Beef steak cubes on hot plate - This was so good and cooked perfectly, especially delicious with the dip it came with!
7) Spicy fries with curry and melted cheese - Nothing too special but I am tempted to recreate this at home!

Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back to try out more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Good Izakaya. The quality is excellent. The decoration is functional, but do not let that dismay you."}
{"text":"Tired of waiting in line for Guu?  Well, now you have another place to wait in line for your Japanese Tapas craving...Koyoi!  Yes the off to the side, hole in the wall Japanese Izakaya is your one stop for delicious authentic side dishes, hot pot, udon, bbq and Saporro on tap.  Also before you start throwing money at your screen while you read this, the prices here are very reasonable!  A proper meal can be had for less than $30 with a beer to boot!

Service here is pretty good and I would compare it to that of Guu.  The staff are bombarded with orders and cleaning up tables, but they still manage to have a smile on their faces.  They take their time explaining things on the menu and always mention the house specials available.  They treat you like fam, knowmsayin?

The food is on point and you can't get a better slab of Octopus with Wasabi on a piece of seaweed in the city.  That fried chicken tho, oh lawd it was some tasty poultry!  It's finger lickin' good and even Colonel Sanders would shed a single tear biting into a piece.  

Watashi wa kono basho e kaerimasu yo!"}
{"text":"This place is casual and has a decent patio.  Ramen on Wed night is more expensive than other places but the broth is rich and flavorful.  Chicken karaage, beef tataki, and the tontoro (grilled jowl) were all pretty tasty and well priced for the quality and serving sizes.  A solid go-to place for consistent izakaya fare (especially if you don't like waiting in lines)."}
{"text":"they charge $2 for green tea WITHOUT telling you there is an extra charge. food is ok. a bit pricy for the proportion. will only go if happen to be in the area and there is no better place to eat. and beef tataki is not that good"}
{"text":"Compared to other Izakaya , Koyoi is very quiet, nice and cozy. It's a good place to have some beers and chat with friends. It has a nice patio there so it will be a perfect hangout place in summer.

Since the place is really small, it will be hard to get a seat if you have more than 4 people. 

Their food is not bad and they have at least 4 different types of fried chicken. However, they have limited food selection there. I always want to try different food at izakaya so i am a bit disappointed at Koyoi in terms of this. This is the main reason that i only give out 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went here again with my brother this time tonight for dinner, and again the food and service was great. 

Had the usual Spinach Salad with bacon and warm dressing and again did not disappoint. Also had the Grilled Chicken with Daikon Radish Ponzu Sauce, the chicken was cooked well and was moist and the ponzu sauce complimented it very well with its sweet, salty and sour flavour. Also had Sake steamed clam, the clams itself tasted very good and very fresh and the sake base also was great and was not very overpowering. And also had the Breast Duck, the duck was moist and was not very greasy the sauce itself I found sweet.

For drinks I had the sweet potato Shochu which was called SatsumaMuso Sakuramon, this one was quite different from the first drink I had which was called Satsuma Shiranami as it went much smoother and had more of a distinct sweet potato flavour. With it we had the octopus marinated wasabi which again is a must not miss in this resto.

I hope more people would come to this resto as the food and service here are great and all employees are welcoming. This place is a gem.

Note: We also had Japanese Pancake, Hamburger Steak (Jap Hamburger) both were up to par and not need to be reviewed again."}
{"text":"The food tasted above average, however portions were quite small and service was slow. Stone pot dish was good, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy fries, ton ton pork hot plate and a Sapporo pitcher.

The spicy fries are a must get, great taste, and excellent quantity for the price. 

Pitcher was also great, around 6-7$ per person when split 3 way. 

Only issue was the main course(s) which were quite small, and expensive. Highly recommend the sides and drinks here, but is not a good place if you're very hungry and looking for big portions for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Sooo experience and so tiny tiny food... and sarvers not notice about customers at all... they forgot my drink as well... terrible customers service"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and had an amazing experience. Think about guu but without the price tag. The food was delicious and everyone there is very friendly. The only bad thing was that they didn't let me cut my birthday cake or eat it there so I was thoroughly disappointed in that. 

Foods to try: beef tataki, octopus with wasabi sauce, stir fry noodles with egg. If anything, try the whole menu! I definitely was not disappointed and will be back !"}
{"text":"Koyoi vey. It would have been awesome to discover a great izakaya in the neighbourhood, especially with its lovely little patio...but we didn't.

The good: fries with curry & cheese ($6), agedashi tofu ($4), Koyoi salad ($6) and \"pizza\" (a small super-thin crispy flatbread with cheese and the very awesome burdock plant, $6) were really tasty, albeit all priced a dollar or two too high. Our friend enjoyed the karaage (deep fried chicken with lemon, $5.5).

From there, downhill:
- Avocado with wasabi & soy sauce (a ludicrous $5) was, sadly, exactly what it sounded like: half a sliced avocado with a dab of soy sauce on the side.
- Onigiri (rice ball, $2) and ochazuke (rice in broth, $4) both offered a \"choice of salmon, marinated plum or okakamayo\" but should probably have just read \"rice\". A single quarter-sized plum and an amount of salmon so minuscule there is no unit of measurement to adequately describe it. Literally too little to taste.
- \"Chilled Chinese noodles\" ($11) were appropriately named, I guess, but with a few sliced cucumbers and scant pieces of ham, the medium-sized dish of yellow noodles was grossly overpriced.
- Our meat-eating friends were underwhelmed by the \"#1 customer favourite\" beef tataki ($6).
- Oden ($1.50 per item): fine. Fish cakes were fish cakes.

We shared a couple rounds of the house sake ($15 for a large size - actually a tokkuri on the small side) which was nice, though why the waitress said it would be enough for 6 people is unclear - there were five of us and not much to spare.

We wanted to order the grilled potato but they were sold out, and they also couldn't/wouldn't make the okonomiyaki without meat, for some reason. Our friend ordered a desperate second helping of karaage and wondered aloud if an evil wizard had cursed the restaurant such that the more its customers ate, the hungrier they got (suspicion unconfirmed). $125 later, we went across the street for cookies and fro-yo.

In summation: getting a full meal here is a Sisyphean task. Maybe worth a happy hour visit? I'll definitely head over to Guu (or try one of the many other izakayas around) the next time I'm jonesing for Japa-tapas - a much more generous menu, inventive kitchen and better service/atmosphere at the same price. For delicious Japanese pancakes (made with whatever you want in them), go to Okonomi House."}
{"text":"All foods are delicious and authentic, like oden, oxy tongue, beef tataki, the pork feet, tofu soup!!desserts are great too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem that serves authentic Japanese food and at reasonable prices for downtown Toronto, and service is always good/friendly.

While I do agree with some reviewers that not all dishes are good, there are a handful of dishes that I think are fantastic and are always my go-to. Koyoi salad, Beef tartar (my favourite dish here - well sauced, well garnished and super fresh), chicken karaage, fried chicken.

Overall, if you're looking for an izakaya with $15 sapporo pitchers, good food and not jam packed with people, check it out!"}
{"text":"Great little gem hidden in the area. Came here for Valentines Day and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, everything tasted great and homemade.

We ordered:

Koyoi salad - highlight of our meal. Love everything about this and the dressing is delicious!

Beef tataki - went great with the ponzu sauce, presented beautifully as well.

Scallop cappricio - loved the scallops with the greens, everything went well together.

Curry fries - a bit too salty for my liking but fries were ridiculously crispy

Fried oyster - fried perfectly, it was soooo good.

Lemon and salt karaage - super crispy and well done!

Spicy pork in soy milk broth - it wasn't spicy at all and felt a bit empty without any noodles in it, but we added rice and it was great. Probably wouldn't order this again.

Green tea cake and ice cream - sooo good.

Black sesame ice cream - this was super good and unique as well, however it was too sweet for my liking.

Overall, amazing food for reasonable prices. Only complaint for me would be the decor/washrooms, they should renovate it since it felt a bit dirty. However I am coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a low-key Izakaya spot on Yonge that offers a heavenly salad and other decent Japanese tapas.

Unlike the Kinka and other Izakayas, this place is more mellow, making for a great casual evening with friends. 

Let me start with the salad. The base is romaine lettuce, and it is topped with bonito flakes, soft tofu, seaweed, chips and a soy based vinaigrette. Oddly enough, it goes wonderfully together. The creaminess of the tofu and savoury bonito flakes balanced with a light salad is so flavourful yet guilt-free. I can eat this salad forever. 

Unfortunately, nothing else we've ordered here has wow-ed us, although their curry fries and karaage are quite good paired with a beer. We'll keep trying out other dishes though, because the salad alone keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"My experience was fantastic. I've been searching for affordable-authentic sushi special spots in TO.

The @waitress was from Hiroshima or Nagasaki...

I just said: f... those gringos"}
{"text":"For me, it's the most versatile restaurant in the city. You can hang out with your friends here (Great tapas style dishes, Tuesday Sapporo specials). You can bring a date here (Not the candle-lit type of place, but the environment is very cozy and fun). You can bring a co-worker or even your boss here to have them try something they probably have never tried before from octopus salad to beef tongue to beef tataki. Quality of the dishes - consistently great. Been here at least 20+ times and it's never let me down."}
{"text":"I remember walking by this Izakaya with a bunch of Yelpers as we went to Ethiopian House for our Okonomiyaki UYE.  It was SUPER packed then on that Friday but unfortunately it was nothing of that kind this Wednesday.  They open 5pm and we were there around 5:30pm as we saw one other person at the patio sitting go on their way.

We were greeted by 2 girls and as we went in we noticed the simple clean decor which was mostly decorated by SAKE Bottles and Posters.  There's a pretty good list of alcoholic drinks but that wasn't what my interest was here.  I know I'm contradicting myself going to an Izakaya and not drinking but I let my friend cover for me in this scenario as we had other Izakaya destinations next.

Beef TONGUE($7.99) was very tasty presented on a cast-iron plate served with a Lemon Wedge and Sprouts.  I wasn't expecting sprouts to be served here but it didn't hurt.  If you tasted the Tongue before and after the Lemon then you would know that the Lemon Juice makes this dish amazing.  The only downside was that I wish I had more for this price-point.

OKONOMIYAKI($7.99) was in appearance everything I remembered from my photographic memory of my Asian trip.  The only thing that was missing was the Shrimp, Octopus, an extra Metal Spatula, and the Teppan Grill in front of me.  I noticed Squid only, but maybe I'm wrong?!?

It definitely makes other Okonomiyaki's look inferior but it didn't go without some slight imperfections as I like my Cabbage bits a bit bigger for that crunch Vege/Seafood/Cake Mix ratio.

Ankimo - Monkfish Liver($4.99) was A-OK.  Looks like Liver, taste like Liver... Served with a bit of sauce and shredded Daikon Radish.  

Great presentation overall for all items and definitely a place I will return when I visit my friends.  May I suggest you go to Guu to get your 1 hour wait time and come to Koyoi for a snack while you wait???  I wish someone suggested this to me before!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese food (according to my Japanese companion). I had a lovely time here after work on a Tuesday. Koyoi is tucked away on a quiet side street away from the bustle of Yonge and it has a nice front patio. The first thing I noticed was that all the patrons were Japanese! That in itself is a guarantee of authenticity. Our server was on a working holiday from Japan and she was excellent. We had karaage (tapioca batter fried chicken), a nuri & tofu salad with sweet potato and beet chips, and a traditional Japanese pancake (WOW)! We also consumed many chuhai cocktails (Japanese-style vodka with club soda and freshly squeezed citrus fruits). Koyoi might be missing a little something in the way of an enticing atmosphere but the overall experience was just delightful."}
{"text":"I love this place...This is the spot I go to after work where I could count on having good, light, quality food and a quiet environment.   

1. The Hokkaido scallop carpaccio - their raw scallop is always fresh, with the right amount of dressing
2. Onigiri (Rice ball) - decent size and the marinated plum is very sour - it's good if you can handle sour 
3. Matcha cheesecake - this will make you happy and content!  Light and delish. 

There's something very Japanese about this place, the décor, the waitresses, everything!"}
{"text":"Koyoi is one of the few places i need to go every month due to cravings i cannot control. I was introduced to the restaurant by my girlfriend (who is japanese) and knows all the authentic japanese places around town and refuses to go anywhere else that is not japanese run (Toronto is full of non-japanese ie. chinese, korean, ??? owned japanese restaurants). Our go to dishes are the koyoi salad, chicken karage with lemon, beef carpaccio, and okonomiyaki (best in TO). Now there is a second location at Yonge and Finch which i haven't tried, but will soon.... ps. actually dont come here its not that great (and very packed on weekends!) :P"}
{"text":"Pioneer of izakaya in Toronto they're here before guu and I've been here since they first opened ."}
{"text":"Admittedly I am a little biased since I do judge a restaurant by the cover and Koyoi, despite being moderately spacious and even has a patio, is really generic and ratchet looking. I like traditional Japanese-style seats at izakayas for the full experience, but here the tables and seats are plastic (?) and really feels like a big hole in the wall (nothing wrong with that).

Food- 4/5. Excellent, but not the best. Kintaro and Kinka Izakayas still do it better. Koyoi uses a lot of soy sauce.

In order of favorites from most to least:
1. Koyoi salad - Our favorite since it was huge and comes with greens, bonito flakes, mayo, fresh tofu, and root vegetable chips (beets, lotus). It does get very salty at the bottom since it's mostly soy sauce.
2. Japanese style omelette - 5 egg rolls that were light, fluffy, and slightly sweet! Comes with a blob of minced Daikon. Small portion size.
3. Scallop salad - The raw scallops tasted like nothing, but the salad also came with greens, tomatos, and seaweed. Above average portion size.
4. Seared Mackerel - My gf hated this, said it smelled too fishy to consume. I personally liked it for being fully marinated (the flavor was really in there, but mostly it was salty) and the texture was more cooked than raw, so felt like I was eating beef. The portion size is small.
5. Grilled Eggplant - eggplant will be eggplant, but luckily Koyoi tried to flavor it up by adding bonito flakes on top. The presentation is interesting - it looked like a fish! 

Value- 5/5. No, it's not cheap, but for an izakaya this is probably as good as it gets downtown. My girlfriend and I ordered 5 dishes and 0 drinks and spent $23 each here last night for dinner. Some of the portion sizes are huge - namely, the fries and the Koyoi salad. Even the scallop salad was quite large (I was expecting a small dipping bowl of marinated scallops). Other dishes are quite small, like the seared mackerel, but since it is quite richly flavored/salty you feel filled up. The food menu items range from $2 for oden to $12-15 for grilled seafood. There's also a $5 per item happy hour deal on Tuesday-Thursday between 5-6PM. Too bad we came on Friday :'(

Service- 4/5. Very friendly, minor language barrier that made no impact on ordering.

Venue- 4/5. QUIET (despite being a Friday night) and sufficiently spacious. As you may know from my Kinka review, being able to converse in an izakaya and sit comfortably (i.e. stretch my legs) are key. They also have a sidewalk patio. If bringing a large group, do call to make a reservation in advance as space does fill up.

Will be back one day!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The food taste good.. But it's definitely not worth the price. got the hotpot but 90% of the ingredients are vegetables. Ordered curry rice and wasn't even full. Their portions are so small that it isn't even worth it. It ended up being $25-$30 pp of you get drinks / you want to be full. 

The food taste decent it's just not worth the price. I rather go guu."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place as a cheap and affordable izakaya but it turned out to be much pricier than what we thought. We have two drinks (a beer and a glass of plum wine), the beef tataki, wasabi octopus, okonomiyaki and fried chicken. The bill came to a total of $60 for both. The portions were definitely of tapas size and the food we ordered wasn't enough to feed two of us.

Flavour wise, the beef tataki had a little bit too much shaved radish (but that's a personal opinion) and the okonomiyaki a bit too much sauce. The wasabi octopus could have also used a little bit more wasabi kick. The fried chicken was light and crispy."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'm not much of a fan of Guu, i think it was cool first couple of my visits but the yelling and screaming to greet customers definitely became an annoyance for me than an excitement.  The food here is awesome.  It not over sauced to compliment the taste of the main ingredients and it quiet ambiance set itself apart from most other Izakaya.  Definitely my go to Izakaya in the city! Keep up the good work guys!!"}
{"text":"Tried it again on their Happy Hour Specials - 5-6pm on tuesdays-thursdays. I want to go for the Nabe, but I keep forgetting to reserve.

Anyways, the food quality is good, my partner demolished her salad and matcha cheesecake and drank up the chocolate sauce. For the drinks, don't go for a non-alcoholic drink because the drink was served in a tall, but thin glass and there's a ton of ice inside and they don't do refills :| At least give me the can!

Ordered almost the same dishes with the exception of the U-don and scallop carpaccio.

The service was...let's say it was somewhat slower than I was expecting. I am not sure what happened, but the food came out at appropriate times, meaning it wasn't too fast and when they missed an order, they immediately worked fast on rectifying the mistake. I'd still come again though! The $5 u-don was smooth."}
{"text":"Less raucous atmosphere than what I'm accustomed to at an izakaya, thus creating a more intimate dining experience. Has a good list of wines and sake but unfortunately I was not in the mood for alcohol so didn't get a chance to try. Portions seem on the whole larger than other izakaya experiences I've had (Guu, Ematei, Hapa). Service was quick and friendly--my tea cup was replenished with hot water regularly--though it did appear to be a slow night. The food was decent, well prepared but nothing to write home about. 

There wasn't anything on the menu that screams at me to come back. Okay, maybe if I couldn't get a seat at Guu and was dying for tako wasabi*  I would come here; Guu and Koyoi (and only on the rare occassion, Tokyo Grill) are the only places in Toronto I've found that serves tako wasabi.

*diced octopus sashimi marinated in wasabi greens"}
{"text":"I came here randomly one night with friends even though I've walked by it a number of times over the 10 years that I've lived nearby. I just never had an inclination to walk in because from the outside, this place looks really \"meh\". I was quite surprised that the experience inside was nothing like what you'd expect from the outside.

This place is usually full on the weekends and the week nights, but because it's not as well-known as the other izakaya places, you never really have to wait too long. It is a small place, but that gives the entire bar/restaurant that cozy feel. I absolutely adore the servers and the bartenders. They are all very friendly and chatty. Feel free to sit by the bar and strike up a conversation with the bartenders - they all seem like they genuinely like talking to people, and just after coming a few times, we're already on a first-name basis with the staff.

If you're looking for an authentic Japanese izakaya experience, this is the closest thing you'll find in Toronto. Guu/Kinka and all their variants are not what you would typically find in Japan. My only concern is that if this place does become quite popular, the wait times are going to become absurd, as the whole restaurant probably can't fit more than 20 people.

In terms of the food and drinks, they are generally good. Not everything on their menu is \"omg fantastic\", but they do have a few stand-out dishes: The beef tataki, gyu-tan (grilled beef tongue), udon, ochazuke (porridge), and beef steak are all excellent choices that I would recommend. If you want something really special, order the motsunabe (hot pot) - a perfect dish for the winter and the portions are generous. The bartenders also have a good taste for drinks, and makes excellent cocktails - just ask for some suggestions and I'm sure they'll whip up something great for you. The overall price of the restaurant is fair, and it is slightly cheaper than your average izakaya restaurant in Toronto - but it isn't super cheap either ($30/person for enough food and drinks).

If you ever decide to come here on a weekend, you'll likely find me at the bar with a lot of food in front of me. And yes, I can and will finish them all."}
{"text":"This place isn't much a hidden gem anymore, compared to its earlier years (~2013). For the same reason, the food and overall quality also went from solid 5 stars to 4. 

Koyoi was my favorite izakaya until last year (2017) when I discovered Zakkushi. It's a regular Izakaya/diner for the local Japanese community. Their signature dishes are Koyoi salad, beef tongue & tataki, chicken karaage & nanban, and any seasonal dishes. As a student, I lived in the condo next to this restaurant so you can be assured I've eaten these dishes more times than I can count.

In these years, the biggest change for me was that certain dishes like the salad and chicken nanban weren't consistent anymore. They used to be so addictive and I'd recommend them to anybody but now it's a hit or miss. For the salad, the dressing's taste changed and the veggie chips they sprinkle on top are sometimes stale. They also changed the recipe for the chicken nanban so it has less of the egg/savoury part; it's mostly mayo and chicken now. Trust me it's still 4 stars but man those dishes used to be THE BEST SALAD AND CHICKEN I've ever tasted.

So if you're in the mood for some authentic Japanese foods (including home cooked curry, okonomiyaki, onigiri, oden, yakisoba), you can try this place.

Call first to reserve because they're sometimes randomly closed for private events."}
{"text":"Great food!  A bit pricier than your regular japanese restaurant but on par with all the izakaya places. They have a best 5 menu list which we ordered off of and they were all great. The deep fried chicken was especially juicy and I really liked their octopus wasabi dish. Don't forget to get the black sesame ice cream as dessert!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap izakaya? This is the place!

We had dinner here and ordered a lotta of food. The drink menu looked intriguing, but we had to pass it at the moment.

Pros:
- It was quiet, comfortable and very casual.
- The food on average was $6/dish.
- I liked the deep fried oysters and their karaage (fried chicken). 
- The food always came hot and fresh.

Cons:
- The service was a bit confusing and sometimes slow. We called earlier to reserve a table, but they didn't understand. It all worked out fine.

There are other izakayas in the neighbourhood, but if you're on a tight budget, don't mind the scenery, and live much closer to this one - check it out!"}
{"text":"As recommended by my Japanese friend, Koyoi's ramen never lets u down n some late night sake is just wut we expect as sweetest addition."}
{"text":"Was craving hot soup on a cold winter's night but was disappointed to find Sansotei--a ramen shop around the corner from here--mysteriously closed on Tuesdays.

So we decided to give this place a try. A quick scan of Yelp reviews indicated that the fried chicken appetizer was a must try, so we ordered that along with two Udon soups: one regular and the other with curry broth.

The fried chicken morsels (which we generously squirted with lemon juice) were not crispy but were still super tasty, tender and juicy. Definitely hit the spot.

As for the udon soups, the curry version is infinitely more delicious than the regular one, although it does have some spice to it (hence: curry).

Bonus points for fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I feel the quality of the food here has been declining, inconsistent at least. Its not bad, but the quality of the food doesn't really match the price it charges. With the same price, there are better choices in the city."}
{"text":"To be honest, the only reason we came here was because we didn't want to stand in line at Guu.  I guess it's close enough to feed off spilloff traffic?  Not a bad izakaya at all - and it's nice they have patio seats.

I am a fiend for beef tongue and I like how they served it in big slices on a sizzling plate.  All the other items we had were on par.  Unfortunately, the top shell dish we had was not very fresh and we simply didn't eat the rest of it.

Anyways - wasn't bad considering it's a izakaya just off Yonge.  However, my friend and I decided to bounce back to Guu - nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Good food expecially during happy hours. Good portion of food and great quality. Thankfully the restraunt wasn't as busy as I thought. They did not let sit at the table of 4 even though they could have move the tables in the other sides. Other than that,  very authentic Japanese food in downtown area."}
{"text":"Tasty fried food and liquor! Yup, I'm a fan!

Deep fried shrimp w/ mayo, fried chicken w/ salt & lemon plus your choice of beer or shochu and you're all set. Just keep ordering that and you'll be happy. 

Want more? The octopus w/ wasabi was tasty and the desserts of parfait and green tea cheesecake were not your typical North American desserts, i.e.; they're not sweet, but still good."}
{"text":"Food here is always good but the service is mediocre to terrible. 

The last time we went, it was a small group of 4. We were waiting for a table so the server sat us down at the bar area and we ordered some food and drinks while we waited. 1.5 hours later, we were still sitting at the same place in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Very fun unique more traditional Japanese restaurant, not your everyday sushi and tempura kind of place. Fun feeling with mostly Japanese clientele and Japanese born staff. You'll even get a Japanese welcome when you come in. Reminiscent of Tokyo.
Food was unique which is saying a lot for Toronto. We had thinly sliced beef, beef tongue in curry and Japanese pancake. All very tasty. Ready for a change? Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Koyoi is a casual yet classy establishment to bring your friends for good food and drinks. The drinks menu is extensive, and after sampling a variety of them I can guarantee you that Koyoi makes delicious cocktails. Similarly, the food is also quite good, and if you select dishes off of the 'top-rated' section you'll probably have a good time. 

On a weekday evening Koyoi was very busy, but luckily we had a table to ourselves within seconds. The waitress is super attentive but won't bother you unless you wave her over. They have a lot of neat specials on the walls, and if you come by on Thursday (I believe) from 5 pm - 6 pm they have some discounted food. 

I love Koyoi very much, and will definitely come back. There are a lot of dishes and drinks I have yet to try!

Favorites: fried chicken (karaage)

Dislikes: onigiri (just plain rice), oden (very average taste)"}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)

Koyoi is a great little spot if you want a real izakaya experience (and without the lineups of Guu!). From the J-pop on the stereo to the cute drawings of animals on the menu posted on the wall, I totally felt like I was in Japan. Hearing lots of Japanese spoken around you is always a good sign in my books. 

Came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. My party of 4 managed to snag the last seats at the bar. We ordered the \"top 5\" menu items, basically their best-sellers which include the beef tataki (one of my faves), koyoi salad (with a light ginger-y vinaigrette and silken tofu), and fried chicken with tartar sauce (greasy but oh-so-good). We also got the last bowl of tonkatsu ramen. At $13.99, it is a bit steep for ramen... but the milky, flavourful pork bone broth and fresh toppings were worth it IMO. I've had this dish in Fukuoka, which is famous for tonkatsu ramen. Koyoi's version came pretty close to what I ate there. I just don't know why they limit it to 25 bowls per week? Seems so arbitrary... We also tried the hot pot udon and I was less impressed with the consistency of the udon noodles -- a bit too firm for my liking. Other memorable dishes include the octopus in wasabi sauce (very small portion though) and yakinasu (grilled eggplant). The onigiri comes somewhat deconstructed... the nori is not wrapped around the rice, it comes in a flat sheet and you wrap it up yourself. I wanted to try the black sesame ice cream with rice balls, but ran out of room in my stomach. A reason to come back...

Space is simple and clean, while the service is polite (although they forgot my friend's 2nd beer and my cup of green tea went empty). I recommend this place to anyone looking for casual Japanese pub fare or anyone who likes Japanese food but wants to try something a little bit different from the usual sushi places."}
{"text":"If you want a place downtown with some quality izakaya food minus the rowdy atmosphere, this would be the place for you. They have an extensive menu of various small dishes to share and also decently priced drinks menu. 

We didn't quite know what to order so we picked off the recommended dishes and asked the waitress for some suggestions too. The drink I got was Cassis with Oolong Tea. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the black current liquor combines with the tea. We ordered 2 people portion of motsunabe, which is a pork based hotpot with fried tofu, bits of pork offal, and lots of veggies like chives, cabbage, and burdock root. I really liked the soup base and it's a great dish on a cold day. 

The beef tataki with ponzu sauce was very refreshing, and the beef cubes were elevated significantly with a dip in the accompanied sauce. Their deep fried chicken with tartar sauce is what all comfort food should be like, lightly battered and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The salad paired with it adds a welcoming contrast. All the flavors takes me back to when I lived in japan, triggered some serious nostalgia.

All the dishes look simple but it feels like a lot of heart was put into it. The staff is very friendly and I had a wonderful time here and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Oh hell yeah this place is an awesome hidden gem.  We ordered tataki, which is pretty much raw beef, totally on point.  The best part was the soup, which is like a Japanese sukiyaki soup, which was amazingly flavourful and earthy.  After eating the soup, you add rice to it which turns the entire pot into a bit of a porridge and honestly that is the best part... or so we thought until we saw people getting the black sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"Koyoi is one of my favorite places in the city for authentic Japanese fare. Super low key vibe coupled with good food. I honestly don't know anywhere else in Toronto you can get motsunabe (which I haven't tried yet, but was excited to see on offer as a winter special). 

It's easy to forget about this place amidst the explosion of izakaya joints and ramen houses around town, but this place is a real gem. The last time I was there was a week ago. We sat at the bar, had some highballs and shochu and snacked on oden, pickles and some noodles. Nothing fancy, but exactly what we wanted and needed."}
{"text":"Small and cozy atmosphere,  I felt like I was in Japan.  We were a group of three and we ordered okonomiyaki, fried noodles with pork, shashimi with cream cheese,  fried chicken with tartar sauce and the green tea cheese cake. The portions were small for the price we paid and when we were done eating, I didn't feel that full. My favorite dishes with the okonomiyaki and the fried noodles. The shashimi and cream cheese is a bad combination. It was just a thin layer of fish wrapped around a big serving of cream cheese and it was too salty. I wanted to exchange the shashimi for something else but they didn't let me. Fried chicken was okay and the slice of cheese cake was too small for it to be $5.50. The servers where really nice and kept coming around to our glasses. Just don't get the shashimi and cream cheese!!"}
{"text":"Koyoi (meaning 'tonight') is one of the earlier izakaya in Toronto by now and staffed with Japanese waitresses and has many Japanese customers, but the owner (whose wife is Japanese) is Korean. The food is quite good and coupled with everything else that makes up a pleasant dining experience and atmosphere is a 3.5/5.

The izakaya's second location opened, changed names, reverted back and has shut down now so the owner has not perfected a formula, but the food is generally good (though not as tasty as in Japan) and there are a couple of rare menu items that no one else offers like motsunabe, which we ordered. This hot pot dish is made with the innards of cow or pig and adds chive, sesame, tofu, cabbage and garlic. Theirs was good, but missing flavour compared to Japan a little and definitely missing 'motsu' or offal. We were disappointed by how little meat there was in the nabemono.

The gyutan or beef tongue on a hot stone is a favourite and quite good, the blowtorched saba battera is tasty and who can say no to Japanese karaage?
They have a variety of sake and shochu. 
The service is fine and responsive. The food items arrive fairly quickly. Water refills is regular.

They are always busy, which means that most people do not care about the lack of atmosphere or decoration, which is what I wanted to get into next. The L shaped izakaya is quite small, tables are next to one another and there is minimal decoration past product posters, bottles and of course signs advertising food. The washroom had its 'best before' date in 2014 probably and could use a major overhaul.
At least they had not turned on the TV.

Koyoi would be an A if it had a nicer interior and refocused on more authentic Japanese flavours for certain items, but as mentioned earlier is still a winner."}
{"text":"Excellent place, hidden gem.  Certainly a place I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out Japanese food but not necessarily default to sushi and sashimi (sushi/sashimi is always bomb, but sometimes one must broaden their horizons).  I would say that this is a place where you want to have a few friends with you, as their focus is on Japanese tapas, and with multiple friends you have a bit of spending power.

Atmosphere/Service: the restaurant is very tiny, but it's very cosy.  Given the small space, waitresses are visible and they themselves are attentive.   Waitresses are courteous and came by a few times to ensure that we were ok, consistently providing water and there to take our order.  

Food: So my friends and I essentially ordered a majority of Koyoi's top 5 dishes.  The Koyoi salad, just fyi, is something that you order for yourself, for several reasons...the portion size, the unique blend of dressing, and ingredients in there.  You could basically say that in itself can serve as your \"main dish\" while you share everything.  All in all, Koyoi's salad is excellent, hearty and very unique from other restaurants.  Definitely recommend for anyone coming to Koyoi.

The weakest dish was probably the chicken karaage.  For one the batter just seems really bland and basic.  Not my favourite

We ordered the beef tongue which was excellent, initially I thought it was really salty, but I probably just got one that was salty, as the other pieces tasted delicious.  It was served on a sizzling hot plate and the texture was not overcooked as I normally fear with a lot of hot plate stuff.  Would order again

Scallop carpaccio was delicious, they were pretty fresh and the combination of the salad with the dressing match beautifully.

Beef Tataki: very strong flavour, it's very vibrant and counteracts with the rawness of the beef, I liked it but overall, the flavour kind of one-dimensional (still good, but not as many notes as I hoped).

Onigiri, I got the benito one, they serve it with a side of pickles and it's soooo good with it together.  Super yummy, I dunno...it know onigiri is basically a ball of rice wrapped in nori, but I like rice....so yeah.

Overall, very enjoyable meal, and I'd love to try out other items on the menu.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I live closeby for two years and I never even notice this place. I heard this from my colleague and I just decided to give it a try. It turns out that we have a WOW moment everytime we tried a new dish!!! From appetizers to dessert, all of them are amazing!!! Their quality/freshness/amount are all outstanding!!! Compared with noisy Guu and pricy kinyo, this place has a cozy environment like the scene in japanese shows. Even with alcohol, one can easily be filled up with $30.

Some suggestions for the owner:
1. Make some renovations to the outside sign, ex. Make the name more obvious and put more lights on
2. Add more varieties to your menu like soba noodle,  ramen, quality sashimi, tempura and chirashi rice bowl...so instead of bearing with other places, I can just stick to you!"}
{"text":"This place is the cool izakaya that, if it were located in Tokyo, would never let in the likes of me. Fortunately, it's in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and the food has never disappointed. If you're tired of the constantly screaming over your lungs atmosphere at typical izakayas such as guu, this quiet unassuming restaurant that attracts many local Japanese patrons may be your spot. 

As for the food, I still maintain they make the best matcha cheesecake in the city. The texture is it's so perfectly smooth, slightly firm and oh so Velvety, it's a perfect bite of food. Other great options are the koyoi salad with very enjoyable sweet potato crisps, beef tataki, raw scallop ceviche, karaage or when they have it fried chicken cartilage which is my favorite. They also make very good Oden dish. 

Overall a great date spot restaurant at a reasonable price. Highly recommended restaurant near the Wellesley area."}
{"text":"The beef tataki and fried chicken are simply Devine.  The prices and service are also excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy restaurant. Really like their kaarage! I think it's the best out of all the izakaya. Beef takaki is very good too! Friendly service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Randomly found koyoi and it was absolutely worth it. The price is right and the food is amazing. Okonomiyaki is amazing. We also got the curry fries and the fried chicken. An absolute 5/5. Service with a smile. Just go now."}
{"text":"The food was alright.. there were some winners and some dishes that didn't appeal to me at all. The koyoi salad was great- it was a perfect level of umami and the chips were a cool addition to the salad. The gyu-tan (beef tongue) was tasty and well seasoned. The udon was decent, just a standard udon, nothing to complain or rave about. The beef tataki and scallop carpaccio were both staff picks I think but I found the radish and onion in the beef tataki off-putting and the scallops didn't taste that fresh... it's just a matter of personal preference but I found out that I don't care for the slimy taste of scallop sashimi. We got the green tea cheesecake for dessert and it was great, with fragrant matcha and a scoop of ice cream on the side.

Also a note that the space is pretty small but there is some room on the patio for additional seating. I also like how this restaurant is tucked away on a quiet side street, away from the hustle and bustle of yonge st."}
{"text":"If you live around the Bay/Charles area; looking for a great place to grab a pitcher of Sopporo without paying as much as you would at Happa; and craving izakaya dishes that are simple but effective compliments to a cold beer without having to line up for hours, Koyoi will do. Quite simply, this place doesn't try to do too much (beef tongue on hot plate/ togarashi spicy fries, yakiudon on hot plate, lemon-salt karage, etc.) but will continue to lure in regulars because it does everything just fine. Would you come here for seared toro belly with a side of unni on rice? Probably not and neither should you expect a fish grilled to perfection with a bowl of rice and miso (what I live for). But I would come here time and time again for a casual drink with above-average izakaya and friendly staff that don't yell hello to you each time you walk in (kidding, I love guu)."}
{"text":"There is some authentic shiz going on here! 

I've walked by many times, and even tried walk-in - learned my lesson and made reservations instead. The staff is friendly, but their English is not the best. No problem, just point to the items in the menu! 

I came here with my bf, and two friends. Here's what we got:

Sapporo pitcher - only $15, and filled 4 tall glasses. Definitely a steal. 
Hhotpot - 2 orders for $30. This came in big bowl bubbling over with broth, veggies, intestines (nom) and we added udon too.
Beef tataki - beautifully presented, and perfectly fine. Served with ponzu sauce
Scallop carpaccio -  was delicately sweet, very good!
Beef tongue...it was just ok. Kinda rough.
Raw octopus in wasabi sauce -  per bf's request - this was AMAZING! Perfect texture, not chewy but had a bounce to the bite! We ordered nori (seaweed) to go with it too.
Deep fried chicken - very crispy, very tender inside. Fried chicken is fried chicken, but this was GOOD fried chicken.
Grilled black cod - so so so delicious! I recommend. The fish is firm and sweet.
Green tea cheesecake - heavy on the matcha flavour, nice treat for  the end. They charged us for the ice cream, though
Apple and custard tortilla - 10 minute wait for this, plus they burned the first one they made. It was....ok. Just ok. It's literally apple slices baked on top of a tortilla with sweet custard. The flavours don't meld together.

Overall, great experience. I think I prefer this over Guu - the food is similar, but ambience is great and sitting is more comfortable. Will be back for more Sapporo pitchers in the summer, when their patio opens up!"}
{"text":"A huge disappointment! The only dish that we found to be ok was koyoi salad, but the rest were all very boring and salty. We had beef tongue, fried chicken, and yakisoba. Will not return here. Went for froyo and cookies at red bench to cleanse our taste buds afterwards."}
{"text":"Fuss-free isakaya in downtown Toronto, steps away from noisy Yonge and Bloor intersection. This hole in wall Japanese establishment is a more authentic and intimate version of the famous isakayas, who are usually known for being cheerful and, unfortunately, a bit too noisy and showy just for catching up with friends. 

I headed there on a Friday night, and it was calm, as expected. I didn't have to wait long, because my host reserved a table. Albeit we were a little late, the waitstaff was understanding (I'm from out of town!) and still agreed to take us in. We were quickly seated on the patio, which was an enjoyable setting to chat over drinks since it's by a quiet side street.

Pitchers were affordable, so we order 2 of the Sapporo on special for the 3 of us. Pitchers were $18 that night! The tapas we ordered came by pretty quickly (karaage, curry rice, okoniyaki). Food was tasty and cooked to perfection, with the right amount of crispiness and juicyness, but portions were unsatisfying. That's why we also ordered a greens salad and a noodle plate to complete our meal. To be noted: food is really salty, so make sure you also get some water glasses on top of the beer! We didn't order any dessert since we were full. Bill came at around $30 per person (for the 3 of us), tips and taxes included.

The menu might not be the most creative one, and the beer might not be the cheapest, but I would definitely come back for the low-key ambiance that's just perfect to catch up with friends in a calm but enjoyable setting."}
{"text":"I was surprised that Koyoi was quite busy when I popped in just a little before 6 pm. On this awful rainy day, why all these people doing here??

Happy Hour... Deal... Value... Tue to Thu between 5 pm to 6 pm if you order a drink, you get Udon, Koyoi Salad, Karaage, Beef Tataki and Beef Tongue for $5.

Wednesday Night is also their Tontoku Ramen Night as I saw a few people ordered that. 

My Ramen took more than 20 minutes to arrive and I ate that in 5 minute....... as it was quite small in portion.

The Ramen has a great sweet and rich broth, I guess that's the star. The noodles is the wavy type and cooked al dente. Yes this plain Tontoku Ramen is just Ramen with some preserved vegetables as garnish with a jar of pickled ginger on the side and half an egg cost $13.99!!! (This is NOT a typo!)

I think I will stick with Happy Hour Specials next time.. I will be a lot happier!!"}
{"text":"Nice Japanese restaurant. I like the neighbourhood and the taste of food here. They have really good beef tongue( raw and grill) and raw scallop/squid. Come and challenge ur mouth! Don't forget about the signature salad, won't let u down."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting spot. Our food was really good and the service was pretty good. I would say the menu selection was vast but not entirely my cup of tea. A little too authentic for my liking. But they seem to do what they do well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Koyoi since I did my undergrad at UofT and my friends and I have kept coming back because the quality of food is great and the prices are reasonable. Now that we have graduated, we still come here when we meet up. 

We've never really had to wait for a table but the place is never empty (I'm surprised it's not busier - definitely a hidden gem). Service is always super friendly. We always grab a pitcher of Sapporo and a Koyoi Salad for everyone. The Koyoi Salad is delicious and refreshing and I would highly recommend everyone to try one. 

For this particular visit we ordered a bunch of entrees for us to share (as pictured, but 2 orders of the Koyoi Salad) and between the four of us the bill came around $20 including tips each. 

Since we started coming here prices are consistent and the quality of the food has remained the same. My friends and I will continue to visit Koyoi whenever we decide to hang out."}
{"text":"Good experience at this restaurant! Set in a small venue just off of Yonge street, the interior is quaint and also quite busy. There's not a lot of seating and the venue was full by 6:30PM the night that we dined there. You may want to consider making reservations especially if you're looking to dine here around peak times.

We ordered the Tsukemono (pickled vegetables), the marinated mackerel and the stir fry pork noodles. The pickled vegetables were tasty with an acidity, crunch, and colour that was fresh and vibrant. There were 5 different types of vegetables in the dish and they all had their own unique flavor. The marinated mackerel was also well-balanced. The dish was reminiscent of \"torched\" sushi with a slightly charred top and came with wasabi and soy sauce. It was also served with pickled onions which helped to balance the inherent fishiness of mackerel. The pork and noodle stir fry was likely the highlight of the items that we ordered. This dish was also well done with chewy noodles and thick slices of pork and cabbaged mixed through the dish.

We also shared a bottle of Soju which ended up coming to about $20. The wait staff were friendly and helpful. May be back to try some of the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Price like Guu, taste like Guu without the line up. Food was solid and the service was great. We were there for 2 hours and it was quite relaxing sitting in the patio.  Maybe it was because everyone was avoiding Toronto during the Pan Am games."}
{"text":"They advertise that they're open until 2:30, I called at 2:05 with a to go order and they made some sorry excuse that the kitchen closes at 1:30 and restaurant at 2:30. Makes no sense."}
{"text":"Very quint place tucked away from the busy yonge street.  The food was decent not spectacular but very decent. I got the rice in tea. It was satisfying. Would visit again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is average. Ordered karaage and I didn't like it, not very crispy, meat didn't taste fresh. Ochazuke was okay, except for there was too little salmon on the top, wish they could give more."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago, on a Friday.

ATMOSPHERE:  Enjoyed the much more casual environment! Sometimes the other (more typical) izakayas can be too similar and the crowd can be stuffy. This place has a more relaxed vibe, and their crowd is more varied, which is a nice touch.

SERVICE: Service was good. Very attentive. They were a bit over staffed the night we were there - but that meant it was easy to flag someone for assistance. So no complaints there.

PRICE: Comparable to other izakayas - so it's good for sharing but like the others, if you're looking to fill up on these small dishes than be prepared to shell out more dough.

FOOD: My friend and I split 7 dishes in total. It was dinner after a movie, so we were both pretty hungry. We had: 

- Beef tongue on hot plate: This first dish was also our favourite dish! Came out piping hot on the hot plate. Texture was excellent and flavourful. Sliced not too thinly, which was nice. Highly recommended.

- Beef tataki: Okay, but I've had better.

- Koyoi Salad: Surprisingly good. Okay, so my friend had recommended it, but I still doubted her until I took a bite. It had a great balance to it. Also nice to have this veggie dish whilst eating mostly meat.

- Monk Fish Liver: Surprised by this dish! It's not overly-fishy as I had anticipated and the garnishes and sauce works well.

- Scallop Carpaccio: I LOVE scallops, but these ones weren't very flavourful and fresh.

- Chicken Karaage with salt and lemon: Okay, but I've had better.

We ended off sharing one dessert to end the meal: the Black Sesame Ice Cream with sticky rice balls. It was okay. Just enough sweet to help finish off, but I've had better black sesame ice cream. (I'm a fan of black sesame, which also makes me a very picky eater when it comes to this ingredient.)

Overall a fun place to grab small bits and hangout with friends. I definitely would return. Am interested in checking out their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Guu without the long line up (still there was a decent wait but reasonable) pretension, and price.  I liked the Sake selection they had and food was very good and unique.  Even a Japanese friend who I went there with said some food is unique liked grated yam (tastes better than it sounds).  My favorite was beef tartar, well sauced and fresh.  I was disappointed with scallop tartar - the seasoning didn't really bake in.  Tako wasabi was good but a bit fishy after taste, shio style yakisoba was great with some fresh squeezed lime juice.  I also liked their fries - bit salty but very crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"To be simple and straight to the point, its a Japanese pub. A real gem. I had never been here but a friend recommended the place and I figured 'Why not?'

I let my friend order dishes for us to share. We shared the Koyoi salad which was delicious. Very unique, flavorful and tangy salad dressing but also light and was a great addition to our other dishes. We also had a plate of spicy fries, which are the bomb!!!! We had a salt and lemon deep fried chicken dish but I think all the deep fried chicken dishes would be amazing. We also had a salmon rice ball which was good, hard to mess that up. The food is good for the price, portion and typical Japanese pub/comfort food. We both had pints Sapporo, which was delicious, crisp and refreshing. Also the service was great. They were prompt with our food arriving and we diligent in filling out water glasses. We finished the meal with a green tea rare cheesecake which was perfect. Not to sweet but plenty satisfying. I'm excited to come back and enjoy their other offerings. Also their udon looked amazing and I would love to savor that in the winter!!!!"}
{"text":"When people think Japanese tapas, they think immediately of Guu.  Little is known about Koyoi as it is tucked away on a side street off of Yonge, just north of Wellesley.  The food is not bad, service is great, and the atmosphere is cozy (small space).  Portions are a bit on the smallish side."}
