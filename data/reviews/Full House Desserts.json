{"text":"The environment reminds me of Hong kong.  I have been here mostly at night night pigging out on the durian pancake.  It seems a lot of people come here for this dessert! No doubt it is good, there is also mango pancake. They also serve traditional desserts and healthy tea.  There is only one person working behind the counter and serving customers."}
{"text":"BLAST YOU PEOPLE WHO CAME BEFORE ME AND TOOK ALL THE DURIAN PANCAKES! :'( I stopped by at Full House at round 10pm after having dinner with the family and I was really looking forward to trying the Durian Pancake since everyones been raving about it. What I didn't expect was that, it would be sold out by the time I got there.... WAH!  I was very saddened by this but regardless, I wanted my durain! I ended up trying the Sago Durian which turned out to be quite refreshing, Other dessert places fill their sago with sugar but Full house uses the durian fruit as the sweetner. It really balanced all the flavours rogether which I really liked and you also dont get that really sweet sugary aftertaste lodged in your throat.  I will be back! ..... for the durian pancake.... and other stuff too."}
{"text":"While the exotic durian desserts are really good.    You really have to wonder if it's worth to go through such bad service just to be given the chance to taste these elusive pancakes or tapioca pearls with durian.  Another thing about this place is that you never know when they are open, the hours appear to be completely random, most of the time you show up, and they're closed.  If I didn't know better, I'd suspect the business is just a front for money laundering by cartels or perhaps a hobby by some rich kid who wants a place to eat durian."}
{"text":"The boss lady told us to order in advance, so we don't have to wait."}
{"text":"I loved this place before, but not so much anymore.   I came here recently on a Friday at 6:50 pm and waited until 7:40 for the owner to show up . (Note: opening hours are 7pm) .   The owner is definitely taking advantage that the business is doing well , therefore she can show up  late knowing customers are willing to wait. The owner did not apologize for being late whatsoever, even though there was a few customers waiting outside her shop. Throughout the whole ordering process, she did not smile. Not sure if the owner looks rude all the time or if it was just that day.   Anyways, onto the food...  I generally order the durian and mango pancakes to go. I noticed they are MUCH smaller now, compared to the size before. Also, the quantity of durian in the pancake has decreased significantly. Feels like I am buying a pancake filled with whipped cream, and maybe a spoonful of durian in the centre."}
{"text":"Wacked business hours   7PM -12AM   But it really doesn't matter to them because the people who know, 'know this place is the shiz!!'   They don't even bother to setup the tables and chairs for dining in here because they are too busy handling the orders and preparing the stuff.  It was take out only when I went Thursday evening.  I asked for a Durian pancake and tonight she said, it would be a 45mins wait time, O-M-G!  I'm not waiting that long for a fricken pancake.   So I went for my alternative the HOT  black sesame almond soup with dumplings ( dumplings filled with black sesame) The natural flavours come through, no over sugary taste tainting it. Taste is nothing like frozen or packaged. So if you want to taste how it should be done, come here.  This is by far the best tasting Chinese dessert place I've ever been to.   P.S. I'm only minus(ed) 1 star because of the Soup Nazi experience. However the goods they deliver are 5/5."}
{"text":"This place is definitely very legit. I wonder if it's part of a Hong Kong dessert franchise because it is almost identical in decor and menu offerings as a Hong Kong dessert shop I patronized some years ago. I came here specifically for the durian pancakes after seeing so many rave reviews and intriguing photos on yelp. The location of the shop is pretty difficult to spot at night: looks like it is in some warehouse-turned-indoor-strip-mall. But once you walk into the sketch mall you definitely won't miss it. It's probably the only spot still open (at 11p.m.) and bustling with customers.   The durian pancake was, indeed, very light and delicious, filled with whip cream and straight-up durian. Price was a little steep ($8 for 2) for what it is, but I guess you're paying for the novelty too. I wanted to try other desserts because it looked equally delicious, but was too full. Perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"This family run business has quite the interesting business model. It has no seating in the actual store, so it's primarily take out only (unless you feel like standing in the store). They offer quite a variety of traditional Chinese desserts to more modern fare. They only open at night running to midnight so it's great if you have a late night sweet craving but want to skip the waits in a restaurant."}
{"text":"This take-out Chinese dessert place has funky hours - 7PM to Midnight?!   There used to be tables for dining-in, but now it's purely take-out. Their most popular items are variations of durian or mango desserts. Apparently their durian desserts are amazing. I wouldn't know because the smell of the odorous fruit makes me sick, but my boyfriend loves it. He ordered the durian sago, and sheesh.. his breath was just reeking of durian, even gum/mint didn't help.   I ordered the almond/walnut paste with glutinous sesame ball. It was piping hot, I burnt my tongue on the first sip. The sesame ball was still nice and chewy - be careful when biting into it, burn alert!   Prices are reasonable, and parking easy to find outside because no other store at this mall is open at the same hours."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get Chinese desserts after dinner. Their durian pancake is my absolute favourite. They're mango sago I think it's called is so good. It's a family run business with good service.   Only con is they only accept cash. And their dessert is a fair bit pricy for a small portion."}
{"text":"+4 stars - Brought some durian pancake home and the family was satisfied. Might want to buy 2 boxes if u have a big appetite. -1 star for the wait"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice and it was good both time.  The environment reminds me of Hong Kong. It was packed each time I came.  Love the Mango dessert and the Full house Sago.  Too bad I am not a fan of Durian as I heard amazing thinks about the Durian Pancake.  Will def be back a 3rd time shortly.  ."}
{"text":"Pricey compare to its quantity   I tried the mango and durian pancake, I prefer the durian better, mango one was kinda greasy I also tried the mango sago and mango pomelo sago The mango in pomlo sago was not fully ripe so taste sour and hard. Total up like 30 somethjng"}
{"text":"Spent $40 bought the durian pancake, durian sago, black sesame pudding, and one more I forgot. The location is very off to a little strip mall I have never been to. Most of the shops were closed but the restaurants inside were open. There is no seating so to go is the only option. Desserts were good but not life changing for the price."}
{"text":"To get typical Hong Kong style desserts, this place is as good as it gets in GTA.   The place doesn't open until late afternoon/early evening, \"busy time\" is 9pm and later. Not much ambiance, but cozy and comfortable.   The English menu is quite challenging to negotiate with because of the translation, so go with someone who knows what to order to take a few minutes to \"study\" the menu.   + There is the soupy paste-y category -- basically there are walnut, almond, sesame varieties; you can combo them up by mixing any of the two or all three, adding glutinous rice flour balls with sesame filing to the paste/soup is another option. Just note this is described as \"sweet ball\" in the English menu.  + There is the whole mango series, from pudding to jello to pancake, everything made fresh (you see boxes upon boxes of mangoes stacked up in the store). Oh, you can also get pancake with durian fillings, the \"king of the fruit\" you either love or hate.  + There is also double-boiled milk and egg white mixture type of desserts, probably uniquely Hong Kong. I don't remember the exact names of the various dishes, some have more milk vs. others have more egg whites, but all are good.   Some of the dishes can be consumed hot or cold, if unsure, asked the owner/chef-looking guy who is always willing to help and give you a recommendation."}
{"text":"This dessert place is one of the best, so far in Toronto.  If you're a DURIAN LOVER, this is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the products from their menu were delicious. It has been 3 years since I came here last time, I love this place but I do not live in this area. This time I ordered 4 items:  Black Sesame soup - a traditional dessert which people said it is good for your health. I do recommend eat it while it is warm. Very smooth and strong sesame taste.  Full house sago - the fantastic?My favorite dessert made with fresh diced mango, pomelo and evaporated milk sand sago. Not too sweet.    Durian pancake - a must - try item from Full House desserts. Real durian with whip cream inside of the omelette. The omelette was thin and smooth. You have to hold it carefully on hand, otherwise, you will destroy a piece of artwork.  Durian black glutinous rice - it surprised me the most. I did not expect the actual durain ball inside. Sweetness just right. The black glutinous rice add texture into it and make me want to keep eating it."}
{"text":"I have had durian pancakes before (in the motherland of Hong Kong to say the least) and so it speaks volumes when I say that these Durian Pancakes were actually better than any other durian pancake I've ever tried and better than the ones I've tried in Hong Kong.  What?!  How can that be?!  I was so shocked and surprised myself too!  These yellow durian pillows (tasted and felt like it) were so fluffy and soft.  The skin of the pancake was incredibly thin and soft.  It was amazing how well-made these were.  Inside of the pancakes, there was some whipped cream and some substantial chunks of real durian fruit.  Wow, it was amazing.  It smelled so good and didn't even taste like frozen durian too."}
{"text":"When i was in highschool like many years ago, my friends brought me here.  This place was sooo cool back in the day.  They had a full out dining area and tables out in the mall.  It was always busy. Food was so good. And it was a fun hang out joint.   I recently decided to return and share my childhood memories with family.  That was such a mistake.  I was soooooo embarrassed. Prices were so much more expensive but that didn't phase me as much compared to everything else. There were no tables anymore. Dining area seemed like it was filled with random perfume products and bottles that looked like it came from a multi level marketing company.  Service was so garbage.  There was no one at the counter to take our order until i yelled out.  The food was still yummy though but you can probably get it else where nowadays for half that price."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from New York for this durian pancake.  Well, we were eating lots in Toronto and Markham too.   I agree with another review that mentioned they get a lot of business from friends/relatives.  I was quite happy by set services in Canada until I came here.  Good thing I checked their business hours so came here around 9.  There were quite a few people outside the mall door.  As so as we entered, the wonderful smell of durian was permeating.   I understand why they have to open from 7 onwards.  I am sure the neighboring stores will not be happy with the smell during business hours.  The lady upfront was really rude - refused to speak in English and I know she knows English because I ordered in English but then she would say a really long sentence to me in Cantonese.  Someone else had to translate for me.  Wait 20 min for a durian pancake that cost CAD 9.05.  And they closed the seating area so we had to eat standing up.  And when I ate it, total disappointment.  Call me a durian snob but they don't use the high quality durian like the one I had in Spore or Indonesia.  The skin is very soft and thin I give them that but the durian was a total let down.  Oh well, an interesting experience regardless."}
{"text":"Most authentic Chinese dessert I've had! Everything we ordered was delicious and wish we had ordered more!"}
{"text":"We ordered the mango and durian sago both were amazing. Definitely the best and worth the $$."}
{"text":"My boss recommended Full House Desserts after I caught him in the staff kitchen, at 8 am, making durian flavoured coffee. I mean, if this man has found a way to inject himself with durian first thing in the morning, you know that I know that he knows his durian.   What we ordered: Durian sago: Cold and creamy durian soup with sago, pomelo pulp, and a large chunk of durian. The richness of the durian is nicely cut by the citrusy note of pomelo. Highly recommended for all durian lovers.  Durian pancake: It's not so much a durian flavoured pancake as much as it is a bright yellow, non-durian flavoured pancake wrapped around cream and durian. Perfect for sharing since it comes in two-and that cream and durian does not a light dessert make.   Full house sago: Mango soup with sago, pomelo pulp, and real mango pieces. This is super fresh and a definite pleaser for mango lovers.   All of the items above are priced, slightly high, at $7.50. You are really paying for the food though. Trust me, there are no other value-added amenities. No service. (Only a lady at the front counter with her very nice and definitely underaged son named Oscar fetching your order). No credit or debit cards accepted. No tables. No chairs. Date and I ate this at a bench in the plaza. You can take this durian goodness to your car, but then you might as well say goodbye to your social life for the weekend.   Bonus Fun Fact: Durian is known as the King of Fruit in South Asian circles. I would like to officially crown Full House Desserts as the King of the King of Fruit desserts. Also, durian flavoured coffee is really good."}
{"text":"the food here is good but not far from the dessert places around the area that actually have dine-in and service, i come here cause i like their durian desserts (ex.  the durian pancake $8.50)  However i feel that their desserts are way overpriced (mango, pamelo sago $6.50), especially for the service that you get. the many times i went, we are not allowed to dine-in. no table or chairs are out and when we asked, she just says NO. that lady there is rude!   also their hours are really strange, i sometimes want to have desserts after lunch or in the middle of the day.. but they are only open from 7pm-midnight. that's ok, its their lost.  so for take-out this place is good (cause apparently that's all they offer), but not quick either. wait time is from 10-20 mins.  If there is any other place in richmond hill that offers delicious durian pancakes, i will never come back here again."}
{"text":"DURIAN PANCAKES rock!  Durian is a fruit, Pancake is a dessert therefore a FRUITY DESSERT.  This is the only place I know that has a Durian dessert in the GTA.  WHY do I come for Durian dessert?  Do you really want to bring Durian home and STINK up the joint?  The Pancake is a thin cold wrap that holds WHIP CREAM inside.  In the middle of the cream is Durian meat and all it takes is that small amount as it is so CREAMY its like Ripen Banana but less SLIMEY.  This place opens in the EVENING and thats the perfect time because after having Durian Pancake, you probably want to avoid any place public because the SMELL of it will be KO lights out for others.  Some people are known to be addicted to Durian and there are many varieties and people get picky over the kinds they will eat even at more cost.  This place is actually an Open Patio-like setting that opens up to the inside of the Mall so every passer-by can be TEASED by your odour.  The secret is that the person eating it won't smell it, so make sure you're the one of the group having it or else SUFFER like the others."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is straight from Hong Kong and makes amazing Asian desserts. There is actually a place that sells desserts in Hong Kong by the same name (same Chinese name that is).   My parents took me here and I fell in love! I'm a huge fan of the black sesame dessert. Honestly, I'm not sure of the exact name in English but it's the soupy dessert that is made from ground up black sesame seeds.   Everything is made on the premise fresh and it's guaranteed to be piping hot when you get it, unless you ordered a cold dessert. If you see in their fridge those round yellow ball looking things, those are called Durian pancake. It's filled with fresh mashed up durian (that spiky fruit you see in Asian grocery stores) and fresh cream wrapped in a soft pastry.   It is located inside a plaza and it is quite a small place. Has approximately 4 tables that each hold about 4 people but they will bring out the fold out tables and chairs and set them up outside in the plaza hallway.  Honestly, you'll be very confused when looking at that very large menu, so go with a friend that knows their Asian desserts and be open to try anything because there are some weird things on the menu that you may have never heard of before."}
{"text":"Well worth the trip. We had the durian pancake and mango special. It was fresh tasting, just sweet enough and they had great service. Super delicious and we cannot wait to go back. Bonus for opening later hours!"}
{"text":"Sad to see what was once a great desert place turn into a desert place that is still okay, but definitely not great.  :(  Deserts that were once rich and full bodied are now watery and really flat.  Mm... I hope it gets better but since half the shop has turned into an incense oil shop, maybe that is where the owner's hearts are now."}
{"text":"I'm assuming that this place is affiliated with the chain in Hong Kong. They share the same name, décor, and menu; and are famous for their mango/ durian pancake.   However, compared to the ones in HK, the pancakes were half the size (smaller than my palm) at double the price ($10.15). And while the skin is very delicate & soft, the filling consists mainly of whipped cream. The spoonful of durian wasn't particularly fresh either.   I doubt I'll be back since it's a rip-off."}
{"text":"Wow, the smell of Durian filled the entire plaza as we entered. You'd either hate it or love it.   It was really a full house when I arrived there at 9:00pm on a Friday night. Glad it was opened too. There was only 1 person managing everything behind the counter, but she was pretty fast at seating, delivering the food, giving the bill, and managing the take-out.  Tried the Full House Sago and the Mango pancake (they were all out of Durian pancakes by the time I went).   The Mango pancake really grows onto you. Covered in a bright yellow wrap, encasing the whip cream + mango goodness. It was heaven.  Definitely going to be back to try the other desserts!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place--a vendor that only opens late into the night when most of the businesses are already closed in this mall. There's no sit-down room either, so you either take it to go or just eat your dessert on one of the benches in the mall. While the menu from a first look might be pretty long, it's actually straightforward for the most part. Hot desserts are mostly combinations of sesame, walnut or almond paste, glutinous rice, and silken tofu, among others. Cold desserts have some of these, but focus more on the sago and mango. And of course you have the durian items, which are pretty standalone.   I found the service to be pretty good, despite what some are saying (but maybe because I spoke Canto). The kids that run the counter along with the lady are very amicable. We tried their signature full house sago (????), which was a winner--lots of mango and pomelo pieces, not too sweet but still a nice texture. For a hot dessert, we got a combination of sesame, walnut, and glutinous rice balls. There was a bit of a wait for that since they actually heat up those rice balls upon ordering. Overall this was less sweet but no less delicious. The sesame and walnut paste were very flavorful, and the rice balls actually had sesame filling inside as well. This is definitely a great place for some traditional HK desserts."}
{"text":"Love coming here for sweets in the late hours of the night. Everything here is take out! There is a lovely mom and family who help us and they are so sweet. It's great to see her and her kids working so hard. The desserts here are great!    I love the durian pancake, the cream is fresh and the durian is so good. The crepe is so light as well. If your not a big durian fan, go for mango! It's a great alternative. The mango sago desserts is good too. Not to great if you leave overnight in the fridge though, it tastes a little sour the next day so i recommend eating it within 1-2 hours    Only complaint would be the hours. The hours are late at night and only open for a few hours which makes it hard if your having cravings during the day. Also it's very pricey. It's about $9 for the pancakes which is pretty steep"}
{"text":"Opens late from 7pm to 12am. Only take out available. No more dine ins. The place is run by 2 adults and 3 little kids. One of the children was writing down the orders. I guess she is going to be running the place in the future.   Ordered a variety of different flavours like walnut/black sesame and mango sago. They varied in price from $5 to $6.50 from the ones we ordered. All the flavours tasted great. Portions are small and even the black sesame balls were really small. I would love to give higher rating as everything tasted great but because of small portions and price I can only justify a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"I went in today just because it was close to 10 pm and I was almost positive that if they weren't open now, they'd never be open.  So I decided to give it a shot.    Their desserts - same high quality and same great taste.  The boss - same attitude.  I really really wish I could give this place a higher rating - I really truly wished I could.  But that customer service was just not on par.  She presented to me with this stand-offish attitude, which got me started up being all stand-offish.  And finally, because of *my* attitude, she got a little bit nicer.    Seriously?  I really don't enjoy being rude to someone to get customer satisfaction.    I gave it another star because 1) it was finally open when I passed by and 2) the boss was nicer towards the end."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this restaurant a long time ago and I finally got the opportunity to try it out. I came here on a Friday night and luckily, there was no lineup at all.  I got the mango pancake which comes in a box of two for about $8. The filling was whipped cream and generous amount of mango chunks. The pancake itself was very thin and has a good consistency.   Overall, I enjoyed the mango pancake but it's incredibly out of my way to come back here again."}
{"text":"**THEY ARE CLOSED ON WEDNESDAY** This is very important especially when your trekking from one end of the city to another for some durian pancake.  You don't want to be disappointed!!  I've only tried the durian pancake and mixed fruit with grass jelly.  They are amazing.  However 2 down side:  1). The price is a bit steep for the portion 2). I'm not a fan of the young children working there until very late hours.  I really think they should be in child care as opposed to working at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Too many options around the area and 2 bad experiences with take out gives it a 3. Either the plastic that they use for takeout for hot \"sweet soups\" are bad and give off a plastic smell or something was wrong with those batches.  By the time I got home which is only 15 minutes away, the whole thing smelled and tasted like bad plastic. Never happened at any of the places I've been to but this place."}
{"text":"An excellent place for Hong Kong style dessert.  It is take out only.  The mango and durian desserts are top notch, and the sweet soup are great too.  It opens late into the night, so its perfect for anyone who wants midnight snack.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Nice little shop. First thing you will notice is that it is a take out only shop. There are no tables or chairs for you to enjoy the desserts on. Then you will notice the smell of durian. It's not strong, but you'll smell it. It was pretty much being run by a little girl who I'd have to guess was around 10 years old. She took orders and handled the cash while being supervised by who I assume is the mother. Putting aside all the child labor jokes, I think she will learn a lot through this experience at such a young she. She will likely grow up to be very successful. I ordered both the mango and durian pancakes. Each order comes with two pancakes. It's basically the fruit and whipped cream wrapped in a crepe. I was rather surprised that the durian pancake didn't smell as much as I was expecting it would. Not that I mind, because I don't think it smells bad. But for those who don't like the \"pungent\" smell. It's hidden as well as you possibly can. Both pancakes were delightfully delicious, though arguably pricey. I think 5 stars can be achieved if they added 2 or 3 small tables that sit 2 people each in the space they have. Also, a little drizzle of chocolate syrup on the pancakes could be magical. You saw it here first."}
{"text":"I think they have the best Full House Sago in Toronto! It is the classic mango dessert with pieces of grapefruit. This one is comparable to those in Hong Kong, as most other places here are really not up to par when it comes to this classic favourite. The mango base is smooth and the perfect balance of sweet and tart. The mango and grapefruit are of good quality. I am not a huge durian fan but I heard their durian desserts are also impressive. My only complaint is that the prices are very high for all their menu items. There is also no seating now so it is take-out only."}
{"text":"It is so hard for me to get desserts at Full House Desserts.   I dropped by too early that they are not open! I dropped by and they suppose to be open but they are not open!  Finally I drop by they are half open! It is a Saturday night at 9:30 pm. All the tables and chairs were stacked together. No one in the front cash. Half of the metal railing was pulled down. Oh they said they almost sold out of everything and they are closing soon! hmmm.. Just take out and with limited choices.  I am a huge FAN of durian. Yes I know it is smelly to some one i.e. my boyfriend.. but I just love the smell. I have to admit that my dog loves that smell too! When I start eating  my Sago with Durian and Mango ($6.50), my dog was really looking at me with hungry eyes and want to have a share of that! Yes it is delicious, and the durian meat inside is huge meatball sized. (BTW, durian being the King of Calories in fruits are all forgotten!)  The nice lady said I should always call before I drop by because they close/open whenever they like or when they sold out!.. That is so so encouraging!"}
{"text":"If you're coming here, you've got to try one of their durian desserts - especially their durian pancakes (also comes in mango flavour). it's a essentially a crepe textured thing with a dollop of cream and durian (mango) inside. Sounds simple, but simple can be a delicious thing!"}
{"text":"full house is so popular in China and I love all durian sweets~~~~???? is my favorite containing coconut milk fresh durian and ice"}
{"text":"Im not a big fan of durian but i love their durian pancakes. It possessed me!! The mango sago is just amazing and drop dead yummy! I strongly recommended the place!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from YELP. I walked in Friday night around 8pm - completely dead and this place looks like it's going out of business. Half the shop was rented out for cosmetics and the chairs were all piled up. Basically, I would have to stand/sit in car eating.   I ordered the mango pancake - very soft on the outside, but way too much cream filling, which makes me sick. Just think of it like a twinkie.   Also had the sesame ball with almond soup - huge disappointment. The lady just dumped it in the microwave!! The taste was okay.. not a WOW. I prefer my frozen sesame ball at home.   Bit pricey for something not soo great."}
{"text":"Desserts are 5/5 but since it's overpriced, I'll deduct a star.   Durian pancakes are a definite must visiting here (sucks if you can't stand the smell!) and the house mango sago was super yummy as well.  It's located in a strip-mall-esque sort of location, no seating so take out only and expect quite a line, and remember to bring cash!   Desserts come in a decent portion size (ok might be enough to share between 2 people if you don't have a big sweet tooth) and isn't overly sweet.  If you're in the area at night then definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Upfront, I'm going to say this place has a crazy business model, but they're certainly confident enough in their product to let customer service go out the window.  And I have to admit that their product is fantastic indeed.  Full House Desserts is located inside a small mall on Leslie St, with mostly small restaurants inside.  They open from 7 PM - 12 AM (closed Wednesdays), after most of the other restaurants have already closed.  The place itself is very small, with only room for 5 dark wooden tables inside (seating at most 2-4 people/table) but they spread out folding tables all out front in the mall corridor, and here's where larger groups cluster. They are understaffed for the amt of business they do, with usually only 2 or 3 people trying to keep up with all the orders (and running around to do it).  My friend and I visited three nights in a row last week (from out of town, not going to get this again for a while).  On the first, we arrived just before 9 PM to find the place lit but their roll up gates half-closed, tables/chairs stacked up inside, and a few groups of people milling around outside.  Seemed they decided to close up sometime to handle take-out orders only and told everyone to return at 9:15 PM.  But they didn't bother to put up a sign to that effect so we saw group after group of people show up trying to figure out what the story was.    Seated promptly 20 minutes later inside, we perused the double-sided menu, divided into traditional Chinese dessert soups (hot), mixed soups (think cocktails) (also hot), sesame-filled dumplings in every combination of the former (hot), a few herbal soups, cold versions of the traditional soups, cold sago soups, a mango section, and a durian section.  As extensive as this sounds, there are several basic soups and add-ons, like black glutinous rice, that really form the basis for nearly everything.  This night, I tried the sesame soup mixed with walnut soup, served in a traditional Chinese rice bowl as a tan-colored soup with several artful black sesame swirls that you mix before eating.  I loved this.  The nutty flavors of sesame and walnut are subtly infused in the soup, and these combined beautifully with just a whisper of sweet.  We spotted the bright mango pancakes being served at another table and decided it would be worth a second visit to eat the soups again along with the pancakes.  On day 2, with 2 friends in tow, we tried ordering the pancakes and were told that mango and durian pancakes had to be reserved a day in advance, and highly recommended paying to guarantee they'll be held for us the entire next day.  Now assured a third visit, we reserved 2 and pre-paid.  I had the sesame-filled dumplings with sesame and walnut soup this day and those two dumplings, made of glutinous rice, were one of the best I've eaten, deliciously chewy yet light.  Sampled a few other cold sagos and hot soups, everything excellent, especially the hot black glutinous rice.  On day 3, the four of us returned around 10:30 PM and tried the mango pancake.  An order came with two, brightly yellow (almost cartoonishly so) and fist-sized.  The thin pancake is wrapped around a light whipped cream filling dotted with cubed mango.  A very very light dessert that didn't precisely wow on first bite but it grew on us until we couldn't stop eating until it was gone.  I attempted to get the sesame filled dumplings again, in a different soup base, but was told b/c of the late hour, they were sold out.  I ordered black glutinous rice in hot walnut soup instead; that was very good also, but less so than my previous orders.  My friend attempted to order black glutinous rice in a hot soup after my order came, but was told they sold out of the hot version of the rice and would have to order it cold.  So in sum, come early if you want full pick of the menu, call-in take-out orders ahead of time, and reserve mango or durian pancakes (or possibly other items) in advance.  It really is worth it in the end."}
{"text":"This place seems to open during odd hours.  The desserts are delicious.  It's a bit overpriced but it tastes good.  Definitely try their mango crepe filled with cream, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"Really yummy asian desserts served here. I definitely recommend the Durian Pancake, it tastes delicious and it is very rich. I also like the hot black rice congee with mango.   The only downside is that it is a bit expensive for certain items but you can definitely enjoy it as a treat once in a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and come here regularly to get my dessert fix. I highly recommend anything with their mango sago dessert, especially the one with durian in it! I've also had their walnut and black sesame desserts, mixed or separate, and they're pretty good as well. Service is good and pretty quick so would definitely come here if you want something to fulfil your dessert cravings!"}
{"text":"The durian and mango pancake was good but nothing too spectacular . The portion was too small for the price. $10 for the durian pancake .  $8.50 for mango. Two bites and it's finished. Also the mango sago was alright . I would adjust the price to $4.50 for Durian and 3.50 for Mango would be reasonable.  But that's their business . Too pricey for me to come back ."}
