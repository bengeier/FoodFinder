{"text":"My review will sound stunningly similar to Kat's, as my only experience at this place was with her on the night that inspired her review.  I can pretty much 2nd every point she made (though I question the size of the centipede), especially about having to search out a bartender to get us drinks.  I found the first two floors to be forgettable but the roof top garden patio makes this place more than worth a visit. It's nice, quiet and secluded from the rest of the riff raff.  Also to be noted was the fact that my pint of Strongbow was not properly chilled and a bit flat. Either because it was the bottom of a keg (forgivable) or it just wasn't properly stored (unforgivable)."}
{"text":"Burger was small. Bun was cheap. Fries were soapy tasting, like the ones you buy frozen in a bag. This place use to have big burgers and fresh cut fries. Now it sells the same crap you can buy at Metro for 10 times the price."}
{"text":"We met up with a few friends to have some drinks over the holidays.  The atmosphere was great and the service was attentive without being overbearing.  It was also nice to be in a place that ended up being standing room only, but in a cozy, not cramped way on a Monday night."}
{"text":"I go out to pubs in the summer on the hunt for one thing:  to find Toronto's best patio.  Like many other explorers I have drifted upon many hidden gems, but nothing compares to the magic that is created ontop of Whalen's Gate.  Located steps from Dundas West Station, the pub's intimate roof top patio will transport you from downtown Toronto to a tree covered, cottage-esque patio where the time seemingly stops as you sip classic Irish beers with the great company you keep."}
{"text":"service was excellent. patio in the back is a hidden gem and really secluded which i love. my steak was overcooked but my potatoes were awesome. 3.5"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm Irish. Like actually Irish.  I've been to Whelan's Gate a  couple of times.  The decor is Irish feeling but is more run down that an actual Irish pub would be. Service is good, I haven't eaten here and drink prices are reasonable. Unless, you're going for St Paddy's when they crank up the price of a Gunniess  to $8.  Last year we made Whelan's Gate our St Paddy's place to be. The problem is there's a halfway house across the street and a number of the residents also made Whelan's Gate their place to be.  I went to the restroom and when I returned one of them took my seat. I asked for it back, as he was sitting in the middle of my friends. He got in my face and tried to start a fight. Security took him out of there but within 10 mins we had to leave as all the halfway housers where coming over and getting in my face. Security was no where to be found. Ruined our night.   So, the pub is alright. Watch out for the halfway housers from across the street as they are not nice."}
{"text":"As other pubs have opened near Whelan's Gate over the past year, there is now some choice. My biggest complaint is that this pub has a clique on the main floor and I'm not into that. I found the bar service indifferent . To top off my disdain, they don't accept Interact Direct Debit cards, but they do have an overpriced ATM.  I frequent this bar only when friends insist. I will say it has one of the more uniquely rural-like patios in the area, and it is one of the reasons I haven't given the place a one-star ranking.  No longer a fan of this pub."}
{"text":"Very solid local! Vastly improved food, and the service is always excellent. My favourite bartender is NIGEL. They have an outstanding selection of single malts. It has 2 levels and 2 outdoor areas, though I prefer the front patio. Regular live music, and other events."}
{"text":"We were walking all day and really wanted a pint in a comfy homey pub, we finally found tyis pub amd were greeted by the most  lovely amd welcoming staff that informed us that that they had just taken over as the new owners of the bar..... they are lovely and the pub is great. the beer selection is fantastic. Definitely worth a stop for a pint or 7"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and the patio in the back is cute and intimate.  Standard pub fare, fish & chips, chicken pot pie, burgers and I think they may have had bangers & mash.   I haven't been here for the live music but heard it is really good.  Small place in general but quaint little neighbourhood hang out."}
{"text":"Was in whelans fri night Heard of a change of management and it was a good thing The place is on the upturn after this beautiful pub was run into the ground Good selection of irish beer and a limited menu ( I am told  they are working on a new menu) I went in with a couple friends and decided to give the place a try My friends had wings and I has the chicken curry The wings I am told were very good , the curry excellent  The server downstairs( refreshing change from the ol boys club) Her name was Mel , very pleasant and took very good care of us The place is supposed to be getting a facelift soon  And I do believe its on its way back"}
{"text":"Three things that earn this place 4 stars:  1. Bourbon. So much bourbon. Also Scotch, a lot of scotch. While it might be a bit out of the way for downtown folks, Whelan's Gate is worth a trek once in a while just for their awesome and reasonably priced selection of whiskey, removed from any sort of pretentious atmosphere. Order a shot of Bookers bourbon, it's fucking fantastic.   2. The Blue Cheese Burger. Actually, all of the burgers are apparently great, but this is the only one I ever order. Their burgers are actually ground from steak in house, so you can actually order one rare or medium rare as the gods intended instead of the usual revolting slab of frozen then burnt meatstuff usually foisted on toronto 'pub'goers.  3. A tiny, strange and beautiful patio tucked away on the roof out back. Pretty and isolated and a great place to chat, eat drink etc."}
{"text":"The waitress was fun.  The \"cottage pie\" less so. I LOVE pub/comfort food so by all rights I should've loved this potato-ground meat-peas-carrots-gravy thing, but it wasn't very tasty, and the mashed potatoes felt kind of grainy.  Decor is good, but when I rate a restaurant, it's mostly about the food. Maybe their other dishes are better, but this one didn't exactly make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Skip it.  Bad food and bad service.  Ordered the Whelan fries.  Really very substandard, but passable for pub food. Service was very non-existent.   The real hassle came at the end.  There was four of us in our group.  One had paid and left early.  I checked my bill.  It was $3 more than another friend who was there.  The waitress said she accidentally charged my friend $3 less.  After telling her I didn't care her response was that I would see my friend again before she would.   Well, I'm glad she watched out for the owner of the establishment, because the owner got his money.  She received no tip.  I guess my tip to you, the reader, is \"Don't go here.\""}
{"text":"A great pub in the west end! Cute building, excellent staff, and good bar selection. Really fun on St Patty's Day. Cute patio upstairs!"}
{"text":"My derby league can often be found upstairs on Wednesday nights. Come say hi if you're around! I like this place for the conversations and atmosphere, and the service of Bushwhacker, the upstairs bartender. She's no-nonsense with the chefs and has no problem yelling at them when they get an order wrong. Which unfortunately happens often.  The food here isn't that great. I've had pretty much all of the vegetarian options and I don't particularly like any of them, so I usually don't eat when I come to Whelans. The drinks are pretty good though!  Come for the derby girls. And I guess you might as well stay for the derby girls too."}
{"text":"Perfectly good little place if you happen to be in the area. I was and had about an hour to kill, so I decided to stop in for a pint and a bite, all by my lonesome.   Even though some of the other reviews I've read have been decidedly mixed (especially some of the more recent ones) I found the food to be just fine. There was a sign outside indicating a new menu or new chef or something to that effect. I'm not sure how long it's been since this has been the case but my meal was quite good. Excellent veggie burger and the fries were very tasty. Attentive service as well, although I was one of the only people there (it was a Thursday around 4:00 or 5:00).     I'm really not in the area very often, probably won't be anytime soon and don't see myself making a special trip. But I can certainly recommend it as a nice neighborhood tavern with good grub and solid Irish pub vibe."}
{"text":"Good winter time pub for a few brews and good food. Make sure to check out the sea food risotto"}
{"text":"We stopped in last week for a Tuesday night dinner with a friend. The first floor was dark and had cases of empty beer bottles stacked at the front door. We normally eat upstairs so we headed up.  We were told that there was a problem with their draught beer system and would have to buy bottles beer for at least the next 30 mins. That didn't make us happy but it wasn't a deal breaker.  The deal breaker was the \"new\" menu the waitress handed us. A single sided laminated page with VERY limited choices. This new menu looked like most pubs late night menu. Fried foods, burgers and club sandwiches. None of the curries, wraps and steak we normally order.   We quickly finished the bottle of beer we ordered and left for a pub a few steps down Bloor St.   We definitely won't be returning for dinner unless the menu is changed. I hope this is a temporary transition instead of a permanent menu."}
{"text":"I had some great company & cold pints.   All the food looked and smelled yummy. I had ordered  some french fries which were nice and crisp & tasty.. Although I really didn't fancy the gravy.   Our server was attentive and we didn't wait long for drinks or our food.   Saturdays after our derby training we'll be back and I look forward to trying some more food out."}
{"text":"Yay!  An Irish pub that actually feels Irish.  This place has been built into an old stylized building of sorts that carries with it a very authentic feel of a pub that you'd find on the isles.  There's none of the trappings of the usual franchised pubs, but a very warm feel and friendly atmosphere.  The kitchen throws out what could be termed North American pub food as well as the traditional Irish.  I say North American as I get the feeling quesadillas are hard to come by in Dublin.  Regardless, fresh ingredients prevail and the food is definitely substantial and worth a look.  What makes this place is the differing floors, nooks and crannies that are available to you.  Up the stairs you're able enjoy some smaller conversational areas with a pint.  In the past they used to have full wood burning fireplaces.  Now I believe these are replaced by gas stoves but nonetheless, still nice to be in front of with a Guinness.  Oh, add to this that the Toronto Ghost Society (http://www.torontoghosts.org/whelans.htm) seems to think that the place may be haunted.  They maintain that the ghosts are of the Casper variety and not the scare-you-mid-sip kind.  They're probably just poking around trying to find a darts partner.  Please, where possible, indulge the spirits."}
{"text":"This pub reminds me of my favorite pub - an old Irish pub, in Brazil, run by an old Irishman. The guy in Brazil closed the pub back in 2004, sadly, and I was orphan. Then I moved to Canada and found Whelan's, which feels the same, with good prices and good food. I'm certainly coming back.   The nachos are HUGE and I suggest ordering for at least two very hungry people.   The chicken wrap comes with fries, and is much smaller. Fits two \"normal\" people, or one hungry."}
{"text":"After walking around High Park, Gord, Sister Sarah and I had supper at Whelan's Gate (Bloor W/Keele).  We sat upstairs.  I ordered the special ... prime rib and mashed potatoes.  It was okay.  Gord ordered a Dublin burger, fries and Ceasar salad ... he really liked it and would get it again.  He said the bun was very delicious.  Sister Sarah got the veggie quesadilla and fries.She said it was good."}
{"text":"I made this a local watering hole simply based on distance. It's a cosy little set-up that brings in a steady migration of people. I have a  preference for the upstairs, assuming that no band is performing, otherwise any attempt at conversations will end.  The back patio is a nice secluded spot.  Beware that in the dead heat of the summer, you will be eaten alive by the bugs from the surrounding vegetation.  Consider Appropriate measures.  I've picked at others finger foods and politely nodded with approval. I've only ever had the fish and chips, the monstrous portion is buttery and crispy and will serve you well in satisfying such a craving.  Unfortunately the biggest downside is the beer on tap.  The selection is fine but there have been way too many occasions in which the draft beer was returned because it was \"off.\"  I won't use the words like sweaty feet or piss to describe the taste, but it was definitely sour and stinky (*cough* Stella  *cough*.)   The staff is generally on top of their game and very accommodating. But you can only be told only so many times that the keg is off and that they routinely clean their pipes. Either their getting their kegs at some underground black market operation or there's some other real underlying problem.  Whatevs, gotta put the kibosh on the beer on tap! which unfortunately doesn't leave much of a watering hole :("}
{"text":"Whelan's Gate has reopened under new ownership...and those owners are friendly, welcoming and seem really driven to try and breathe new life into this local pub.  For folks in the area, this is a good place to stop in and unwind after a long day.  I've stopped in 3 times since they reopened and each time I have tried a different dish. So far each dish I've tried has been very good, prepared well and with good flavours.They do a very good burger (one of the tastiest I've had in recent memory), have a nice chicken pie, and a \"bangers  and colcannon\" that was excellent.  They only reopened a little while ago (I believe early Janurary) and are still finding their legs a bit with regards to potential entertainment options. Currently they offer a nice flow of music...loud enough to be enjoyed but quiet enough that you can carry on a conversation without straining to hear the other person.  They have mentioned that they are looking at doing one or two things on the entertainment front in the very near future that seem really promising. Keep your eyes open for something coming up on a trial basis on Tuesday Feb. 3rd...if it comes together as I have heard it might, it could be a fun way to spend your Tuesday evenings.  I never had the chance to visit this place under its old management but the new folks seem like they will breathe new life into it.  Best wishes to them for a bright future may it be a long one."}
{"text":"Bit of an underwhelming experience at Whelan's Gate.  We grabbed a table in the small room upstairs, where we sat ignored for 15 minutes.  I eventually just ordered some food from the waitress at the bar.  (I had to stand up, the indignity!)  The BBQ chicken sandwich was a bit small for my liking and a bit too sweet.  The sides were actually superb, and I think I would go back for those fries alone.  The atmosphere is swell, so I might return here for drinks.    Obligatory Title Pun: It's all WHEL-an good (but not great)  Menu Readability: Think \"Elephant & Castle.\"  Need to mention:  I might have to try this patio everyone keeps talking about at some point during our 14-day-long Canadian summer.  What this place teaches me about myself: I should have just had the Scotch."}
{"text":"When you get to Whelan's Gate, march right upstairs, ignore the hulking centipede lurching its way across the pub walls (no joke - the centipede I saw was two inches long) and head straight to the garden patio.   It's a bit of a find, really, and you have to know it's there, but that's a good thing. It's completely secluded, dimly lit and has beautiful shrubbery, a rock garden and wooden bench seating that lines the entire perimeter of the patio.  The other floors are more forgettable - the first is usually filled with fairly standard pub/bar clientele and they're a tame bunch, but head to the second floor and all hell breaks loose. There was a dude on guitar alternating between Violent Femmes covers and Irish drinking songs, groups of inebriated girls doing their best Riverdance impersonations and others drinking beer out of enormous Medieval Times-branded chalices.   Service is a bit spotty. It was impossible to find someone to serve us at 11pm on a Friday - as in, there was no bartender present and we had to hunt one down."}
