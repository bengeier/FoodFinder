{"text":"The restaurant is deceptive from the outside. It is quite large a clean on the inside. Our southern waitress was surprised we hadn't been there before as it is a place locals go.  Reviews said the soup was good. Got wonton which was flavorless....I kept thinking it needed salt. I went without because who needs extra salt in their diet?  The meals came quickly (it was lunch and we were there early). I had Sa-cha chicken, which she said was spicy and a favorite.  It was not spicy at all (maybe southern spicy?) and there was a heavy taste of Chinese 5 spice powder which gets overwhelming after eating the dish. Maybe it's just over-spiced? The Hunan chicken my daughter got tasted exactly the same as the Sa-cha chicken and she could only eat a few bites.  The fried rice was rice and egg, no peas or carrots. The portion size was good for lunch without leftovers.  All I know is that now I have to take my daughter to her favorite Chinese in Charlotte, Taipei South, because this didn't come close to satisfying."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese I've had in the Pittsburgh area. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. And everything was great value, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried various places but they have the best steamed pork dumpling in pittsburgh area"}
{"text":"Just tried this place because it's new and wow! Unbelievably good. Just wow! The spring rolls are huge and taste great! I had the triple delight- all 3 meats (chicken, beef and shrimp) were perfectly cooked. Just a great surprise. Definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Went to the Golden Palace recently to try out the new Asian place in town.  Glad to have an Asian place that delivers and will certainly use them for that.  We went on a Friday around 5 and the place was dead....one other table was filled when we got there, they left and not a soul came in.  I'm not a fan of eating in restaurants when I'm the only one eating there.    The atmosphere was ok...a little too bright, they could probably lower the recessed lighting...the lanterns above the tables seemed fairly bright.  Sushi bar in the back with a big screen TV in front...I'm also not a fan of a TV's in restaurants unless it's in the bar.  Really takes away from the atmosphere.  The food was good.  Fresh and plentiful.  We ordered the dumpling combo which were all good.  I tried my first deep fried tempura roll...it was good, but I like the traditional cold sushi better.  Just personal preference.  For our mains we ordered the Walnut Shrimp and the Massaman Curry (was SO excited to see this on the menu...my favorite Thai curry).  The Walnut Shrimp was very good,  Maybe a little too sweet. The shrimp however were beautiful really large shrimp and they weren't stingy with them.  Beautiful broccoli and crispy walnuts and other veggies.  Very fresh.  Two disappointments though...even though it had the spicy sign next to it I did not find it spicy at all (and they don't ask how spicy you want it), but more disappointing was that it wasn't hot (temperature hot).  Our waitress asked us how everything was and I told her it wasn't hot and she just said \"oh, ok\" but did not offer to reheat it.  The Massaman was very good as well, lots (LOTS) of tender chicken breast in a sauce with some veggies.  No potatoes?  My favorite part of Massaman - and I truly missed them - they soak up that delicious sauce.  The flavor of the sauce was very good though, but again, it had the spicy sign next to it and it wasn't enough for me.    I will definitely give them another try, especially with the delivery service, but they need to spice up their spicy entrees, or at least ask you how spicy you'd like them.  They need to serve the food hot, and dim the lights a little."}
{"text":"They have a lot of great variety of sushi, thai, and chinese food at decent afforable prices. We went there for dinner and general tso chicken, crispy walnut shrimp, california rolls were delicious. They also have delivery and take out. we are definetly coming back again :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese cuisine. This has to be the best Chinese restaurant in Gastonia. Very friendly staff. The food is very good and presented well. The restaurant is very clean and cozy. We have eaten here a couple of times and also ordered take out. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend The Golden Palace. Try the teriyaki chicken is fabulous! Best I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight I arrived 20 mins before they closed. The staff was very courteous. The sweet tea was amazing. My wife had the four happiness and her only complaint was that she only got 3 shrimp. Other than that she was impressed. We had the dumplings as an appetizer. They were steamed and amazing. I tried the garlic and ginger shrimp. First time trying it ever at any restaurant. Plenty of shrimp and already de-tailed and de veined. Plenty of peppers and onions. Fried rice was great as well. Will go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! We have been coming here for 20+ years.  It is great to have a good Chinese restaurant right near home.  They  do have the best SWEET TEA !   I have ordered many different things off the menu and all of them are tasty.  They even have a little buffet on Sunday for lunch, very reasonable price.  Portions are also large.  Highly recommend when you are craving good comfort Chinese!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since they opened.  Today was the day.  Stopped in to place a take out order of Thai green chilli curry, oh my goodness, it was delicious!  We ordered the tofu, a slight heat, a delicious flavor!  Really sweet people work there and we can't wait to try other dishes. I placed my order, grocery shopped at Aldi, then stopped in to pick up dinner.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very nice surprise! Ordered delivery from here. Pad Thai and General Tsos. Arrived hot,tasted wonderful, very nice delivery driver at a reasonable price. This will definitely become our favorite choice for great food that's delivered!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Lunch prices are very good.  $7-$8 for most lunch items.  comes with meat, rice, and choice of soup or eggroll.  We called for a pick up, and it only took 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. Food was delicious. Dinner portions were generous, though the rice portions were small. Fair prices. Atmosphere was a bit awkwardly quiet- tv was on in the background. Unfortunately, they no longer serve sushi."}
{"text":"I found myself in Monroeville after church today looking for something quick for an early dinner. My fellow Yelp buddies led me to this place and they did not disappoint.   The dining room was quaint and  we had a choice of where we wanted to sit. We chose a booth which gave us a clear view of the sushi making going on.   We chose a triple delight and combo lo mein. Since it was lunch time, the meals came with either wonton soup or egg roll and choice of rice for the trip d. The serving sizes were crazy. I mean, easily meals for each entree. The wonton soup was just okay for me. In a little spoiled though because I've had some killer wonton in my day. The lo lo mein was really good and the pork, shrimp and chicken were cooked just right. The trip d was bangin! A nice mix if crunchy veggies including a fave...zucchini. The brown sauce was pefect...thick, covering every morsel. It was very good. The shrimp eggroll was crunchy and fresh. I like it when the cabbage I still has some bite to it. The shrimp inside were surprisingly large and cooked just right. The service was friendly and attentive.   I docked a star for the tea. It was not good at all. I don't know if it's the water that's used or the brand of tea. I was expecting a good hot cup of oolong or some other tea but this had some weird after taste that I just could not get past. Nevertheless, that's an easy fix. This one is worth a stop."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened.  From the outside it looks uninviting but t inside is so nice!  Always great service and excellent food.  Tastes fresh each time."}
{"text":"Basic and good! All the basics you expect with a great taste, service and atmosphere. You can even cone and watch your favorite sport...they have TVs. We got sushi. It was really good. The have many lunch specials to choose from and reasonably priced. All around 6-8. One large sushi special is $12."}
{"text":"Indeed a decent find at a strip mall in Plum.  Golden Palace offers an ample amount of lunch options, from Chinese, Sushi, and Thai.  I decided to get the Japanese Bento Box.  My box came with Miso soup, salad, three pieces of sushi, a California roll, another salad, and two mini spring rolls all for under $10.00.  Not bad at all.    After ordering, the waiter brought out our soups.  The miso was satisfactory.  Didn't blow me away but still tasty enough.  Next he brought out the salad.  There isn't much to write home about when you are served a bowl of iceberg lettuce topped with Asian dressing.  Dressing had a palatable flavor nevertheless.  After a few minutes passed, my box was presented to me.  A very gratifying amount of food for a lunch portion.  My roll was 6 select sized pieces.  A hearty portion. My box contained a second salad! I didn't eat it but hey it was there.  Next the three pieces of sushi. The fish was nicely trimmed, though I felt the ratio to fish and sticky rice was a little off.  Lastly in my lunch box was two mini spring rolls.    My friend opted for the lunch Maki rolls.  Came with two rolls of your choice, soup and salad as well.  Wow the portion was huge, especially considering all the sides.  So I swapped a couple pieces of my Callie roll for a couple pieces of his spicy tuna and yellowtail roll.  Overall I was decidedly pleased with our choice to dine here.  The sushi was fresh, the portions were large, and the price was right.  Would definitely come back for lunch or dinner especially since they are BYOB."}
{"text":"This place is a GREAT find!  So happy to have high quality, delicious sushi in the East Suburban area of Pittsburgh!    Not to forget, they have Chinese and Thai cuisine to offer as well...so varying palates of Asian food are accommodated.   That said, I can only speak for the sushi...for now...which was scrumptulescent!  They offer a wide variety of specialty rolls along with the traditional rolls found at your typical sushi joint.  The ingredients were clearly fresh, the service was super friendly, and the portions were ample.   This place has instantly become my \"go to\" sushi spot in the area.  Give it a try...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet. They had a very limited selection of items, and the food was very Americanized. Everything was a tan/brown color because it was mostly deep fried food. I would have liked to see more color. The buffet area was highly lacking in vegetables. The egg rolls were very large and filled generously, but I didn't like the odd texture of the meat. The fried rice was bland. The egg drop soup barely had any eggs and tasted bland as well. The broccoli in the chicken and mixed veggies dish was mushy. The sesame chicken was good though, and the lo mein was okay.   I wish the buffet selection was larger, especially when considering the size of the seating area. It's not the best Chinese food, but it's good place for groups."}
{"text":"This restaurant would have been a five star place to eat at with the exception of their salad offering which is just plain iceberg lettuce and that's it.  So this is a tip for this restaurant to at least offer some carrots or other things in the salad offering.    Now for the review of this excellent restaurant with smiling service the food was fantastic including the sushi which I had three of them and they were well created and tasty.     Normally I would have my daughter with me at a sushi offering but she is overseas defending our county so my lovely cousin joined me.  This gave me a chance to sample some of her food and everything I could sneak on my plate tasted mighty good.     All in all a nice place way out in the suburbs of Pittsburgh area and if they just fix that hilarious bowl of iceberg with some color this place would get my five star rating."}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Ordered take out. Sweet and sour chicken is delicious. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this new neighborhood Asian restaurant (offering Chinese/Thai/Sushi dishes), but after my third order I decided to not explore the menu any further.  The bad experience came with over-sweetening the entrees (vegetarian dishes); although tasting fresh with good ingredients, the preparation was just not delectable.  Luckily we have several good options nearby, if not just down the street."}
{"text":"I am excited to have this new chinese restaurant in my neck of the woods.  Even more excited to see that they do delivery (with a minimum order and for a fee). They still advertise their \"grand opening\" but they have been open over a month now.  The menu includes sushi and traditional chinese dishes.  We ordered two sushi rolls, two different soups and two chinese entrees.    The sushi was beautifully presented.  Even more important, it tasted fresh and fantastic.  They had a great combination of flavors.  The entrees didn't disappoint either.  I was extremely impressed with the presentation.  Most chinese places just sort of throw things on a plate, but here there was great care taken to have beautiful presentation.  The taste didn't disappoint either.  My husband had a beef dish and I had kung pao chicken.  The veggies used were fresh and crisp and the meat was tender and flavorful.  Staff was attentive but not in your face.  They were eager to answer questions and tell you about special dishes or answer ingredient questions.    Overall, a great experience and a welcome addition to the Plum/Monroeville area."}
{"text":"There is literally nothing bad I can say about this place. It is cute and divey. My mother and I have been coming here for years. We absolutely love it. We always get the dinner for two, chicken and broccoli, in white sauce, hot and spicy with fried rice. It is the best Chinese food! I rarely venture back to Gastonia, but when I do, this is one of the places I stop for. The chicken and broccoli is absolutely delicious. You get a ton of food (more like a dinner for four) for $20. The rice is cooked to perfection and they have delicious egg drop soup! Each person gets an entree, rice, soup, egg roll, and crunchy noodles & hot tea or iced tea. What more could you ask for? Their hot tea is to die for. You won't find anything like it any other place. We love it and I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been coming here for years for Chinese food! They are always polite and food is always warm. I suggest chicken Lo Mein and Sesame Chicken. My husband likes Sesame Chicken and General Sao. Wonderful place and worth the price"}
{"text":"When it comes to Chinese, I compare every place I eat at to Golden Palace. I have grown up eating at this place so my taste buds might be biased. Several have mentioned the wonton soup (I'm not that big of a wonton fan so I can't judge that). My personal fav is the spring rolls and crab ragoo, they are great! Entrees: beef with garlic or your basic sweet and sour chicken. Sauce is nice and thick for both and has a great flavor. You don't get the \"mystery meat\" with either and it's always tender, never a chewy blob that I've experienced at other Chinese places (yes ew I know).  The wait staff is always super friendly and great. We usually take out and it's ready within 5-10 mins. Love that! They know me when I walk in the door."}
{"text":"Was here for the dim sum and wow. It was good. There are very few Chinese places in the Pittsburgh area that serve \"real\" Chinese food, and I must say this so far is my favorite place. The best so far is a place in Boston, but I live here not Boston, so I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The worst things about American-Asian restaurants are the food tastes old and the flavors are all the same. However, our food at Golden Palace had neither of these qualities.  Basil chicken hot pot was the best. Really fresh veggies and unique flavors. The meat to vegetable ratio was perfect.   My sushi rolls were really good. I liked how the California roll had separate crab, avocado & cucumber (not mixed up like a crab salad which many restaurants do). My miso soup was a huge portion for only $2.  Another cool thing is the Thai menu, which is pretty rare for a Chinese/Japanese restaurant. Definitely going to return soon to try the curry. The only negative of this restaurant was the atmosphere, consisting of bare walls and one TV."}
{"text":"had it for lunch today, really good food. the soup is just delicious! they are always nice and friendly and seat you as soon as they can, fast service too. definitely my favorite Chinese food in Gastonia if not everywhere!"}
{"text":"I was there for the Dim Sum brunch.  Very good.  Pittsburgh is not New York, so the select is not that big, compared to those city.  The crab soup was very good and service was great.  Here is the menu for the brunch (https://sites.google.com/site/goldenpalaceinpittsburgh/dim-sum).  For the 4 of us, cost with tip was $16.00"}
{"text":"Service was very good and the food was very good too.. Willing staff was willing to do things exactly as we wanted them and the prices were reasonable"}
{"text":"Shocked. After years of being faithful customers, we received inedible food and a too bad/so sad. Sesame Chicken looked hushpuppies. No sauce. Mongolian Beef was bad. Could not eat it. I called the restaurant to find out what was going on, we have been going there for 20 yrs. I was told and I quote \"I've sold twenty dinners, and you the only complaint\". Really? No where near their normal quality. I have had better tv dinners. Refused to allow me to speak to manager. They have to have new owner or chef. Never been treated with such disrespect!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh but lacking in flavor. We ordered the tuna tempura roll, general tso chicken and Mongolian beef. Everything looked great but the flavor was very bland. I wish they offered a vegetable tempura roll. Service was good but the wait was a little long considering we were the only people there."}
{"text":"Amazing, high quality food.  We started with sushi, they clearly use fresh high quality ingredients which always makes me feel good about eating raw fish. Recommend the volcano roll (shrimp tempura with spicy tuna)   We all loved our main courses. Lemon chicken is my favorite dish and I'd say this was far and away the best lemon chicken that I ever had. My sister got pineapple chicken, served in a pineapple - really cool! Very delicious, not overly sweet like a lot of pineapple chicken - just right. My dad has a hard time finding sweet and sour pork that he likes and he loved the sweet and sour pork at Golden Palace.   Definitely give this place a try, you'll be back"}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in the Forestbrook Shopping Center for quite a while now, ever since I can remember as a kid. And if you've read some of my other Chinese food reviews before, you'll know I'm not a big fan of this type of food. But they do serve up a pretty good menu with all of your Chinese food favorites.  I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to the names of Chinese dishes, & heck, I sometimes have no idea what the difference between Chinese & Japanese is. But if you're unlike me, which most people are, then you'll love the food this place serves up. You can never go wrong with rice, broccoli, & chicken, covered in some sort of sauce, so that's my usual choice. Everything I've tried here is pretty good, considering by disdain for Chinese in general, so you can't really go wrong in the food department.  It's a stand alone restaurant, which is unheard of for a non chain in Gastonia. Usually, stand alones are left to only the large franchises in this town. The place can get pretty crowded at your usual dinner hours, but nothing crazy.  Golden Palace hits all the key areas for a decent restaurant, being that it serves up tasty food for a good price, all while in a good atmosphere. There really isn't anything special about the place, but this is coming from a Chinese food hater."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and had **great** dim sum! Highly recommended!!! Having eaten dim sum in places like NYC and other major cities, Golden Palace is a great gem of a restaurant in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"This place appears to be closed for good - BOO!!!!!!  Great dim sum available every day off he menu. I was on business in Pittsburgh when the dim sum craving hit me. I found Golden Palace online and took chance. So glad I did. All the dim sum is homemade and delicious. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent! I enjoyed the shrimp egg roll immensely and the triple crown was delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and had the General Tso's Chicken. It was served with chinese noodles and a choice of soup or egg roll. I had the Sweet and Sour soup and it was very tasty, very hot. As soon as I finished the soup, the General Tso's Chicken was set in front of me and it was delicious. The service was a bit spotty -- I had to ask twice to get chopsticks and I don't think anyone ever came by to check my tea -- but I think that might have been a matter of early staffing jitters.  Prices seemed pretty decent on the lunch menu, about $6-9 depending on what you got, more if you went for the sushi courses."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the perfect cashew chicken! It has been awhile since I have eaten here, and I had forgotten how the real sauce was supposed to taste!!! No doubt it will be my go to Chinese to eat in or take out from now on. It was so scrumptious that my plate is half empty in the pic. Excellent service, friendly folks, nice atmosphere made it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"**Update 06MAR11- I have stopped up there twice this week and there was a handwritten note \"Closed\". I hope this is not permanent.**    Yum Yum Dim Sum! I must say, initially the reason I ate here was because they own the Laundry place next door and that's where I did my Laundry when I lived in Oakdale.  What struck me as odd compared to most Chinese restaurants was that Chinese people actually ate there. In fact, most times I go, I'm the only non Chinese. Their Savory Dumplings are very tasty. I like when I ask for my Spicy Chicken or General Tso's to be very spicy and they laugh at me. Reassuring, haha. The waitresses there are very attentive and fun, always smiles. You will feel very welcome here. They have a Sushi bar, that I've never seen used, a liquor/beer bar, a sadly, unused karaoke machine and a couple huge family style tables with lazy susans in the middle to eat family style."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a new Chinese restaurant to pop up and Golden Palace did not disappoint. The food is delicious here. We've eaten in the restaurant (which is BYOB) as well as ordered take out. When I picked up an order of 3 meals plus sides, it took less than 15 minutes and still looked and tasted like high quality food. I haven't tried the sushi yet but it's definitely next on my list!"}
{"text":"You know, I'd probably go here more often if it wasn't so close to me. I'm already past it when I'm out and thinking about food. But we stopped in again Friday for dinner and were reminded how good this place is. Good food, quality ingredients, great staff. This time we had the veggie spring rolls, the Sesame Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein. Plenty to share or take home. Or both.  Do yourself a favor and give them a try. BTW, I'd give them 5 stars, but nobody gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"This food was disgusting. Im leery of Chinese food, and order the same thing each time no matter the establishment. This was either poorly made or just low quality food. Not going back here."}
{"text":"Only ordered take out but their service is great and portions are pretty big. I love their hot and sour soup! Ordered their 2 rolls lunch combo and it is filling! And they are generous with their fish! And rice is not too much."}
{"text":"This is a inexpensive but good restaurant. You never have a wait and the delivery is fast. They also will never win any awards due to placement of the location or being in Plum. The egg rolls put to shame everywhere in Pittsburgh. The Tso chicken is crispy and very flavorful. I've tried the sushi before there and it wasn't the best ever but was better then a lot of places around here. I've tried numerous Chinese places around here including the one that always wins awards in Pittsburgh for being the best and this is better. You just pay more there because of the decor. Def try here if you are looking for quality American Chinese food."}
{"text":"My teammates and I visited Monroeville for a tournament and all 20 of us had dinner together at The Golden Palace. The service was very kind and friendly and after we called ahead they put some tables together for us so we could sit together. The food was very tasty and fresh. My pork and eggplant was cooked perfectly! Would highly recommend this restaurant for friendly atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's close to my work and my home and everyone at the office goes here for lunch almost daily.   I've been here for both dinner and lunch and loved it both times. The presentation is spectacular! All the veggies are vibrant, fresh and arranged around the plate so beautifully. The lunch specials are killer and will attract me a lot in the summer :). The dinner prices are a lot higher but portion size is decent. Staff members are very friendly and attentive.  I judge Chinese places by the house chili sauce they serve. I always ask for hot sauce on the side and this place did not disappoint. Their chili sauce was flavorful and authentic--chili oil base instead of paste.   The reason I take 1 star off is because I ordered the Beijing/Peking duck. As one of its priciest menu items, I expected more. The duck was a particularly skinny one and rather dry. If you didn't dip it into the sweet sauce, the meat itself was flavorless. Step up your duck game and I will order again! Otherwise, the best roast duck I've ever had will still be in  Cleveland Chinatown."}
{"text":"Yikes! A 1960s style Chinese restaurant residing in a strip mall on the Golden Mile Highway outside of Monroeville? Yep, sure is. Now granted I took the safe way out and just ordered vegetable rice noodles which needed a lot of soy sauce for flavor was expertly cooked and seasoned with a hint of garlic. The vegetables were canned mini corn and broccoli. Blah.   The decor is very plain, it's rather boring. A flat screen TV on the wall was set to Jeopardy. Boring Asian restaurants for 500, Alex. Answer, Golden Palace. What is a restaurant I won't ever visit again? I wish it were the daily double!"}
{"text":"I do not believe the other reviews on this place. It's not anywhere near 4.5 stars. The food is mediocre, at best. we tried both Thai and sushi. The service is friendly but unprofessional, not at all familiar with the menu. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I used to live in Gastonia and this was my favorite Chinese restaurant. After I moved to Charlotte I still drove back there to eat once in a while! They have excellent soup. Best in town. All the entrees are fresh and taste very good even for a Chinese like myself."}
