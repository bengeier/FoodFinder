{"text":"Very tasty.  My wife had the 3 chicken taco plate with side of rice & beans and I the 3 fish taco plate with chips & salsa.  The corn tortillas are very fresh and delicious.  Chicken is finely shredded and moist.  Fish is pan seared Tilapia.  All very good with a relatively authentic street taco flair (the difference from authentic street tacos would be the cheese; Juan Taco uses a grated \"Mexican\" style cheese blend vs. the queso fresco served in traditional street tacos you would find in the southwest).  All in all, very good and a lot of food for the price; the 3 tacos were very filling and the sides were just enough to satisfy.  Would definitely return and recommend."}
{"text":"Juan Taco is the first Charlotte-area food truck I've tried, and I was very impressed! I got a chicken burrito with a side of rice and beans. The chicken burrito was generously sized, and very flavorful, however, the sides left something to be desired. The beans were not refried, just regular ol' pinto beans with cheese, and the rice was just okay. My husband loved his three chicken tacos, and my son also got a chicken burrito (which he loved as well). Pricing was very reasonable, and I love the look of the truck! All in all, despite the bland sides, a very good experience! I will definitely try them again!"}
{"text":"I noticed this new food truck in uptown recently and decided to try it out.  It's a taco truck serving a different meat(shredded pork, steak, fish, chicken) daily on heated corn tortilla's with guacamole salsa and salsa verde......3 taco's for $7....2 taco's with rice and beans $8...burrito $6.  I opted for the shredded pork taco's with guac salsa on the side....the meat was seasoned really well and the salsas were a pretty decent compliment.  I wasn't blown away but it was a nice change of pace for uptown."}
{"text":"Juan Taco catered my friends bday party! The taco truck just pulled up in their driveway! It was a great idea! The owners were so nice and the food was good! I asked for chicken tacos with no tortillas. She made it right up with no issues! Great idea for any party! She also said they weren't uptown anymore bc they got a diff gig. Tear, no more Trade and Tryon!"}
{"text":"I had their steak burrito at the Chow Down Uptown event and it was just fine. Generous portions, decent quality, akin to a little less flavorful Chipotle or Salsarita's. I'd try them again, but for the price you could find better burritos at other places."}
{"text":"Juan Taco is a cute little food cart but I didn't much care for the tacos. They were ok... Not bad but not good either. Ordered the carne mechada tacos (3 tacos for $8 no side). The shredded beef was kinda tough and not that exciting. The corn tortillas were just warmed up, store bought ones. The toppings didn't add much - shredded cabbage and cheese. It's a good thing they were served with hot sauce. Juan Taco could be pretty awesome if they stepped it up a bit!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first lunch at Juan Taco. They sit on the corner of Trade and Tryon during lunchtime, and provide fast service for a good bargain.    I got the taco combo, which had two chicken tacos (shredded white meat) with rice and beans.  The tacos were generously filled and had plenty of cheese.  I liked the beans - they were cooked pinto beans (not refried), topped with cheese.  The rice was a little bland, but hot sauce is available outside the food truck to spice things up.    I definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have some mighty good tacos. Everything tastes really fresh."}
