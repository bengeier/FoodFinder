{"text":"great place for coffee and work :)  The soup and sandwiches are tasty too.  It's too bad the hours are not longer!  I love the atmosphere, it's great to come here and just chill with a friend."}
{"text":"Used to be great. CSI is now policing wifi access. You have to get a sign in code which lasts an hour. Avoid if you need Internet access."}
{"text":"I say CSI... you think... Crime? Mystery? Police? Investigation?   Maybe you *did*... but now it is also the CENTRE FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION at Bathurst and Bloor.  Part cafe, and part office / meeting / collaboration space for organizations dedicated to social change.   By FAR the most unexpected discovery on the Indie Coffee Passport circuit.  

With over 200 organizations using \"roving\" desks and offices... and an open-concept cafe with dozens of people working on laptops and wifi.... this un-assuming basement space is a hub of enterprising fringe entrepreneurs who are shaking up the status quo.  Part bohemian-art vibe, and part effective office... it is a *new* kind of work space that reflects the *new world order* that embraces and encourages individuals with an idea to change the world. 

If you have a small business or organization that needs to meet, collaborate and work, its a great option.  And a great way to brush organic-wool-cardigans with similar-minded people.  Or if you just want to pop in for a coffee and support them that way, that is cool too.  Who knows, you may end up in a conversation that sparks the next \"engineers without borders\" initiative, or Occupy Wall Street phenomenon.  All that brain electricity with surely inspire you somehow!  

Its good to know people are thinking up global solutions.  Right here in the Annex Neighbourhood of Toronto.   www.clivemclean.ca"}
{"text":"Need a good meeting place for coffee and a business chat. Here's the place."}
{"text":"I did not feel much when I was first time here, but as I came here more and more often, I start to love it.
It is close to my school and the gym I usually go. Went here to read and do homework, felt like another home. Their chairs and sofa are comfortable. Clean washroom. Nice lightning. Friendly staff. Always packed with people, but you will definitely find a seat. 
So far I tried their blueberry banana muffin, highly recommend.
Oatmeal chocolate chip is also nice. 
Don't recommend the club sandwich. Stiff and not worth the price. 
Highly recommend the western breakfast."}
{"text":"Great and relaxing place to work and hang out. Good coffee and fresh and healthy food. Staff is generally friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"The CSI Coffee Pub, is located in the main entrance to the Centre for Social Innovation Annex (CSI). Since the pub also contains the centre's welcoming desk, there is a continual flow of people coming through. The bright atmosphere is achieved by 2-metre-high windows on the pub's west side. Free wireless Internet is provided along with plenty of power outlets. The Amerciano I had was very good, and the sandwiches were excellent. There were no shortages of tables to sit at and people watch, or get serious work done. One of the few drawbacks seems to be that the entrance is not wheelchair accessible, as patrons have to climb-down about five metal steps to enter the pub from the street. It might have access in the back, but not apparently from directly off the street.  They accept credit cards, direct debit cards, and cash."}
{"text":"Great price, beverage and food selection, atmosphere and customer service."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place.
The staff are super friendly, the space is gorgeous and the food & drinks are incredible. CSI has come a long way from their humble beginnings and the improvements on the place have made it even better. The coffee is great and their sandwiches are unbelievably delicious too, but their organic and local ingredients (while commendable) often make them too far out of the price range for this poor student. 
This is such a happy environment - I really can't recommend it enough. Not only are the staff very welcoming but I've also met some really interesting people by spending time at the space."}
{"text":"How interesting place it is! The entrance does not look like a coffee shop entrance, but the inside is a large coffee pub. CSI has lots of seats and tables and you can work with your laptop or you can work with others like a group discussion. Everybody is minding her business and it is a good place to work on your project. The hot chocolate is good. I love the place!!!"}
{"text":"Good coffee good atmosphere. Kinda annoying that wifi is only an hour long. Not sure if you can renew it but I didn't bother to do it."}
{"text":"This is one amazing place!

I was visiting CSI as a guest, but a membership here seems awesome.
It was super busy with people studying, reading, or sharing ideas.
There is a mix of sofa type seating, wooden tables, and what I would call \"classroom style\" seating.

There are rooms that can be rented out for functions, seminars, and meetings.   
I thought it was great that they have office space available to rent if you are an independent business owner who needs a space to meet clients.

It's such a comfortable space to sit and you can get food as well!  
I had a Western ($4.50) and it was made to order and excellent.  
They used OMG focaccia, a free run egg, and Sanagan's ham.  

I went back for a cookie but the baked goods from OMG were sold out.
Espresso drinks and herbal teas are great here as well.

Note, the internet can be tricky to connect to with the guest account.
If you haven't been here, you should check this place out!
They have talks here as well, so I check their event calendar to see what is happening."}
{"text":"Funky, multi-purpose underground vibe to this place, in the bottom of the Centre for Social Innovation Annex. Beans from the Fresh Coffee Network (Merchants of Green Coffee).

I've had their Americano twice, and both times they were very well made and very tasty."}
{"text":"I came here as part of Indie Coffee passport 2012 (ICP) 
I had read up on this space before coming over and admire what this centre is trying to achieve. Now with the feel good stuff out of the way lets get down to business
I ordered a cappuccino and waited for my drink looking at the space which is quite big. More of an open space with all sort of meetings going on. The space is kept spick and span. Good setup.
Now the drink itself here is the verdict
Espresso: Medium
Crema': OK
Milk: Frothed OK
Latte Art: average.
2.5 Star for the drink
With the space and setup I would say 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"I think this is probably my favourite coffee place in Toronto. I love the vibe."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.


This place is definitely a great spot to come if you work around the area or are a student nearby at U of T. When you see the place from the outside it seems as though it will most typically be a small place,  but man oh man, the space this place has is serious. I don't think I have ever really seen so much space at a coffee shop.

It seems as though it is the Mecca of all things creative. They are open to having companies come in and use their place for meetings and just thinking big. As a big thinker myself I can respect this A LOT!

In terms of the coffee, average. I can make just as good of a latte or cappuccino at my house with my at home machine. The food seems to be the thing here. Well made, reasonably priced, and overall great.

This place could easily be up there as THE place to come for coffee lovers if they had some good critical assessment done by some REALLY good baristas.

I may be back to this place just because of the innovative vibe it brings. I love being creative and this place could definitely bring that.

All in all, not bad.


That's it."}
{"text":"The CSI Coffee Pub rocks. Well, we all know all the CSI locations rock and CSI in the Annex with this specific coffee pub, easily has the best food of any of the locations. 

All of the sandwiches made with the best quality meats are delicious and the maple butter tart is pretty insane."}
{"text":"Found myself here with my indie coffee passport today - looking for a place nearby to cozy up with a latte and read my book. I love this space, but I felt like I needed to be with a group and/or laptop to really get the full experience.

As part of the Centre for Social Innovation, everyone here is hustle bustle, meeting and collaborating, and definitely a great working vibe here. If I was working on my laptop, this would be a perfect place, but alas, I was looking for a quiet book reading time, and found myself constantly listening in to interesting conversations everywhere. 

The decor is a hodgepodge of chairs and old couches, but gives the place character. 

You could stay here for hours, but they offer only 1 hour of free wifi for non-members. I don't know what it would mean to be a member. 

The food menu looks great. Sandwiches and salads, with gluten free options - all organic and locally sourced. My cappuccino was also very tasty.

I'm going to come back one day with a laptop or a group of people."}
{"text":"I love the CSI! The lattes are great, the baked goods are always fresh, and the atmosphere is so warm, inviting, and inspirational. I love seeing a community come together and actually get work done in a shared space. I love the big tables, where I can sit and work for hours while sipping delicious London Fogs and eating homemade sandwiches and soups. Let me say that the soups are seriously yummy!

My only wish for the CSI would be to get some sort of stove too (if even portable) so that I could add an egg to my mega bagel. 

Other than that, this place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"You should know that you can't use the Wi-Fi here unless you sign up for a membership. I wish I had known that before making a purchasing and sitting sitting down to do some work. 

Otherwise it's a very cool and large space with a good vibe n"}
{"text":"Screw libraries. This is the place all students/ work-from-homers have been looking for. A huge space to work in, and that's just what you do here, no chit chats to distract you just motivated people collaborating or getting into the zone. Food looks good and fueling for those long haul work sessions. Music is varied but the kinda stuff we all want to listen too."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and accomodating for special orders, the food is very delicious and healthy and the prices are very reasonable. However, even when it seems fairly empty ththey can be a little on the slow side."}
{"text":"I need to echo the other yelpers

Great food, great coffee, great people, great service, all with a common cause!

Now i know where all the mismatched furniture goes...it comes here. This place is an excellent gathering spot and the place for like minded people to meet at.

You can rent an office or a boardoom, whatever you need for your projects.

The nice thing is profits support the space to be available for more project"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

A few warnings: if you are in search for a cafe with free wifi, CSI is NOT the cafe that you're looking for. Wifi is available to members only (a minimum fee of $30). CSI can also make you feel really drowsy - the fact that the cafe is in a basement, the dim lighting, the couches and cushions all add to this factor. 

Apart from suffering without free wifi (and having to resort to using up more of my limited data), I enjoyed the coziness of the cafe and I appreciated the fact that CSI is a very open, work friendly-ish (I added the -ish because CSI only provides wifi for its paid members) cafe with a unique interior design (it's like a cross between a secret lab, an indie warehouse and an exclusive clubhouse). Something noteworthy to mention about CSI: it's very spacious (it's the biggest cafe that I have been to so far) and they allow corporations to hold busines meetings. 

The food was also really good - the latte (and latte art) is amazing and the bacon sandwich was super delicious. I recommend coming to CSI if you want to catch up with friends, if you're out on a casual date, or if you want to catch up on work (provided that your work doesn't require much wifi usage)."}
{"text":"This place is beyond cool. In fact I think it'd too cool for me. Renting meeting space, all natural coming, tables that look like they from my old dining room at my parents. This place is all this!

Located near/beneath the Annex theater, find parking on nearby side streets free for one hour, and come enjoy s fabulous latte with a what I can only imagine is made in house morning glory muffin that remind me of the good times!

Sit down at your favorite dining room table and just watch all these people come in and innovate. Maybe they are shooting something what I think I saw was a Telus sponsored space?

Or go over to the concierge and have a chat, book some space or find out information on what all this collaboration is about!"}
{"text":"WIFI is good
Coffee is good
Vibe is good
Outlet access is good
Baristas are friendly

nothing was outstanding but put it all together and you have a five star review for a coffee shop that actually wants to serve my ilk - i.e. people who want to write a paper at a coffee shop all day. 

is down a set of steps, so i guess that would be my one complaint, not accessible and kind of confusing the first time you go in."}
{"text":"Great food, great coffee, great people, great service!

I love everything about the CSI Coffee Pub beginning with the fact that it's nestled into the warm and inviting basement of the Centre for Social Innovation's annex location. The staff here are incredibly friendly and they have built this coffee pub from the ground up, turning it from a tiny little espresso stand into a full-fledged operation that now serves the community.  

You can feel good when you come here because everything is local and sustainable--from the coffee to the food. Fresh buns and green juice are delivered by bicycle each morning and there are enough pastries and treats to appease most any sweets-seeker. They have no problem adjusting menu items to suit your preferences and they make a mean cortado--even with skim milk. 

Plus, the space itself is inspiring (search back a few entries because I've reviewed it too!). You really can't go wrong working here in the company of good people and good coffee."}
{"text":"The vibe: Located on the ground floor at the Centre for Social Innovation, Annex this place is always buzzing with social good and entrepreneur types having all kinds of meetings of the minds to save the world. Which is awesome, of course. It's a great place to really hunker down and get work done, and there is plenty of rooms for meetings. Did I mention comfortable chairs? 

The food: Great little munchies all around. No shortage of sweets and a good selection of savoury baked goods which is always appreciated for long working days. I tried a veggie stuffed baked thingy and it was great.  

My go-to meal: Latte. 

Secret: You can book a real meeting room here. Just chat with the friendly folks at the CSI Welcome Desk as you walk in."}
{"text":"Love this place! I live in Brampton but used to be a hardcore downtown person so every time I get to go downtown, I try to hit up my favorite places for hot fresh organic coffee, best breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and amazing staff and this place is always at the top of my list. The owners also run a 2nd location at Young Place (liberty village) - amazing concept - whole, fresh and local ingredients - and they are all about the quality!"}
{"text":"Came here with about 10 friends and we loved it. There was tons of seating and the couches and rocking chairs made it feel very cozy considering the size of the place. We ordered the best tasting apple cider I have ever had, and I also ordered a croissant that was perfectly flaky and buttery. I am so glad my friend suggested this place. I am eager to return!

**I do think that this place is best for groups. I think if you came alone it would feel too cold."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been hanging out at the Annex all year, and this is the first time I came across this place! A friend of mine recommended we meet here for our study session. It was love at first entrance for me - huge, long tables where we could study. EXCELLENT selection of bagels, coffees and pastries. Friendly, warm service. 

I have found my new study spot!"}
{"text":"This is such a cool space!  And I would not have discovered it had I not been at a Ladies Learning Code workshop on the 5th floor.

During our lunch break, I ran down and grabbed an Americano ($2.50) and ginger cookie ($2.55).  Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming.  

I parked myself on one of the comfy armchairs and breathed in the social innovation.  Room was definitely lively with lots of people on lunch.  On my way out, I checked out a few of the meeting rooms available for bookings in this ground floor eatery.

Our lunch was also catered from the Pub.  I had a turkey sandwich with salad and was impressed that it was made from locally sourced ingredients (Rowe Farms meats, Woodlot bread and 100km veggies).

One of my favourite finds of the new year."}
{"text":"When I walked along Bathurst trying to find the cafe, it took a good minute before I realized that it was underground. When I glanced into the cafe from outside, I immediately fell in love with it before stepping foot inside. Vast in size, CSI Coffee Pub provides an amazing location for community get-togethers and group work. However, many students come here to study because it provides that perfect atmosphere (if you are the kind to like open space and people). On top of the cafe are five office floors with about 160 tenants. Everyone working upstairs would come down before work, during break or after their shift for a cup of deliciously brewed coffee and sandwich. I got to speak with one of the owners, Nick, who was extremely friendly and enthusiastic to answer my questions. I found out he also happened to know the president of a student group I am apart of! A small world eh?

CSI Coffee Pub is currently waiting on their liquor license, which would be perfect for those who would want to de-stress from a long day at work. They also brew each and every coffee individually to ensure freshness, all within five days after they receive their roasted coffee beans. They serve some of their drinks in beer mugs as well, so you would be sure to be caffeinated! One of their specialties are their open-face toasted sandwiches with a side of greens for $8.50 (tax included). Customers have claimed that CSI Coffee Pub's sandwiches taste homemade! The cafe doesn't use stamp cards but their drinks are at a great price ($3.50 for a latte in comparison to $4 lattes at other locations)."}
{"text":"The Centre for Social Innovation. I really like this place. Decent lattes and little snacks, huge work spaces and meeting rooms for rent for terribly cheap. 

I'm not a member, but I've been seriously considering paying the fees, because I think me and CSI could be very happy together.

My only gripe is that sometimes they will give you your internet password, and it doesn't work. Last time I had to go get a new one three times. They have an on-hand IT guy who gives you the passwords, making it extra frustrating... and I know my way around wifi, so I certainly wasn't the issue. At least not on this occasion.    

I feel like a dork spending most of my review talking about that wifi debacle, but it had to be noted. But please know, this really is a four star place, and I really like how it's called CSI. It makes me feel like I should wear a suit and sunglasses and look at every coffee stain like a clue."}
{"text":"A happening place - CSI itself is absolutely fantastic, and the coffee pub reflects the diversity and innovation of the centre itself. The building is deceptively unassuming from the exterior, but belies a dynamic group with some of the smartest people in the city. 

The coffee pub is probably best frequented by groups - it can be a bit busy for those who want solace, so bring a friend, or better yet, meet some of the awesome people around!

The surrounding neighborhood is fantastic as well - it's yet to become as gentrified as the neighborhoods north of Bloor, and while it certainly isn't gritty, it's still got character. Drop by Honest Ed's while you still have the chance."}
