{"text":"Food is pretty much tasteless from appetizers to steak.  Venue and service, ok."}
{"text":"Unfortunately no one ever asked us how our food was... If they had asked- who knows- maybe they would have made an attempt to be sure we were satisfied! Bizarre rules w/ the menu. For example, \"could I have a side of veggies instead of rice or mashed potato?\" Response- \"it will cost $6 extra.\" We did it anyway and were much happier with the grilled zucchini, peppers & mushrooms at an extra $6. I wonder though... Why were there only olives, onions & peppers available in the veggie quesadilla I asked about? Bottom line- I took 2 bites of the tasteless margarita pizza I ordered when the veggie quesadilla sounded too boring, and no one asked if it tasted okay!! Our server also didn't ask if I wanted to take my leftovers with me (is that allowed here? Not sure_ either way though)... I would have let her know I was unhappy. Poor service. Meh food."}
{"text":"Have you been to ruby Tuesday? This is montreals version -- but muchmore expensive.  And ruby tuesday is better. The location is great and lots of outdoor seating--hence one star. We were starving and they fed us. But the food was mediocre at best. The service slow and overworked--I ordered a long island iced tea but low and behold received a soda fountain nestea. Boo.  And remember the service is slow so you can't fix your order without getting stuck listening to god awful pop music even longer. Bottom line: only go here if you are starving and desperate and your intended dinner plans fall apart."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a twenty-dollar pint of watery pilsner, and a twenty-dollar tourist sandwich, come to Dundees! The waitresses' minimal clothing and spaceshot personas are flawlessly woven into the generic sports bar atmosphere! The food tastes like every meal you've never remembered! If you and your party are looking for the ultimate tourist trap experience, give your money to Dundees!"}
{"text":"Right! So the skinny ...   Atmosphere: Serviceable - nothing to write home about (no pun intended).  Americanesque in its decor; bar, high bar tables, booths, individual tables.  The \"den\" (as I call it) that they have that looks out to De Maisonneuve is a great place to be on a cold snowy Montreal night though.   Service:  Serviceable - good staff, a mix of young students and veterans - at least one tiny mistake per order as per my experience here over the past 10 years or so.  Little things - forgot the condiments, Cheddar instead of swiss on the burger, etc.  They work hard to make it right though.  Food: Serviceable.  You're not here for the cuisine.  Standard fair menu - prices could be a little more inline with that- but since it's on they corner of Cresent & De Maisonneuve (a hub of furious activity during the weekend clubbing scene) the prices are somewhat reasonable.  The Brunch however, is actually good & a very good deal.  On Saturday & Sunday mornings, when all the revellers are still sleeping away their hangovers - the area is quite and actually very pleasant (especially during the spring / summer months).   Just my 2 cents (Canadian!)  W"}
{"text":"Had a pitcher outside and people-watched for an hour.   Lots of outdoor seating which is good but I didn't check out the inside or try any of the food."}
{"text":"We went to Dundee's for a family dinner and it did the job. They accommodated our large group with kids and took our reservation for ten on a Saturday night. The Crescent St location is convenient for bar hopping and has quite a lively bar scene as well. The ribs were actually darn good and the service was also good. It's a reasonable costing option if you are in the area but not worth going out of your way to check out."}
{"text":"Ehh. Don't get a mixed drink, they use way more juice than alcohol. Food was so-so. Basic bar food. Nothing special. If I wasn't so hungry and it wasn't so cold out, I would have looked harder for a place to eat. Service was kind of slow. Loud pop music."}
{"text":"Meh. Walking around on a rainy Saturday night, we needed a place to eat that wasn't fancy and not too far. Hotel recommended we go down Crescent Street. We did and this is where we went in. We were seated at a booth above, looking over other booths. Very cool spot, but the space between the table and you is very small and I am not a big person.   The menu is in English and French, which is great for us Americans!  It took awhile for the waitress to initally come over to us, but she was ok after. Not great, but ok. We placed food and drink order together. We ordered a hamburger with side salad and a chicken sandwich with mushrooms and cheese and a side of fries. It was ok. All hamburgers are cooked medium well - no custom ordering here. The only thing that stood out was the beets that were a topping for the sandwiches. That was good! Also had a glass of the house blend red wine. Not very good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best veggie burger I have had in North America .  The balsamic , cheese and cranberry made this feels like heaven on buns. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful . Pretty of out outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy good weather. Plus a full bar !!! What more could you ask for from a place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on a stormy night in Montreal. I was with three friends, all of us being from New York City. Our waitress/bartender Jessie was great and really made our experience enjoyable. She shared two shots with us and gave us plenty of suggestions for food and drinks. We had a pitcher of Alexander Keith's Indian Pale Ale which was really good.   Two of us had the Dungee's Burger which was definitely a very good quality burger, and the pasta was very good. For what it is, which is a bar/grill it was a decent experience, the food was good, the service was great and the price was right.   We were there on a Tuesday Night during a thunderstorm so it wasnt packed so I cant comment on what the regular crowd is like but for a casual drink out and a low priced meal it hit the spot."}
{"text":"If you ever decide to come to Montreal for the first time and you don't know where you should eat and have no internet access to browse reviews of places, I strongly recommend you come to Dundees. The outside may confuse you over what type of restaurant it will be but be brave enough to venture in. Once you get inside, the TVs may convince you it's a sports bar, the decor may convince you it's some local cuisine, the reggae-ish music playing may convince you it's actually cultural, and your fianc√© may finally convince you that you have accidentally stumbled into a Canadian Applebee's. But it's okay! This is what Montreal has to offer! Only after you've had your meal (which was fine but unmemorable), and done some researching, will you have read the words \"tourist trap\" over and over and immediately shake your firsts at the sky."}
{"text":"We ordered the onion soup... What can i say .... Not good at all, no cheese or bread in it, its on top ,old french bread sone cheese on it.  Ordered the lettuce wraps, the lettuce i got was literally the size of my finger, had to ask for normal size you know the kind where you actually make the wraps in  , the chicken was floating in grease. This was bad bad badddddd.  Sorry Dundees never again !! Yuck."}
{"text":"Great service. Granted, we did come minutes before closing and a wee bit drunk. However, the bartender was in training yet managed to serve us the best mojitos of our lives. The Swedish berries shot was to die for. Everyone was very nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a tourist joint.  Plain and simple. The food that is so incredibly boring that if you told me that it was trucked in from a chain restaurant in upstate NY I would not be surprised.  The drinks, although uninspired, are served by universally attractive tip magnets.  The singular vibe of this place is \"Where are we gonna go next?\"  If you're a tourist, and you are intent on avoiding all of the amazing food and atmosphere this amazing city has to offer, then by all means - camp out here for the duration of your stay."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant is just amazing! Right in the heart of downtown! Plenty to watch if you sit al-fresco! Which we did and it was amazing! I order a veggie burger which honestly just fell apart there was so much in it (a little stressful to be honest) but delicious none the less .. fries were amazing home made goodness! Staff were so friendly, laid back and helpful! Never listen to anywhere that has 3 stars on this, go see for yourself as this was very enjoyable and lovely atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Dundees since the late 90s. If you don't have kids in tow, the bar area is very cozy, the beer selection is very good, and the food is perfectly decent pub-type fare.   Unfortunately, none of the cozy aspects of the place are open to you if you go with a kid. It's like they try to get you as far away from the hub of activity as possible. Definitely not as enjoyable to be exiled to a distant end of the place, despite having an extremely well-mannered child."}
{"text":"Steak and cheese wrap and ceasar wrap were both good-poutine was delish! Sangria-mmmm:) ended with a B-52 coffee:) a little pricey, but that seems to be just life in downtown Montreal!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that their service was so poor because the food was great. I came here with two friends on a Friday night. We were seated right away, but it took 15 minutes before a server finally came over to our table. This particular server quickly realized we weren't seated in his section, so he wouldn't be serving us (and proceeded to announce this out loud to us - yikes!) We asked him to find out who was supposed to be taking care of us since we had been sitting for awhile and he said he would find out. After another 10 minutes, and still sans server, we had to ask yet another member of the waitstaff to find out who was supposed to be taking care of us. When our server finally did come, it was another 10 minutes before we even received waters. Thankfully,  the food did come out relatively fast and was great tasting - everyone at our table enjoyed their meals and had leftovers for the next day's lunch. However, based on the service alone and the fact that there's plethora of other restaurants Downtown, I won't return."}
{"text":"In another city this restaurant would have earned 4 stars, but for downtown Montreal it deserves 3. As other reviewers mentioned, the waitresses are pretty and friendly, and they have nice outside seating. We ordered a curry chicken entree, which was very good, and a tenderloin sandwich, which was okay. The bruschetta appetizer was also excellent. Overall a good experience but very American and a little bland for Montreal."}
{"text":"As for as fast deli food goes, this was uninspiring to say the least. Went on a Friday, service was average and the bar area was loud with a rowdy party next to us.  The food was normal pub fair done sloppy. Ordered the California chicken sandwich and was underwhelmed with a side of fries that were ok. Also ordered a Cesar to start. It was an average salad with a dressing that appeared to be heavy on anchovies.   All in all, there aren't many fantastic options in the area and this definitely isn't an option I'll return to."}
{"text":"This was one of the nicest bars we found in Montreal. The place has a great atmosphere & it's in a great location. The bartender was quick w/ drinks & lots of fun. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Bonnes assiettes, service rapide, prix abordable. Ma pizza m√©diterran√©enne √©tait d√©licieuse tout comme le fish and chips. Belle carte des vins. Vraiment une belle d√©couverte"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad! We were looking for a place for beer and some food, and Dundee's got the job done. Don't expect exceptional food though."}
{"text":"I love this French restaurant on Crescent St!!  During our week long trip to Montreal to attend a wedding, we tried many different restaurants and only 2 restaurants are truly memorable.  Dundee's being the very one we just love and keep going back for lunch and dinner and supper!  Their soup, escargot, the bread, the steak, salad (oh so FRESH!), the halibut, the beers, the ambience, the cute waitresses, ... and all this come at a very reasonable price for the experience!!     I am salivating just writing about them.  I wish I were in Montreal right now!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here and waited about 10 minutes to be attended, we were about to literally get up before the waiter arrived, he did immediately apologize so w/e shit happens no?....Well anyhow considering me and my friends stood at a relatively cheap hostel for the weekend we had some extra capital to invest in some great meals and Dundees didn't disappoint. We had the lobster, a pasta scampi with shrimp, and a rack of ribs we all equally shared. Overall the food was good, not great but I'd probably come back again when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"That chicken Caesar wrap though.  Americanized restaurant that served excellent food.  Good portions, good drink menu, overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been to Dundees almost every time I've been to Montreal. For a bar their burgers are some of the best in town, they have large (decent priced) beers, and the waitresses are not only very attractive but also really friendly. Great place to catch a game or to grab a bite & a brew before heading out for the night..."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! If you are visiting Montreal and looking for a quite bite to eat you are better off going to Taco Bell. The food took 45 minutes to arrive (there for brunch) and was cold and tasted .. .well, it didn't taste. Omelets weren't cooked, pancakes were thinner than a crepe, and the coffee was like drinking tar. I have never sent a plate back in my life but I was prepared to here, if only the waitress came to check on us. She picked up my plate without speaking to us or asking if we would like more water, coffee, how our meal was... no interaction. Glasses empty and looking for a refill? That's not going to happen. Eventually we had to get up and track down the serve station to request our bills. Never have I wanted to walk out of a restaurant more. I requested to speak to the manager about our experience because it was so disappointing, but he didn't seem to care. He shrugged, said 'well were slammed' and blankly starred at me. I didn't leave a tip and told the waitress why. She was clearly trained by this lovely manager because she had the same excuse. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Very nice that they're open late. We got seated right away and service was very pleasant. The food was amazing as well. No doubt this is a good place to eat in/drink at."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone seems to hate on this place, I've been a couple of times now and it's always been good, service is always friendly and bilingual. The pesto pasta with tiger shrimp was fantastic and just recently I stopped by for a small snack and decided to try the peanut butter pot stickers which were pretty delicious. The lychee and strawberry sangrias are both fantastic and there is a lengthy drink menu with tons of things to test out in the future. There are huge windows in this place making it a very bright and warm environment which is nice and tons of seating options however I tend to always sit directly at the bar. Food seems to come relatively quickly... Overall I don't see what all the fuss is about and would highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in this place for some poutine and some pre-dinner drinks during our quick trip to Montreal. It was a fun little bar. Julia, the bartender was very helpful and friendly. We had some good laughs with her. The poutine was great, though it was our first so I'm certainly not an expert. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat before going to the movies, i.e., we knew we would be stuffing our faces with popcorn and whatnot later on so we just wanted a small entrees in our stomach and burgers just seemed to be our only not totally overpriced option in this area! The atmosphere is cold as in any sports/beer american bar but then I suppose people don't go there for the decor as long as there is alcohol in their glass and hockey on tv everyone is happy! We went for the chipotle burger and the whiskey burger... On paper, these two sounded delicious... In reality, these two tasted exactly the same. We weren't sure which one was which and ended cutting them in half and sharing to be sure... which we never became! Presentation was nice and service was friendly which is why I am still giving it a two-star."}
{"text":"We were out walking around in Montreal on a very cold night dressed like we were still in Pacific NW.  We picked this place because it looked the warmest with the two fires in the front and all.  It was warm.  But the food was really meh... and service was incredibly slow."}
{"text":"Alors le Dundees, on y va seulement pour un verre quand tous les autres bars potables de la rue Crescent sont bourr√©s ou remplis de jeunes tr√®s jeunes... Les cocktails sont corrects mais la nourriture pas du tout, elle est ch√®re et de basse qualit√©. Bref, c'est un plan de secours si vous tenez absolument √† rester sur cette rue"}
{"text":"Nice menu.. great value and attentive staff.  My chicken Souvlaki was delicious.. my husband enjoyed his 3 cheese tortellini and beerenjoyed sitting by the fireplace."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch because we were tired and didn't feel like walking any further. We both had the potato leek soup, which was excellent. My Sweetie had the tuna sandwich with fries and I had the plain salad with a side of fries. I was sad my salad had a more than a few not-so-fresh leaves, but the waitress (Dana) did not charge us for it. The fries were crispy and hot and tasty. The food was good but not memorable in anyway. Dana was one of the sweetest waitresses ever. So polite and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I'm sure their location affords them plenty of diners, but they should try a little harder... The food is really salty. Wait staff can be incredibly slow. While staying in the city, I regretted having eaten here and not somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well I went here to see if we could catch the end of the game, then realized it was over and stayed anyways.  english/irish type pub.  great service actually, very welcoming.  Casual spot, not crazy exciting, but a good stop for a couple pints.  Takes Amex."}
{"text":"Happy hour was good prices. Not a huge selection of beers or wines but the upper balcony was a nice spot to sip an adult beverage and people watch. Service was good and place was clean."}
{"text":"Prime time people  watching destination being right on a corner along bustling Crescent.  Their  cockails are the standard fun and fruity variety, but  very pretty.   Simple  tourist  friendly food,  I go here for the  terrasse and people watching,  have only casually glanced at the menu."}
{"text":"So we went here for lunch and let me tell you, The food looks MUCH better then it tastes. I have a thing for french onion soup so the lady at the table beside us had one and it looked soooo devine! it was the only thing i ordered and i thought it would be amazing, unfortunately when it came to eating it it was horrible. The bread was hard (i dont know how thats possible when its soaked in soup) and the broth was the worst part of the soup. It just tasted like watery chicken broth douced in salt. You know when you make that liptons noodle and broth from the package and there are those little yellow circles of i dont know what that are sitting on top of the broth, that was in my soup. It was so gross i could even eat it, i sent it back. My friend got a chocolate cake and she said it tasted like something she could buy at the grocery store. The server was easy on the eyes but thats it, she didnt really seem to know much about the menu. I for sure would not go back there."}
{"text":"Great location and nice atmosphere! But you are paying for that and not the food!! Burgers are so so - I spend nearly $30 Canadian Dollars on one hamburger,a side of vegetables, and two sodas. Burger was tasty and juicy, but the patty was a bit thin and broke apart easily. The side of vegetables for $5 was a waste - frozen vegetables (about a cup worth) steamed with no seasoning at all.  Fries are comparable to that of McDonald's. Service was really slow as well - I ran dry with my soda and water - 10 minutes went by before the waitress came by - she didn't even offer to refill my water or soda. I had to ask as she was walking away. Yeah no I will most likely never go back again - there are too many other choices around there in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special and I don't think much is authentic or homemade. We ordered Nachos to start (they came to us cold and not all the cheese was melted).  I ordered the tortellini Gigi and the noodles were over cooked and very little flavour.  My BF ordered the Giant Burger and really liked it.  The service was not bad. Not great, but no complaints."}
{"text":"One, great service. Two, great happy hour. Three, excellent food both times we came here. Four: good beer selection. I look forward to coming back on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Our Montreal vacation started with a bit of a wander around the city and we couldn't help but marvel at the strength of the city's patio game. (Sad to say Toronto has nothing on Montreal as far as patios go.)  We wound up in this very cool neighborhood that was just rife with outdoor seating and decided to give Dundees Bar & Grill a shot.  A quick perusal of the menu led me directly to the Cuban Sandwich (\"Ham, Swiss, Pickle, Mustard, Pulled Pork, BBQ Sauce\"), because who can say no to a sandwich with meat and melted cheese?  It arrived shortly after and was presented open-faced, which seemed like an odd choice but certainly highlighted the copious cheese on it. I closed it up and took a bite and immediately thought to myself, \"this tastes nothing like a Cuban sandwich.\" For one thing, Cuban sandwiches, as far as I know, are supposed to be pressed so that they're a little crunchy. And I've never eaten one with pulled pork in it.  But once I got over that stuff, I'll admit that I enjoyed the hell out of this 'wich. It's packed with tasty ingredients and the copious melty cheese really ties the whole thing together. I also want to single out the fact that it arrived to the table piping hot, which is, unfortunately, an extremely rare occurrence and ensured that the cheese remained gloriously stringy the entire time I was eating.  Five stars for Dundees is probably an overreaction, but honestly, the food was very tasty, the service was quick and attentive, and the outdoor seating was just about perfect. I really can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was not great. I hate giving bad ratings, but for the money the food should have been much better. We could have gone to a higher end restaurant and paid the same for better quality food. My husband got a raw steak when he ordered medium. They did not charge him for it which was nice though. Kids were ok with what they ordered. They did not like the pickles. They were not the half sour kind we typically would expect. My steak had a weird taste and the veggies were bland with no seasoning. The poutine may have been the only part of my meal that tasted good. We also ordered the calamari. It tasted like frozen prepackaged type and had no tentacles like we normally see at places. This meal for 5 cost about $175 after the steak dinner was removed. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant with great service and fresh food. We found this place on New Years Day. We are a family of six with picky eaters so finding a good restaurant that everyone enjoys is a pretty tall order. The original restaurant was closed so we decided to try Dundee and didn't regret it. Justin our waiter couldn't be more accommodating. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went there on the Quebec day with my project group. I tried the chipotle burger which was soooo good, but too much to finish. Instead of fries, I got the poutine. To be honest, that was the best poutine I have ever had!! It totally changed my mind on this Quebec special dish:) It is such a great place to eat and have fun with friends!!"}
{"text":"2.5  Good for people watching, but pretty touristy. We knew this, we just wanted some place where we could sit and enjoy a few snacks and drinks. Would I go here again? Nah! No need to since there are so many other places on the rue."}
{"text":"Food was good, I got the dundees burger and I enjoyed it. They for whatever reason serve the burger with one bun on the side with the toppings divided between them. All the mushrooms are on the bun you have to flip on the other half so makes it a bit messy. Not too big of a deal though. My friend got a different burger and it wasn't like that.Just depends on the burger you order I guess.  Getting the bill was the hardest thing! The girl pretty much ran off and returned like 20 minutes later."}
{"text":"Great location, open late. Good drink selection.  Ordered nachos, cheese wasn't really melted.  Service wasn't bad but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"As many others have said, this is a TOURIST JOINT.  And I'm a tourist, and I can say that I was really unhappy.  I wish I could say that it had something to do with the food, but I cannot even say that because my friend and I were seated outside in the patio area and we did not get served or even an \"Ill be right with you\" for about 15 to 20 minutes.  We ended up just getting up and leaving.  Hope no one lets this place ruin their experience with Montreal's food scene because it's pretty awesome in general, I just would be hesitant to go here, especially if they're busy.  But hey. maybe the food is awesome?    Note:  There was also another family sitting next to us who had not been served either and looked as annoyed as us.  They stayed in spite of their annoyance though."}
{"text":"We were walking along a side street that reminds me of Maiden Lane. Lots of cute restaurants dotted the street. We dropped into Dundees after looking at the menu.   We ordered fish n chips, cowboy burger, mushroom steak wrap and Sicilian pizza. All were very good. My wrap was tasty and came with garlic mashed potatoes. Fish and chips was small. Only 2 long pieces. Minus one star for the tap water disguised as bottle water charge ($2). Otherwise service was great!"}
{"text":"The service is usually pretty slow but the staff is very friendly. The food is delicious and the portions are plenty! They have great lunch specials Monday-Friday. Dundees is located on Cresent street which is a busy street so great ambiance and yet there's never a wait for a table! I usually take a seat at the bar for faster service."}
{"text":"I really loved the food here.. We were seated outside in the balcony, and food came out nice and fast. Service was great and so was the food! My favourite dish here was the fried calamari :)"}
{"text":"Not understanding why everyone's hating on Dundees.. I had the seafood pasta and opted for the creamy pesto sauce instead of the pomadoro, and it was actually delicious..! We also had nachos to start with, along with mozzarella sticks. The service was prompt and extremely friendly, too! I would probably come back. Yes it might be touristy, but it's good food, and that's good enough for me..!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to get out of the rain. Sat at the bar. Ordered beers which, eventually, grudgingly, arrived. Asked for menus. Twice. Waited half an hour with closed menus and expectant looks, while multiple servers and bartenders passed us without acknowledgement. Gave up, paid the check and moved on.   Service is unhurried in Montreal -- that's part of its charm -- but the staff here just plain ignored us. Don't bother. There are so many superior alternatives."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Has a decent bar, and great 5-7 specials! The food's not bad either. Having said that, the chicken is rather dry, and the servers messed up on the order twice (we asked to substitute an item, but it was missed at some point in the chain). The servers also took their time, both taking orders and delivering food, but a decent mid range place. It has lunch appropriate cuisine, but a vibrant bar atmosphere, so choose wisely."}
{"text":"So it was a late night out and we were looking for just decent food nothing off the chart! Good thing because we found nothing off the chart! The onion soup was so salty that it was not edible! The calamari was ok and the pizza was nothing to write home about!   The kicker is we asked for 2 glasses of water and ended up with a $2.00 unexpected charge on our bill. Our server did not ask if we wanted bottled or tap water. When I questioned the bill she pointed out a box in the menu saying a $2.00 will be added for water if you don't ask for tap water. Then she told us she is not allows to tell customers about the charge.   There are so many places to go in Montreal and this is not one of them!"}
{"text":"My fiance√© and I popped into this place for drinks and appetizers on a lazy Sunday during our recent mini-vacation.   We sat outside on the patio and our server was Jordan, and he did a 5 star job. He greeted us right away and was nice upbeat. I ordered seltzer and he suggested this Italian soda water, which I guess is a thing now, and it was refreshing and delicious (and only $1 unlimited per guest). I also ordered a beer cocktail, the Funnel Cloud I think? Anyway, it went down quick. My lady had a daquiri and it was fruity and rich. I crushed the Funnel and then switched to Rickard's White, served cold and frothy.   We had the tuna tartar and steak frites. Both were great, crushed them both and by the end of our apps and beers we were both actually stuffed!  The music was great, I don't know what it is about Montreal, but all the casual-type of places seem to play classic rock. This was a real treat coming from NYC where the music in restaurants is typically the same as the service; crap.   I hit the men's room and a gentlemen in a shirt and tie was politely and quickly directed me. A manager I presume, very nice. I also noticed Jordan slinging drinks behind the service well, so he was hustling working both the floor and the bar, and making it look easy. It was refreshing to see someone proficient in this industry!   We will be back for sure any time we're in town, cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was ok/mediocre. We had a salad, burger, fries, and chicken fingers. Nothing was memorable. Thankfully the World Cup game was on and they have great drinks and a big tv inside.  The waitress was a bit rude and the other waitress seemed lazy and lacking in customer service skills.  I wouldn't choose to go to this restaurant when there are better choices across the street and around the corner.  Not a bad place - just not good or great."}
{"text":"The food is ok , the cocktails tastys, i like decoration , the big window,  the country feeling inside with music. Little terrasse available."}
{"text":"We went to Dundees for dinner last night.  I was thrilled to see a veggie sandwich on their menu.  I ordered that with French fries as well as a side salad.  The salad never came which seems par for the course (it's just my luck!) but in the end I was grateful because the sandwich filled me up.  A lot.  They did have the salad on the check but promptly removed it when we told the very friendly waitress that we never got it.  At first I was a little freaked out by my food because the veggies had grilled marks and I was afraid it would taste like a stake but either they clean the grill real well or I was truly starving because I really enjoyed it as well as the very yummy fries.  My husband's steak was average.  A peperonni pizza order by our friend seemed to have real peperonni and a salad with chicken was huge, was done with mesclum and looked to be a huge portion.  All in all we were happy.  Of course, as a vegetarian, I did not find a lot of variety but would probably go again."}
