{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER. Ordered take out from here a few times and have never been disappointed. The restaurant seems a little sketchy from outside but their food is verrrrry good. They give you huge portions that are made fresh for very cheap, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"When i used to go to York for school this place used to be on top of my list for good and inexpensive food. Its basically all their dishes for 4.99 each with a few exceptions. 
The lady behind the counter is really nice and she actually remembers her customers. Chilli chicken is awesome. Make sure to specify how spicy you want your food to be . Don't let the simple environment fool you , the food is just amazing."}
{"text":"Don't let them decieve you,  but the chicken balls are ugly, yet yummy all the same.  

Special fried rice was delicious and you could actually see chunks of real meat in it as opposed to some places I've ordered the same dish from.  

Wonton soup was alright,  you had the option to choose chicken or shrimp.  Chose shrimp, not entirely disappointed.  

The general atmosphere is something that of you just eat and go.  Nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and CHEAP! Great for take-out. Wouldn't recommend for a nice sit-down meal, the place needs a reno yesterday."}
{"text":"This is a popular restaurant that serves the many businesses in the area as witnessed by the many workers still in their work uniforms that dash in for lunch or take out.

Quite reasonable pricing and very tasty food is the draw.

The Chinese owners describe their food as more like Indian Hakka food and they are very right in the spicy department! Be careful if they ask you if you like you order more spicy!

The menu also covers some Thai food and regular Chinese food as well.

The interior is very sparsely decorated so there is not much in terms of atmosphere here. This suits the purpose of eating here though .i.e. run in for a quick bite!"}
