{"text":"It's pretty much like dinner at an immigrant Uncle's basement.  This is the definition of a hole in the wall.  Food was only ok and not enough to make this a glorious hidden gem.  The staff seemed nice enough, but don't go expecting Canoe type service."}
{"text":"nice eat in or take out location. the staff was friendly, and very generous with the food :) its my goto place for very affordable rice box."}
{"text":"Super friendly staffs and unbelievable price.  $5 for a single item combo.  I got bbq pork with rice and soup.  Can upgrade to two items for $5.50.  Taste is amazing, tender juicy meat.  They even ask to see if I want extra rice as I got take out.  A must try in East Chinatown :)"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall. But it's declisious and great. I went here for the first time since Ka Ka across the street is closed for renovations.   I went into the restaurant and it was quite dingy, with sparse tables and you could see people who had probably just gotten off work and needed something fast, cheap and delicious to eat. It decorated with the standard Chinese decorations around it.   The food there is quite cheap - considering what the area is and what it usually is - and it's all out there for you to see. The BBQ duck was only $10 for half a side ($20 for a whole) and the guy let me look at each of them and choose which one I wanted. My own criticisim was that it was very salty - but it was good. The BBQ pork is what really shown out for me, it was delicious, fresh, tender and exactly what I want in BBQ pork. He also actually took time to slice the BBQ pork into slim, evenly cut pieces so I was very impressed (I don't see that quite often).   The guy who was serving me was quite friendly and nice, trying to make conversation with me and my boyfriend (who was white) and let me choose what I wanted.   Great place to go, will go here more often when I'm in Toronto."}
