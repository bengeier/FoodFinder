{"text":"So this place is new, it replaces the Zoup in the McDonald plaza beside magic noodle. 

The interior is highlighted by yellow walls with brown and black chairs, tables and and accents. The ordering counter still retains the soup wells from when Zoup was here but they are not being utilized. There is photography in large picture frames decorating the walls. 

The theme seems to be Japanese comfort food so the menu is comprised on rice and ramen dishes. The Rice's dishes are split into dons and curries. For +$2 you you can add a miso soup and a salad or a pop and a salad to form a combo. Salad options are: green salad, mixed veg (cabbage and corn), kimchi, and potato salad. You order your food first but then hey bring it to your table. Aside from this level of service they don't have any additional interaction with you. Btw the cashiers and owners appear to be nice and recommended their specialty of the Gyu-don. 

My partner and I both got combos w/ miso soup with the gyu-don and the tofu mushroom don. I got the kimchi salad (which btw kimchi is always just a side I and the amount given was neither the amount for a salad nor would I ever want to eat a full salad portion), and my partner got a green salad. 

The food was what you would expect. Nothing special but also nothing bad (minus the wet soggy rice, which as an Asian eating at an Asian restaurant is hard to over look). The soup was fine good tofu, you can taste the salt, but not like salty. The kimchi has a kick, and the salad dressing wasn't to strong, creamy yet light. The poached egg and the Guy-don topping are well cooked. The mushroom and tofu also well cooked but the mushroom don't have additional seasoning so when you don't have the sauce it can be bland but you get that mushroom flavour. 

Overall there isn't anything wrong with the restaurant for what it is. The quality is slightly better than average (good food cook on everything but still can't overlook the soggy rice). Their service is what it is. The price is $12.42 for both $8.99 set with the combo added on. The quantity of food is on the solid to fair side (filling but not too full). 

Personal rating is 3.5 but since I can't find any real fault aside from rice I rounded to 4 vs 3 for service and everything beside the rice. I wouldn't come here again as a friend personal preference for other types of Japanese food at slightly cheaper price points or better quality Japanese food. But again for what I feel like is a fast food concept it's good for what it is."}

It probably is difficult to locate for those who aren't familiar with Richmond Hill geography. I recommend that you drive east on 16th avenue so that you can turn right into the plaza directly. Turning left on 16th avenue could prove to be difficult if you are doing this during rush hour. To find this plaza, look for McDonald's or St. Louis Wings.

I went with a bunch of friends so we all got to try a bit of everything. At first, I found that the prices were very decent but the portion sizes proved otherwise. They probably could add a bit more food to each dish and make the whole experience \"worth it\". If you are a girl who doesn't eat a lot, this is fine, but for a guy it's not enough (trust me on this).

Their specialty is in gyudon. Let's go through some history lessons, gyudon is very popular in Japan and people literally see it as a beef bowl. Layers of beef are piled at the very top, with a bit of sauce, and the rest is rice. In Japan, Yoshinoya is the restaurant that people go to when they want to eat gyudon. It's not supposed to be fine dining, quick order, let's eat, and get the hell out atmosphere lols. Yoshinoya is popular in Hong Kong as well.

The beef here is great, super tender, good seasoning, and the amount is alright. The rice is not too soggy, I would say they did a pretty good job. For $2 extra, you can make it a combo, but the miso soup was horrible and the potato salad was too salty. I recommend you skip that. My boyfriend ordered the chicken karaage and honestly it tasted excellent, but 4 pieces? No, this is not Kinka or Guu - you can give us more. The gyoza that came with the ramen was not good - the batter was too thick - it was too crunchy - not hitting home for me. The ramen had a good broth, unique, warm, and worth ordering. There's a lot of potential here so I recommend the following: 1) Increase portion sizes if you want to retain customers, 2) Redesign some of your recipes, especially sides, 3) Look at putting a sign at the front to direct customers to the cashier for ordering - while it may be common sense, the point of restaurants are to make things straight forward. This isn't an escape room lols."}
{"text":"I ordered Gyu don with egg and added $2 to add salad (many salad options like kimchi, veggie, garden or potato salad) plus miso soup or drink. My friend ordered the mushroom and tofu don with potato salad and soup. We also ordered the appetizers spinach with sesame sauce and chicken karaage ( fried chicken).
Don portion is not big, rice is not soggy like the other reviews have mentioned but there was a lot of sauce at the bottom of the bowl. I would personally prefer the rice to be more dry. The beef tasted good and tender. My biggest complaint is that the miso soup is lukewarm, don't know why. Miso soup should be hot!!! 
Chicken karaage and spinach were okay. Potato salad is quite yummy. 
It's cafeteria style so you order the food at the cashier and the staff will bring you the food to your table. Staff is polite and friendly. The place don't serve water so if you need water, you might want to pick a drink instead of ordering miso soup if you want to order a set. 
Would I go again? If I am craving for beef don and if I am around the area, maybe. I hope the miso soup will be hot next time."}
{"text":"Although this place just opened up I feel like there can be always room for improvement especially in regards to the portion sizes. Do not expect here to leave here full unless you plan on ordering 2 mains for yourself as well as an appetizer. The dishes here are a little bit on the smaller side but that does not mean they're not tasty. 

Not pictured but there was originally 5 takoyaki. The takoyaki was tasty and so was the ebi curry rice. 

I don't mind paying a little extra for a bigger portion but for $9 which is equivalent to what the prices at Jtown are; I expect a bigger plate with more food. 

Service here is friendly and they do try to be as efficient as possible. 

Now as I finish the rest of this meal, I need to make a trip to McDonald's after to eat a McDouble in order to feel full after this meal."}
{"text":"We came here few times since they opened, they serve Japanese style comfort food, tasty and lots of options, u can choose from rice combo to ramen with various appertizer. The friendly service enhance the dinning experience, if you like Japanese cuisine just like me, recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this new spot for a quick lunch, and the speed is fantastic. I waited only about 5 minutes for my entire order. It's nice of them to put their menu on the window, and the price is sooooo cheap. You can get a big bowl of beef rice for only $7.99. That's comparable to McDonald's pricing, and way more filling than Big Macs. 

I used to go to Yoshinoya a lot when I was in Asia. Kome's menu does remind me of Yoshinoya's, but way more choices. They even have Ramen. And I heard that they do their broth and flavoring in house, unlike many other Ramen places in the GTA, using packaged broth, so they all taste rather the same. 

I tried their Gyudon with scallions and Onsen Tamago. My partner ordered Curry Katsu. First, the taste. This is better than Yoshinoya's. Reminds me of some of the Gyudons I tried in Kyoto, Japan. The curry Katsu is great for the price. Same dish would cost 10-15 US dollars south of the border, and it's $9.99 Canadian. And the taste is so much like homemade Japanese Curry. 

The service is quick and fantastic. What I don't understand is, why some of the people are complaining about their portion. For me, it's more than enough. And the topping and rice ratio is good too. 

Kome Shokudo just becomes my favorite spot for a quick, inexpensive and comfortable meal. I will be a regular here! Highly recommend?"}
{"text":"Casual fast food Japanese styled lunches. 
You order at the counter and they either call or bring the food to your table. 
I had the gyudon with scallion and egg and added a combo with drink and salad. If they were trying to model after yoshinoya or other gyudon chains from japan, then they are doing pretty good for taste-wise. 
My sister had the teriyaki chicken on rice which she liked. I thought it was nice that they actually had some veggies on it. The staff were nice and asked us how everything was, which I liked."}
{"text":"So a group of 8 of us dropped by after church to check out this new spot, and we were all incredibly disappointed. The place a spacious, and has a cafeteria sort of atmosphere, but the portion size and quality of the food was just very lacking. Many of us ordered the ramen, and the cuts of meat were all mixed up, the soup left no impressions. I personally ordered, the chicken teriyaki bowl, and the rice was so overly cooked, I thought I was eating congee. There was only 4 very small pieces of meat on top of the rice, with 2 broccoli pieces. Some of us had ask for the chili flakes for the ramen, and after a twenty minute wait, we just gave up, (even after reminding them several times). Safe goes to say, we went over to Mcdonalds for another meal."}
{"text":"Decided to try this after seeing some good reviews. This place is spacious. Great for family with kids and even strollers. They could have easily fit more tables here especially in front of the counter. I guess they just kept the same layout from the previous restaurant. The seating is really limited. I only come during off peak hours. The staff were friendly and kind. We ordered the Gyudon with egg and scallions, chicken katsu, and fried Octopus. The Gyudon was perfectly made. It's tasty. I know some people mentioned is too wet or even like Chinese congee. They are over exaggerating and they don't know anything about  Japanese don.  This is how they are suppose to be. This is not Chinese rice. The chicken katsu is fried nicely and not oily at all. The fried octopus is not as good as the other food. It was too oily and not crispy at all. Not recommended. I took a point off because the portion is kind of small. Good enough for ladies. But for me I was still hungry after the meal and an appetizer."}
{"text":"You order at the counter, and they bring the food to your table. There is not a lot of seating though. But you have the option for take out. 

The menu is mainly Don (rice) and Ramen (noodles). We did not try the ramen today. Add $2 for a combo of miso soup and salad, or for a drink and salad. There were several choices for salads. 

The kids menu size was decent. Good thing we asked to have the curry on the side, as it was too spicy for my kid who doesn't tolerate any heat. It tastes like the medium-hot S&B golden curry.

The regular rice dishes was good, but portions are a little small for North American standards. (Probably a good thing to help with portion control.) Teriyaki chicken and Pork Katsu were decent quality and met expectations. Gyu Don was good, but I thought it had a little too much sauce that soaked the rice.

The miso soup was good, not too salty and had a few good sized pieces of tofu and seaweed. The vegetable salad was like a plain cabbage slaw with a sweet mayo based dressing. It actually came with the pork katsu, so it's good we didn't order an extra of that."}
{"text":"Love the modern, clean, fast food cafe style atmosphere here.  The ramen, rice dishes are pretty good.  Service is fast and friendly, no line up.  Not a huge selection but what it does have is presented very well.  Lots of parking.  Worth visiting if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This spot is a new spot that opened up in Richmond Hill. It's a Japanese fast food kind of experience where you order and pick up your food/have it brought to your table. After eating, you return the tray to the front. 

The Chicken Curry Katsu Don was really tasty! However my order's curry was warm and not as hot as I expected it to be. My friend's order didn't have this problem though. Some may think the portion sizes are too small, but it was enough for me. 

Overall presentation was nice. I will definitely come again to try their Gyu Don. The price is decent for what you get."}
{"text":"We had their gyu don and miso ramen. The gyu don was just ok, and the ramen: if instant noodles taste better than it, which it does, then there really is no point to this dish. For the small portions, unexceptional taste, and cafeteria style restaurant, it was not worth the money. It seems like a bad move for them to be located next to what I believe to be a really tough competition, Magic Noodles."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. The food are better than average albeit a tad too salty, pricing is more than acceptable and the service is amazing. Making it better, the restaurant is not blaring its music. Background music was in the background so people can have conversation without the need to scream at each other. 

Definitely will come again very soon!

Added: well, less than 24 hours later, here I am again!!!"}
{"text":"There is NO DIRECTION; poorly executed Japanese fast comfort food experience.

*note for eat-in: the idea is to order at the cashier, sit down with your receipt which has an order number, and someone will walk down the aisle and call your number, then you get your food, eat, and leave

The layout is indecisive between restaurant and food court, and doesn't make use of an otherwise plentiful space. 
Only half the restaurant is dedicated to seating. Small (tiny) dining booths line the sides of the restaurant and a small portion is packed tightly with 3 tables to seat 6 each (if you're sitting on the inside and someone sits behind you and beside you, ur not getting out lol).
The other half is dedicated to a cashier counter where you place your orders. 
The eat-in and take-out menus are the same, but are designed in a way to make everything look unappetizing.
The service is questionable. My first cashier was an elder woman which spoke Cantonese right off the bat, it honestly surprised me as I was looking for a Japanese experience. My second cashier was a teenager, who spoke politely and took great attention to my order and requests. When my order arrived however, there was no how she knew which of my family members ordered what, and with such small tables, there were lots of confusion.

My family ordered the gyudon, tofu mushroom don, shoyu ramen with pork belly, and miso ramen with pork belly. We also added sides of their gyoza, green salad, potato salad, and fried squid tentacles. 
The ramens are too salty. I was very disappointed as they advertise a homemade chicken broth and that was severely overpowered by salt. The cook on the pork belly was fair, but didn't wow me at all.
The tofu mushroom don was bland. The tofu has a nice cook, but doesn't have the power to cover the mess in the rest of the bowl. 
I had the potato salad which I'm not a fan of. The gyoza almost seem packaged and fried. The tentacles are not good at all. The breading is light and soggy, falling apart from a chewy tentacle. 
*note: pop is available for re-fill

The gyudon is great on the contrary. It's actually quite close to authentic Japanese gyudon! n.n

Portions are small. Prices seem fair, but for the mediocre food, even for food court food, just no. They need to seriously rethink their business management and quality of food. :("}
{"text":"Great beef bowl and ramen place. Perhaps the first in the GTA, so nice to see a Japanese restaurant that offers something other than poor sushi and frozen fish labelled as \"sashimi\". The beef bowl tastes authentic and the ramen was also great. They just opened so there are not that many customers thus the service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend to people who seek comfort food straight from Japan in the GTA area."}
