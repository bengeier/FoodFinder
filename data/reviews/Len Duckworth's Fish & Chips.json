{"text":"Good haddock, nicely crisp batter, but not the best around. Portions are impressively large. Fries are thickly-cut and quite moist.

The place is full of people who look like they've been eating here for decades, and Duckworth's doesn't look like its changed much in that time. Service is brisk, but friendly enough."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips here at awesome prices. The halibut is extremely good. Like eating a AAA steak, battered...can't wait to have it again. Ambience is so so but the food is what you come for !"}
{"text":"Ok folks.  I've started writing reviews because after reading them for years and trying places I can't stand people not knowing the real deal.

This place is good.  The fish is fresh, the batter is light (ish), the fries are hand cut (with some skin), and the oil used to cook tastes fresh.

When you walk in it looks like a bit of a dump, but the food is great.  This is authentic, fresh, fish and chips.  So yes it's a bit greasy, but I'm lost as to what more (or less) you'd want from a fish and chip place.

This is a 4/5 for what it is.  Straight forward fish and chips (the seafood combo is awesome).  I've eaten at Guy Savoys restaurant in Paris - where they had a bread sommelier(!) - does this compare to that?  No, but for fish and chips, I haven't don't much better than this place in the T dot."}
{"text":"Great value and food! They do a good special on a Tuesday! The service is excellent too."}
{"text":"Good fish and chips. Good specials during the week amazing service. Just need better ventilation in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Located close to main street station, my friend and I stopped by on a chilly Thursday last week. The initial restaurant we wanted to go to wasn't open that day so we stumbled upon Len's! Had a very casual, old school diner look to it and all booths! Yay for comfy seating! The place looked very clean and our server was very nice. My friend and I both got the famous halibut and chips ($12.50) which took about 15 mins or so to prepare. It's all fried fresh to order and you can even watch him cook it! A couple of people strolled in for takeout and another for dine in - it's quite obvious that majority of their customers are regulars which made us feel like one too.

The fish is coated in a light batter that stays nice and crisp without being too greasy. The chips on the other hand were kind of a miss for me but I still really enjoyed them. They're thick cut so the texture was similar to a boiled potato with a slight crunch on the outside but im sure you could ask for them to be fried longer. What about the tartar? my friend and I basically demolished their house tartar sauce, lacking a bit of pickles but still so delicious!!

Overall, very old school and cozy atmosphere, friendly servers and yummy food. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the neighbourhood craving some fried goodness. Be sure to check out their daily specials as well!"}
{"text":"I can definitely recommend this place.

I'm from Scotland, so I've eaten a reasonable amount of \"chippy\" style fish and chips, both good and bad. It's been a while though, and the first attempt I sampled after a year of travelling was the dirt they serve at British Style Fish & Chips off Coxwell. This was waaaay better and damn close to the real thing.

I ordered the halibut and chips with bread and butter and it was all excellent, reasonably generous portion too. Grease factor was medium, which is pretty much how it should be. Delivery was prompt. The lady on the phone was friendly. The tartare sauce was ehhh, but no big deal. I'll definitely order again in future."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good Fish & Chip places. Len Duckworth's is one of the best in Toronto. Been here about 10 times in the past few months for takeout and it is always good, halibut, cod, sole. $10 for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips, been coming here since I was 7 had always been great. Nice little spot for a quick lunch. Fish is always fresh, extremely tasty and cooked to perfection. Highly recommend this place for fish and chip lovers !"}
{"text":"UPDATE: They have now increased the price of Hailbut & Chips to $12.50, Haddock & Chips to $9.50, Gravy to $1.50, and less fries are given. The filets have also become smaller, probably because they serve many seniors in the community and they can get away with smaller portions. It still tastes great, but I can't in good conscience give this 5 stars anymore because fish 'n chips is supposed to have a status of slightly-above-fast-food. For the reduced amount of food you get, I now consider eating here a luxury."}
{"text":"I had the famous premium west coast halibut and fresh cut fries. The fish was lightly battered and crispy with a delicious fish flavour on the inside.  The fries were nice and thick. 

The interior has a nice and unassuming charm to it. The mounted fish are a fun touch.

The staff were friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about 7 years now. It is one of my two favourite fish & chip places in the city!! The food is always fresh and hot. The bread and butter is a fave as well, the bread is so fresh and the thick slices make you feel spoiled. The fries I like a little well done and you can ask for some scraps.. which are the bits of batter left in the fryer from the fish cooking.. yum!!! 

The staff are always friendly and personable. If you go often enough they start to remember your order!! ha!! The prices are very reasonable. The dining area is very clean. 

I'm not a huge fish fan but I go every couple of months to satisfy my halibut craving!! :0)"}
{"text":"Halibut!! Hot and delicious everytime  we come every few months to enjoy the fish and we also love thier coleslaw.  That's it   its all about the fish and it is tasty!"}
{"text":"When a local joint like Duckworth's has shown that it has the bollocks to withstand the test of father time in the cutthroat world of fish & chips, one would think that mere longevity would be a testament to greatness.  Unfortunately when it comes to Duckworth's, one would sadly be mistaken.

We recently stopped to grab a quick dinner here and there are many positives.  The service was speedy and friendly, and as others have noted seating is abundant, ( we were fortunate enough to grab a window seat), and the interior, although definitely falling under the \"no frills\" style of decor is decidedly clean.

However I found the Halibut to be a bit on the greasy side, our fries were cold and the greatest travesty of all....they don't make their own tartar sauce.  For a place that exclusively caters to the fish n chip set this is simply unjustifiable.  I was forced to  subject my greasy Halibut to a gelatinous glop of unrecognizable origin that I had to force with conviction out of a sticky packet.  I know, I know, a first world problem to be sure.  To many I may be coming off as the greatest of fish n chip snobs, however I am not a pretentious foodie, simply someone that likes to see something done to the best of ones capabilities, and in my humble opinion Duckworth's fell short.  Especially considering that it has been around since the depression.

I do owe it another shot and will be back.  Maybe I'll bring my own tartar."}
{"text":"After 100 years in business, Len Duckworth is still putting out stellar fried fish. I thought the chips were sub-par, but the cole slaw was lovely. I'm going to come back, break into the store room, and steal the recipe so I could learn how they make their breading so good. Don't tell Len, and I'll get you a copy of the family secrets..."}
{"text":"Called Sat.; they said they were closed for delivery. Said the next day they were open for delivery was Monday. I just called. They said no delivery except Wed. to Fri. I don't care how good they claim to be,  there are other fish and chip joints that are reliable such as Olde Yorke. The last time I ate at Duckworth's it  was 10 years ago and it was meh anyway (too greasy and tables were sticky)."}
{"text":"Thirty years ago this was a great fish and chip shop.  Times have definitely changed.  The halibut is crispy, but very small portion and greasy, as are the fries.  If you like eating a box of crispy grease, this will rock your world.  Funny as hell is the sign saying \"eat fish, live longer\".  If there was a decent piece of fish in the box and less grease, maybe that would be true!

Pricing is messed.  Every item is an individual order. $2.00 for a tiny dollop of average coleslaw?  Interesting that the space occupied by fish if ordered with fries doesn't have pricing adjusted to account for the smaller portion of fries.  Very curious as to the significantly higher pricing for take-away, particularly the Seafood Platter at $2.35 more just to not eat there; it seems rather backwards.  Would it not be more costly to occupy seating having the meal there, and use their dishes with service provided by wait staff?  The take-away price is very prohibitive to picking up a meal here, which is significant to whether I'm having their food or someone else's.  Major price gouging at every turn and they look at you like they just don't care.  Why should they?  They're making a fortune based on a former business reputation that no longer holds true."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Len's. Had the seafood platter, enjoyed it very much. Shrimp, scallops, and halibut were very tasty and fresh, nice crispy batter, fries were large cut and delicious. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is the best fish and chips in Toronto bar none. It is never too greasy and always done to perfection.
I like the fact that they don't try to pawn off pollock, in fact they don't even have it! The standard fish is fresh, yes you heard it here folks, fresh halibut.  I also like the haddock.
The chips are not those thin prissy things. But proper thick cut.
All in all a favourite for someone like me who is new to Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here with high hopes after reading some reviews but the fries were soggy, the halibut was fresh but the batter was lacking flavour and they did not give us a lemon wedge for our fish and chips. I have NEVER gone to a fish and chips place and had to ask for lemon; they go hand in hand. I looked over at other people's plates and they did not have lemon wedges on their plate either. To top it all off, we ordered a slice of blueberry pie and we were given a slice of limp, lousy store-bought pie. The meal was mediocre overall, and we don't get what the fuss is all about. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, and I got the standard fish and chips.
The interior was not very clean, and the service was inexperienced, though very nice. 
The fish was your typical haddock, battered and friend nicely, overall fairly good, even better with some lemon and tartar sauce. The chips were not as good; they were greasy, seemed slightly soggy, and were entirely non-absorbent. They did not soak in any of the vinegar, which makes them somewhat pointless. 
The location is very convenient: a couple minute's walk from Main Street station."}
{"text":"Pricing was about standard but the family and home feel was what made it. Everybody was kind and personable. I had the Halibut and enjoyed it very much. Crispy and the quallity was amazing. I guess the only thing I have to say is that maybe provide us with a larger plate for the large portions you generously give. Glad to eat at this restaurant as I learned it's been around for awhile and got to taste food at a restaurant that is as old as I am. Yum"}
{"text":"Meh. Overrated Fish and chip joint. FIsh was fresh but the batter was  super weak and no lemon wedge. The fries are soggy and gross. Pie was total crap. I saw waitress take in out of the fridge from plastic store bought container. They are to too lazy to make their own pie. Never going back ever."}
{"text":"Best Halibut and Chips I've ever had in my life. Not too greasy, great chips, just right! I try to go on Mondays with my mom, when Halibut is on special."}
{"text":"The bestest Yorkshire fish & chips this side of the pond  A gem of a place on the Danforth . Fish is scrumptious and the staff are always welcoming. A go to at least once in 2 weeks"}
{"text":"The food quality is good, I love the atmosphere in there. It's old fashioned but moderated to today's tech. Service is fairly quick."}
{"text":"amazing seafood!!! By far my favourite place to go to in Toronto. 

Going to being the parents here next time they visit"}
{"text":"I love their fish! The batter is not to thick and it's very crispy. The halibut is fresh and not frozen (although it's a bit more expensive it worth it). I go there as much as I can. The only thing I would change is to include a salad in their menu :-)"}
{"text":"Service here wasn't great. I always find it weird when you're friendly to the staff and say \"thanks, that was a really nice meal\" and they look at you like a piece of crap and say nothing, especially after you've just left them a nice tip too.  Anyyyywayy...

Food was nice. Portions of chips are pretty small if we are comparing it to an authentic British chippy. But still a good meal."}
{"text":"good fish and chips but certainly not the amazing delight that I was expecting due to the flamboyant reviews I have received from word of mouth. I trekked very far to main station to experience the \"best fish and chips I'll ever have\" and I am critically disappointed. The waiter forgot our drinks (a coke and iced tea, not that hard) which I don't understand seeing as they had about a 1-1 staff ratio for the other people in there. I ordered the halibut and chips (or maybe it was haddock, whatever, its all fish) as did my friend. We found our meal to be good, but not even close to the godly praise that it was given by several people whom I thought had good taste. Such godly praise is deserved by deep-blue fish and chips, who seem to have disappeared off the face of the earth (RIP). I would rank the food here good-average, its not bad but its certainly not above and beyond. I think I slightly preferred the fish and chips at the old nick pub on the danforth due to them serving it with tartar sauce, other than this they would be about the same in quality.

so unless you live nearby I would recommend just going to the nearest pub or other fish and chips place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fish and chips I've ever had. Store is a bit dated but it's clean and charming, and besides it's about the food"}
{"text":"This place is an institution. I came here for years and years. The food is still amazing after 20yrs and you can't beat the proximity to the subway. The haddock is great and for those who don't have a lot of dough, get some chips with some malt vinegar and salt. Oh my.  Great shop."}
{"text":"I ordered the haddock and chips.  The haddock was lightly battered, crispy, and tasted delicious.  I especially like their chips! The chips are super thick and good!  Even though my take out box was covered in oil, I really enjoyed fh"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fish and chip places but I thought I would give it a try since the high reviews and that it was close to a pet store that sold aquatic pets. So I though I would make an afternoon out of this. Sadly, I must mental note to trust my gut and never try stuff that I'm not a fan of. I got the halibut with fries. The fish was covered in a thick flour batter which was expected but I find this takes away the original flavor of the fish. The fries were meh and I think I would rather have Mc Donald's fries even though I go to Mc D's once in a blue moon. And I think the bill came close to $20 after tax and tips which I found a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Really tasty fish (halibut) and chips. My wife and I have been here a couple of times, once for eat-in and once for takeout. Decor is nothing special - open kitchen style, with few decorations - but the fish is perfectly done, and although not the hugest piece I've ever seen, is one of the tastiest ever. Will definitely return over and over."}
{"text":"Best one in the neighbourhood. Crispy not oily. One of the best fries and fish of course. It's my go to place. A little pricey but I don't mind paying for good food though they have daily specials. But still would go any day. Service excellent and very friendly never a bad experience. Honestly just writing this review makes me feel like ordering fish and chips."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fish and chips, and every time I have to drop off my car at the Canadian Tire down the street, I come here for a bite. 

It's a little greasy, as to be expected, and it's not totally cosy, but it's hot and fresh and tasty and salty. I usually get the halibut. 

Not overly friendly service, but polite and fast, so can't ask for more than that. The seating isn't too cosy or warm, it's a little cold, but you're eating and leaving."}
{"text":"This place makes good fish and chips. My standard order is haddock and chips and the portion is filling. The fish is done just right with a crispy batter and moist on the inside. The chips are thick cut and feel a bit on the greasy side but at least they are not dry. Good value for your dollar.

The interior has booth style seating and looks super old. Service is usually prompt and they are polite. Definitely not the place to take your date but definitely a place to get your fish and chips fix."}
{"text":"I have lived in the general area to this location (off Dawes Road) for months now and although I passed this place often, my main issue with fish and chip spots is that the food tends to be over fried, sinks in the stomach like a rock after. So this past weekend I had a major hankering for fish and figured I would give the place the benefit of the doubt, it the stuff came out greasy enough to sort Fonzie's hair, I'd write this place off. Well, I am extremely pleased to report the place knows their frying, the seafood platter I had which consisted of scallops, shrimps and a nice piece of halibut was lightly done, not overly greasy and the fish was very soft, no grease had made it mushy. Nothing of the sort, the piece of blueberry pie that I had for desert was a knockout, again done perfectly. Took a menu home to order in and glad this place is so close."}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

VIBE 
I haven't been to the restaurant. It's always delivery (mainly because it's on Main Street).

I ATE
Halibut and Chips. Moist, flaky with a good crispy exterior. The one piece isn't enough. A second piece will satisfy you if you're super hungry. They give you way too many chips. The chips are ok. I can only eat half the box. I find them a bit flavourless but that's what salt and malt vinegar are for. 

Other notes: if you get a large order, you'll get coleslaw (looks okay...didn't have any) and randomly, buttered bread. I was a bit skeptical about the bread but once I had it, it was so fresh! It kind of feels old fashioned to get something like that and though its weird, I kind of like it. 
The gravy is thick and salty but only great when super hot. It can get cold fast so get it while it is hot! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Definitely worth the duckface. Perfect for a rainy night in."}
{"text":"My mother would eat here every sunday from the age of 11, and the halibut and fries from Duckworth's was akin to mothers milk for myself and my 2 sisters.  I go here often still, and the place hasn't changed a bit!!  Even the lady at the counter has been there as long as I can remember (and still wears her make-up exactly the same LOL)!!
The fish is always crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, though, I wouldn't eat here if you have cholesterol issues.  It's artery-clogging goodness!
I'll always come back to Ducky's, as my family calls it, and my children have been raised on their food as well, starting a 4th generation off right :)
Eat in and have the bread and butter.  It's always been a favourite with us :)"}
{"text":"Fish & chips. That's what you go for. That's what's good. Of course the slaw ain't bad either."}
{"text":"So I moved into the area last summer, I had passed by it multiple times and kinda guessed it was your typical place for seniors. boy was I wrong yesterday I popped in on a whim and decided to try the food, I ordered the special of fish and chips I got the cod while I got my boyfriend the Halibut (he used to work at a fish n chips place so i figured if he didn't like it we ain't gonna order again) well I can say, small area, really friendly knowledgeable staff, I was greeted warmly and they answered all and any questions I had. I also made a note of how many awards they had won, I figure if you've been in business for as long as they have in the same location and have a MULTITUDE  of awards. you're doing something right. so onto the food. the cod was delicious battered and cooked just right, as was the halibut. the chips were amazing too, my one MINOR complaint is that they didn't seem to salt the fires. however the fist fulls of vinegar and tartar sauce they gave me more than made up for it. I have missed a good fish n chips place since where i used to go with my family had closed down and a lot of others just aren't that good. However friendly knowledgeable staff, greeted at the door, fast service, great food? hell yeah I'm going back! plus close by Main Street subway station and usually packed during the lunch rush. Good sirs, I salute you! I don't know if you read these or not, but whatever you're doing, keep it up! and don't stop!"}
{"text":"Food 5/5 great fresh. Crisp. Self made refrigerated tartar sauce

Price 5/5 portion under $10

Service 5/5 great family

Location 4/5 near central road. Subway. Street parking

Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago, mainly because I'd heard that this was some of the best fish and chips you could get in Toronto. When I saw the \"People love us on Yelp!\" sticker on the window, it filled me with even more hope. However, when I walked in, all that hope basically shattered.

Despite an attractive exterior, Duckworth's interior is not exactly pretty to look at. The walls are painted a plain white, with a piece of dull artwork here and there. The air conditioning was blasting, and I ended up having to switch tables just to get out of the path of its frigid wind. The whole atmosphere was really not my cup of tea.

But wait! Don't go away just yet. There is positivity on the horizon.

I had the haddock and chips, which were actually great. I really shouldn't have been surprised, but I was. After tasting the fish, I understood where the good reviews were coming from. This fish was so good, it didn't even need any vinegar. Seriously.

Duckworth's is far from being a fancy joint. However, if you're looking for good fish and chips, it's worth a chance."}
