{"text":"Great decor, food and service. The two waitresses assisting my table were incredibly sweet. The ginger beef, chow mien, fried rice and spring rolls were delicious and a great value for a table of four. The restaurant was also very well organized and clean, with a peaceful setting."}
{"text":"Good freshly made typical chinese buffett style fare. Not family or twin baby friendly. I did not sight one high chair. Better to pick up and dine at home"}

*schezwan noodles
*sweet and sour pork
*green bean special
*dumplings (also great and crispy ;) )

{"text":"This is a gem in Marda Loop. We ordered there a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and it was delicious. Our food was ready for pickup within 15 minutes, and was steaming hot and fresh. The ginger beef was crunchy and had just the right amount of sauce. The rice was tender, noodles fresh! Honestly sooo good. My only complaint was that I tried to order there again about a week ago and they didn't answer both times I called. This is some of the best chinese I've had in awhile :)"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.  I have been going to this restaurant for 20+ years.   If you want great Chinese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Lunch Buffet after 1pm...1 star.

WARNING...do NOT come here after 1pm!  The food is just simply awful.  The only edible items were the stir-fried vegetables and noodles.  Everything else was just rock hard and stale.

I've ordered take out here many times and the food has been pretty decent...being the only Chinese restaurant in the area, I would consider it a blessing.  It's average at best, but it's better than nothing.  There are a lot of hits and misses, but with such an extensive menu you'll likely find plenty of dishes to enjoy.  Having never tried their lunch buffet, I thought I'd I give it a go.  And for only $9.40 including GST, it's hard to beat.  But man, was I sorely disappointed!  This is by far the smallest buffet I've ever seen.  The whole food area is smaller than my office desk!  There are 9 food trays the size of those you'd find in a gelato ice cream shop, and the food stand is no bigger than a hot dog push cart.  Next to the food stand is a table for plates, soup bowls (but I didn't see any soup) and sauce trays, as well as, about 3 different kinds of dipping sauces.  I guess in this case, you really do get what you pay for.  But despite the limited number of items, they all looked quite appetizing (except for the stir-fried noodles, which is as plain as it gets being simply cooked in soy sauce...not much different from your typical Chinese food court offering).  Then again, now a days, Chinese food courts have come a long way and are really just as good as your average Chinese restaurant.  Anyway, in addition to the stir-fried noodles, there was sweet and sour pork, egg rolls, deep fried wings and spare ribs, fried rice, salt and pepper calamari, stir-fried vegetables and fried pot stickers.  There's another dish but I can't seem to remember it.  Everything tasted as it should; even the calamari was surprisingly top notch in flavor.  But the real let down was how hard all the protein items had become.  I don't know if it was the time I came to dine or the warming lamps, or both, but the calamari and spare ribs had the consistency of cardboard.  Even the sweet and sour sauce couldn't save the pork.  This was quite sad cause they were all seasoned well.  I hate returning to the scene of the crime, but I feel I must prove my theory correct and put the blame on my ill timed lunch visit.  True, there's no excuse for leaving out stale food but this IS a buffet, after all, and not fine dining...so buyer beware. 

I shall return tomorrow promptly at 11am and then update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I ordered Wonton soup, moo shu pork and singapore noodles.  I would compare it to mall food...maybe worse. The owner greeted me at the door, she is so hyper you feel rushed.  It's not a comfortable welcoming.  The wonton soup was the worst I've had in Calgary; a bouillon cube broth with ok wontons and a handful of peas thrown in - really disappointing. The singapore noodle was a heap of rice noodles tossed with too much curry powder and not blended enough so it was powdery and dry with not enough veggies. The Moo shu pork was a nice assortment of veggies but the pork tasted funny and was mixed in a sticky salty sauce - commercially prepared .  I make better chinese food at home.  Nothing seemed homemade and there is no love in this food. But you get what you pay for as prices are not high.  I'd rather pay more for a bit of quality."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst Chinese restaurant in Cleveland . The restaurant is located in an old McDonald's building barely fitted for a sit down restaurant.  

I ordered an egg roll - it was average - mustard and ketchup containers used for hot mustard and sweet and sour - cute. 

I ordered walnut chicken - a \"new\" menu item - it was horrible. I was expecting something fast fried in a brown sauce and stir fried with honey walnuts. What I received was a pile of \"white\" fried chicken with a flavorless sauce and some walnuts thrown in. It tasted like cornstarch -the sauce had absolutely no flavor - I would have added soy sauce, but I don't need the extra sodium and there might not have been enough in the restaurant to spice it up.   

The service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that I couldn't bring myself to complain about the food.  I simply asked for a carryout container, boxed it up, and threw it out at my hotel.  

It was really cheap though - $15.00 for entree and egg roll.  I was on my expense account, so it didn't bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night.  

But do yourself a favor - this place is not good.  Ignore the internet reviews.  I can't believe that anything here has any flavor...."}
{"text":"Not trying to rain on anyone's parade. There just aren't any choices here if you're vegetarian or vegan. Well. There's one. And you have to ask for no pork. And then the little guy (who was VERY nice by the way) asked if I ate no meat and when I said yes he said \"I'll ask them to cook it in water because there is beef in the broth.\" ?? Okay. The sauce was super salty, not spicy like on the menu, and the tofu was very slimy. Anyway, it wasn't great. But I ate it."}
{"text":"That's for the food, but a 4star for its cleanliness, good service and high end furniture!  Looks like walking into the emperor's palace with its redwood, nicely carved tables & chairs...is def pricey.  

A handful of tables, even offer a lunch buffet for $8.95 fr 11am - 2pm.

Parking can be tight during busy hours but just hate that ramp entering/leaving, not for those low sports cars, i scraped my rental car front bumper...

asked for their specialty dish, and beef broccoli was ok, pretty good value, enough for 2 meals."}

{"text":"Just some pretty darn good Chinese food. Staff is super nice and food was really good. Huge portions for leftovers!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food we have ever had.   

We ordered some ginger beef.  It was a disaster.  Ginger beef being a Calgary creation should be a success in all Calgary restaurants This place actually managed to mess it up.  It was overly hard, full of sauce, and missing the beef.   

We had other dishes as well.  We left our food on the table, unfortunately we just couldn't take another bite.  The pork had the \"Freezer burn taste\", and the veggies were overly cooked.  The staff were talking loud as well.   They were sitting at a table conversing, and just made it hard to \"Think\".  

We did not enjoy this place at all.  For a nice neighborhood and being the only Chinese restaurant in the area we expected more."}
