{"text":"Great new food and drink menu! They recently started Bingo nights on Wednesday's and it's a really fun time! Good atmosphere, great service!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Only one person working the bar and tables.
Ordered a long island tea, terrible premix solution. 
My wife order a glass of wine and it had a viniger taste, bad wine, you can buy this at the grocery store.
Beer was good.
Did noy eat there so I can't say anything about the food.
Overall it was not a good place to have drinks."}
{"text":"This Is Not Just Your Average Run Of The Mill Pittsburgh  bar, This IS The Place To Be!!  Not Only Do They Have Amazing Bar Tenders With A Large Variety Of Beers, But There Food Is Amazing!  There AM Burger Is Mouthwatering, There Wings Are Cooked Fresh Daily, And They Have Specials Every Day Of The Week!! You Really Need To Make It A Point To Check This Place Out If You Haven't Already.  The Atmosphere Is Great, People Are Fun, And The Food Is Amazing.  5+ Stars!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with a wonderful staff. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good quality beers and casual food. You may not want to takes girl here for dinner, they have bands on the weekends sometimes. Another review mentioned plastic glasses, I was happy to find that the beer is served in glass and very cold."}
{"text":"I don't know why they bothered trying to make another location because they can't keep up service for anything. Waited an hour and a half for food that the server gave to the wrong table. Ended up leaving because it wasn't worth another thirty to forty five minute wait for them to fix it. Saturdays are busy days, thats why you staff up and put people behind the bar that know how to make drinks. It really isn't a hard concept. I never came to this location before and now I see why. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Stabbings, Fights, and bad customer service. They messed up my check, and tried to overcharge me. Then the manager gave me a hard time about them messing up my check. This place lost my business-- period"}
{"text":"This place went downhill fast compared to when they opened. Mixed drinks are never made right. Food is faster than other places."}
{"text":"The food is great!! But the service stinks!! Everything is slow we ordered drinks and was waiting 20 minutes for them we had to ask twice for our drinks they take their good old time getting your check too...use to love going here but now I'm gonna find a different bar to go to"}
{"text":"Better then I was expecting. Stopped by last night for some drinks and a bit of food. I sat at the bar and felt welcomed by the bartenders. Both were very friendly and never made me feel rushed. This is a great place to just come and chill with a cold drink. The tap selection is ok. Nothing really unique but they do have a bit of a seasonal selection. The bottle selection looked a bit more extensive. I ordered a gyro because I'm still on my gyro kick and while it was delish I wish the tzatziki was a bit creamier. The flavor was still there though. The fries were fresh and crispy. I'm looking forward to my next visit and hoping the food is just as fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening, and it was moderately busy but not overly crowded and we got a table right away.    Our server came over within 5 minutes and greeted us and got drinks.   She was pleasant and got our food and drinks quickly.   She checked on us a couple times during our meal and got refills quickly.   The portions are really good, and their burgers are huge!  You can double a half pound burger to a full pound for only $3 more (the menu says $2 but the bill says $3).    My son wolfed it down and thankfully it was well cooked.   The taco bites are also better than expected, and the salads are huge.   We would return and plan to.

{"text":"I hate this bar. I only go there if my friends make me. Everytime I go there a fight breaks out and I almost get hit by a 200 lb man when I'm a 100 lb woman. I don't think the place is safe."}
{"text":"Great place to eat; fish sandwich is delicious! Drink  specials everyday. Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was back in Pittsburgh visiting the \"extended folks\".  My parents are in upstate New York, but just about everyone else is in the Pittsburgh area.  So I've lived in rural New York state, various places in Maryland, and just outside Los Angeles.  None of which are big Steelers TV markets.  So I've grown accustomed to watching the Stillers at a bar.  

The weekend I was home in Pittsburgh was no different.  I wanted to head to a bar to watch the game....  so that should give you an idea of how I look at bars for watching football.  I'm use to bars packed with Steelers fans.

So with that... this is a pretty standard sports bar.  It's got a lot of room so I'm sure if they have something big going on, they could accommodate everyone.  But the Sunday afternoon that I was there was uninspiring.  There was plenty of parking for more than just those watching the game.  

The place wasn't empty, most of the bar stools were taken, but I think there were only two people other than the bartenders who weren't sitting at the bar.

I can't say I disliked this place.  They had a good beer selection and the Gyro Burger that I was delicious.  but it just didn't inspire me to want to return.  So I think the A-OK Yelp rating is about right."}
{"text":"Passing through West Mifflin on our way home, I did a Google for \"Wing Night Pittsburgh\" on a Tuesday night, because we were half-starved and were in the mood for wings.  It just so happened that our route home would take us up Route 885, and right past a place we had never visited called \"Mulligan's.\"  As a less-than-impressive golfer of many years, and as a man of Irish heritage, I could appreciate the name, so it FELT RIGHT.  We decided to try it.

It was a hockey night in Pittsburgh, and there was a good crowd.  The first thing that struck me was that this place could get loud.  Open metal rafters and a highly reflective metal ceiling above.  Put some sound dampening material up there, please.  The second thing that struck me was, \"Hey, they've got 18 taps... There is bound to be something good!\"  Sure enough, we were treated to a cold glass of Troeg's Nugget Nectar and a Lagunitas IPA.  There were other interesting taps as well, and of course, the Irish standards, Harp and Guinness.  The third thing I noticed was the restroom, since I had just been on the road for three hours.  It was clean, with foam soap and automated paper towels.  I appreciate those kinds of amenities in a new place.

We wasted no time ordering some wings, and the price was perfect.  50 cents for a whole jumbo chicken wing.  When the wings came out, we were very happy, because they were indeed jumbo wings, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned (we got the Cajun dry with some hot sauce on the side) and they came out of the kitchen very quickly.  The hot sauce was a bit on the mild side for my taste, diluted with butter, but had some other spices mixed in that made it very interesting and enjoyable.  We also got a basket of fries, and they were excellent.  I believe the method used was the \"dipping in corn starch\" method, which produces extra crispy and delicious fries.  They were not fresh cut, but they were excellent!  The blue cheese was quite good too.

We plowed through our wings, celery and fries and were entertained by three consecutive Penguins goals in the third period for a come-from-behind victory.  The crowd was very enthusiastic, and an extremely loud boat horn sounded on each goal, adding to the crowd's excitement.  Our bartender was very pleasant, attentive, and friendly.  (on the check, it said that our server's name was Laura.)  Everybody in the place seemed like they were enjoying themselves as much as we were, too.

In short, we've discovered a great new place to have wings and good beer on a Tuesday night, and couldn't be happier about it.  I would not hesitate to stop in there again on a Tuesday, and the rest of the menu looked like my kind of sports bar fare, as well.  If you're not sure where this place is, it is located right next the the Get-Go on Lebanon Road.  From my one experience, you won't regret stopping in for a beer and some wings!"}
{"text":"We went here to grab a drink and some wings. I had high expectations and was very disappointed. The cool thing about their wings is they are huge. I got the dry ranch rub and it was so bad. There was barely any rub on the wings. I had to ask for hot sauce to help the flavor a bit (or lack there of) it felt like I was eating a dry crispy flavorless wing that just got done baking. My bf got Cajun BBQ and he liked them but when I tried it, I could care less for it. I wouldn't eat the wings again because they were that bad. However, their cheese balls were on point. I did like the atmosphere though. I'd come back to just drink and maybe eat some cheese balls."}
{"text":"One visit on a band night.

Mulligan's has a great layout; ample tables and chairs, large horseshoe bar.  There was nothing on the food venue that we were interested in; they had several decent IPA beers in bottle but a very short draft list.  Mulligan's is another sports bar... and it could be much more.  The issue is the chaotic service -- at least 3 people were working our table of 2 ... very difficult to have continuity of service this way.  Everyone was pleasant enough.  We ordered the chips as an appetizer -- chips from a bag with a very tiny dip.  And the chips were stale.   Not even warmed.  Sigh.  

Not sure when we will return as this was a one time visit to see a particular band -- a good thing having live music of course.

f8 and be there."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but this place has gone way downhill. The service is ridiculously slow even on a normal night. The last few times that I was here with friends, we had to wait at least 20 minutes after our glasses were empty for the waitress to ask if we wanted more drinks. Sometimes we even had to ask for our drinks twice. The food is mediocre and I'm pretty sure the portions are smaller now."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place.  There were tons of tvs and projections for games, which was nice, and maybe if you go on a Wednesday night or something, you can have some luck, but I won't be going back.  First they charged a cover for us to get in, there was a band playing, whatever, it happens.  Then the place was so crowded that we ended up sharing a 4-person table with another couple.  We waited 20 minutes without being seen by a waitress--a girl walked by selling shots and I asked about a waitress.  She told me she was not a waitress but would send someone over soon.  20 minutes after that, we finally flagged down a waitress.  We ordered a dozen wings, fries, and two beers.  The other couple also wanted more beers.  We got our beers quickly, but the waitress wanted immediate payment, so we gave her a credit card and she never returned it (we said we did not want an open tab).  About 30 minutes later, we finally got our food, which was cold but at this point we were so hungry and knew that we'd never eat if we send it back.  Would have been really good if it was at least warm.  Our original waitress never came back, so we eventually asked another waitress if she could find our card and close our order, and gave her our receipt.  She came back 10 minutes later to confirm our card, but then we didn't see our card again for another 30 minutes.  Just overall awful customer service."}
{"text":"Good service and the Santa fe burger was better than I expected. I had a family of 8 and all our meals were prepared well. The server did well also. Never seems too busy so seating isn't a problem. I'll come again for sure!"}
