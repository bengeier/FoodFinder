{"text":"The food was incredible. The service was great and the restaurant manager even gave us complimentary dessert. The chicken entree was cooked to perfection. It was a great experience and probably the best food I've had in the area."}
{"text":"They make a great Whiskey Sour here.  Probably the best I've ever had.  Food quality is good.  It's so convenient to have dinner and then attend a concert under one roof.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Made a reservation in advance, then got a message the day before the symphony saying my reservation was cancelled. No explanation. When I try to call the restaurant, I receive a pre-recorded message telling me to make reservations on the website (which is how I had originally made them). Now the only reservation time left (on the website...\"opentable\") is 15 minutes after the symphony begins. Brilliant. The most brilliant restaurant in the history of mankind."}
{"text":"This makes a a great trouble free evening at the symphony. Food was very good with an appealing and very convenient way to have a meal before attending a concert. I was a little concerned from some other reviews online. I was afraid that we would just be getting banquet level food on exchange for the convenience - far from it!! The flavors were very good. As a vegetarian I was especially pleased to have a couple of options for the entree. Usually many restaurants only have one, token veggie entree so that's an added plus. Atmosphere was very nice, though it does have a slight hotel feel to it. Server was very nice though a little inexperienced and slightly stressed from the pressure of getting people finished at the same time. All the staff were very pleasant though. I would definitely take advantage of this again. Combined with the connected garage parking, it's hard to imagine a better overall experience. They also mentioned that they are open after the concerts."}
{"text":"Has gone down hill for breakfast with Santa - he's OK but the menu has been made healthy so there is nothing for my son to eat -- he'd been looking forward to his annual bacon and Christmas  cookie feast. Nope. Nothing on the buffet for anyone under 40. Food was under cooked and cookies are from a box. Nothing in kitchen either. Was a tradition - I won't be coming back. 

Paid for hot choc and left."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant. We didn't even go to the concert, but were looking for some place near the Cleveland Museum of Art. Everything was pretty good except the \"berry cobbler\" dessert. It really wasn't that at all, but a small fruit (kiwis, mandarin oranges, strawberry, etc. on cream filling) tart with soggy crust."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right in Severance Hall. A quick dinner right before the show would be the best way to go. They often will have a limited number of menu items so that food comes out fast. However, the downside is that the crowd crunch does affect the speed and efficiency of service at times.

They do not have a children's menu. On certain days, perhaps for afternoon shows, the have lunch or brunch. Not bad. I'd say this was A-OK."}
{"text":"Food and service are top notch.  I'm almost always on my own when I get a chance to dine here and they always make me feel welcome, as do diners at adjacent tables."}
{"text":"Was extremely Dissapointed in dinner, food was cold and inspired for what I thought severance hall would be. Seemed more like fast food cafeteria food from gordon food services. The highlight was my salad which only goes down from there. Wild mushrooms are more than portabella? Black grouper tasted a bit off and the mussels also tasted fishy to me."}
{"text":"Needs some updating, but a convenient spot pre-Symphony.  I had the short ribs and the dish had a great flavor.  The carrots/potatoes could have been warmer.

Good service at the bar!

Would come back!"}
