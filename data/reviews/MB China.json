{"text":"Always a great price the specials are only $4.25 and cooked after you order.  Its really good to get a fresh cooked dinner under $5.  They are pretty quick and I always go thru drive thru."}
{"text":"Quick and Friendly service.  Clean dinning area.  Offers drive through window, as well as take out.  Healthy portions, so come hungry.  Great prices and great tasting food.  I am a regular customer, even On disability income."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Cheap Prices and the food is amazing. For less than 5 dollars you can get a 2 item meal which is WAY cheaper than Panda Express. I always order the Crab Rangoon and I get 6 for less than 2 dollars and they are BIG! My wife LOVES the Egg Drop Soup. I would go get lunch there everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, its not PF Chang, but thank goodness to that I say.  Quick, clean, cheap and tasty what else could it be but 5 star in my book."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its our second time here and the woman remembered us and even what I like WOW. She is extremely friendly and offers excellent customer service.  My food is always tasty and served hot. Try the chicken teriyaki bowl and of course crab cheese wontons are a fave!"}
{"text":"Ok.... First if you plan on eating there get ready. It's all paper plates plastic forks and packets for your sauces. The place needs some serious up keeping. Stained ceiling tiles, chips in the walls, mens restroom looks like a downtown bus station bathroom. Loved all the graffiti and the obscenities written all over the walls. Now to the food which really wasn't that good. Had sweet and sour shrimp.....shrimp came in box with some onion and pepper pieces thrown in. No pineapple. It was about 6 inch long shrimp sticks, first time I ever had to eat sweet and sour shrimp with my hand.  Now the coup de gra.... Went into the restroom as the cook was coming out of the restroom..... went to wash my hands and no soap in the dispenser. Not a drop. By the look of it,there hadn't been any in it for quite some time. Sat back down at the table and looked into the kitchen area and there is the cook back at it making the next customers food. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Cheap no frills Chinese but surprisingly tasty. I'd probably end up a regular if I was a local. Mongolian beef was good and so was the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"MB China offers so-so Chinese food that probably merits only 2 stars. But the price is so low and the portion size so high that it bumps itself up a star.   I ordered kung pao chicken at the drive-up window. For less than $5, I got a large portion of the entree and a side of fried rice packed into a Styrofoam box. The rice really didn't taste fried, and it looked more like regular white rice doused in soy sauce, but once I mixed it all together, it didn't matter anyway. The sauce had a nice bit of heat, and there were plenty of peanuts and veggies (including baby corn!), but the green peppers were chopped into huge pieces that I put to the side. Surprisingly, the chicken itself was pretty good, although the overall dish came off as a little cloying.  Still, what do you want for $5? I wanted quick, cheap Chinese food, and I got it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for cheap & good portions of Chinese food! We were visiting Las Vegas, and because of the reviews, we decided to get some. The night before we tried Ocha Cuisine, and I thought that it was overpriced for food that did not deliver. First of all,BOMB COMBINATION RICE!! This place has one of the best combination rice that I've tasted. We also got shrimp lo mein and chicken fried rice...decent food for a great price! Definitely recommend & will be back again when we go to Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I loooooove this place!! I've been going there since i was like maybe 12 years old and the food is always good. The lady is always nice and the little coin machines are always cute games. The chicken is always bomb!"}
{"text":"If you like processed pre-packaged food then this spots is for you. Oh don't set or eat under any of the ceiling decorations -dust just waiting to go home with you. Customer service : one lady taking orders from walk in and drive thru, while trying to bag your order and take payment,  but she was very nice."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! This was my first time here. I saw the reviews on Yelp and it seems to be a good lil decent recent for Chinese food..... wrong. I ordered my food for me and my kids. We were on our way to the bathroom and on our way  their a cockroach came out of the kitchen and was walking through the dining room area!!!! Yuck!!!! The lady that took our order saw it too and just walked into the bathroom. I waited for her to return and asked her to cancel my order right away and give me my money back. She gave me my refund no problem no questions asked!!!! She knew exactly why I cancelled. I will never return. A health inspector is definitely needed here!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Actually very good for what it is. It is great for a take out place but we dined in. Since we were packing up to move and needed to eat somewhere and were too tired to head down to Spring Mountain to our usual haunts we found this place on Yelp. .It might only have 8 reviews but I have to tell you it's way better than other take out Chinese in the area.  We are veggies so won't eat meat or chicken and they were very accommodating. We had tofu and veggie curry and kung po tofu.. Both not on the menu but made special. Yes she charged us a bit more but not enough to make us not order it. We also had veggie lo mein which was really really good. Of course, they don't compare to many of our favorite places on Spring Mountain but for a quick dinner that's fresh, hot and tasty you can't go wrong with MB China! ."}
{"text":"Food is really good and made when ordered! Way better than Panda Express! Lady in the front swears the hot sauce comes out her pay check . Stingy stingy stingy I don't mind paying extra just don't make faces!"}
{"text":"Being a mile from work I had to try it.. friendly staff, super fast service and great prices. Why 4 stars? The Fried rice was so bland. No veggies, just rice and soy sauce."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. Minute from work, but they are a true authentic Chinese place,  the food is great and always fresh. You always get way more food than what you paid, great value . There is always specials , and a drive through. And the owners are very nice !!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and inexpensive! I always order the teriyaki bowl and two eggrolls. Their orange chicken is so bomb! Dinner is really cheap and I find you get more out of it than say going to Panda Express. Your food is made quickly incase you eat out while it's lunch time. And all in all awesome food."}
{"text":"My friends and I were going for lunch and I asked to go somewhere cheap. THIS PLACE IS CHEAP. It's also really delicious! The sign is a little run down, but the inside is clean and the food is great. They give you big portions and all the food comes in a to-go box so if you don't finish, you can just leave. If you're low on funds but want to eat a lot, I recommend a trip to MB China!"}
{"text":"Summer of 2010 began it all, the obsession. Love it, ma and pa restaurant all the dishes are delicious my favorite being #9 the Kong Pao Chicken. My parent love the orange chicken it is the best. Next door is a 24 hour bakery there by the ladies bathroom smells so welcoming. Now six years and I'd never reviewed this place. Plus, I'm an introvert so I've not referred anyone. I gotta try, this winter we will have family visit. I'll bring them here."}
{"text":"I love the orange chicken and chow mein from this place it's one of the best in North Las Vegas very well cooked food"}
{"text":"The food here is not good. The king po is soupy and not very spicy. The fried rice has no flavor it's dark brown. This place makes Panda Express look like a 4 star restaurant. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"After that expose on Dirty Dining, I just cannot bring myself to go back.  And the people are so nice there and that food was good, but....."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to come to the food is great and the price is even better if come here at least twice a week  even though it's quite a drive for me it's worth it Ivan been coming  here for more then 10 years"}
{"text":"love there wor won ton soup and convinient drive thru.they have great lunch specials everyday and they give u plenty of food for there prices"}
{"text":"Food was great and give you plenty to eat. Menu on wall didn't have a lot of selection. If there was another menu I was never offered one so not sure if there is more to offer. Food came out quick so didn't have to wait long. Would  come back here again, just hope  there is more of a variety."}
{"text":"For anyone keeping track on my quest for the most impressive or even Good Chinese food ..I decided to take an adventure and try this place! ... first visit was yesterday. .. we did an in store order ... upon walking up ... I was shocked to see they HAVE A DRIVE THRU....kinda neat yet bizarre considering it's Chinese food but hey guess it's no different then any other place so... continuing on.. my first impression is the restaurant was clean which is very important. ..there were people in there which says ok someone must like this place .. (as the reviews also did ).. anyway we are standing at the counter which I thought was where you order but after atleast 6 minutes of watching this lady run around between drive thru and the pick counter before greeting us I began to wonder was I in the right place .. eventually she directed us to a register area which is where you actually  order ... so I place my order ... issue one: I wanted to order shrimp and broccoli but seen it No where listed on the overhead menu... so I inquire to the marathon  running lady lol...and she directs me not once but 3 x to this overhead board that it IS NOT ON... FINALLY she looks up there herself and says oh..it's not up there huh... ok but yeah we sell it ....smh.. ok great.. anyway we place order ..issue two: I has to pay an additional 7.00 bucks for rice because none of the entrees come with it ..**shocked face** ... it's literally just the shrimp and broccoli in a box  for 7.00..rice extra... upside regardless of that prices are still better than other places ... soooo... we get food home .. it smells great... we had shrimp and broccoli,  shrimp chow mein, egg roll and some chicken wings ... everything was ok.. not AMAZING but good the shrimp and broccoli could of had way more shrimp there was basically a box of broccoli and three shrimp. . But I will ask for extra next time and see what that gets me and let you guys know.... even though there were some things keeping this from 4 or 5 stars.. the definitely earned another shot. . So I'll order again.... stay tuned.  Note: you can add white rice for 25 cents to your entrées."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was fast and excellent. First time here and i will be coming back and spreading the word. Thanks MB China foor the experience."}
{"text":"What eva pepole say this place is good.  Alway made to order.  Not sitting in warmers.  Lady up front is very nice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What an awesome little place with great food and cheap prices.  I really loved my shrimp fried rice.  Great casual place."}
{"text":"The customer service is always good at this location. You can't say that for most places. Every time I go here the lady remembers my name and the food is always good."}
{"text":"7/16/2017  After reviewing this place on Yelp, I decided to give them a try.  The place had seating for about 32 people.  The place was clean and roomy. You order at the counter and pick up your order when ready.  They had both canned and fountain drinks, but I had water with me, which seemed okay with the person taking my order.   Several people pulled up to the drive up window to pick up to go orders.  The person taking orders was friendly and I ordered a large size of Hot and Sour Soup and Kung Pao Chicken.  The soup was really good.  The Kung Pao I ordered with all rice, came with a brown fried rice and was good but could have had more sauce, but it was good.  I drive several miles to eat at MB China.  I think the quality of food and reasonable prices make it worthwhile. If you want an inexpensive lunch that was fresh, I'd stop in and give this place a try.  Their menu had a variety of food reasonably priced. They are across the street from Chipotle and CVS and share a building with a Donut Shop."}
{"text":"Good food low price!  Turns out over priced bland tasting Panda Express."}
{"text":"Great food always fresh and very cheap on price.  You will have to wait a few to get your food but it's cooked to order witch not to many places do.."}
{"text":"Our favorite go to Chinese restaurant! Always delicious. Take out is always hot and fresh. Customer service is outstanding.  Large portions and big menu, great specials too! For really good, fast service, this is the place!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything amazing.  Cheap though.  Most dishes are less than 5 dollars.  Meals for a family of four even with drink turns into 20 dollars give or take.  Flavors are there.  If you are on this side of town, it's not bad.  I see they have chef specials though I never saw them.  Also they have drive through,  healthy alternative to most of the drive thru choices nearby i am sure.  No dessert but the donut place next door has great pastries and pan."}
{"text":"This is our second time here in 1 week! The food is great and the price is right. If you like your food spicy just ask, they will make it as hot as you want. The lady who works the cash register is also very friendly and remembered us after just one visit. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"You can not beat this place for the prices!! Good food, dirt cheap, funny lady at the counter. Love it here, I'm from Cali and this taste like the hole-in-the-walls back home.  Sweet and sour chicken House chow mein Pork fried rice Those delicious chicken wings  Thats my usual! all for around $25"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, divey chinese food, this place delivers. I wanted to find some cheap Chinese food somewhere near my work downtown. I was tired of paying the 10 dollar minimum at downtown places.  I found this on Yelp, and man am I glad I did. The building and restaurant is completely barebones and hole in the wall. However the food is good, it is obnoxiously cheap, and the people that work there are very friendly.  It's hard to leave here not feeling like you got a delicious value, and they even have a drive through if you're in a rush. Definitely recommend if you like pretty good Chinese at amazing prices."}
{"text":"Not too bad for what it is. Popped in for a spur of the moment lunch during a work meeting break. Very low prices, quick, and extremely clean!  Food was nothing more than Chinese take out. Don't be fooled by the fried rice. It's literally just fried rice, no veggies included. Then again, it was a side on an entree so I'm sure their fried rice dish includes more. The veggies in my black bean chicken were my favorite part. Didn't skimp at all. Every piece had crisp and flavorful.  If I am at another meeting in the area I may have to stop in!"}
{"text":"Great price for the food, you can get a lot of food for a low price. The pot stickers were lightly fried and the dipping sauce was tangy with a littke spice, food rated great I would definitely come back here again"}
{"text":"This is The best fast food Chinese  food ever the noodles were very fresh and moist also I like how they cook the food as you order and the orange chicken was very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Affordable for a family on a  budget. Food is always hot and good.  Happy family happy Mama."}
{"text":"Wallet Friendly  I was craving \"authentic\" fried rice on my way home this evening and remembered this place my mother would frequent (and force us to eat) way back in the day!  You definitely get what you pay for with their wallet friendly menu!  I was honestly anticipating an oily box of rice with tiny (joker) shrimp for $4.95 but I was pleasantly surprised! The rice was decent and the shrimp were average sized for the price. #Score   I wish I stopped there but I ordered Kung Pao Shrimp $6.75 to meet the minimum credit card requirement for payment. Big mistake! Huge! This \"dish\" taste like a filthy freezer!  #BarfDotCom   I definitely won't be back but I guess it was worth the quick trip down memory lane..."}
{"text":"Pictures look great. But the actual food was blab and dry the white rice I think was left over from yesterday. The soup was ok but had no vegetables in it just oil and egg"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Been coming here since my childhood days. Yes it's in the ghetto but don't judge a book by it's cover ! I live far from here now but it's a go to place during lunch break. I definitely recommend the pork fried rice! Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Paid 16 for two meals. Fried rice and chow mein with one chicken each. Panda Express has better prices and might even taste better. But if you're really hungry and in the area it's not toooo bad."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for the price. One of the few Chinese restaurants left at a low price. The owner is very nice. Their rice is not the best, but tasty though! I had their sesame chicken, which is my test dish for a Chinese restaurant and was actually pretty good! The egg rolls are another item I look at, and they were very good...service is very warm and receptive. It's very obvious they have a following here, lots of locals come here to eat! It's my go to, when I don't have a lot of cash on hand.."}
{"text":"Love This Place, my local Chinese food fav. Great Prices and the House Fried Rice Is The Business. Wish the hours were longer for when I catch a craving late night."}
{"text":"This  place is soo good and cheap. We love it.  My husband and I have been coming here for over 12 years. You have to try the chicken wings they r sooo good!   I recommend this place,  yes the place might be a little dirty so just take it to go.  its good for a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food for a good price & friendly staff (Julia). I like the house fried rice, the shrimp vegetable soup, and the shrimp vegetable entree, which you can order with either white or brown sauce."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for an inexpensive dinner! You have to make sure you order by number not a la carte. Big price difference. Food is always good! I usually get Beef & Broccoli, broccoli is always fresh! Always order take out. Didn't really like eating there. Felt akward!"}
{"text":"If you've been looking for a GOOD Chinese spot....this is it! The food is good, prices are cheap, they have drive thru, take out, & dine in! One of my favorites is garlic chicken! It's garlicky & the sauce is delicious over steamed rice! I've ordered almost everything off the menu since 2006 & haven't been disappointed yet! Consistent every time!"}
{"text":"Ordered Fried Rice And Wings . Cost Less Than $10 AND It Was Sooooo Good. I Did Burn Myself Trying To Eat The Chicken Right Away But That's From Just Being A Fatass. I Believe My Food Took Maybe 10 Minutes With 2 Orders Ahead Of Mine. They're Really Nice And Professional. The Dining Area Was Spotless. I Wish I Still Worked Closer To Enjoy The Food Often."}
{"text":"Got delivery from Door Dash. Got cream cheese wontons (good,  not greasy), chicken curry (good), beef  black bean (good), and vegetable egg foo young ( not good). The patties are hard,  and full of flour, no egg. I ended  up throwing  them away which left me feeling but  they were completely  inedible."}
