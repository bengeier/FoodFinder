{"text":"Went for dinner here with friends over the Xmas holidays. Interior is nice, very clean. Waiter was definitely new but did his best and was very attentive. The food wasn't great and no one in the group enjoyed their meal. 
It is essentially the same menu as The Salty Dog with a few different options, including the same beers on tap. 
If you want pub food there are better option in the neighborhood, including The Salty Dog."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently opened in the beaches and it is now my new favorite restaurant to go to.  It is definitely a hidden gem.   I have been to many upper scale restaurants in my lifetime and none of them compare to this new establishment.   The food is absolutely delicious and the presentation is breath taking.   Every time I saw a dish come out, I wanted it.  The service is top notch and I am highly recommending you try this place out.   The best part of my evening... I ate absolutely delicious food for a fraction of the cost the upper scale restaurants charge.   Oh and if you want to stay for dancing, they have a DJ every Friday and Saturday night.   Everything all in one place.   It just can't get any better for an evening out.   I am already planning another visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food. We got the seafood platter. Huge amount of food for two people. All of it was cooked well and great sauce combinations. Drinks good too."}
{"text":"Where does one start with tasty little hidden gem. It was an exceptional meal, the special was Jerk chicken when I asked what the spicing was, I corrected myself and asked that if it could not be prepared like a local Jamaican kitchen was not interested.  

Lucky me the chef is Jamaican and did not disappoint with that or the curry dish my wife had.  

Only recommend I have is they could work on the wine list, if you are a wine drinker it's so so at best.  

Great food, great service.  

Highly recommend giving it a go, you will not be disappointed.   Thank you Peppery Cat.  

Cheers......."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a chance. I really did. And the review on the food alone should be better than the one star. But truth is truth, the service in this restaurant was the absolute worst. Please note* the bartender was great. Friendly and she was on point. But the waitress just really didn't care about us at all. I'm actually attaching a time lapse video of how long it took my ONLY glass of water to be even looked at. I was 3/4 done my steak. Then miraculously, I was asked if I wanted more water , which then took another 7 minutes to arrive. The actual highlight of this restaurant was the bathroom sink, which was one of those old ones from my grade school where you stand on the thing at the bottom and it sprinkled water out into the big tub. I took a picture of it. That's how excited I was lol. 

I'll probably never go to this spot again based on service alone. The steak was cool.. But I was already cheesed at the lack of caring from the staff so.. You know how that goes. 

Sorry but I need to be honest."}
{"text":"It was my first time being here when there was music an although the crowd of ppl were awesome I would have to say the music sucked an wen they actually let the ppl played music it sucked even more cus the music was being played from the jux box an there was this getto white boy toke control of it an I wanted to play dance much an he wouldn't let me an played some crappy ass music like rock an roll an crap like that wen I only came there to dance oh my goodness wow needless to say after that experience I will never go back there again but ppl there were  friendly tho an the lights were awesome i went there on Thursday night an there was a chick there named Emily an she was awesome an there's also a dude there named Larry an he is totally is cool an I would only go back to see them other then that I wouldn't be goin back"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time for karaoke (every second Wednesday). The shooter prices are good, beer and wine are slightly over priced. It can be hard to get drink service to your table, by the end of the night I usually end up walking to the bar for refills. Food portions are pretty big. It took me a lot of figuring out to operate the sink in the men's washroom. I've never seen one like it before. All in all it's an ok place to hang out"}
{"text":"Food was good - service was horrible - we were ignored and waited and waited and waited without apology - surely waitress - horrible experience"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend after seeing stellar reviews but was very  dissapointed.  We ordered a seafood pasta and a salad.  The waitress dropped off our plates and never returned. She did not offer fresh pepper or parmesan for the pasta.  The food was bland and unremarkable.  The sauce tasted like it was from a jar. Then when we were finished we sat and waited until we finally had to leave and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for our bill."}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere new and local for our work Christmas party so we decided to give The Peppery Cat a try.  I met with one of the owners and he was polite, professional and didn't say 'no' to a single request we had. Not long after we heard from their chef regarding the type of menu and meal requirements we had, the menu was all set.  We then received a call from their event planner, who let us know that she was there if we needed anything and she also had several great suggestions.  We were all set it was almost too easy.

This was our best Christmas party ever. The restaurant itself has a great decor and the event planner added a few simple decorations that made our reserved section that much nicer. She even created a custom drink menu for us naming the cocktails after our work terms.  Every drink was well composed and had several fresh ingredients, like mint leaves, grapefruit, pomegranate, etc.  The food was amazing.  It was fresh and tasty. The portions were large enough so that everyone got to take some home.  The staff were friendly, polite and very accommodating. 

We had such a wonderful time that I went ahead and booked a birthday party for a few weekends later and the experience was exactly the same.  There was not one disappointment.  I highly recommend The Peppery Cat as I could not have been happier with both experiences."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  The quality of the food and the menu really stand out.  Very nice people running the place.  I've been in a few times now and it tends to be not as crowded as other pubs in the area.  The layout is setup more as a bar so it would be great watching a sporting event here although I have always been able to get a good table.  I believe that this place has the same owners as the Salty Dog, which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to pop in with a friend what a great local spot! So unassuming from the street but inside a very nice, new and clean spot great to catch a game (large screen tv's all around) which is exactly what we did while enjoying a few tasty pints and wings which were delicious - big juicy and saucy. Great spot that I hope lasts in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Went to the Peppery Cat for a group event and found the place to be nice upon walking in.  Then I took a walk around and found the layout to be very awkward as one section closes out and you cannot get out unless you walked all the way back to the front of the restaurant.  They seemed to have wasted a lot of space with poor floor planning.

Apart from that the food was plentiful and very good.  I had the Montreal Smoked Meat Burger which is their hamburger with smoked meat, creamy cole slaw, and thin fried onions piled on top of the already generous patty.  I ordered it with onion rings which were made perfectly.

The service was good, and the menu was pretty good from what I could see.

I will probably go back when I am back in the neighbourhood."}
