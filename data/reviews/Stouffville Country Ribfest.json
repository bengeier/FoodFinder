{"text":"This was the first ribfest that I attended where I did not have to line up. It was Friday afternoon so I guess there were less people. There were 4 different ribbers and I decided to go with Sticky Fingers because I had not tried this one before.  I really like the sauce for their ribs and pulled pork because it had a nice hint of sweetness. The ribs were not super fall off the bone but still tender enough for maximum enjoyment. I think the full rack was $23 and the 1lb pulled pork was $12. If you are planning on taking your food to go like I did then I recommend bringing a plastic bag because they never give you bags at ribfests. So carrying the food containers back to the car was a bi!%# because I parked far away just to enjoy the walk.   This ribfest is smaller and more basic when compared to other ribfests. About 4-5 rides for the kids. Many tables for eating. A few shops setup that sell complete junk in my opinion. There were also other foods to snack on like funnel cake, mini dounuts, cotton candy, popcorn, fresh corn, etc. There was also one food truck present at the time which had an interesting menu but I was already too full. There were parking spaces near by but I encourage walking Stouffville Main steet as much as you can as the scenery is very nice."}
{"text":"Sometimes bigger doesn't means better.  Stouffville Ribfest though has only 4 ribbers but it is just the perfect small town country event vibe.  Local business set up booths selling everything from roti, fresh farm produce and more.  But with Stouffville Brewing Co, Barn Door and Mill St Brewery on site, making this a 4 star event. Just like a mini beerfest!   We were here on a Friday for lunch to use the $3 off coupon and there was no lines at all.   Chowing down ribs, drinking craft beers and listening to Country Music...   What a great way to spend a nice Summer afternoon!"}
{"text":"I only stayed here less than an hour, because I had to go to another venue after this.  However, this is by far one of my favorite rib fests.  The event is not overwhelmingly crowded likely due to the location and I think most people who go there live around the area and just go home shortly after.  It's not like the other rib fests where people have to drive or take transit to go.  As such I found the queues are pretty civil compared to say Scarborough rib fests.  Since this is predominantly a non-Chinese neighborhood, There's NO STINKY TOFU to ruin the ribby aroma.  The aroma was pretty heavenly and was whetting my appetite.  The location had I found that there's ample covered seats (due to less people sitting around) and even a small playground for slightly older kids to run amok as part of the venue itself rather than temporarily placed for the event.  There may be only four ribbers to choose from, but it's more or less same amount as in Markham and North Scarborough Rib fests.  However, the standard staples are all there namely:  * funnel cake * beaver tails * blooming onions  And since there was a lot more of us going this time we got to try two of them.  I think we need a slightly bigger crowd next time.  I was slightly annoyed that they ran out of beef ribs in the Texas one, but at least there was another that had it.  Overall, I'd go back again."}
