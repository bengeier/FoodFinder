{"text":"This place has been around for a few years and I've been there when they first opened. At the time there were non Pho places along Yonge St. between Finch and Sheppard. This shop may have started a trend as there are now 4-5 more Viet/Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.  I've always ordered the House Special Pho as I do at every Pho restaurant just to compare them. I can tell you that their small is pretty much a medium at other restaurants and I can't imagine what their large would look like or who would conquer such a feat.   The other dishes are par, usual broken rice dishes and some Thai stir fries in the mix. Their menu is simple but still caters to a wide variety of selections which is a good thing. Sometimes too many menu items that cover multiple cuisine types is not a good thing and makes the restaurant look like their not sure of their own identity.  Overall good place to eat Viet/Thai food, ample parking space in the back and on the street.  P.S. I dare someone to try out the XL size Pho, I know some restaurants have this size but don't advertise it on the menu. ;)"}
{"text":"Place was okay, clean decor. House noodles had a lot of stuff. Portions were large. Soup base ok, points lost on the noodles being too hard. Not the best pho I've had nor the worst.  Onion smell alert, *sigh* another round of laundry."}
{"text":"A nice, new, clean, and friendly Viet restaurant dead in the heart of Korea Town North (buk). I found in Seoul, Viet food is considered high end and pricey. In North America, most people rave about the favorable cost:taste ratio. I'm happy to say Pho Delight maintains the North American standards. Both me and ArtBabe had noodles and spring roll. ArtBabe tried the pork variant. I tried the chicken variant. I found the chicken a little grisly and once piece was inedible. ArtBabe had no complaints about hers.   Service was quick and friendly.  I'm docking them a star because when they first opened they literally coated any flat surface in North York with their restaurant fliers. The sidewalk, subway stairs, sneaking into my condo to litter my hall. The amount of paper trash they dumped on North York was disgusting. Utterly disgusting. I'm not much of an environmentalist (trees really make no effort on my behalf so I don't see why I should care much about them). But I do resent they shifted the burden of their advertising costs onto home owners and tax payers."}
{"text":"Very poor quality. The meat was undercooked. The taste was ok. On the upside, the quantities are huge and the prices are very reasonable.   But I wouldn't go back unless I saw reviews that said they significantly improved"}
{"text":"Not the best Pho I've tried in my life. We found it has a lot of MSG in it and there are not a lot of condiments that come with it. I also wish they'd put more noodles in it. Their prices are fine and the decor is limited. Over all nothing to write home about."}
