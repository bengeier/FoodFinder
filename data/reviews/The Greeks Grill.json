{"text":"I was craving a gyro so I decided to give this place a try tonight. I arrived around 6.30 and there were two other tables in the dining area. The place is very casual. I stood at the front counter for few minutes before the man sitting 2 feet from me on his computer actually acknowledged me. No big deal. He then continued to mess around with to-go orders and had a side conversation as I stood there waiting to order for another 5 mins.

About 20 mins later, I my food arrived. I ordered the original gyro combo. It was an average gyro. Not terrible but nothing great. 

Customer service= 1 star
Food= 3 stars

I won't be back."}
{"text":"A very homey quaint place. Has a feel of a very traditional Greek ambience. The owner is very helpful and humble. The food we tasted were awesome. Gotta try the original gyro and of course the chicken kabob!!"}
{"text":"This was obviously a family run business which I love!  The people there were friendly, food came quickly and it was delicious!   HOWEVER the cleanliness of this facility concerned me.   The table had not been wiped down, my arms were sticky from resting them on the edge and there were crumbs on the chair.   The salt and pepper shaker was greasy and absolutely grimy, it was obvious it had been a long time since they had been washed.   When we left I also noticed the outside dinning table hadn't been wiped down.    I would really like to eat there again because the food was very good and I like to support local business but I'm thinking if the dinning area was that dirty what must the kitchen be like???    I'm not trying to be mean by this review but am hoping the owners see it and make those improvements."}
{"text":"I dropped in close to closing tonight and the man whom I'd guess was the owner was very friendly and helpful. He even gave me a sample of his excellent baklava while I waited for the to go order. It's Great little place."}
{"text":"I don't understand how so many people have had great experiences with the owner. He gets grumpy when we use a card instead of cash and it's not like we're placing a piddly order -- we're buying more than enough to justify it. I prefer to get the food to go (I love the tzatziki) but recently decided to eat in and realized I won't ever do that again. I had ordered Greek fries but received regular fries instead. When I mentioned this to the waitress, who was really nice, she told the owner who then complained about me in the nearby kitchen. I like to think that cashiers, waiters, and customer service people in general appreciate my patience and kindness but this guy makes me feel like it's such a hassle for him to even bother with me. I had another bad experience ordering lunch today and I'm done with this place...I just don't get it. :("}
{"text":"Have you ever been banned from a truck stop restroom? At first sight the place looked closed. After I had a closer look I realized there were just no customers. I thought great I can have the whole place to myself. After I walked in and saw every table was dirty and the old food in the floor I figured that was the reason i was the only customer. I hesitantly ordered a gyro plate even after I saw the visually repugnant warning photos of each plate scroll across the cheap and poorly mounted menu screen. When I finally received my gyro platter I will refer to as \"The punisher\" the meat was well done almost to the point of over cooked jerky. The portion on my plate was less than filling ( not that I needed a larger portion of \"the punisher\"). After I tearfully gnawed through the sandwich like I was eager to suffer, I looked around for a place to wash the sweat from my face and cool down with a bit of water. I was surprised when I realized there was no immediate access to a toilet room or a water closet. I gathered my things and rushed out the door to begin my search for a porcelain victim. I found a convenient store about 2 blocks away and not a moment to soon. As I waddled like a penguin with a bonobo size ass rash I almost didn't make it. As I made my way to the public restroom I was feeling the pressure of a quivering anus and violently seizing intestines I realized the latch on the stall door was missing. At this point in my suffering I was shameless. As I barely made it to the place of duty, the other poor patron look over nervously as he was rushing to leave this apparent crime scene. As I finished I washed up my hands and face and tried to look smooth as I opened the door to leave the scene. Immediately as I left the restroom, a small child walked in to and belted out \" Daddy it smells like a dumpster in here\". I'm not saying I was immediately noticed but I'm sure I have been banned from this location if they rewind the surveillance camera. Let me close with a kind word. It was better than my experience at La Mexican Restaurant in Mo. As you can read in my reviews."}
{"text":"Was craving greek and saw the good reviews.  Checked it out and it was good!  Memtioned it was my first time and they gave me a few baclavas on the house.  It was delicous."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best gyros in Chandler. Don't be fooled by the strip mall it's in, this place is a hidden gem! We had the original gyro and their humas. Both were extremely fresh!"}
{"text":"The food gets better and better each time! Family owned and run.  Best service around!"}
{"text":"I get served the freshest food when I order food from here. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome. never too busy and always ultra nice. I live close and will come here whenever I can. you have to try the baklava, it's probably up there with the best in the valley. would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We get this at the office all the time for working lunches and it is the BEST.  Greeks Grill also blows Pitta Souvli away...there's no comparison...Greeks Grill is sooooo much better.  Everything I've tried is outstanding.  The owner is a good man, too, who treats the Chandler Police with a lot of respect and appreciates their service."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for two years now and LOVE this place. It is family owned and run. The same guy who owns it is there every time we go. The food is so tasty and fresh. Everything is seasoned perfectly. We always start out with an order of pita and hummus...delicious!! The salads are amazing and so are the gyro sandwiches. The fries have a great texture and taste too. We love the tzakki sauce and always ask for extra. The place is quiet and clean and really you can't ask for much more with how good the food is, the portion sizes and the prices. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Got take out from here twice in the past few months and it was great. Everything tasted fresh and you can't beat the price for how much food you get. Both times I had the Gyro with fries, I like the Greek style fries which they? add feta cheese to and their Greek dressing. I skip the dressing and just dip them into tsasiki sauce and theirs is delicious. My kids had their chicken nuggets which were just your average chicken nuggets, but that is too be expected and I like that they offer a kids menu."}
{"text":"The Greek's Grill made me feel like I was at my grandparent's house.  The owner greeted me so warmly, shook my hand and had me meet his wife, who was cooking in the back.  While the greeting was a lovely warm-up, let's be honest, I was there for food.  I don't know much about Greek food, so I found an item on the menu that looked delicious -the chicken caesar pita- and it was!  The pita bread was warm and soft and the chicken was out-of-this-world.  It had so much flavor and was so tender.  I would order a bowl of just the chicken and eat it.  My husband had the salmon pita and he raved about his order, as well.  The charm of the owners is a rare find among businesses and the food is fresh and delicious.  Definitely give the Greek's Grill a try. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"This guy does a fantastic gyro and gyro salad. I have been in for pick up a few times and felt very authentic ,large portions and great prices. Wish they delivered but i believe they do cater."}
{"text":"I had the beef kabobs and they were cooked nicely.  The falafels are really crispy on the outside, just like I like 'em.

The only downside to my platter was the rice, which wasn't fully cooked or left out and dried.  Might've been better to order the wrap + fries instead of the platter.

Unfortunately, MBFGR chains have similar dishes/prices, but with consistent quality.  I would certainly stop by here to satisfy any falafel cravings, though!"}
{"text":"I went to the school next door so I came here often! The price was a little expensive for me as a student, so I wish they would have deals for students! /: However the amount of food and the quality and taste of the food was AMAZING, FRESH AND DELICIOUS. Fred, and his family who works there are all so nice and sweet. Fred is lucky to have such a cute family who makes his business look good! Literally everything is good, the chicken is so moist and season to perfection, the gyros have the perfect amount of meat and fresh veggies, the rice was just mhmm too perfect, even there AMERICAN CHEESE BURGERS MADE FRESH!! They take a little longer to make since it is made to order like everything else but just oh so delicious. Even after 6 months after I graduated from the school next door, I came back and they still remembered me and had the same devious food! Only thing different is they updated the store with new seating arrangement! :) love this place, staff and food"}
{"text":"Incredible gyros! They are only like $5 and they are a very generous size. The salads are also very good. What makes these sandwiches so good is the quality of the meat and all the ingredients seem very fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of this place, and would order take out frequently. However, I have noticed a significant decline in the quality of their food over the past few visits, and tonight was the final straw. The hummus was runny and flavorless, the chicken tasted \"off\", the salad dressing did not appear to be mixed right, and they did not include tzatziki sauce with my meal (which left it very dry). Back to Spices Mediterranean I go.. Even if it's 5 miles out of my way."}
{"text":"My husband found out about this place when it was catered at his work. He wouldn't stop talking about it so we went to the actual location to give it a whirl! It was so yummy!! Also they were so kind to us and made us feel very comfortable. Would definitely recommend and we will be going back"}
{"text":"I've driven by numerous times and finally stopped because we didn't know where else to eat. Wow!  The man that was there opted to have the woman (wife?) take our order because we started asking questions and I think his English is limited. She assured us she makes everything from scratch and it is the best around. 

I agree!  So much that when I asked my husband if he liked it he said, \"Uhum, I want to hug her.\"  Then when we were done she came over for our reaction and he told her he wanted to hug her! Why don't I get hugs when I cook dinner?

We got the sample appetizer and it all was delicious.  I'm not a big dolmades fan but I did eat three!  I thought the falafel, hummus and tzatziki were phenomenal.  I had chicken kabob dinner with rice and hubby had chicken pita.  We even got a complimentary baklava. Yes we are big eaters it is hard to try things without ordering everything at once!  I have a nice lunch for tomorrow. 

I've already messaged my friends and family of the new find and now passing  to you."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy food and the service is top notch.  Always a great experience, especially when catering!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars.  Never have I seen more irate customers.  Everyone was extremely angry.  I had to request a refund and left after waiting for over 30 minutes for a gyro and a salad.   I saw people come 10 to 15 minutes after me and get their food.  When I asked where my food was, I was told the original gyro takes a while....   Soooo precooked, chopped and formed meat, reheated on a griddle takes 30 minutes???   Very unorganized.  They had no idea who ordered what.  Would ask every table if the orders coming out of the kitchen were theirs.  No one knew if it was their order since they came out 2 plates at a time and some people had 5 or 6 people.  Never again!  Just horrible."}
{"text":"Yelped out for what was nearby and found this place.  It's in a shopping plaza and just a little restaurant.  I ordered a gyro salad and small fry (shhh...!) The salad was bomb bomb bomb diggity no doubt!! I ate my entire salad and actually threw most of the fries away because I was so full from my fresh, flavorful salad.  The salad came with shredded iceberg, Lamb meat, one pepperoncini ( would have appreciated more), tomatoes, red peppers, red onions, and cucumbers.  It was lovely.  I am thankful I yelped the \"around me\" option to find this family owned spot."}
{"text":"Just moved to Chandler, far far away from my favorite (and the BEST!) gyro spot, so I'm searching for a replacement on this side of town.  I discovered Greeks Grill less than an hour before they closed for the day.  I called and they were willing to take my order as long as I was able to pick it up in time for them to close.  Done deal!  Very gracious and friendly service, and the gyros were pretty good.  I also ordered what turned out to be a huge mountain of fries, which looked really salty to me, but they actually weren't, and they were nice and crispy on the outside.  While they won't knock my favorite gyro spot off the top of the list, Greeks Grill will definitely do."}
{"text":"Every bite was perfect! The service was incredible! Each staff member was friendly and more than willing to help every customer."}
{"text":"Updated: I'm giving them a higher rating because they were kind enough to reach out to me after I posted this review. They explained that the lack of iced tea happened because I visited during a brief period while they were switching out their drink options, and that tea is once more available.

This use to get 4 stars from me, since I took one away for the seating options. I'm putting it down to 2 stars because on our recent visit they had removed the iced tea machine and served the side salad with no dressing at all. The Philly Pita was still very good. For a take out I'd probably give it an additional star but the lack of iced tea for dine in was a big minus for me."}
{"text":"I was here about a couple of months ago, just forgot to put in a review until today when I had another gyros for lunch. I can't say I am an expert on Greek food, I have had some in Minneapolis and Chicago but never here and mostly just gyros or other meats type of dishes and some falafels. The Greek Grill is okay,  I will say that they do give you a good portion, a little smaller than the midwest but an okay amount. The pita is somewhat fresh and the tzatziki sauce is okay, other ingredients like the tomatoes and onions are fresh. The meat was not that tasty, and I wonder if it is that fresh but all in all the place is okay. Would I go back? Maybe if I had a real craving for gyros or other greek food, but otherwise not likely. I would recommend it for the people seems very nice, an old guy and his family I presume, they had very good service. So good service, so-so food, but maybe this is as good as it gets in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"Sorry its taken me so long to review this place, but I've been very busy traveling lately. Anyhow I again had the experience of eating here last week, and as always the food was excellent. The owner Fred is awesome and one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. I always go with the Chicken Gyro with a side salad. This place is like a hidden gem, tucked away in the Pollack plaza on Alma school and Galveston in Chandler. You have got to give this place a try if you like authentic Greek cuisine!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been into the Greek in quite some time.  Went in tonight and got the Greek Salad.  Fred, the owner, stacked my salad with chicken kabob, grilled chicken and gyro meat.  It was a high protein, low carb treat.  All 3 of the meats were flavorful and nicely cooked.  He also treated us to some complimentary hummus, enough that I brought leftovers home for my daughter, who loves hummus.  The hummus was yummy.

Fred makes the place.  It was also nice to see the place humming w/ some business on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall and not exactly impressive decor but has amazing food. Obviously family owned, the people there are super friendly and I have yet to have a bad meal in about 50 visits."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time the Gyro was the best ive had. I never thought anyone could beat my greek gyro place in Scottsdale but these guys have done just that. Definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"There is nothing quite like having service from the owner of a restaurant! I know the place is no frills, but I don't eat the chairs or table. It has the feel of a local Greek hangout. The food is awesome! I recommend the felafel, and veggie Gyro. You might even her some regulars speaking fluent Greek sitting next to you."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how there can be this many positive reviews of this place.  The gyro was sub par, very little meat and the tzatziki was watery.  The chicken schawarma had an odd taste to it as well.  I would rate Gyro Express and the Hungry Monk wayyyy better and they are both within a mile of this place.  Save your cash, go anyplace else."}
{"text":"We've gotten take out from here several times and really enjoy it. The gyros are really good and so are the fries. I got a cheese pita for my kid and I think I'll order it for myself some time because whatever cheese they use is delicious. Normally I'm not a fan of chicken gyros but theirs is delicious. They seasoned the chicken really well. We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"There are a few decent Greek restaurants in Chandler, but this one is our favorite.  

The food is always high quality and the customer service top-notch.  We've met who we think is the owner and he's a pleasant gentleman who very much reminds one of what a Greek restaurant owner would be like:  Humorous, aims to please, ready to do whatever it takes to ensure you enjoy your experience. (If he's not the owner, then he's just a really friendly Greek guy who should go ahead and buy the place so I don't look like an idiot for typing this.) 

The gyros are delicious and hearty.  The dinner platters are large enough to require an adjustment of the belt after eating. I am particularly fond of their basmati rice and their homemade tzatziki sauce.  I always order extra.  Don't judge.  It's THAT good.

All-in-all, this is our go-to Greek place."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Place was dirty!  Tables and chairs are old but that's not an excuse for the nasty tables."}
{"text":"I was having a hard time finding not only a small business, but one that was family owned and built off nothing but hard work. You can tell this is one of those places. The food was phenomenal and they put their hearts in it. I had the original gyro but added feta and kalamata olives"}
{"text":"Let's start with the service. I feel alot of places could learn from these people. This is the kindest most friendly service I've had in a long time. I would recommend this place for that reason alone.
 I ordered the gyro for lunch. It was good, but failed to make it into my top 5, which is a disappointment, cause of the reviews I was thinking it was a sure placement. The service is what pushed my rating to 4 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I love gyros, but getting a good one is a hit or miss affair.  I'm happy to report, this place is a definite hit.  I've had gyros in many places, but none better than this.  The meat was tender, flavorful, and plentiful- the real thing off a rotisserie.  The tzatziki was creamy, and the pita was soft and fresh.  For 6.99 you get a combo with a soda and choice of Greek Salad or fries.  We both had the salad and were not disappointed, the dressing was flavorful without being overly tart.
We haven't had the baklava yet- we brought that home to enjoy with coffee later, but it looks divine.  The brownie that we also brought home with the same intention somehow is now somehow half as big as when we left the restaurant.  Hmmm, wonder how that happened.  Probably has something to do with the fact that it was fabulous.  And it was just two bucks!
The only thing this place doesn't have is great atmosphere, but I don't see that as a negative; if it did, it would just make it more expensive, and it's perfect, just the way it is.  And the staff is super-friendly, too.
We're already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great locally owned family restaurant! 

We had the original gyro and the chicken kabob platter. We also ordered some grilled chicken and vegetables for our daughter, which was a healthier and cheaper alternative to the kids menu. 

Thank you for the hospitality. The food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I chose this place at random and im more than pleased. Lamb and rice are on point. And the baklava is very tasty. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Chicken gyro was stuffed to the brim with moist chicken and was absolutely delicious. I licked my plate. When we first came in I was starving and mentioned low blood sugar as we ordered. Becky behind the counter rushed out with a desert to help me feel better while my chicken was cooking, whaaaaa?!? Nicest people ever, quick wonderful service, I can't wait to come back. PS the baklava was the best I've ever had, don't skip dessert!"}
{"text":"Really yummy food. My special prefer was correct. SUPER friendly people! They are the type of people that make you want to come back just because of how awesome they were! I'll absolutely be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! The service is always amazing and the food is great! We have gotten catering from Greeks Grill several times for family events and it never disappoints. They are always very generous with their portions, and always throw in some free goodies. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business. I've been blessed to have worked at an establishment where venders occasionally bring us catered lunches. The food from the Greek Grill never disappoints!

I made it a point to go to the restaurant after eating several of the catered meals. Everything is fantastic! A must on your restaurant list."}
{"text":"For a small eatery, the food is great. The hubby and I both ordered the Gyro combo pita and it was tasty. The staff is friendly and accommodating. We will surely return next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Greek restaurants I have been to in Arizona.  The food was wonderful.  I had the Gyro and Fries and everything was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place was excellent!! Best falafel I have had anywhere!! Greek salad was good too...just not best ever. I will definitely be back again and would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! The food is so fresh and delicious!!! Nothing on the menu is bad! My favorite is any pita sandwich!!! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"This is a completely honest review.  The food is outstanding.  I had the chicken kabob with rice.  As far as the place itself, it is a dive.  We walked in on a Saturday evening and there was not a person in the restaurant.  We couldn't decided whether to stay or not..we stayed.  The tables and chairs were just a mess, one table had boxes on it, the drink area was blocked by chairs and had a vcr/dvd player on the counter full of dust that was blocking the silverware.  The iced tea canisters were empty.  When we ordered and tried to pay with a credit card, the guy requested that we pay in cash because he was not going to get the machine to work.  We paid in cash which he put right in his pocket.  The next patron and 3 following, all paid with a credit cards with no issues.  The food was good, but I won't go back there to eat.  It was terrible sitting in that place.  There is definitely more money spent on the fancy TV and probably a lot of time watching it.  The odd things in the place just made it strange.  They sell pop tarts on the counter and the ice cream cooler caked in dust was unappealing as we sat there.  Too bad for them, the food is really good but I won't recommend going there to eat.  Take out---a possibility."}
{"text":"being paleo, there aren't many fast food options that are quick and easy. i've got in'n'out and chipotle.... and now greek food! 

my boxing gym is in the next plaza over and i thought i'd try this place after a long night of working out and not wanting to cook or clean. Greeks is a small, family owned restaurant located in the Waterfall shopping center on Alma School. it's got a really nice cozy feel to it and you know that this place is pretty legit. i believe that the owner and his daughter were working the night i walked in. they were both extremely nice and made a few recommendations on the menu. i went with the gyro plate (no pita). the price was really reasonable (~$9).

the food came fairly quickly and i was sent on my merry way. when i got home, i couldn't believe the amount of meat that was stuffed into the to go container. it was incredible! at other Greek food places i have experienced here in the valley, they usually skimp on the meat and add extra salad. not this place. the meat was juicy and flavorful, the greek salad was extremely fresh and made well, and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. perfect! i've definitely added The Greeks Grill to my fast food rotation from now on :)"}
{"text":"Love it!!!  Great Food, Good Service, Delivery, small family owned and very friendly. What's not to like!!!  Definitely a return trip restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This is literally a must have on every trip to the Phoenix area!  Off the beaten path and in a shopping center you will find some of the best Greek food you could place in your mouth!  Fred always provides a delicious meal of the best chicken Gyro and baklava ever!!!  Not only is the food delectable but the entire family is so warm and friendly that you would think you just left your grandmas kitchen table!"}
{"text":"Their gyros are delicious! This is the spot forsure. I'm super picky about my gyros, it's hard to find a decent gyroStaurant and this ones above decent- super kind staff too."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers brought me here...as I was craving some good food and I found it here. 

Things I loved:
Very clean!
Delicious Hummus, buttery, soft pita!
Home made Falafal YUM! 
Great tasting Gyros piled high with meat - my Gyro over- floweth! 
Baklava! 
and above and beyond service from \"Becky\" who was all smiles and made us feel like family first time there. 
Good energy and vibe.  She \"runs the joint\" and made us want to come back soon. Can't wait to try other things on the menu like Dolmathes. Keep up the outsanding work The Greek's Grill! 

EF-HARI-STO = (Thank you) in Greek."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering pick up through Yelp. My food was ready within 10 minutes. 

The lady at the counter provided great service! Very nice and personable. She even threw in a complimentary baklava! (This could be a gesture since it was a Yelp Eat24 order, but I appreciate it nonetheless)

I ordered the original gyro pita combo with fries and a sprite. 
There was a generous amount of meat, which was also well seasoned, however, I would've preferred it with a little more tzatziki as it was a little dry. 
I was excited to see that the fries were seasoned, but unfortunately was underwhelmed because they were so soggy. I thought maybe it lost its crisp since it was packed in a to-go box- but I've ordered from a different Greek restaurant before and was pleased with nice crispy fries. 

The lady at the counter did mention that there were some new cooks in the back so I'm understanding of the hiccups. I would come back and give them another try if I'm in the area for the kind service."}
{"text":"My favorite take-out. Tastey foods and a great variety. Nice chef who always says HI. It is a mom and pop place that I don't mind eat in or taking out. Chandler PD seem to love this food too."}
{"text":"I had a chicken kabob and gyro platter.  Really good and Greek authentic. Nice customer service as well!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place. I love it and crave it several times a week. Aside from being out of town for work, or on vacation, I have eaten here at least once, mostly twice a week since we discovered this place in January. I mostly get take out for my husband and myself on my way home from work, and we have yet to have a bad meal. Everything is delicious. 
We have tried pitas (chicken, gyro, falafel and salmon), salads- always fresh and the chicken perfect, their baklava and soup. In the colder months when they make their lemon chicken soup, I dream about this stuff! It's to die for. I have told everyone about it and have a few friends and coworkers who also are addicted to the soup. I should probably learn how to make the soup myself, since I love it so much, but why bother when I know I couldn't reach the same level of perfection? 

Fred, and the lovely ladies (who I assume are his relatives), who work there are all such nice people. Everything they make is fresh, and they take pride in the food they serve. Sadly, they aren't open on Sundays, but it gives me a reason to look forward to work on Monday- I'll be calling them for take out on my way home! :)"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and great service. Love the hummus and dolmades. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and the food was great. The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful. She gave us a complimentary baklava which was very good. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast!!! Seriously $3 for a huge plate of eggs, toast and home-style potatoes. Such an awkward location but I think that makes eating here even more fun. Great owners, very friendly!"}
{"text":"Food and service are fantastic. Best gyros around and the dolmas are wonderful. Our 7 year old ate the entire gyros sandwich without taking a break it was so good."}
{"text":"Hummus was amazinggggggggggg!!! The owner is a great man and was very kind and welcoming to us. Definitely would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Greek food!! Traditional Greek cuisine in a mom and pop atmosphere. The dolmades and baklava are a must!! It's hard to find good dolmades. The owners are so warm and welcoming! I love this place! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome gem tucked away in a plaza. Greeks Grill is family owned and they are super nice. The owner definitely knows the meaning of customer service, the first time we went we sat and ate there and the owner gave us free hummus which tasted amazing, great blend of spices and just the right amount of olive oil. I ordered the original gyro which was stuffed full of fresh ingredients, the meat was so moist and had great flavor. My Fiance had the Chicken Shawarma pita, that as well was stuffed to the top of the pita with meat and fresh vegetables. The food is amazing and has become our favorite spot to eat when we are craving for some Greek food. They have great prices and always have some sort of lunch special going on."}
{"text":"Got take out for lunch here today.  Had salmon pita with side Greek salad-a great, reasonably healthy and reasonably priced lunch.  Salad was solid with good feta cheese and dressing.  Most importantly for me, the salmon pita contained a generous amount of salmon-and for $6! The owners also gave me a small piece of baklava for free, which I appreciated and enjoyed.  Will come back here for lunch."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim, and boy were we happy we did! We had chicken pitas with fries, and it was delish! Stuffed with quality chicken & ingredients. The fries were seasoned Greek fries & amazing! Looking forward to returning!!"}
{"text":"Had food from here at least twice and each time it has been so good! Everything tastes great and its definitely something different from the regular eateries in the area. Be sure to give it a try!!"}
{"text":"My GF and I both like Greek food, and I decided we should have an early, big lunch before we head to the airport to catch our flight to Washington State, since we won't be having dinner till after 8 pm tonight. So we went here and ordered two dinners -- My GF had a chicken kabob dinner and I ordered the combo gyros and lamb kabob dinner. They were freaking huge!!! Both came with two big dinner salads as starters. Then we got the meats with rice and grilled veggies. My GF's kabob had 8 pieces of chicken breast, and I got 8 pieces of lamb chunks on my kabob. My gyro meat was in slices; about half a pound of it. We both couldn't finish the meal and took some home so K can feed the kids with it tonight. When I cannot finish the meal, you know it must be huge!!"}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst Greek food places I have ever been to my rice was microwaved and the gyro meat was mushy and to top it off the hummus came from a 5 gal tub don't waste your time . It is garbage!"}
{"text":"This place isn't the prettiest to look at, but the food is very good.  I had the Zues Pita and it was definitely good enough for a return trip.  The interior could use some updating."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing! This was our first time and we decided to stop in after reading the great reviews. This place did not disappoint! We got the chicken kabob platter combo (delicious and packed with flavor) and the gyro sandwich with fries (fries are cooked to perfection, crispy and golden with perfect amounts of seasonings). The salad was also really good; it was fresh and came with a good amount of veggies that accompanied a flavorful dressing. This place is a new favorite and we'll be coming back again very soon!"}
{"text":"My pregnancy craving led me to this tiny hole in the wall spot today. I ordered the simple Gyro Platter with rice, I'd definitely go here again. The lady who was working was welcoming and the atmosphere itself was cute and quaint."}
{"text":"First time eating here I'm vegetarian so I decided to try the falafel pita, Delicious could use a little more sauce but all around has great taste. Got a side of basmati rice, so tasty moist fluffy and flavorful. I ordered through Eat24 and I live 15 mins away when I got there to pick up my food was still warm."}
{"text":"at first walk in, this place had  a stinge that frightens me but feeling adventurous all you yelpers giving this place 4 stars i decided to stay when i walked in the place looked like it needed a serious cleaning which it does the tables were all dusty lookin and the high top i sat at was stickey with left over food spills and all the hot pepper sauce containers were about a 1/10th full and needed a good wipe down as well. the owners were congeniel but had a hard time under standing my order from the 6 breakfast items they offered. once they figured out i wanted the sausage omlet with cheddar(whats so hard) it took about 15 minutes to get it now the good part it was a damn tasty omlet and great potatos. doubt i will go back just because the place is so filthy"}
{"text":"I loooooove the Greeks Grill! It's something of a hole-in-the-wall, but the good is amazing. The gyro meat is so moist and flavorful and the fries are so good they're evil - like I know You know you shouldn't, but you can't resist!"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly (Becky) and food is consistent and reliable. I've only had their Greek salad and falafel and both have been very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I mean... what's not to love about a cozy little Greek grill?! It's family owned and operated and the whole family is so sweet and puts a lot of care into what they do. 

I also agree with the review before me... amazingly affordable breakfast with nice hearty portions. 

For lunch, I tend to stick with the shwarama sandwich combo. And yes, they do sell gum. Trust me, you will need it. ;) 

Highly recommended to anyone in the area for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and saw this place near the area I was visiting. While I was expecting it to be decent, I wasn't expecting to be blown away like I was. Got the chicken shwarama sandwich and I can honestly say it was one of the best sandwiches that I've had. Everything was super fresh and everything was seasoned very very well. Fries that came with the sandwich were very good as well. Very inexpensive and the portion was perfect for lunch. Talked with the staff for a little bit and they were very friendly. Hands down... just go here. It is amazing. Will become a go to place for me every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is cheap and is definitely worth trying. I ordered grilled salmon, while my co-worker ordered grilled kabob. Like all the other reviews, the salad is very good as well.  Very tasty and filling!"}
{"text":"I had a few extra minutes to eat lunch today and wanted to do something different.  I ventured out to the Greek's Grill in Chandler.  The place is clean and amazingly affordable.  I had my Grecian favorite - the gyro (actually I think it originated in Chicago, but anyway.............).  It was cooked just right, not burnt or dry.  It had the right balance of tomatoes, yogurt and lettuce.  It came with a free drink and fries.  The fries are exceptional.  They are done with sea salt, oregano and olive oil.  Simply exceptional.  

In addition, they provide a china plate and real silverware.  My combo was under $8.00.  I was actually tempted to break my plate and yell oopa! But refrained.  

The food is delicious and priced right."}
{"text":"This is a great Greek restaurant. If you're looking for authentic, juicy, fresh food this is your spot! The gyro meat was off the hook!"}
{"text":"BEST Greek food in the valley! So glad we found this lil gem a few years ago. We love it so much they catered our wedding in March!"}
{"text":"Gyro was fresh, soft, and meat was tasty. The baklava was so yummy and gooey. Staff was super friendly. Found a new favorite."}
{"text":"We ordered the salmon pita platter, salmon pita combo, and gyro pita. The pitas themselves were thick and soft, grilled just right. The salmon was not salmon filets, more like salmon burger style. But super tender and had just the right amount of flavor. The rice in the platter was a tinge salty, but good. The red and green peppers, lettuce and tomatoes were super fresh. The tomatoes in particular were SUPER red and omg delish. Was a good compliment to the meal. The gyro meat was tender, and cooked just right. Amazing customer service. We will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and friendly staff. I love hole in the wall ethnic restaurants. You get a lot of food for the money."}
{"text":"Excellent Authentic Greek food at inexpensive prices.  The owner is fabulous !! Place is a small quiet place but very welcoming.  The food is amazing.  Definently a place to go when you are hungry."}
{"text":"I look to yelp always when I am going somewhere new. Based on the reviews and my love of Greek food I was excited to get my food from here. I ordered chicken schwarma and hummus for pick up at 11:15am, arrived at 11:14am. The people were nice as I paid for my food, then as I'm walking out the couple starts bickering loudly which I found a bit rude. I drove four miles to my destination. I opened my bag to oil everywhere, an inconvenience but I don't think much of it because I know the yelpers never do me wrong. I unwrap my schwarma, it's soggy and doused in oil and smells strong. I'm still giving it the benefit of the doubt.... I pick it up and it is cold. Not cool. Cold. As if they made it when I ordered it at 9:30am. I could give more detail but I'll just say it didn't taste good. Plain and simple. 
I open the hummus. It smells like a can of olives. No flavor, I couldn't eat it. 
I really am not terribly picky. Nor a food snob. And I just won't be coming back here unfortunately."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!  Service is always top notch, food is consistently fresh!! Have been many times and always great food...  Cannot go wrong coming here for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"One name: Falah who's the owner...great guy!! My first time here and he says \"baklava is fresh...here try some\" I ended up buying more and it's a good thing I did!! 
Greek wraps on the west side are hard to beat...this place is a very very very close 

Who makes pita from scratch? This guy does...great atmosphere. The panera of pitas I would say"}
{"text":"Today was our first time visiting. We ordered the gyro philly and Greek salad. Very tasty and large portions. Becky was very friendly and helpful and brought us a sample of hummus to try. Also gave us 2 baklava desserts!  We will definitely be back soon to for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyro I have tried in the east valley! Also Fred is a very nice man and makes you feel right at home. This gyro will be busting out of your pants after you lick your fingers:)"}
{"text":"Good food at good prices. This place has been our favorite local Greek food restaurant for a few years now. It has recently changed management. I've been here twice since the change and the chicken pita seems about the same. The previous management was good, but it appears to still be family-run and the service is still great. I wouldn't be surprised to find out the new owners were previous customers that liked it the way it was. They have only made a few minor changes here and I think they are improvements (i.e., real plates and silverware). Give them a try. We want to keep them in business!"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel pita combo with greek salad instead of fries. It was perfect! My boyfriend had a simply and refreshing Greek salad. It tasted good. The staff is friendly and they even offered us some baklavas in exchange of help with their computer. We will certainly go back!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best Greek food I've tasted in some time. In fact, maybe ever. We had the Falafel Pita and Chicken Gyro with some baklava. I would come back and eat it all again. They have a good variety in the menu. Becky our server/cashier was so kind and friendly and the owner even came out to say hello. We will be back with friends."}
{"text":"Pretty legit Greek gyros and Greek salad. Had an opportunity to taste their catering for lunch. Nice real slices of gyros meat. Great prices for individual plates."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday, they were close to closing.

Being from the East coast I expected them to tell us they wouldn't be able to serve us. Instead they were welcoming and made sure the ice tea was filled for us the entire stay. The food was great, and the portions were very generous with the dinner platters.

I highly recommend this place for Mediterranean cuisine at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food was ok. But, I ordered lamb, but I was brought steak and told it was lamb, by the male cook. And when I called him out on it I was lied to my face, the rest of the restaurant backed him up. I know what Lamb tastes like, I am not making a mistake. These people are liars and schemers in my eyes and I will not be back."}
{"text":"The Zues Pita! Chicken, Gyro, Falafel, Feta, Tzatziki. Delicious. The hummus is great. Five stars for the food, hack a star for the oddly slow but friendly service."}
{"text":"Nice people, busy, but quality is consistent. I called and placed my order ahead, they waited until I got there to put the fries in the cooker, to make sure the fries were fresh, great service! They have free WiFi if you need it."}
{"text":"I agree with Krista S. This place needs a major facelift! The furnishings are old and grungy and would be rejected at a goodwill. So for atmosphere it doesn't deserve any stars.  The chicken shawarma had a curry type of seasoning, more Indian than Greek.  I do not like curry and we would not have ordered it if the menu had described it accurately. The gyro was good but nothing so outstanding that I would make a special trip back for it.  The French fries were well seasoned and were fresh and crispy - loved them, but I don't return to places when only the side dish impresses."}
{"text":"Definitely the best greek place I've ever been to hands down! This moms and pops restaurant helped me see what greek food really is all about. Their wonderful customer service and especially \"mama\" herself makes us want to come again! They're almost like family in terms of how they treat us and I couldn't be any happier with their food and service. 6/5 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"New favorite greek spot. We came here for a late lunch on Saturday.  It was just what my boyfriend loves EMPTY. Anyway, food was freshly made to order. All ingridents were great and fresh. Hummus was yum and they even had siracha sauce that you could add to spice it up. All and all it was great. Cant wait to go back and try Chicken Cesar Pita."}
{"text":"OPA! Delicious Greek food on the quick! I've eaten in for a lunch in between shopping/errands, and called ahead to pick up meals to bring home for dinner. Not fancy inside, very casual, but when we ate in for lunch, it was hearty and came on real dishes, giving it a homey feel! I can vouch for the falafel, gyros, chicken schwarma, pita/hummus, and Greek fries; all top-notch! And the folks who run the place are amazingly kind and authentic."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst gyros we have ever tasted (considering they said they were one of the best in the valley). We went here because the reviews are amazing and we were craving for a real good gyro. My boyfriend went to the restroom and noticed that they don't have any fresh gyro meat spinning considering its lunch rush. We got our gyro weirdly fast (too fast that you know you didn't get a fresh one). The meat was dry as expected, and the pita was room temp. It was so disappointing. We asked our server if the gyro was fresh and she said yes. But when I went to the restroom I saw the chef just chopping gyro that wasn't on a spinner and it looked cold cos he was holding it with bare hands. 

Extremely Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place !!  The gyros are perfect and fries are very tasty .  Staff is always friendly.  Best gyro in the area"}
{"text":"Very good, quality food. Their pitas are my favorite I've ever had. So soft and fresh. We have liked everything we've gotten but our favorite is their skewer platters. I love the lamb and my husband loves the chicken. The baklava is definitely worth ending with. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!!!!! The food is amazing and the owners are just as good as it gets. I am middle eastern and can cook the food , so I am not usually impressed with greek food however this place is the ONLY one I will go to if my family and I go out to eat... I really do love it here"}
{"text":"Always a fan when I find  a place where they are from Chicago, The gyro was great, and the cheese fries made it even better."}
{"text":"This just opened last summer and boy was I glad to see it--fast, inexpensive, good food, VERY friendly owners/clerks, even gave me a comp spanakopita to try to get me \"hooked\"!  I would eat here all the time if I lived in town."}
{"text":"Good food.  Small location but I chose to cater from here for a work event.  It was disappointing the food wasn't ready, so I was over an hour late returning with the food for 40 people... so that put a sour taste in my mouth.  They really should have planned on starting cooking earlier.  While I enjoyed the food, I've not been back since."}
{"text":"Love this place, cheap, tons of food and awesome food...the staff are nice too!!!"}
{"text":"Love the gyro meat from this restaurant. Much better tasting then Pita jungle. Portions are very good and the french fries are always hot and crispy.  I changed up this time and had a gyro salad the helpings of meat were very generous and the salad was good.  It is a small little storefront restaurant not fancy but a small local owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Feeling a little hungover one Saturday morning, I was craving fried foods, so me and my guy headed out to get me some falafel and fries.  I had read the great reviews for the Greeks Grill so I was excited to give them a try.  Becky, the woman who took our order was so sweet...and I remember her name because it's the same as mine.  The food came out fairly quickly and it was delicious!  I got the falafel pita with hummus instead of tzatki sauce and it was sooo good...and the fries were amazing!  My guy got the special which was a gyro cheesesteak and he loved it!  Fried foods are an occasional treat for me, but we'll definitely be back next time I have a craving!"}
{"text":"The menu for this restaurant is pretty standard Greek food, but still really tasty. The original gyro is awesome, and they overfilled my pita sandwich with meat. Yum! They use fresh ingredients each day. Their hummus was awesome, just a little bit spicy, but not hot. The pita was hot, soft and fresh. The combo meals come with either fries or a side salad, and both are awesome. They season the fries with a little bit of something yummy that I couldn't identify. 
As the other folks mentioned, the service at this place is amazing. The owner is the sweetest guy, so friendly and helpful, and offered to help me walk my to-go order out to my car, since my hands were full. He shook my hand, asked for my name, (and then called me by my name!) and invited me to come back. You can't get more endearing than that.  I'll definitely go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least once a week for lunch for the last two years. The food is tremendous and the owners are accommodating. There is a loyal lunch crowd ranging from groups of police officers to salon workers and tech geeks. All of us need to come together during this crazy time we live in. Whether you wear a blue tie, a red tie.. or maybe no tie at all. We can all come sit down together and enjoy a nice Gyro Combo with fries."}
{"text":"I was in Chandler on business and I actually came here twice because it was so good. The pita was fresh and soft, the meat was delicious. I didn't experience the owner, just his daughter and she was very pleasant. No frills, just a damn tasty Gyro and the fries are surprisingly good for steak fries!"}
{"text":"I really tried to like the Gyros. Do I need to move back to Chicago for real eats?"}
{"text":"Excellent-great food at a reasonable price. Order at the counter & food bought to your table. Fast food atmosphere but well worth it! Would definitely return & recommend! Had the combo platter & could not finish!"}
{"text":"This place has great food! They are also hiring so contact them at shainanajor@yahoo.com! Please and thank you!"}
{"text":"I do go back weekly - just went tonight, and it's better every time. And now the owner recognizes me (I think?) and sometimes gives me free bachlava - and it's soooooo good. And I don't even like sweets. 
The only thing different now is that I get the chicken kabob platter because I love the grilled vegetables and they know it's me when I phone order because I always get 2 extra tzatziki sauces b/c they make it in-house and it's mouth-watering. But 1 just isn't enough for me. :)"}
{"text":"Great place! Had lunch here and the food is phenomenal. Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today and omg it's so yummy that I had to write a review!!! I ordered the chicken gyro combo that came with fries and a drink for $8.50 after tax. I asked the owner what a certain dessert was that was sitting in the pan on the counter and he gave me a piece for free! Very friendly workers. Now back to the food...let's just say, I got it to go and when I got home I was barely able to eat it because my family devoured it!!! I took one bite and was moaning because it was so delicious, and my sisters and parents came into the kitchen to check out what I was eating and asked to try it... Then they just kept taking more and more of my food cause it was sooo good! Now they owe me. Lol so the fries are seasoned to perfection, the chicken is marinated and juicy topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and tahini sauce on a pita....nom nom I'm getting hungry just talking about it!!!"}
{"text":"Best gyro in the vicinity hands down. Loaded with tasty meat and piping hot. I've been to a lot of gryo joints in Chandler and Gilbert, but this is the only I return to now (I feel a little guilty for abandoning my previous favorite with a really nice owner, but the Greeks Grill Gyro is my master now). The interior is cramped and utilitarian, otherwise I'd give the place 5 stars just for that gorgeous gyro."}
{"text":"Love their food. Family owned and operated. Really good and healthy options on the menu. Love the chicken pita sandwich so good. And the greek fries are a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place! The gyros are really and packed with meat! Great customer service too! It takes a little while to get your food but that's because they cook to order!"}
{"text":"Soft tasty pitas on freshly sliced superbly seasoned gyro meat. Fresh crisp lettuce with sweet red peppers, red onion, olives and grape tomatoes with homemade Greek salad dressing... baklava crispy layered phyllo with buttery honey drizzle - as close to a bite of heaven on Earth as you can get. Been to many Greek casual places but none as good as this. Owner friendly, fun, hospitable. Come here for casual delicious Greek food, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!!! Locally owned and operated by two of the sweetest people you'll ever meet Fred and Anna. They make the food fresh everyday and you can taste it. If you want fresh and delicious Mediterranean food then this is your spot."}
{"text":"Dirty tables everywhere! Sticky, grimy, old drink machine.  I had the chicken gyro, it wasn't great, kind of dry. Just cut up strips of chicken with pepper. I was the only one in the place when they started emptying out the garbage in front of me. I hate when places do that while I'm eating!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the Dean's list for cleanest restaurants Saturday took the family and tried it  sometime with kids it's hard.  Not here. Greek Salad was good Gyro meat was shaved thin and fresh.  Rice was on point and the Chicken Kabob was super tender and full of flavor. Small place. Nothing fancy just good food from an owner that cares. Look at the pix."}
{"text":"The food is good and the price is very reasonable. Tried the special at that day. It was well cooked. Baklava is very good!! Giving it 4 stars only for its environment. Its kind of depressing!!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Greek food I have EVER had!!! I am never disappointed when coming here, and will make the drive from Maricopa when craving hits. Woman behind the counter is super nice and always makes us feel like we're at home or apart of the family."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon Pita but changed my mind while watching some other customers order go by.  The Combo Meat ($13.99) gives you a choice of two meats.  The gentlemen recommended the Chicken Kabob and said they would do the salmon for me and spoke to the lady who's cooking to let her know.  The Dinner Plate comes with rice and salad.

Overall the food was good.
The gentleman was tops with service and recommendations too.
I came here based on reviews, and it's a bit out of my way, so overall I think we've got Greek and Mediterranean options that are much closer and equivalent in taste and value."}
{"text":"The best chicken kabobs I had in the valley. Their chicken shawarma is also delicious. I tried the lamb and beef which were alright. You will have to try their chicken kabobs if you go to this place for sure, and if you like them let me know. I took so many of my friend there and so far none of them complained.
But heads up call them before you go and place the order before 15 mins."}
{"text":"Very fresh food. I had the falafel and it was fried perfectly. The sandwich has tzaziki and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Friendly service. Good prices. Dont be turned off by the shopping center."}
{"text":"Best greek food I have ever had. Fred is awesome! The chicken kabob meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful. The rice was very tasty. Baklava...OMG...baklava. Love the place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek places closed down so I decided to give the Greek Grill a shot. Let me start out by saying, the service there is phenomenal. The workers were very accommodating and eager to please. The food was amazing. I have eaten a lot of Greek food in my days and I would argue that this is one of the best Gyros and fries I have had in Phoenix/Gilbert area. Their French fries are so delicious. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"First time here! Looked up a place to order a gyro on my way home from work and this one caught my attention on yelp. I ordered the chicken shawarma pita and let me tell you, this is the best gyro I've ever had! The pita bread was so soft and fresh and the chicken was delicious. I'm addicted. I'll definitely be coming here again. Thank you for existing."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time today and it was so yummy!! I had the chicken kabobs platter and he had the original gyro platter. So much food and it all was wonderful:) We will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"Love the gyro's here, meat is fantastic, taziki sauce is awesome,all is fresh including the amazing baklava!"}
{"text":"I had to check twice to see if this was really the place we ate based on the other yelp reviews.  I went expecting a greek dive with 4-5 star food.  There's dives and then there's ewwww.   The place inside is disgusting - dirty and in need of a major facelift.  Even if the stuff is old you can try to get the grime off.  All I thought about while we were waiting for our food to get done was what Robert Irving and his Restaurant Impossible team would have said.  Plus - if the public areas are that dirty -what's the kitchen look like?  

 I originally tried to call in my order - but the guy on the phone couldn't understand what I was trying to order - so we gave up and just went to order the food in person.  We tried the Zeus Gyro and hummus.  Hummus was bland, blah, not worth eating.  The Zeus is stuffed with gyro meat (just your standard premade stuff), falafel (ok) and chicken - which tasted like weird curry spices and not like greek food at all.  Yep - it's a big pile of meat - all mediocre meat."}
{"text":"We went here a month ago.  We had an Entertainment coupon, so our meal was about half the cost.  The food was good.  The bathroom was neat & clean.  It looked like a family owned restaurant.  Though the people were courteous, I felt like we were intruding on them.

I did feel a bit out of place here, though very casual.  The service was substandard, but the food and the prices were good.  Would we come here again?  Maybe.  I do value good service."}
{"text":"The portion size is large, however, I am a Greek food connoisseur and I have very high expectations. I ordered the combo plate with gyro meat and chicken shawarma. The gyro meat was very salty and dry, as if it had been shaved well in advance (poor lamb). The chicken shawarma was also dry and reminded me more of a bland curry. I upgraded to the Greek fries and those too left much to be desired. There are at least three other Greek restaurants within 5 miles that are fresher, less expensive and exhibit more flavorful seasoning."}
{"text":"Had a coupon (not Groupon, but similar offer), and my wife and I dropped in for lunch.  Let me assure you, we'll be back!  Excellent food, and really superior service.  They clearly pay attention to what they're doing.  One of the best Gyros I've had in the Phoenix area!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Warning: this is a bit of a novel... To get to the parts about the food and service, skip to the end... If you want to hear the story, read on.

This place is beyond ridiculous. My friend and I walk in after a race, are greeted by the owner, and a nice mother and daughter immediately start recommending items for us. 

My friend orders the chorizo breakfast and I the falafel pita (naturally). I am always very skeptical about ordering falafel because so many places just don't get it right. It's either been frozen, it's too greasy, or too dry. So, as you can tell, I was nervous. 

The owner is super friendly when taking our order and just made us feel as though we were at home. We talk to the other patrons in the restaurant for a while (it really says something that extremely friendly, intelligent people eat here), and then go take our seats outside. The woman cooking the good brings us out two of the most amazing plates of food I've seen in a while, and the owner follows her with the forks, airing us that the food is freshly made and that he hopes we enjoy it.

We dig in, and oh my goodness. The chorizo had the perfect amount of spice (according to my friend), and the falafel... oh, the falafel. It was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Just perfect! I have never enjoyed falafel that thoroughly; every bite was just a little piece of heaven. 

After finishing our meal, I had to step back inside to compliment the owner on the falafel, to which he responded by showing us just how truly fresh it is. They make a huge batch of it from scratch every day! I was so impressed by the quality and by how he made me feel right at home.

I thought things  couldn't get better, but as we were walking out, he wanted to make sure we had enough water since we had just run a race. Talk about a wonderful human being!

I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I yelped for local good eats and found this place.  I love good gyros, hummus and greek salad.  This was good.  The meat was perfect, shaved perfect thickness and perfect cooked.  Yummy hummus with lots of yummy pita bread.  Greek salad was just like you got it in Boston.  Middle of small neighborhood in Chandler and who would have thunk!"}
{"text":"Lamb kabobs are so yummy! We get the jalapeño poppers sometimes too and those are good as well! You will be left with gross Greek burps but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for take out that is not fast food, this is the spot. The Greek Grill has some great gyros and the mixed salad selection is excellent. A greek salad with the grilled chicken or keba added is excellent. The owner will come up with a few specials about twice a month and those are always worth checking out. He put some greek grill appetizers on the menu which are essentially gryo meat spring rolls and they are fabulous... So, for a meal that is not Jack in the Box... the Greek Grill is the way to go."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. So fresh and so delicious! We love it and have gone back many times now!! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Had the original gyro. Tender and flavorful meat!! I don't know if it's the owner that was working the cash register, but he is such a polite, hard working man! The tables were a little dirty, but they all work so hard in there it was nothing to complain about. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST hummus that I have found to date. Yeah, I'm kinda freaky that way, I only date hummus.

I called in a to go order on a Saturday afternoon so I could take a bunch of food to my friends house.

Everything was wonderful but I have had a better veggie pita at... wait for it...Gyros Express! But everything else I ordered here was better than there. The tzatiki and pitas were fantastic

The owner is a very sweet man named \"Fred\" I challenged that and said no Greek man is named \"Fred\". He laughed and told me his real name. This was a very tasty experience and we will be back! Thanks Fred!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, the falafel is consistently awesome. Definitely my favorite Greek spot."}
{"text":"Awesome Greek salad with gyro meat and falafel. Yum. Will be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"Finally! A Greek restaurant that knows how to make a gyros sandwich like we used to get back in Chicago. The Secret? Plenty of meat. Most area restaurants here that purport to serve Greek food skimp on the meat so you're eating mostly pita and onions, tomato, etc.. We enjoyed our meal here and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed, since this place had good Yelp reviews we thought we'd try it out instead of our usual go to for Greek/Mediterranean food. The food overall was just ok. We ordered 3 meals: Steak kabob platter, Gyro Platter, a Gyro and Chicken Shawarma platter and a side of Greek fries. The steak kabob was decent, the meat was a little tough but the flavor was good. I think this is the first time I've ever had chicken shawarma with such an overwhelming curry flavor. I love curry but it tasted like it hadn't been cooked down all the way, it had that raw seasoning taste. The gyro had nice flavor, but was salty. The rice unfortunately was also very salty. The Greek fries were basic, nothing special and the fries were underdone. I think the salads were the only solid thing we got, the lettuce was fresh, no wilted pieces. One of the most disappointing factors was they forgot our tzatziki. I ordered an extra side of tzatziki sauce and they remembered that one, so we had to share one sauce between 3 meals. We called to tell them and the lady we spoke to basically said 'well we're closing so unless we were coming back before they closed (which we wouldn't have made it) i don't know how to fix this for you. I can give you some tzatziki if you come back another day.' We paused because with the food being what it was we weren't convinced we would be back. As we were deciding she seemingly hung up. Now MAYBE we got disconnected, but I'm not sure. Either way, with the way the issue we had was handled on top of the food not being great, it's doubtful we'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST Greek I've had in AZ. 
It all started when a dog rep brought us lunch from Greek's Grill. Since that day, I literally jump for joy when I hear it's waiting for us in the break room. Let me just tell you that it's even BETTER fresh off the grill at the restaurant. I seriously could eat here everyday and not become bored. We met Fred tonight, and he is just the sweetest man. I will gladly visit this local establishment over those chain restaurants from here on out. 
Thanks for the hospitality and wonderful food, Greek's Grill!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Wish their hours were longer especially on weekends.  The food is always great.  Their rice is amazing and I love the chicken and lamb souvlaki platters.  Super reasonably priced also.  Best Greek food in town!"}
{"text":"First time here and let me tell you, I LOVED IT! The customer service was awesome and the food was just as great. I got the gyro dinner plate. The meat was delicious, the rice, pita bread were off the chain, and the Greek salad was so fresh, let me not forget about the dressing which you can tell they make fresh every day and not from a bottle. I'll be back and I'll definitely recommend this spot to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"I very much like this place. The service is always very friendly and quick. They have a great lunch special. I think they have some of the best gyros compared to a lot of the Greek places in the east valley. I'm very picky about my baklava and I think theirs is the best!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight after getting a pedicure for a quick dinner, and overall, it was okay.  The place serves really good greek food, and they serve a great menu of items. 

I went with the gyro pita with fries and a drink.  Food was tasty, but the place was HOT and STUFFY.  No air conditioning and no air circulation.  It was so uncomfortable! 

Overall, halfway decent place, great prices and good filling food."}
{"text":"Longtime user, first time reviewer! Please don't judge! After our dinner at The Greeks Grill I decided it was time to pay back the community that helped me through so many food dilemmas. Hubby wanted pizza for our Friday night dinner, I wanted Greek...boom...I won!!! After looking through our many Greek food options we decided to go with this little gem. When we pulled up there were not many people which made me a little leery, but not enough to scare me away. I had the Gyro combo w/salad & my other family members had Gyro combos w/fries. The pita was soft & yummy, the meat was flavorful & delicious, the salad had the tangy Greek dressing that I love & the fries were crispy on the outside & soft on the inside. Everything was great (not the best in the entire world, but really, really good!)!! The best part was the owner! He was so sweet! He showered our big group with hummus & pita on the house & topped us off w/baklava. Seriously the best customer service & he was just so cute! In my book that deserves 5 stars because service is part of the experience for me. Please give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always get the chicken greek salad because I am always trying to be good.  Today I splurged on the original gyro and it could not have been better!  The only thing that would have made it better is if I did not split it with my brother.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Such a great find! Delicious fresh food and friendly adult staff. Very refreshing to see such kind customer service and a good value. We will be back."}
{"text":"Greek HEAVEN. My favorite is the chicken kabobs with rice, gyro with greek fries. So good! They also have the best baklava. The owner, Fred, is the sweetest ever. SO SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"$5 for a gyro is a good price.  I've had $10 gyro's taste worse than this.  That's why this place get's 2 stars.

It was nothing to write home about.  I will have to find the perfect gyro in Phoenix somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!!  Family owned and everyone is very friendly and the food ROCKS!!  Find this place, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food I have found in Chandler so far. Also, it's nice to see that it's family owned and operated. Recommend the Gyro!"}
{"text":"Good gyro. The hummus was pretty bland, but had some spicy red pepper powder that my wife hated and I enjoyed.  I might come back here if I was in the neighborhood, but wouldn't drive very far for it."}
{"text":"Hands down best falafel sandwich ever!  Go there and order a falafel sandwich!  Your mouth and belly will thank you for it!  Then you'll thank me for making you happy!  Go falafel sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Falafel- fabulous. Chicken Kabob Combo is also excellent. The only thing missing were knives."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and needed a quick place to stop for lunch. Found this place on Yelp and I'm so glad we did. Food came out fast and was amazing! I had the chicken shwarma and my boyfriend had the Zeus Pita and both were fantastic and a great size for your money. We also shared the hummus as an appetizer. Additionally, the staff were very friendly and accommodating. When we are back in Phoenix, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It may not look like much, but I can truly say it is authentic. It is family owned I believe, and the Greek fries.... you need them! I like this spot for quick light lunch breaks (i order a small Greek salad and a side of Greek fries and its perfect). The service is great, quick polite service is always nice for people on the go like me. 

I would highly recommend the gyro (it is a bit heavy so I try not to eat it during my lunch hour). I really feel this is the closest you can get to having a Greek grandma."}
{"text":"My first time here. I was in the area and decided to try it because of the good reviews. I was not disappointed! Food was very fresh and full of flavor! Plenty of seating. restaurant was clean and customer service was exceptional! Very friendly staff. It seems to be a family run operation"}
{"text":"Fred & company have the secret recipe for the best damn Greek food in the valley. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait - order early for delivery - but that is because more and more people are finding out about this diamond in a strip mall. 

Everything is always tasty, fresh and homemade! You cannot go wrong with anything you order here but I recommend the Zeus (no falafel). Also the baklava is AMAZING! 

Run there and try it.... but if you see me coming, let me skip ahead in the line because I don't really want to wait for you."}
{"text":"Amazing. The food is awesome, and the staff is friendly. If you haven't tried the chicken or the Gyro, you need to."}
{"text":"This place was way better than I anticipated...loved the chicken shwarma and the Greek salad. VERY flavorful! Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Good food. The veggie gyro was good and the fries were just amazing."}
{"text":"Bravo!  This place is \"the bomb\".  Everything is homemade, fresh, and delicious.  Their fries are cut and fried on site, the meats are marinated and cooked to perfection.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable.  This was one of my favorite spots when I was working in the area.  As of Jan 1, 2010, they now charge for Credit/Debit transactions, so bring cash.  I have nothing negative to say about this place and encourage everyone to give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo delicious.  Great food and great ownership.  Put this on your list!  Their food is amazing - chicken, hummus, pita, baklava ....  everything I've tried there is good.  
Go!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I had the chicken pita with a salad and falafel. The five stars was given for the wonderful service. The gentleman that took my order was patient and so kind. He took time to explain the menu items and options. He's a shining example of excellent customer service! I'll return again!"}
{"text":"OMG this is the best Greek food I have had on the east side of the valley. Excellent prices and they even deliver. I am a fan'"}
{"text":"Great clean food. Friendly staff. Delicious chicken kabob plate. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The fresh pita bread and the gyro are just as delicious as the prior reviews suggest, however, if you plan to stray anywhere else on the menu you're liable to be disappointed. The hummus tastes like it came out of a jar... from a gas station, which was only slightly less disappointing than the dolmades which had no flavor at all. If you're looking to grab a quick Gyro for lunch this is the place for you, if you want to sit down and eat a good greek meal, you should pass on the Greeks Grill."}
{"text":"Maybe 4.5.

Very good food.  Most made fresh on premisses.  Good prices, fast service.  Odd location, but they really can't do anything about that.

Well worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I really dont like to give negative reviews but I must. Like other people said, the place is a dive, I will add the tables should have at least been wiped down. I was the only person there.  The only person working there took my order and made me a chicken kaboob platter with rice.

The chicken was dry from the microwave (I assume,kept hearing the bell go off) the block of rice that was served still had the marks of the pan it was in, but the microwave made it nice and hot.

The cashier/cook/waitress was very nice. I would give her 4 stars"}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of Greek food until I went to this place. The people working there are super nice and the food was great. I highly recommend it whether you like Greek food or not. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"While this place may not be the greates greek food in the world, it's all made fresh, and the service is great.  Also there is the convinience that I drive by there everyday.
Every time I order food there they give me extra of something.  The price is great.  I love the Greek-iness of the service, I'm from another mediterranean country and it's endearing.  The man who cooks, the owner I'm assuming talks with the same accent and demeanor as my dad, so how can I dislike it?
I recommed that people try these Greek burritos (I don't think they are in the menu anymore but they still make them), either meat or veggie.  They are the greasiest most awesome food ever!  So yes, I can only eat a couple until I hit oil-overload, but the flavor is amazing.  The veggie ones are curry-type vegetables, and they come in larger size, and the meat ones are little burritos, and again the flavor of the spices is amazing."}
