{"text":"If good bar food is what you're craving, this place has got it goin' on. Wings, sandwiches, burgers, fries -- all delish. Buffalo wings were perfectly crispy, the burgers (we've had the Tom, patty melt and bacon cheeseburger) were all great. French fries taste very fresh, and are not heavily salted (but if that's your thing, salt away!) and their potato salad is out of this world. This place is easily a favorite rotation."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars, but some drunk bros have been rude to my girlfriends on several occasions. Security is lacking."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place for turkey rueben in the whole world. I love them!!!!!! I never get anything else because they are the best. Ask for fries Bc they go really well with the sandwich. It's an awesome portion. Juicy! Full of meat, cheese! Yummmmm. I will always keep coming back to this place"}
{"text":"This is great neighborhood gem especially on a Monday night when wings are $.50 a wing and a tall Coors Light is $4! The three stars comes in with the downfall of that I seemed to be invisible to the bartenders. I don't know if this is one of those places where regulars get all the attention but I had to wait over 5 minutes to even get a hello and a menu. To get a second beer I had to wave my hand to even be noticed to order. This place made me feel awkward to be in."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a while...food ok....nice patio....had 2 waitresses so seemed a bit disjointed.  All of us got wings and waitress came and grabbed extra plates and wipes and I said something to the effect of -whoa, hey whoa- to get the napkins and wipes back and was told off for being rude and that her day job at the TV station people were way nicer!! WTH....I was just trying to stop her....she never asked if we were done....I work a FT day job too and don't need people being snippy with me if they had a bad day.    CHEEZZZZZZZ.  Will go to Firehouse from now on."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood  bar restaurant with average bar food. The wings are very good tho. I definitely recommend them. They also have a nice patio to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Got the rodeo chicken sandwich.  The bacon tasted really weird..didn't eat it.  Burger was way past well done.  Wings were pretty good and so were the fries.  Brownie dessert was the best thing on the table.  Service was slow.  I had higher hopes for this place."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The pizza is great. Good wings and burgers. Honestly I've never had a bad experience here. It's got a friendly staff, consistent quality and the bathrooms are clean. I like it."}
{"text":"We've visited The Wright Place a number of times and it's always just okay.  Not terrible, not great, not too expensive, not super cheap, food is just fine.  On our last visit I had a chicken caesars salad and my friend had wings and fries.  My salad was fine.  My friend liked his wings and fries.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.  The place does attract an older crowd, especially early in the evening. 

The restaurant  is located near and number of other restaurants and they share a parking lot.  There is additional parking across the street and I can see how the parking lot would get pretty packed on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a couple of friends on a Saturday night.  Typical suburban bar setup and menu. Bar was unusually loud but after too many beers that is to be expected.

I ordered a burger with cheddar cheese and sauteed mushrooms and my companions ordered wings and we shared spinach and artichoke dip and mozzarella sticks.  

Spinach dip was good and the mozzarella sticks were alright.  The issue was with my burger.  It was charred beyond recognition.  Wish they had asked how I wanted it cooked to spare them from murdering it.  

If I'm in the neighborhood again, I might give them another shot but after one visit I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"This is a pretty run-of-the-mill bar & grille.  The food is fine, but nothing special.  The beer selection is decent but not great.  I have been here a few times and it is always very clean-- a GOOD sign in my eyes!
What caused me to give a 2 star rating and not a 3 star?  The staff.  Don't get me wrong- they are pleasant, friendly and moderately attentive, but unless the place is busy, I feel like I just walked in on their group break-time.  They all gather at the far end of the bar and talk about who was cut on what night and how dead it was on such-and-such an evening.  This isn't just 2 employees chatting...recently it was 5 staff members sitting/standing around BS-ing.  We felt like intruders into their private party.  I have been to the Wright Place a handful of times and I ALWAYS witness that type of behavior."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, slow but friendly.  Food is great!  Recommend the turkey rueben and chips."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a few beers after work on a Friday.  Bar was about half full with bar patrons and some tables occupied.  Modest selection of draft beers, nothing special.  Decent selection of bottle beers, though.  Service was relatively efficient and friendly.  I understand the patio is the place to be in the summer, so I'll have to check it out in a couple months."}
{"text":"We were tired from a failed trio to Erie, Pa. Never been there before and let me tell you if you haven't been there yet just go to the islands. Anyhow, we visited on a Sunday evening. Our original plan on the way back from Erie was to go to Firehouse which is a favorite of ours. When we arrived our beloved Firehouse was a music blaring meat market. After narrowly escaping death on the golf course from a unfortunate golf cart accident we were in no mood for hip hop night. We strolled over to the Wright Place and were assisted by a very friendly bartender promptly. I had a California chicken melt which was awesome and my lady had something she loved. They had beers as big as your head and good food at a decent price. I like this place and would go again."}
{"text":"The wife and I were out for a mid-week motorcycle ride and decided to stop in for a late afternoon beverage and snack. We decided to sit outside; after a brief moment the standoffish bartender came to the table and asked what we wanted to drink. Then I asked if they had a menu. She pointed to the other end of the table and said, \"they're right there\" and turned and walked away. The waitress brought our drinks and asked us what we wanted . Sliders and French fries. Waiting for our food, we witnessed the bartender take another order from a table walked back to the bar and begin to make fun of the older customers to a male customer sitting at the bar.  A food runner- kitchen help brought our order; he was pleasant and speedy.  I wanted ketchup for the fries, but the bottle was empty. No one came to the table to see if everything was ok and check to see if we needed another drink. They were super slow and the help was interested in playing on their phones and smoking right off the deck.  

As for food quality, the French fries were fresh cut, hot and plentiful.  Very good.   The sliders were run of the mill.  

Overall, outside of the French fries, the experience was negative.  

Their tag line: The Fun Tavern.  
Their truth: The dysFUNctional Tavern.  

We will not go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in The Wright Place for a birthday party the other night and was surprised to see how nice it is since it was renovated.  That renovation took place years ago, if that tells you how often I make it to The Wright Place.  In my younger days, I spent a lot of time on their now nicely remodeled (and usable in the winter) patio, but after a friend started and then stopped dating a member of the kitchen staff, I had no real reason to go back.  But seeing how nice the place is now, I'd definitely go back.  The two main bar areas are exactly the same as I remember them, but the incredibly large outdoor patio area - that's gated in by garage doors in the winter (and is Africa hot thanks to a couple amazing heaters) - adds another nice and kind of unique space to the bar area.  

Support your local pub and have a drink or five if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This weekends stop on our pick a spot.

The decor of this place is nice, just what you would expect from a nice bar.  Wood bar, warm environment, lots of tv's, kitchy art up on the walls... the norm.  That being said my wife and I ordered an appetizer, a meal each, and some wings (the menu leads you to believe that these things are to die for).  

Just for those who will go there in the future, there are other ways to do nachos besides throwing a bunch of chips on a plate then pilling onions, olives, jalape√±os, and cheese all over them.  If your going to feature something and suggest it to new comers to your restaurant, you may want to make it something rememberable.  

The meals were just straight bland.  My wife had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich (which it was nice to see it was a butterflied piece of chicken breast, i.e. fresh) and I had there Stacker (panini).  My wife's' food was fine, nothing special.  The only problem was that the coleslaw was so wet that it was dripping liquified mayonnaise onto the bun, the breading, everything.  Unfortunately mine was as well.  Wet, soggy italian bread soaked in liquid mayo... enough said.  The wings were just wings.  Fried, sauced, and served.  

If your looking for something different from a bar, you won't find it here.  Run of the mill bar.  Oh and lastly, for a bar... or tavern... 5 beers on tap and only one beer that was from the local brewery?  You would think there would be more in that realm."}
{"text":"We have come here numerous times and it's always a hit or miss. I've gotten a good amount of things on this menu but if you go here, only order the wings. They are good and juicy and definelty the best thing on the menu. 

I recently went and got a burger with mushrooms and onions on it. The burger you could tell was frozen. It was over cooked, had no flavor, and was very chewy. We also got the onion rings that were just medicore. The waitress we had too wasn't all that pleasant which didn't make it any better. 

They have a good selection of beer and alcohol and a ton of TVs so good if you want to watch sports. My only suggestion is don't go here if you want amazing food."}
{"text":"Newly renovated, much needed bathroom upgrade, and a heated patio!!! Much I say more......yeah probably.

Food: Pizza is good, American Melt is a fav of mine, wings are pretty good, they are trying a spin on the panini called a stacker which seems like a good idea but I have yet to try.  The Wright burger is tasty, almost as good as the Wright Place Nacho which is a must try the first time you roll into this joint.  

Ambiance:  There are two levels to this place.  The 'upstairs' is a bar wrapping around tv's and is perfect for watching the game along with additional seating around the bar.  The bottom area is just a long bar that leads to the bar outside.  I really don't have a preference, just as long as the beer is cold and the food is good.  Pretty sure there is a juke box, there was a lobster machine but think that might have disappeared.  

Staff:  Waitstaff and bartenders are attentive, and have been with the WP business for quite some time.  They are friendly MOST of the time.

This place is a must stop for me.  They run specials all the time and have a pretty good Super Bowl Party.  The owner(s) goes all out with free food and drink specials.  I suggest a cold beer and a shared nacho...mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I went here on Tuesday and the wings are 45 cents a piece. Typical bar food. Has a good size patio outdoor."}
{"text":"This place has so much potential but is lacking in so many ways. Let's just say my titos martini came out brown. Bartenders should know classic drinks and the difference between sweet and dry vermouth. And why is it so hard for this town to make their own margarita mix?"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. I have lots of highlights from my experience.......

5 stars for the outdoor patio. It's a cozy place to hang out, watch tv, and enjoy a cocktail

5 stars for the wings! Actually, 6 stars. They were very good. I ordered them with the dry rub and extra crispy. They were perfect.

5 stars for the french fries. They are hand cut and not greasy. 

Now, the burger. A major dislike. 0 stars for me. I ordered the special burger of the day....the black and blue burger. The bartender asked me how I would like it cooked, and I responded with my usual medium, medium rare. What did I get? A giant bun, and 4 skinny a** patties that were gross! It is impossible to make one of these 'medium'. Why not take the 4 disks and make one GOOD patty? I was totally bummed. 

Get the wings....... Scrap the burger."}
{"text":"This place is \"A-OK\". 
We visited prior to a Captain's Game. 

Patio is nice, we got seated in the last table farthest away from the inside so I think that the service wasn't the best for this reason. 

I ordered the Irish Breakfast Wrap (corned beef, eggs, fries in a tortilla). Twas OK, but really nothing special. Also had some of the sweet potato fries. Now, those were pretty good especially since they came with a cinnamon-y sweet sauce to dunk them in. My hubs got one of the chicken sandwiches. It was decent. 

Overall, this place has decently priced pub-type food. I did not partake in any adult beverages so I cannot comment on the beer list or anything of the like. If I am out in this area, I might come back again."}
