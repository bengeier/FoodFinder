{"text":"The place is not familiar with the meaning of word service. Waiting for my burger for one hour, still no sign of food arriving any time soon. You have to chase the waters to get something as simple as water."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and service. Very friendly people considering I was wearing Browns gear! I will definitely put this place on my list to stop when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 0 star review. This was by far the worst customer service jhave ever experienced. After waiting over an hour for our food after we ordered (while watching multiple tables get seated, order, pay and leave) the manager on duty not only did nothing to compensate, but instead offered a free appetizer if we came to watch the fight tomorrow night and mention his name. No certificate or offer in writing - just mention his name and we get a free appetizer (while I'm sure he assumes we would spend a substantial amount more on drinks and food because we would be watching \"the big fight.\") Even our waitress was appalled that no food was taken off the bill, and took the drinks off (which according to her is the only thing she has the ability to comp)."}

{"text":"The atmosphere at All stars is great to meet friends for drinks and to hang out,  but not to eat. I would advise to eat elsewhere before you go. Food is not that great! Like, how can you mess up buffalo wings?"}
{"text":"I work in Southpointe and have been trying some of the new restaurant options, one off which is the All Star Grill and sports bar. Let's start with the \"sports bar\" aspects of the place... There are plenty of nice big screen TVs and projectors that will allow you to see your game from any place you are sitting. Another great feature (that I wish more places offered) is small TVs in every booth. They also leave you the remote so you can change the channel whenever you want and won't have to wait for the server to change it for you. So I give this place an A+ for ambience. The old and prices are unfortunately another story. I have eaten here 4 times before writing this review, because I SO wanted to like it. While the menu is large, the prices are too. Many of the appetizer items I've ordered were clearly frozen and just dropped in the fryer, as opposed to hand made. I realize this is the case in many sports bars,  but when you find one that makes everything from scratch it really sets them apart. The one item I did find that is very good is the steak salad. They actually use REAL NY strip steak, although it seems no matter how I order it, it comes out well done. This is a great place to grab a drink after work, but I wouldn't rush back with the family for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Ideal location if you work in Southpointe. Friendly staff, and I got a decent salad for a decent price.  They also have a great patio in the back which I'll be sure to utilize this summer."}
{"text":"I was there for the first time on Saturday at 11:45, ordered a beer and asked for tennis to be put on one of the many tv's , waitress tried and couldn't find it, she asked the bartender who came to the table to say the OWNER doesn't believe tennis is a  sport.   Hmmmm, not happy about that then the beer I ordered she said had kicked, so I ordered a different beer and was told ALL kegs were being changed.  The beer was pricey $8 for one and $6 for the other.  Fries were the best thing.  Needless to say I will never go back.  The tennis exclamation was an insult."}
{"text":"Liked it. Fun waitress. 2 boys enjoyed their own tv at booth to watch top gear.  Kids burger was a real burger $5. 3 of us had fries that were old or overcooked...not a deal breaker. Open Sunday although yelp said closed."}
{"text":"Don't come to eat. Food it good if you can get it. Kitchen shut down for a hour during Steeler game due to being busy.???????"}
{"text":"Terrible service. The staff is so rude that it makes it uncomfortable to ask where your food is.  It took an hour and a half for a salad and a Rueben.  My husbands first beer was served in a tiny mason jar??   Again I have to stress how incredibly rude their waitresses are. Like you are bothering them!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Stopped in for the first and last time today.  Noticed the walls adorned with autographed Joe Paterno pictures, Notre Dame emblems, and WVU logos.  Not to mention Tom Brady's jersey.  Also noticed not one single picture, poster or logo for the University of Pittsburgh.  I asked the bartender why and she said \"the owner does not like Pitt\".

So...definitely stay away from this place if you are Pitt fan.   I know I will!"}
{"text":"Customers are an inconvenience to the employees. Worst service I've experienced and my tip reflected that. Big TV screens can't make up for the lack of the staff. I felt that I needed to post after several visits here and the service has been consistent.. Consistently bad."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked in and no one sat us so we decided to sit down. We sat there for 10 minutes after we seated ourselves and no one even smiled at us or said anything.  Right when we were about to leave the waitress came over so we felt obligated to stay. She wasn't horrible but this waitress had absolutely no personality. The vibe at the restaurant also sucked. The food was okay. We aren't going back l, though."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Had to go inside 3 times to get waitress.  Asked twice to wipe table and that didn't happen. Other tables weren't bussed and food was decent at best.  And the manager kept coming outside to smoke and just looked at the filthy tables and did nothing"}
{"text":"My day started super early this am. After 2 flights and a rental car ride I arrive at the hotel for check in. The guy at the front desk recommended this place for a quick bite.
I thought the place was closed.
I asked if they were open when I entered and I was told they were. I sat at the bar. While I'm there a few other patrons come in.
I go with a French dip w fries.
It comes out in a reasonable amount of time.
It tasted good. The bread choice was questionable. It didn't really hold up to the meat/ au jus. It was soggy prior to me dipping in in the au jus. The au jus wasn't hot, just warm. 
The fries were fresh cut. They weren't hot either. May have been prepared for a bit prior to being served. The server wasn't very speedy. She was nice enough and pregnant so she gets a pass but it wasn't like they were busy.  She easily could have brought my food vs chatting w a co-worker. Not a good practice to take an order disappear, bring the order disappear again and show up with the check.
I requested ranch. It was an extra charge, which was reflected in my bill but not disclosed.
The interior was clean and nice.
Lots of football memorabilia, some hockey memorabilia as well, but football was most definitely the focus of the owners theme. 
Lots of TVs and a large beer selection. Proximity to hotel was great. I walked across the street. I may go back. Seems as though service issues have been the primary complaint of the reviews I read. 
The place has potential."}
{"text":"Food was decent although the French onion soup was nasty. This is a place to drink at the bar and watch TV not for good sit down service or top notch food."}
{"text":"I walked out of this place not too long ago. Just had a pretty boring bartender, and to top it off, she wouldn't put a beer in a smaller glass, even when my buddy requested it and said he'd pay the same price.  Well I just moved next door so I came back because the bar a block down had the most, I don't even know the word for it, stagnant maybe, staff. I've been there for happy hour for a week. No matter which bartender it was, same look on their face - I call it the \"half-pout\". They don't smile at all. Anyway this post is not about them. All Sports has stepped up their game. At least at night time. Very nice people. Now let's see about their burgers. They get 4 stars for their service because of their location, if you know what i mean."}
{"text":"Horrible front door service older gentleman didn't really seem to know what was going on or what to do to alleviate the busyness food was good service so so"}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of All Stars the past 6 years, both locations! Their nachos are my absolute favorite. However, my boyfriend and I went to this location last Saturday and the service was downright deplorable. Number one, they were not busy whatsoever, it was 7:30. We sat at a high top table in the bar. It took over 10 minutes for anyone to come over to us at which point, a very unfriendly young lady came over and curtly went, \"Do you need menus?\" No \"hi, my name is...\" nothing. She was obviously pregnant and obviously miserable. Once we were finally able to get her to come back and take our drink order (2 waters, no alcohol) I watched her walk back towards the bar, stop and socialize with what appeared to be her young friends sitting at the bar for over 5 minutes, go behind the bar to socialize with co-workers for another 5 minutes, and then walk back over to our area empty handed! I watched her, she had ONE other table in addition to ours, that's it! The best part is the MANAGER was standing behind the bar, could clearly see his restaurant wasn't crowded, and had he cared to pay attention would've seen his employee being rather incompetent and addressed it. Thirty minutes, empty restaurant, wildly unfriendly service, couldn't even get 2 glasses of water = we walked out. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Awesome place been here 5 or 6 times already .....Love the chili-cheese fries .....I have had the Fish sandwich 3 times and everytime its so big I struggle to finish it. My wife has gotten a salad 2 times and a wrap the other times and she was not disappointed any time at all. generous portions and a great price"}
{"text":"On first arrival, it looked clean. The tv's on the table are super laggy and are almost pointless in my opinion. Hummus took forever to come out, but I assume its because of the pita. I ordered the hot pepper sandwich, and it was pretty good. 

Overall service was slow for 2:30 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"The problem with this place is the horrible service and the below average food. On the other hand, the sports atmosphere is probably the best around. More Tvs than you can count and tons of seating. It also happens to be located in the heart of Southpointe, which seems to be the only thing that is keeping this business alive. I can't see this place being busy at all any time after 5:00 pm."}
{"text":"Meh, a lot of flash but no substance. Beer selection is barely average. I was just passing through & wanted to check this place out. It's a weird manufactured area, lots of businesses and expensive lofts/apartments. 
I got a pretzel & nacho cheese, just wanted to get something in my belly, because I was drinking all day. I would probably stop back if ever in the area and actually try to the food & provide a better review......maybe"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but I just can't.

The controllable TVs in the booths are a nice touch; the all-star fries are great; the wings are nice and crispy; the happy hour prices are great.

But I went during a Penguins playoff game and only two waitresses were working the dining room. It was at least 25 tables and people were clearly mad about the service. I wasn't in a rush and didn't mind, but the manager should be ashamed of himself for letting that happen because people are yelling at the workers when its not their fault they don't have help. Some random people were delivering food, but the wait staff clearly needed more help than that.

If you are looking for a casual dining experience with a broad bar menu than this is a pretty decent place. If you are looking for a place to watch a Pittsburgh game you are better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pittsburgher wrap was great.the fires tasted fresh cut.

Friendly waitstaff. They are always cracking jokes and making you feel more comfortable. 

Lots of beer on tap with a ridiculous amount of tvs. They even have a few projectors to showcase major sporting events.

Pinball and arcade machines for the kids.

Guest appearances by Antonio Brown from time to time.

Can get loud but it is a fun environment."}
{"text":"When I meet a client for lunch, I expect to have a leisurely meal. This was ridiculous. We were seated right away- a benefit of a late lunch. We placed our orders and then waited more than a 1/2 hour for an appetizer to arrive.  Lunch showed up a 1/2 hour later.  Not one visit from our waitress to refill drinks or to provide a status on our order. I would understand if the place was busy, but the lunch crowd had already filtered out. I would be a little more forgiving but the food was nothing special either. 

Never trying this place again. Better options are nearby."}
{"text":"Horrible place, don't normally give bad reviews but we really just didn't enjoy ourselves. We decided to try here on a weeknight. When we walked in, we were helped out immediately which was great! Except, when they sat us another table got upset and said that the table was with them even though no one was there. The server should have known that, so therefore, we couldn't sit outside like we had asked to. We got seated in the middle of the room in a table. Tables are very close together and not spaced correctly. Service was slow and the menu was decent. I ordered the potato skins and they were burned. They had live music in a room that just is not meant for it, not big enough. The music was crazy loud, we had to scream the whole time (I'm young too, 20's and enjoy good live music& a good scene, but this just wasn't the right time or place). Won't return. Hope others have a better experience than we did! Sorry!"}
{"text":"Give this place two stars. Because the beer selection for a sports bar is pretty good. And the food for a sports bar is what you would expect. 99% comes out of the fryer accept for salads. Owner works hard and is always on sight. I have to respect that. However, the bar staff is miserable. Every single time I come the girls (very into cleavage - which is good with me) seem to be so miserable. This seems like the only bar I barely tip at. I usually go 40-50% tip but when the girl is miserable as heck for no reason from the start, I just can't give them more than 3%. It makes the whole experience of coming here annoying. 

I now go to Montana's next door. Their girls aren't fitness models like they are at All-Star but they are fun, happy, and smiling. Which is what makes me want to have another beer AND come back."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Our server admitted to giving me the wrong salad, which I tried to eat anyway, but it was so salty, I was unable to eat it. I mentioned it to the server and after being there for over 90 minutes for 2 burgers and a salad. She just took the uneaten salad away after handing us the bill. Nothing at all said or done to rectify. I just wanted what I ordered and for it to be edible. Oh well...there are definitely several other restaurants right there to choose from.."}
{"text":"First time customer!!

Walked in and a bunch of frat boys were yelling in one corner, karaoke being played way to loud(and I'm already deaf)  and people way over served.  Which was amazing because the 4 girls behind the bar were more worried about what \"Johnny\" did last night and how it affected all their lives.  They were so unpleasant that it made me uncomfortable.  

Now so you all know I was there for 2 hrs and had 3 beers.  So by no means was I intoxicated I was a late night traveler stay at a hotel 300 yards away. 

I Watched a server sweep food under a table instead of cleaning it up and another server use a dirty dish rag on the floor and then wipe off a high top table.  Then watching grown adults shaking hands and talking to a Santa statue.  Place closes at 2am? They gave last call at 12:15 and started putting bar stools up around customers.  I started to think there might be an illegal craps game going on in the back, that I haven't been invited to.  Personally this place is a sh*t show!! I would never go back and I sure as hell wouldn't eat there.  

I feel the place is very poorly run for being in an area with money.  But maybe that's what they think a dive bar is.  Because I've traveled the world and I've seen dive bars that look like the Waldorf compared to this place."}
{"text":"Every time we have visited the food was delicious. The staff and management are gracious.  The helpings are huge. The shrimp dinner is our favorite. Would like to try something else but am hooked on the shrimp. So glad they are local."}
{"text":"Slow service, super loud, wings came out cold and not much flavor and my steak on my steak salad was really tough.  Nothing special at all and not worth a Friday night"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Wings were excellent.  Fantastic kids meals, good beer selection, fun atmosphere, even the bathrooms were perfectly clean on a Saturday night.  We showed up to a packed house at 630pm on Saturday night, had never been there before, and they treated us like family.  Reasonable prices as well.  Oh - and the desserts are worthy.  We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has such a high overall rating. 

The food is mediocre. I've had a salad and a pizza, and neither were anything to write home about. At lunch, the service is epically slow. I have a job to get back to, people!

They do have a decent beer selection and a good bar, but I avoid this place for actual meals if at all possible."}
{"text":"Chips are always good.  Wings are OK.  Seems like many of the dishes are plain and lack flavor.  Every time I come here they are out of a lot of Draft beers on the menu.  They were actually out of Jack Daniels once.  How does that happen?  Overall...good for kids because there is a TV at the table.  Wait staff is very friendly and attentive.  That part they seem to have right .  This is why I gave 3 stars and not 2."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of the food especially some of the seafood options it is not often a sports bar has good seafood but this one sure does, DONT SLEEP ON THE FISH TACO's they are outstanding, however now on to some of the negatives service had always seemed to be an issues mostly on the bartending side (I have only ever sat in the dinning room twice, while I was meeting clients and service was excellent) however the past few times I have visited I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service I had be given by some fresh faces I have only just started to see so hopefully management has gotten on the right track now. The happy hour also can not be beaten by anyone in the area and the amount of tvs is outstanding if you are trying to watch multiple games at once. Would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are looking for some good food and drinks while watching a game or just meeting with some friends."}
{"text":"No longer have all you can eat crab legs. Loved coming here for these. Disappointed. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wrote a less than stellar review a few weeks ago. This was once our \"go to\" place. HOWEVER things have deteriorated so badly that I doubt that we will ever go back. We  liked this place, so much we decided to discount out our recent disappointing visits. Went in today and sat at one of the high top tables adjacent to the bar. Despite two of the waitresses/bartenders sitting at the end of the bar, we waited FIFTEEN minutes and no one even acknowledged our presence. There was another couple that entered about the same time. Apparently they were comfortable waiting. We left and walked down the street to the Chop House. SO sad that the current managers have allowed this establishment to deteriorate so badly. Doubt that it will be around much longer."}
{"text":"Service was OK (nothing negative, very friendly but service was a little slow), food was excellent.  Went on wing night and they had live music, kid friendly too."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome and the wing special is great. I'm from out of town and asked if they would put on the Caps game and they bought the game for me. That's customer service!  It's brand new and worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Not that great. As some of the other reviews say, it's good place to watch a game and have a drink, but the food is just ok.... I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap, and the chicken wasn't fresh chicken. That fake processed stuff they use at subway.. My husband ordered the hot turkey sandwich and it was just deli turkey... Wings were good though! 50 cent wings on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food, Drinks and Atmosphere. Lots of TV's to watch sports. Our server was very attentive and never let our drinks run dry. Every Saturday night is all you can eat Crab Legs for 22 bucks, and they know how to cook them. Highly recommend this place for a good meal, drinks or to watch a Game on the big screens"}
{"text":"Went to the All Star Bar & Grill tonight to watch the Pens game.  Mid way through the second period they started karaoke and turned off the sound.  To make it worse a bunch of kids started to sing.  Really I thought this was a sports bar.   They should realize people came to watch the game not to listen to karaoke."}
{"text":"This is probably my 20th time here so it's about time I wrote a review. This place is great. They have about a million tv's to watch sports on. Always have the Pens, Buccos, and Stillers on. Lots of beer choices. My wife likes the snakebite, a Red's apple ale mixed with Guiness.

My only gripe is they have a band that plays during happy hour. Which is fine for the bar, but not so much if you are just there for dinner. Pretty decent menu and the service is fine. Just hope you can hear each other over the band!"}
{"text":"This is somewhere that we have enjoyed in the past, largely because our kids liked having a tv in the booth, but nonetheless service and food had been acceptable,  Tonight on the other hand, we waited and waited and never got our dinner.  The kids did get dinner, and at some point  they told us the rest of our food was on the grill and 10 mins away.   We just left, without dinner about 2 hrs after being seated (and it wasn't crowded).  The only thing management was  kind enough not to have us pay for was the food we never got.  The waitress was great and not at fault, not that would matter to most anyone having spent 2 hrs without getting dinner!i"}
{"text":"Its okay. Bar food. Lunch gets packed and packed up due to all the southpointe businesses. The happy hour is good. I tend to get wraps which are always okay. The TV situation in the bar is good to watch games."}
{"text":"Summary: Management needs to raise wages, because after 7 months, they can't keep anyone and the can't attract competent, friendly staff.

What to know: I've been several times to All Star, mostly because friends want to go.

The Goods:
- The food is above average bar food. HUGE portions (I wish I could remember I really want to split a meal...)
- The atmosphere is energetic and not too noisy for a sports bar.
- Option of seating in a dining area, around the bar and at bar area tables, and even outside.
- Lots of TVs, including at dining area tables, where you can select your channel (and not be stuck with just the options on the wall TVs).

The Bads:
- Service.
- Service.
- Service.
- At best, I've had indifferent if competent service. Usually it's incompetent, slow, dismissive service. 
- Parking can be a challenge, particularly around weekday lunches.

The Uglies:
- Service.
- Service.
- Service.

Bottom line: The consistently bad service over several months has convinced me I don't like my friends enough to join them at All Star. I'll catch up with them at another venue."}
{"text":"This place isnt too bad.  Its just about the only place to hang out after work in Southpointe.  There's a pretty decent wing menu and an extensive appetizer menu.  During the week it can get pretty packed in the evenings with business people from the surrounding offices.  There are quite a few large tv's and its a good place to watch games.  Overall if you are looking for a Bar and Grill with decent food, prices, and a casual atmosphere in this area, its about as good as you'll do."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed with service.    Came in and was told to take a seat anywhere in the bar.   Sat at the high top near the door.    Waitress came and took a drink order, dropped them off and that was the end.     A half hour later I flagged another waitress down and asked if she could send our waitress over, who had been talking to a guy at the bar.   The waitresses talked laughed and still no one came.   Ten minutes later my wife walked to the bar and asked for two more beer and to put some appetizers in.    Our food came out quickly but never saw a waitress again.  We've been done eating for 20 minutes, and if we would happen to get a bill we could leave and probably not come back."}
{"text":"Got take out and the vibe I got from 3 minutes inside was enough to convince me to not want to go back. I ordered a crispy buffalo chicken salad. Pretty simple, right? I opened the container and it was just lettuce topped with a small fried chicken breast. It seemed like they may have forgotten to put the buffalo sauce on and last minute just DUMPED an unimaginable amount over the whole salad. It made the lettuce so limp and unappealing. I couldn't even finish it because the heat was so overwhelming and I'm not a baby when it comes to spice. Just seemed careless. Oh, and the bartenders/waitresses behind the bar were absolutely miserable. I worked as a bartender in college for 4 years and I loved my job. the first impression of a place is the customer service and attitude of the atmosphere and it was horrible. Get some smiling faces that look like they at least try to like their job. At least then I'd be able to look past the buffalo sauce drenched lettuce."}
{"text":"Yet another epic fail at the Southpointe All Star Grille.  I order a take out 2 1/2 hours ahead of the pick up time.  Ask if that timeline is on and am assured it is.  Come into a nearly empty restaurant only to wait nearly 10 minutes for the order.  

They used the same excuse as they always do, and blame it on \"their system going down\".  Either they have the worst system, since that was the excuse the last two times I was here and everything was slow, or they have all been trained to give that reply.  Another bartender came up to me and asked if the other one at least offered me a drink; she did not. 

Hands down the worst run restaurant I have ever been to. The staff all stands around talking together as you wait, the manager just roams the place and says hi to people, and no one has any sense of urgency to the customer.   Three times bitten and I'm officially done.  Boulevard is the ONLY real sports bar worth going to in Southpointe."}
{"text":"Great place to get wings and watch the game! The unique thing about this place is the booth tables have their own TVs, so you can change the channel yourself instead of having to ask your waitress. The food is really solid, and the atmosphere is great! Would come back."}
{"text":"Beautiful building in an up and coming area.  South point is going to be awesome when finished.  This is a go to place for having a good time, good food, with sports thrown in for good measure!  Great sports bar with above average food.  Try the wings, or the chicken salad, you can't go wrong with either one.  Outdoor patio will be opening soon.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Service was really slow.  Give yourself an hour to sit/order/eat/pay.  Check your receipt to make sure you weren't charged for something extra."}
{"text":"Out of town and tried this place for drinks and dinner with coworkers. Food was good and service was awesome! Very nice folks!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well this is a tough review.  When the two of us showed up little did we know that we would be the last customers served food that night.  Mind you, in was only 7pm on a Sunday night and they were open until 10pm I believe.  I'm not sure exactly what was going on but everyone that entered after us was told that food was no longer being sold, only drinks.  The menu that we could order from was also very condensed, good thing we really only came for the wings. We were forced to sit at the bar as the dining area was closed off.  Also, not a fan of sitting at the bar, but we dealt with it.  The girl behind the bar was as helpful at that time as she could be, apologizing for everything that was going on.  We went with a couple different flavors of wings, both regular and boneless as well as the mac and cheese bites appetizer. 
Mac and Cheese Bites, gross. I had hope for something more than Kraft mac and cheese cut into triangles and deep fried.  I would never order those again, they should be banned from the menu.
Hot Garlic Wings, tasted just like regular buffalo wings. No distinct taste of garlic at all, although you could see the little pieces of it on there.
Arizona Ranch Wings, pretty good, would get these again.  Was told these were the most popular flavor.  Tasted like a regular buffalo wing except it was sprinkled with dry ranch seasoning.
Honey BBQ boneless wings, exactly as they sound.  Tasted like the ones we buy at Sams Club and cook ourselves. 
Overall, we may or may not be back. The wings were fine, nothing spectacular by any means, service was fine, but the overall atmosphere of the restaurant the strangeness that ensued that night was not a good first impression. Also, the place is full of TV's so you would think that they would be showing different things on them.  Nope, same rerun of a Pirates game on every screen.  
No military discount here."}
{"text":"They use a meter for their drink pours, who does that other than England? That's a crime, fortunately their food is delicious and the staff rocks. If they go free  pour I would up them to a 5 star."}
{"text":"Wondering if anyone else got sick last night and this morning after eating here on Sunday.  I think it was the Soup of the Day (beef and rice)
Never going again. I have been up since 3am"}
{"text":"The bartenders may be the worst I've ever encountered. Really! They are so negative, just looking at them can ruin your day. The management must treat them like s***, only possible reason they can all be so bad."}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab some wings, beer and catch a game(s).  There are enough TVs in the place to watch any and every sport available, nice clean restaurant with great booths and bar area.  I'm happy they have a patio for outside seating but no TV's outside to watch afternoon games.  The food is what you would expect from a sports bar, descent but nothing fancy.  The ranch dressing is made fresh, if you like salads or with your wings.  Now here's why I gave 3 stars.....the few times I've been there, they have been short staffed for a pretty busy place, so expect to spend some time.  Oh and if you plan to watch MNF or TNF I advice you find a different place that stays open past 11pm.  It's a sports bar......shouldn't they have consider keeping the kitchen and bars open late during football season?"}
{"text":"It's not half bad. We enjoyed everything we had, it just wasn't great.  Sandwiches and pizza were our choices. We had chicken and steak sandwiches. We also had one of their chicken pizzas.  The fries are good.

Nice selection of beers.  We had a great waiter, who was extremely pleasant.  That usually makes up for so-so meals and it did.  I might go as far as 3.5 stars but had to go up or down, so I chose down.

We had live music, it was WAY too loud.  I like loud music, but if you have to yell to talk it gets really old fast. The multitude of TVs are nice because everyone at the table can see without turning around."}
{"text":"The appetizers were interesting.....onions rings; 4 of them. But each one was roughly the size of a distributor cap. (Before we get into an argument about the varying sizes of distributor caps, stop right there. There were 4 different sizes). I was afraid they would be underdone being so big, but I was wrong, they were done perfectly. The breading shattered almost immediately, they need to work on that. Also: this was the first time I tried fried pickles. My worry was that they would consist of a handful of limp pickle chips, but these were five big, flavorful spears of good variety cukes. I could not finish them. 
Entrees were a mushroom swiss burger, med-rare for the hubby, and fish tacos for me. Fries were tasty but, as is the norm for restaurant french fries, were limp. Burger was deemed really good, and the fish tacos were excellent. Also could not finish. 
Service was prompt and friendly. However, the place was pretty dirty. It's off-putting to sit next to a little TV mounted on your table with grease and crud all over it. Hey, guys, you weren't so busy. Get out there and clean your stations! 
Peace n' burgers n. at."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for drinks and a quick bite, but the kitchen was closed. It was midnight but the sign says they are open till 2 AM. The waitress was not very attentive, drinks were put down with no napkin, she forgot about our second drink order and had to be reminded. It was practically empty. The one good thing I could say was that the drinks were small, but they were also cheap. Also, lots of big screens with sports. Probably a great place to be for a game, otherwise, not so much."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area. I give it one star because \"some\" of the bartenders actually care and are good at their job. The place is nice. Has a lot of potential. But the last visit will be my last. $10.00 for a 12 oz Pumpking.....unreal. Price not listed anywhere in the cooler.  I can go to Southern Tier (the brewer of the beer)on the north shore and get a 4 pack for $14.99.  Don't waste your money or time on a place that doesn't care about you. I tried to contact the manager twice....unsuccessfully.  I'm sure they will go the way of th dinosaur before long. The fish rots from the head down."}
{"text":"Was at the Watson Institute Summer breakaway fundraiser.  The staff serving hotdogs and drinks outside were so nice.   Thank you for participating in the event."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and atmosphere. The food was amazing. That being said the service was absolute garbage. The two bar servers were in Lala land the entire two hours I was here. There are people all around the bar with empty glasses just waiting for the two servers to take a break from their conversations with friends at the back of the bar. I find it extremely frustrating when a server is playing on their phone and too busy for an order. I really wish the experience was better because the rest of the place has high potential."}
