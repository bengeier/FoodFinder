{"text":"Pizza is usually stellar, but wait time for pick-up is 90% of the time, under estimated. Add ten minutes to the pickup time to avoid frustration."}
{"text":"I've had Pizza from this place 3 times now.  The first two times were over 1 year ago, and it was good.  But the last time was so incredibly horrendous, that I need to come down hard on this business for it.  First, the Pizza was extremely soggy.  When the delivery person handed it to me, I grabbed the box from the bottom, only to notice that it was sogging through the box.  I didn't say anything because I was starving and just wanted to eat right away.  How bad could it be, right?  Well, when I opened the box, there was a layer of water on top of the cheese.  After gwaking at this, I drained the water.  Again, how bad could it be?  I put some slices on my plate, and the dough was way undercooked.  There wasn't even any \"crust\" feel to it.  It was doughy pizza.  Again, I was so hungry, that I sucked it up and ate two slices.  It was the most disgusting thing I ever ate in my life-- and you know what they say about PIzza; No such thing as bad Pizza.  Until that day, I had believed this adage to be true.  I am a physician, and can say certifiably that the Pizza smelled and tasted like a cadaver.  I've never eaten a cadaver, but so far as smell and taste are intimately interchanged, upon smelling this pizza as I ate, it brought me back to when I was a medical student dissecting fresh cadavers for the first time.  Needless to say, I ordered a small Pizza, and had to throw away 3/4 of it.  I never throw away Pizza.  I was very disappointed, but decided to give them a second chance; after all, this could have been an isolated event-- a fluke, right?  Wrong.  The next time, the Pizza was soggy again.  It didn't smell like cadaver this time, but still a major disappointment that deemed this pizza unworthy of my further business.  So I now refuse to order from there again."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Fox chapel and have been looking hard for a go-to pizza shop.  I ran into the Upper Crust and thought I would give it a shot.  1.I stopped by during lunch on my way home from work to order a pizza.  They were very busy preparing take orders so I waited.  And waited. And waited.  10 minutes later I still hadn't even acknowledged by the staff.  I left  2.Not deterred I ordered a pizza from home and was not impressed. I think the cheese was high quality but the sauce lacked any flavor  I continue my search......"}
{"text":"Every time I have bought pizza here it is soggy and cold. I have even asked for a crispy thin crust and they cannot do it. They take their phone off the hook often and don't answer. Also, you cannot get a slice of pizza after lunch hours. I find that their pizza is awful and service is meh. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Amazingly tasty pizza with hearty toppings and a perfect thick crust. Can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely my go-to stop when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area from Chicago. This is the 4th pizza place we have tried. I thought it was terrible. My husband convinced me to rate it 2 stars instead of 1. The crust was over seasoned and very salty. The pizza was heavy and greasy. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you are ever in the fox chapel/hartwood area.   Actually, if you need some quick food on the way to a concert at Hartwood give this place a shot (It is less than five minutes from the concert venue).  The pizza is in the style of mineos and aiellos but a bit different in its own way."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch pizza was really good. Got two slices with can of pop for 4.50. Can't beat that at all."}
{"text":"love their pizza and hoagies. we order from here 3-4 times a month. even more when family is in town. great delivery service."}
{"text":"I had to give it three stars because, although it's easily the best pizza I've ever eaten, I live literally up the road (a 3 minute drive) and any time I've had the pizza delivered, it's ALWAYS taken at least an hour and fifteen minutes. One hour and fifteen minutes for a pizza to be delivered from down the road.   Any time I pick up the pizza, it's amazing. But the 3 or 4 times I was unable to leave the house due to a party or something like that and had to have the pizza delivered, I was wildly disappointed.  My suggestion: DEFINITELY get this pizza. It's delicious. But do not order it for delivery. Especially if you live farther than a 3 minute drive. I can't imagine how long it would take for a delivery outside of that zone."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing.  Love the sauce an dough.  Right balance of everything.  Super friendly staff.  I called ahead and picked up."}
{"text":"Second time ordering take-out from this place and I was impressed. They were slammed (Friday night) when I walked in but my food was ready when they said it would be. People at the counter were super nice despite clearly being very busy. Greek salad was super fresh and the pepperoni pizza was piping hot and delicious. Probably best to order in advance rather than walking in on a weekend."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place and was disappointed when I tried it. The pizza was extremely greasy which made it way too soggy to be enjoyable. The sauce wasn't anything special either. It's just your run of the mill pizza."}
{"text":"This pizza is really good. They have a huge pizza that you can preorder for a large party. It is huge and so worth it"}
{"text":"A really wanted to like this place.   Unfortunately they fall into the typical mediocre Pittsburgh pizza.  Undercooked, and way too much dough.  The oven needs to be 200 degrees hotter.  In a pinch I'll hit them up since they're practically next door, but my expectations will be set correctly.  Friendly people and they seem to care.  I hope to improve the review in the future."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My husband and I ordered a small pizza with half meatballs/pepper rings, and then a six inch chicken parm hoagie to share. The hoagie was straight-up gross. The chicken was a thin, rubbery, low-quality, processed chicken patty and there was barely any sauce or cheese. My husband and I each took a bite and were like...yep, this is going directly into the trash (ugh I HATE wasting food, but it really was disgusting). The pizza was definitely better, but nothing remarkable. The crust was thick, fluffy, and chewy...fairly standard for most Pittsburgh pizza shops. The cheese was plentiful and the sauce was slightly sweet. It wasn't a bad pie, but if I didn't know where I had ordered from, I'd think this could be pizza from any number of shops. Nothing distinctive or particularly delicious...just standard pizza. Definitely not pizza worth going out of my way for."}
{"text":"We have ordered pizza here a lot lately. The crust/dough is great...breadsticks and Greek salad also great. The pizza as a whole not so great. It takes over an hour each time we have ordered delivery from here. We have tried pepperoni and the meat pizza. I want this place to be good but the pizza is a let down. Better off going to a chain."}
{"text":"This place has awesome Pizza! Their crust is crisp but also light and fluffy. I don't know how they do it! The breadsticks are so so, but it doesn't matter because the pizza is amazing!!"}
