{"text":"This is a great place to go for a beer and a burger. The food is delicious, and the bar is packed with tv's! The bartender, Brenda was great! I now go there every Sunday with my wife! Try the Alamo burger and the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great rewards card savings.  Only negative is it gets a little dead in the evenings. Highly recommend the Philly cheesesteak, second best I've ever had, southwestern chicken, fish tacos and all the burgers are also great. Tator tots are crisp, old fashioneds are great.  Only negative is drinks can be a little expensive when not on special but with all the tvs it's a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, good food, good service. Only thing I do not like at ALL, is the fact that they allow minors to be seated in the bar area. There is a restaurant portion with plenty of seating too. Really kills the vibe!"}
{"text":"We love going to Monk's. We have always had good service. The food comes out quickly. My favorites are the BBQ Chicken Wrap, the Sliders or the Fish Tacos."}
{"text":"I have ordered twice from this restaurant through the grubhub delivery service. Their burguers are ok, they are kind of bland for my taste and The texture it's kind of grainy, whenever you chew on them you will find like little balls of fat or something like that. To be honest, I have tried better burguers. Their chips are nice since they keep crunchy for a long time. The only thing I like from there it's the southwestern chk sandwich, it has Cajun spices and the spicy ranch it's good. My boyfriend ordered the AA breakfast sandwich and he did not get the bacon it is supposed to have, I don't like it when they do that at the restaurants, they should try to be more careful in taking a good care of their customers."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed. Yummy, fresh classic bar food and great mojitos! My favorite is the grilled chicken Caesar wrap. Best wrap I've found yet."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Burgers are amazing! I will definitely be coming back. Service is Great!"}
{"text":"good sports bar atmosphere - VERY clean - Friendly staff - AMAZING FOOD - recommend the Wild West Burger, which was on of the best burgers I have ever had.  Good daily and weekly specials at $1-2 prices"}
{"text":"Monks makes a top notch fresh and flavorful burger - one of the best in town, and when not over cooked, a very juicy burger. Although the burgers comes with choice of excellent beer battered fries or home made chips, I recommend ordering a-la-carte and sharing a side of the fantastic cheese curds or hand battered onion rings. We recently tried the Monkey Fries and I can recommend these as well but try the cheese curds first. 

So excellent food, consistently good service, and competitive prices make this a five star spot."}
{"text":"Great sports bar for catching a game and grabbing a bite to eat. Kid friendly but not catered to, perfect combo imo. This has made our go-to list for Madison-area. Haven't tried the burgers yet, but salads were nummy and chicken was fresh and perfectly cooked. A couple more crafts on the draft menu and it would earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  The service was mediocre (we went on a Friday night and they were dead).  I got the baked cod and asked if I could substitute a side salad in place of my potato option and coleslaw that comes with the fish dinner. The server told me I could, but it would be $5.49 extra.... I went and talked to the manager (it's absurd that a plate of lettuce would cost close to six bucks when the fish is already $12)....the manager assured me that they could in fact substitute a side salad and it would be a difference of $2.00.  My husband and 3 kids felt rushed (server probably wanted to be done or was next up to get cut since they were so slow on a Friday night) and none of us thought the food was anything to write home about."}
{"text":"My first visit to Monk's will definately not be my last.  In fact, I plan on going back very soon.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The burger was the absolute best I have ever had, anywhere.  They have a decent beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Overpriced, very below average food.

The kid's menu prices are horrible.

The only positive is a nice bar area."}
{"text":"Good service and excellent food, even at an off-hour. Comfortable and lots of screens for watching a game or event."}
{"text":"Pretty convenient location with good burgers. Staff is always friendly; especially Nate. He's the man!"}
{"text":"Very friendly servers and fast service. I had the El Cubano sandwich and homemade chips. It was very tasty! On wish my cup of ranch on the side was bigger. Get two right away. I will return!"}
{"text":"Probably more like a 4.5 star, but I like to give the benefit of the doubt most times.

I had the sliders instead of my regular pulled pork whenever we stop somewhere new for our weekend lunch.   I make sliders and know that the window for perfection is small.   These were a little over and dry, but very flavorful.  I can't figure out what the spice or marinade was, but I will order them again.  The dipping sauce made the sliders juicier.  Fries were standard and slightly breaded, but done perfectly crispy. 

My wife had the shrimp po'boy.  She commented that there was far more filling than bun.  Nothing wrong with that. 

This may seem like a small deal, but their unlimited soda refills glass is very large so I never had to ask for a refill.

I'll go back again.

We went back again.  I had the pulled pork and it was good.  I like Monk's practice of not seasoning too strong and letting the customer add sauce to their liking.  The Carolina pork sauce had a kick to it along with the slight sweetness."}
{"text":"Kind of a Madison bar sort of feel, with a college crew as staff.

Had a good beer selection, food was limited to burgers and sandwiches. The burgers were very good, the service was prompt without being overbearing. Only downside was that person in our party of three didn't want that sort of food."}
{"text":"I had the fish fry with tater tots.  Food was fast, hot and tasty.  It is not a 5 star restaurant but very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"Average food, although the avocado was left off my California chicken ( I was discounted $0.99), but it was not $6 better than a $6 Wendy's chicken sandwich. French fries were nothing social or different.
Just kind of \" meh\". 
Really noisy and I felt really packed in to the next table, although they did not personally disturb me.
Why go here when Hubbard is so close by. Madison has such great real food, why bother with chains."}
{"text":"Had very high hopes for this place. The pictures on here were awesome. But alas the food wasn't good at  all. We had the cheese curds which were not good at all I like cheese sticks at bowling alleys better, also had the loaded fries which were actually pretty good, best thing we had actually. We both got the bacon jalapeño cheese burger, we were asked if we wanted it pink or no. Said pink was great. Burger came out very well done, not a lot of flavor and very disappointing. The tater tots were standard, and the homemade chips were actually really good. Overall very disappointed. Service was good, and beer was cold though."}
{"text":"Fun family friendly environment to grab a bite to eat,  a drink and catch the game. Big selection from burgers to salads and offers a full bar. Lots of appetizers to chose from. Bar and restaurant in separate spaces."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my mom for lunch after hanging out at an event nearby. My mom ordered the Mahi Mahi sandwich, and I ordered my go-to Bucky Burger with tots. The burger was good, as usual and my mom seemed to enjoy her sandwich as well.

The host was pleasant, and it was nice that she asked how our day was going on our way to our seats; not many hosts try and make small-talk. Our server was nice and attentive without hovering, and the good came out reasonably quick. It wasn't too busy, so the noise level wasn't so bad either. 

I will say that my only \"negative\" comment is this: it's a bit off-putting when customers walk in through the door and make direct eye contact with a worker who refuses to smile or even greet customers back when they say \"hi.\""}
{"text":"Average bar food. Awkward server. Too many other places to try before this place again."}
{"text":"This place is known for it's burgers but the server suggested shrimp tacos as well.  I went with the tacos and it was a fabulous taste when you add guacamole."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer selection and great service.  I had the Meatloaf and it was probably the best I ever had.  I will definitely come back here when I'm I the area!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour which runs until 7 pm.  There are drink specials and appetizers are half price.  We really enjoyed sitting outside sipping an Old Fashion.  We ordered cheese curds and chicken tenders which were good, typical bar food.  The portions were very large, more than the two of us could finish.  Emma, our waitress was outstanding.  She was very attentive and always seemed to know what we needed before we did!"}
{"text":"We loved the Badger theme throughout the restaurant! The burgers are incredible! I had the jalapeño burger and it was prepared with care and melted in my mouth! My partner had the Cuban sandwich and she said it was probably the best outside of Florida. We upgraded our sides to cheese curds and monkey fries. The curds were more like mozzarella sticks and came with marinara sauce - so good! And the monkey fries were yummy with lots of melted cheese n bacon! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch and a drink today so I'm basing this review on today.  The food was not great.  The bartender we had was very slow and seemed a bit out of it. We had to ask 3 times for our drinks.  The 2 guys next to us waited forever for their food. 
Very disappointing because inn the past we have always had FANTASTIC food & service! 
Hopefully they will fix the problem because we have really enjoyed Monks in the past."}
{"text":"Tried Monk's for the first time the other day. Wasn't really excited about going because it sounded like a very regular sports bar - burgers and fries sort of place. But my mom had a coupon and you know how mom's are when they have coupons. 

I was actually very surprised. Friendly greeting at the door and sat immediately. Waiter was on friendly and fast. Food was way better than I expected. I had their Cuban Sandwich (El Cubano I think it was called) and it was huge and very yummy. Bread was soft and the pork had great flavor. Got it with the chips which were delicious and not overly greasy which was a huge plus. Mom got a burger and I think my wife got a salad. Both seemed quite happy with the quality and portions. 

The place was busy - but not overly annoying at all. Very sports bar atmosphere with TVs and such - but it was nice and you could tell they really had things running smooth. I was pleasantly surprised and would go again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch place in the area. It is a decent sports bar with the typical type o food for such a venue. The service is good and the decor is a nice mix of sports items.

The menu consists of your typical bugers, sandwiches and salads as you would expect to find at a bar/ pub estalishment. For me I would not go out of my way for the food here but it looks like a good place to come and watch the big game."}
{"text":"Considering that Monk's is a chain, the food is actually pretty good. Atmosphere and huge menu are chain-ish, but fine. (Can you tell I don't like chains much?!) Our server was friendly, professional and attentive. 

The tator tots were perfectly cooked -- crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken wrap (yes, trying to order something somewhat healthy!) was tasty and light. 

I doubt I'll go back unless I'm invited by someone else who wants to eat at Monk's. If you're in the Middleton area, though, and would like some bar food and sandwiches, you'll probably be pretty pleased if you go to Monk's."}
{"text":"There are good things about this place.  It is a great place to watch a game and the staff seems to care.  The menu is good and the food seems flavorful for a bar. My problem with this place is the last few times we have been there, the food is cold coming to my table.  I hate cold food."}
{"text":"Monks bar and grill is a neighborhood sports bar where locals and business travelers alike can enjoy moderately priced comfort food and relatively cheap  and good beer. The servers are friendly and there are several screens to enjoy a game with friends and colleagues. I enjoyed the Wisconsin cheese curds. Take the opportunity to play shake of the day and win a prize!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Monks last night. Service was great food came out fast and was good. Great sports bar. Big place so no waiting. Lots of locals there. How can you go wrong if you eat at a place where locals go. Will def go back"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger and salad spots in Middleton.  I generally get an appetizer and a burger and my wife gets one of there salads.  The burgers are the right size and the quality has been consistent over time.  The salads portions are large enough to truly be a meal.   I've had many of their appetizers and have always found them to be of good quality."}
{"text":"My better half and I only went here because of our Bucky Book coupon. The burgers were nothing to write home about. My wife had the Monster Burger and I had the classic/original burger. The buns seemed dry. The patties were very greasy and the service was SLOW. The place only had a few tables filled and yet our waitress was in the back of the dining area talking with co-workers. How nice, she finally brought a refill of my soft drink when I asked for the check. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Well, having been to the Monk's location in downtown Wisconsin Dells, WI and had a good experience, we thought we should try out the newest location closer to us. It was great. The atmosphere was great and enjoyable. The staff were extremely nice in every way. And the food... was just amazing. Some of the burgers are really different, and taste just awesome. The service was also quick, and got our food pretty fast. And the price, just wasn't to bad. We will defiantly going back here again."}
{"text":"Great  burger!  That is what they are known for and they deliver. Nice atmosphere friendly staff and good selection of food and drink make this place a great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"In the former Applebee's location near the Costco. 
Interior has a sportsbar feel to it with a UW focus. 
Good place to go for a greasy burger."}
{"text":"Booooo!  If I could hiss I would.  

I had fish tacos and pretty much I was served cabbage.  A huge mound of cabbage.  Hubby was seen taking the bun off of his sandwich and cutting the meat with a knife and fork!! It was hilariously crappy!!  

It also probably doesn't help that we were not the ones choosing the restaurant, and were completely in the mindset for brunch and coffee...  

The definition of \"meh\""}
{"text":"Stopped on a Sunday eve, I had sliders & french fries, wife had a chicken wrap. Both were very good. Best of all, service was great and food came fast, without the fast food atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So a bit of a mixed review....just being honest.

We sat in the bar area on Sunday for some football watching and appetizers.
-Service was GREAT!  Our waiter was attentive without being over-bearing.
-TV/Game selection was GREAT!  Everything you wanted.
-Drink...strong...cough cough....which is okay by me
-Food....we got wings and chicken tenders (tenders were the waiter's recommendation).  The wings were all wings with only 2 out 15 being drumsticks.  The favorites are too limited as well.  The chicken tenders were bad....not recommended.

I guess if we wanted wings, we should have hit Quaker Steak close by....so perhaps our fault.  I will go back when I am in the mood for a sandwich and a game.  The good service means a lot to me so I have to say give it a try, but no chicken tenders would be my advice."}
{"text":"I really didn't like this place. At ALL. The atmosphere is severely lacking, there were a lot of kids there, and the food was lackluster.

We went because I had a coupon in my \"Welcome to Town!\" packet in the mail. If you go with a coupon, be aware that alcohol doesn't count for the final bill tally. So that kinda stinks.

Our waitress was really nice. But she forgot our appetizer and we ended up having it served to us after we were almost finished with our entrees.

I had the mahi mahi street taco thing. My guy had a burger. The appetizer (which I had been SUPER excited for) was an order of onion petals. I'd been hoping they'd taste like Outback's Bloomin' Onion. Instead, they tasted like common onion rings that had been over-fried in oil that was old and spent.

Again, our waitress was SUPER nice. She was the best part about the place. But I won't go back. There are too many other places that are WAY better."}
{"text":"We had very, very, high hopes for Monks after great experiences in both Dells locations. It wasn't quite the same, but still a good dining experience overall.

The decor of the Middleton monks is fantastic - badgerrama! So many cool decorations, fatheads, and signs it's the perfect place to watch a game! Very family friendly but also a cool bar atmosphere.

Tap beer selection is definitely lacking compared to other game day spots in the city. I had the Amber Monks 47 and my husband had a lienies Octoberfest...but when your seasonal beer is lienes...you need more beer choices.

Appetizer of beer cheese sampler platter was delicious and burgers were good. Not gonna lie, not as good as the ones in the Dells. It could be that this is our home and not a tourist place, or the fact that we aren't scarfing them after a day at the water park, but it just didn't leave us saying \"Man that was great.\" Service was very good - kind and efficient!

Overall we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Great beer and speciality drinks to choose from. We enjoy the Wisconsin theme throughout the restaurant, bar, and menu. The menus have a lot of options to pick from. One if my go to favorites is their BBQ Chicken Wrap that's in a spinach wrap. The last time we dined here I upgraded my side to the cheese curds and my boyfriend to the monkey fries, both were amazing. The guys also enjoy their burgers (the black and blue burger and the Bucky badger burger). I did try their BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was not for me and I wouldn't try again. The BBQ sauce wasn't my favorite, it was a little to spicy. I tend to prefer a honey BBQ sauce. 
But we do love it here and recommend it strongly."}
{"text":"One of many choices for game watching. Overpriced since you're paying to watch BTN or whatever sports network. $9 for a kids meal today makes today the final Monks experience for us. 

When the kids cheeseburger slider meal is $6 for a little meat, a lot of carbs, and no drink, I don't expect to then PAY ADDITIONAL FOR CHEESE when \"cheeseburger\" is on the menu. I inquired with the server. That's how they do it! Not an error.

The plus beyond the Badger games is the turkey burger. They are seasoned well and juicy."}
{"text":"Came here with a very large party, and we only had one server. He was very nice, but at least 4 of us had to send our food back because we received the wrong food. The food was good, but I did not enjoy my chicken sandwich very much. I ordered the California chicken sandwich without cheese, and I received a naked burger (a bun, chicken, and another bun). By the time my food was corrected, it was pretty cold. And the tater tots were too salty so I barely touched them.

The environment was open and friendly, and we all enjoyed ourselves very much. I would come back with a smaller party."}
{"text":"Honestly the burger and service were fine.  Nothing memorable but not at all bad.  Chippers too.  Atmosphere is something between Applebees and a basic small-town restaurant.  Service was fine.

But I was so angry...I tried this place because I had a Bucky Book coupon good for a free burger with purchase of the same.  The catch was that it had a $5.95 limit...and the cheapest burger on the menu was $8.50 - another .$75 for cheese and on up from there for specialty burgers.  I have never used a Bucky Book coupon that tried to pull something like that.  Pretty crappy."}
{"text":"We had a party of 13 with reservations for 7pm on a Thursday night. I'm glad I called ahead to be safe, but it wasn't needed. The place wasn't even close to full when we arrived and it was only starting to pick up when we left an hour and a half later.

I know it can be difficult to get everything straight with such a large group, but there were a few issues that arose. First, one of my dining buddies was the only person not to receive a water even though the waitress handed waters directly to each person (she didn't just put a bunch down and leave), so she should have noticed she was off one or checked to make sure. Second, the same person also didn't get her order of wine until I stopped our waitress and informed her. Third, my BF ordered fries and got chips. Fourth and last, my burger was supposed to come with BBQ and arrived without sauce.

The positive spin on this situation is that there were only four mix ups and they were somewhat minor. The waitresses and manager also made sure to correct the mistake as soon as it was brought to their attention. I can appreciate and respect that. It was a bit annoying, but at least something was done about it as soon as possible.

As far as the food, it was OK. I enjoyed the deep fried cheese curds, but be warned that \"curds for the whole table\" is really more like \"curds for 3 people.\" We had a large table and ended up ordering two baskets of curds and wanting more. I really enjoyed the large, soft pretzel and cheese dip. I also thought the burger I ordered was pretty good. The meat patty wasn't all that interesting, but the jalapeno bacon gave it a nice flavor and the shredded carnitas was surprisingly tasty. I was sad when I requested the missing BBQ sauce, put it on and found it to be ridiculously sweet. It overpowered the burger and could have been left off completely.

All in all, I would recommend it for a large group if you're looking for an easy option to please everyone. It was incredibly close to the Fairfield Inn where we stayed, so it's convenient if you're in the area. I might try something else next time, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone else suggests this place for another group dinner."}
{"text":"Cheese curds... Ehh. Not good. Very sweet tasting with bad batter.
Tater tots... Very sweet tasting-not good.
Philly burger- decent, but bun was so sweet.

All of the food tasted like it was sprayed with sucralose before it was served."}
{"text":"Solid place for a family  meal would give it 3 1/2 stars but since you do half star I give them the 4. Enough variety to please all mostly burgers and sandwiches also wraps and salads. They do offer some appetizer you don't se as much such fried pickles,cauliflower bites as well  as the things you would expect curd nachos etc. We like the homemade chips although my husband was disappointed the got rid of the pimento cheese dip. Kids meals come on a frisbee for a plate which they get to take home. Never had anything we didn't like but also never had anything that we had to get again. We been to most of the locations pretty much the same decor at all Badger,packers brewers .Never sat at the bar but had cocktails at table decent strength. Nothing spectacular but it's certainly in our rotation of regular spots"}
{"text":"Great place. Went for a beer and dinner. Sat at the bar. Great service. Very clean and an excellent chicken wrap. TVs are well placed and people were friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Monk's for lunch one day. We have returned a few times since. It is a nice place to have a quick lunch. We usually get good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went because we had a Bucky Book coupon for a BOGO burger. Turns out, even though the coupon clearly stated that it was 'buy one get one free,' it actually only took $5.49 off our bill. How is that a BOGO when the cheapest burgers (what we ordered) are $8.99? 

Not only that, but I didn't think the burger meat had any flavor. Could have used some season salt in the ground beef prior to cooking. The fries were pretty good though. But just because of the frustration with the coupon, I won't be coming back to Monk's."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday night and it was not overly crowded, but it proved to be a great spot to watch the Dodgers beat the Mets in game #4 of the NL West playoffs.  

I sat at the bar and got outstanding service.  The bar has an OK array of beers but an exceptional selection of hamburgers.  I went with the house recommendation and got the Badger Burger, it was delicious, see my picture.  Another recommendation was the upgraded fries, the monk fries which included two different types of melted cheese and bacon bits, another delicious suggestion. 

They have nightly drink specials and PLENTY of televisions, I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for a watering hole to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"Thursday night @ 8 o'clock, a piano player started taking requests in the bar.

Drank a Fat Tire, although @ $5 for a bottle it seemed a bit pricey.

Awesome mushroom & Swiss burger.

If I'm back in the area, I'd come back."}
{"text":"A-ok. Monks is a decent place to stop in for a burger and a beer or to watch a sports event with some friends.

Service was good, food was decent, and they have a good number of TVs. The only thing I would complain about is the fact that they constantly rotate what games are showing on which TVs, since only one is connected to the audio. Very distracting and confusing if you're following any of the games that are on."}
{"text":"Positives: the bartender was nice and they have tons of TVs. They play GREAT music. 

Negatives: cheese curds had little to no taste. Our server disappeared and never said a thing to us (thats how I know the bartender was nice, he ended up serving us). The Mikes Hard Lemonade that I ordered was expired and $5 (wtf, thats a little steep). The prices are way too high for the quality of food. My husband and I both got sick after eating here. 

I would be totally fine with my life if I never ate here again."}
{"text":"If you are hoping to cheer on your Badgers in style come on in to Monk's! The place is decked out in Badgers and college football decor and there are tons of TVs making anywhere you sit a perfect spot. 

The bartenders are super awesome and will use thier Wisconsonian lingo to get you to keep buying local beers such as New Glarus all night. You Bet'cha!

Something else super cool is that every time the Badgers score a touchdown they rock \"Jump Around\" through the speakers and hand out red jello shots to make everyone feel like they are in college again.

This is a great place to go if you want to be able to actually talk to who you are with during the game as well. ;)"}
{"text":"Decent menu, but food wasn't that great. Pears in the pear salad were from a can and the mahi tacos were no good. Monday fries were ok, not fantastic."}
{"text":"I chose Monk's because I heard they have the Impossible Burger. For those of you who may not know, it's a vegetarian burger that you HAVE to try (yes, I'm looking at the people who enjoy a real, meaty burger too). It's a delicious substitute for a real burger and I'd have it any day over a boring, most likely frozen, black bean burger. I know as a non meat-eater you may not trust me, but ask anyone you know that have tried the burger to hear how good it is!

I had it off a menu downtown and that restaurant had no idea how to dress up this burger to make it worth the hype. But at Monk's, you can fix your burger to your liking! I added as many spicy things as I could do it as well as the classic burger fixes and it was delicious! The fries were nice and crispy as well! 

I got ahead of myself because of my excitement for the burger... We started with the sweet chili cauliflower bites. These were pretty good, flavorful, a decent portion and crispy. They do pitchers of beer, so we got one of Blue Moon (did not come with orange slices but I'm sure you could ask if you wanted to). Another plus was that Leinenkugel was walking around with free samples and it was towards the end of their promotion so they gave us free beer. I definitely won't complain about that! 

For a night on a weekend it wasn't very busy, the service was nice and attentive as well. We'll most likely visit before a movie again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Monks a half dozen times now, and each time has been a fairly pleasant experience.  There's no wow factor, but its an upgrade on the usual pub experience for sure.  If Yelp had half stars this would be a 3 and 1/2.

The burgers and sandwiches are the big hits on the menu from what I've tasted, specifically the Jalapeno Burger and the Carolina Pulled Pork sandwich.  All the sides and sauces hit a home run, I really enjoy the cheese curds, kettle-style chips, and the pimento cheese sauce.  The BBQ sauce is passable and overall you get extremely generous portions.  In fact, that originally was my only gripe was that the portion sizes are a little out of control, but probably better that you get your money's worth.

The bar at the Middleton location is actually one of the better spots for sports in my opinion than other places around.  It's not a huge area, but they have plenty of large TVs that are easy to see, they play the game audio, and I've been in there for some badger games with a good crowd hooting it up.  The bartenders are friendly and social, all the times I've been they've given positive recommendations instead of just listing off the menu when asked.

Prices are a little steeper than your average pub or restaurant, with burgers being about $11 and specials in the $14-20 range.  I think the premium is mostly justified by their above average taste, but its certainly borderline with other places I like better for a similar price.

Monks is certainly worth trying, if you like a good burger and want to relax and watch a game, this is a good place to do so."}
{"text":"Service is amazing!  Stop in this place on my way home around 7ish. Walked in didn't think much of the place. But from the moment we walked in the hostess were super nice and we took a seat in the bar. The server was amazing, offered recommendation, and was very knowledgeable of the menu. We enjoyed our meals and she was back to check on us after the \"2 bite rule\" to make sure we were satisfied with everything. She wasn't to pushy or rushing, even the management team double checked on us after the meal. She was amazing \"sorry i didn't get her name, blond, taller, so sweet\" but i did really appreciate having a meal, enjoying it, and not being interrupted. Big props to this place! Get a burger definitely can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"This was a case of 3 strikes and you're out. Food was mediocre at best and the service was less than ideal. Don't waste your time, go to Subway next door!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints ( or raves) after numerous visits to this location as it's close to our house. It's another great sports bar but I would skip the dining room. Decent tap beer selection and they usually run some good specials especially for games.  Food is great bar food and even the salad was good.

On a service note, we were just here the Tuesday before Christmas and the bartender was pretty rude and clearly wanted to leave and booted us out before close because we were the last table there...kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  I started with a cup of Vietnamese pho, Whig was really delicious, followed by a Cuban sandwich.  The bread was really crispy, the carnitas was juicy and the cheese was Wisconsin Swiss. It was gone before I could say, \"go Badgers!\"

If you're  in the neighborhood and are looking for a quick, delicious lunch- Get In Here!"}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Courtyard Marriott in Middleton without a car, you don't have too many options. My coworker and I decided to eat at his place because it was walking distance from the hotel. Also, it was reasonably prices. 

We arrived around 9pm on a week night, so the place was pretty quiet. There were maybe 2 other occupied tables. Once you walk in, there's a big bar in the middle of the room. The place is pretty big so it can accommodate big parties. 

I ordered their cheese curds, buffalo wings, and half baby back ribs. My coworker ordered a steak. The cheese curds were decent, I didn't find them to be great. My other reviews show that my favorite is still at the Old Fashioned and Craftsman. The buffalo wings and baby back ribs were also decent. The baby back ribs came with potatoes, but I opted not to have them and the waiter took off $3. For a local place like this, I'd have to give them props because my expectations weren't too high. My coworker enjoyed her steak, but she said it was warm..not sizzling hot. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and it kept me full. 

The service here was great. There were only two employees working that night, but they were both very helpful by making recommendations. They also dropped by many times to give us plates and refill our drinks. If I return to Middleton, this is not a place I'd point to first , but if I need some quick and filling then I wouldn't mind returning."}
