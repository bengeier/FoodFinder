{"text":"I love seeing Braizen in the area. Whatever you get is delicious. I always get the chickpea avocado salad and a main, and I have never been able to finish. Who doesn't want lamb from a food truck?"}
{"text":"Had the beer braised lamb shank with orzo, and it was excellent. Restaurant quality food from a food truck. The lamb was very tender, with little fat and no sinew, and was lightly scented with baking spices. Not too salty. The orzo had tomato and arugula smatterings that worked well with the lamb. This dish gets 5 stars, so on balance with my sliders the truck get a 4 overall."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this food truck today while out doing some shopping near Deerfoot Meadows. We hadn't had lunch and were looking for something to get us through to supper.

The menu was pretty simple...about a half dozen selections of sliders, 2/$8. They also had chili for I think $6. I ordered orange ginger pork, the man ordered curried beef sliders and the child had meatball sliders. Each order came with two sliders nestled in a little paper container. At first we werent sure about portion for price but when we got them, they were surprisingly filling. They certainly didn't skimp on the protein at all. The orange ginger pork sliders were flavourful with a good blend of ginger and citrus... nothing too overpowering. The pulled pork was juicy and lean. My only complaint was that it was tricky to get the first slider out of the container as it was sharing pork with its neighbour slider.  The curried beef sliders were also tasty, lightly curried with good flavour. I didn't try the meatball sliders but the child repeatedly was boasting how good they were (with his mouthful....sigh). Happy kids =  a good kid so we can't complain.

They were all a little messy for eating standing up or sitting on the curb but there were plenty of napkins available. The chef running the truck was very friendly and down to earth. Seemed to be very interested in what each customer thought of their food. He was also ready to explain any of the menu items and clearly took a lot of pride in what he was doing. I'd love to go back and try some of the other items!"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken sandwich was very flavourful and a good size, too!  Took the leftovers home to my chef spouse who declared I should have bought 2! 

And yes, all food trucks are overpriced."}
{"text":"Found the sliders lacking in substance. Flavors are good but just too small a portion for the price. 8.00 for 2 sliders is expensive. 4-5 bucks would be a good price point"}
{"text":"I'm blown away each day by what a huge variety of street food is available in Calgary.  This time, I was unable to locate a location close to me online, so I made my way to a local eatery.  What did I spy with my little eye on the way? If you haven't guessed the answer by now, I cry for you.

I had never heard nor seen Braizen before.  A smaller than usual food truck was explained by the fact that the grub is pre-prepared.  I am not one to judge in advance, so I decided to try out the food.  Ummm wow.  No wonder it's prepared in advance.  Wanna try to get cumin rubbed lamb or short ribs to order from a food truck that doesn't have full kitchen equipment to cook it properly?

I decided to dive into the adobo short ribs with cranberry buttermilk slaw.  The menu actually lists them as \"Adobe short ribs\" however, I believe that is a misprint as I was unable to open my Adobe files or create other pdfs with the food.  Sounds fancy.  Tastes better.  The short ribs were very nice.  Fresh considering they were cooked earlier and they had just enough heat.  The slaw was a unique take on traditional coleslaw and was very good.  It wasn't a huge portion, but big enough considering the quality of the meat and meal in general to be worth $9 once in a while when I want some quality street food."}
{"text":"Decided to try the Curry Beef sliders at Braizen food truck.  One order comes with 2 sliders.  Messy but not too bad."}
