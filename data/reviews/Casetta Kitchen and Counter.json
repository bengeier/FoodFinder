{"text":"The go-to spot for breakfast downtown. Got two ridiculously good breakfast sandwiches and coffee. Better than any coffee that I had while living in Chicago and in years of searching Madison for the best cup. Can tell it took time to source these beans. Ordered the ham and bacon breakfast sandwiches. Chef took his time preparing each sandwich after I ordered freshly slicing the meats with a deli slicer and crisping the buns on the griddle. Didn't take long at all which was a concern before work. All around the best spot for breakfast downtown."}
{"text":"Bad atmosphere bad food bad service. Very limited menu and greasy sandwiches. Over priced."}
{"text":"My Italian salad was Amazing, I'm talking about out of this world freshness and flavor. The place is beautiful and classy, you can tell all the love and care that they put into the place. My dad got the Italian sub and it was pure heaven, I'm definitely going to recommend this place and will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and an eclectic wine selection. We enjoyed the Italian and the Tonno, both fantastic. Run, don't walk, to Casetta Kitchen & Counter."}
{"text":"My go to place in Madison, not only for the great sammies but for the AMAZING chocolate chip cookies (with sea salt), the wide selection of wines (love buying my bottles here for the month as you will actually be able to taste some different stuff Thursday nights than would you would typically buy), and the daily specials and take home dinners.   My recommendations: 1. Turkey on focaccia with extra cucumbers/pickles (they make the pickles and focaccia in house) 2. Chocolate chip cookie 3 my fave seasonal side is the snap peas  4. A bottle of wine for the weekend"}
{"text":"They know food, and you'll eat well and become a regular.  No one makes a more delicate focaccia to hold up amazing sandwiches, or works magic with chickpeas day after day, or turns out absolute perfection in a simple cheese omelette, or can give you a reasonably-priced and totally delicious entree to take home for dinner.  Explore the Friday night dinners to see the breadth of their mastery in the kitchen.  Amazing and friendly place for coffee or a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Very good!  Cool place, lots of seating, convenient location.  It got to be pretty busy both days I was there this week, but I didn't have trouble snagging a table either day.  A lot of their business seems to be take-out, and their seating is pretty smart/flexible.  Major pro: *Great* Carrot Ginger Soup.   Main quibbles:   1.  I wish they had espresso drinks. 2.  I wish their bread was better.  It's fine/\"good enough\", but Porters is orders of magnitude better.  The sandwich I got today at Casetta (Chicken Parm Special) was pretty good, but could've been phenomenal on whatever bread Porters uses. 3.  I wish their Caesar salad (my order yesterday) had less red endive.  It was in big pieces, and extremely bitter.  If there was less of it and it was more thinly sliced, I think I would've loved the whole salad: it was perfectly dressed, loved the dressing, loved the breadcrumbs.  But, I felt like 1/3 of the salad was crazy bitter endive, which was too much for me.  Didn't eat it.  Felt like a waste.  (For $8, it'd be cool if you got a piece of bread or something along with the salad.)  So, very promising.  I with with a few minor adjustments, I would head there multiple times a week on the regular.  As it is, I'll probably head over once every few weeks.  Let's keep in touch, Casetta!"}
{"text":"Great new lunch spot in the neighborhood. Sandwiches and sides are delicious, simple, and elegant. Design is contemporary, sleek, and clean. So happy this place moved in across the street - been here 3 times in the past 2 weeks."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday specifically to try their porchetta sandwich (only available on Thursdays). I went to 3 years of high school in Rome, and on countless nights out in the city, I enjoyed a warm delicious porchetta sandwich from my favorite corner sandwich shop. I had high expectations but also a healthy amount of skepticism going in, a lot pressure to put on a sandwich. But let me tell you, this is a 5-star sandwich. The flavors were incredible and the porchetta absolutely took me back to nights wandering around Campo de Fiori. I will definitely be back to try everything else but this was the perfect introduction."}
{"text":"Well, what a pleasant addition to the Madison food scene. Ever since coming to Madison in august of 2015 I have wanted a deli that provides chicken cutlets, fresh roasted turkey, and reminds me of an Italian deli from New Jersey. Casseta provides that and much more. Fantastic chicken cutlets, chocolate chip cookies, and bread. If I were to make one recommendation, it would be to offer Russian dressing. The owner is very friendly and we have become good friends! I look forward to hitting Casseta for lunch frequently."}
{"text":"Took part in a soft opening this weekend and loved it!  Portions are very generous and I would suggest sharing all of the sides.  Staff is very friendly and quick to make sure all needs are met.  The lasagna special we tried will instantly put you in a happy place on a cold day.  Excited to go back and try everything else on the menu soon!"}
{"text":"Found out about Casetta's from a friend and had to try for a lunch meeting. Ordered on EatStreet for delivery. Prompt delivery and the subs and salads were labeled and packaged very clean. Just a few issues/suggestions: meat/cheese on salads were cubed, (super small)  not a fan. Would of liked more meat. Everyone enjoyed their sandwich choice, but would of liked another layer of meat. I will order again but will make sure to ask for more meat:)"}
{"text":"We tried Casetta Kitchen for lunch last Wednesday.  What a great find.  The space is clean, modern, a little eclectic in the decor.  The building has an beautiful atrium when you first come in.  We sat at a high-top table.   Ordering is done at the counter, and then they bring your food to you.  Our cashier was both friendly and patient while we asked questions and decided what we wanted.  The runner who delivered our food was friendly.  Between the three of us, we ordered various sandwiches including the Italian, the eggplant Parmesan, and the turkey.  Choices include hero or focaccia bread as well as various condiments. They come in both half and whole. We ordered whole but in retrospect a half would have been plenty. They are huge. Not only were the portion sizes excellent, the ingredients were fresh and tasty. I thought the spread on the Italian was especially tasty and unique. They also had soups and salads available.  Drinks were cans and bottles from the counter display, tap water, beer and wine.   I'd definitely come back to Casetta Kitchen to try more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Just returned from a quick lunch at Casetta.  Order, pay, sit down (or take away), pick up order when called, enjoy and clean up before leaving.  We enjoyed a Tunno on focaccia and an Italian on a sesame-seed  hero.  Fresh deliciousness sets these sammies apart from run of the mill subs.  The ingredients are high quality and super fresh.  Proportions are entirely satisfying.  Counter service is friendly and efficient.  The light-filled, open space offers counter, high table and banquette seating options.   The sides, salads and soups we saw other patrons eating also looked great.  A winner!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads, friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. Highly recommended checking it out for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Casetta is my new preferred lunch spot on the East Wash corridor, and maybe even all of downtown. From elevated veggie side dishes to sandwiches and soups packing a punch of flavor, there's really something for everyone. I have yet to try their coffee and take-home dinners, but I know I won't be disappointed. Thank you for saving us downtown office folk from drab lunches, Casetta. Appreciate it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are pretty big. I got the sorpressata sandwich on focaccia bread. It was very tasty and made with high quality meat and bread. I just wish it was open later during the week!"}
{"text":"The chocolate chip cookies!!!! Hands down, the best.  Awesome staff and delicious food.   But seriously, those cookies..."}
{"text":"Very good pasta e fagiola and Italian sub. Friendly service, bright surroundings. Hip, but not pretentious."}
{"text":"I was there Monday night this week, one of those beautiful evenings we've had lately, and finally stopped at the place I walk by each night on my way home from work.  The owner greeted me right away, letting me know they'd started offering sandwiches until 7pm; very smart move.  He made my delicious Donatella to order and poured me a beautiful clear glass of water right away - anticipated the need so I didn't have to ask. 'Ordered the BLT on focaccia which Casetta makes with heirloom tomatoes and fresh pesto; next time I'll skip the italian dressing because the pesto and mayo would have been just the right amount of savory against the salty bacon; mouth waters as I think back on it. We chatted about their new-each-week Prix Fixe Friday menu, which at $40/$65 with wine pairings, looks great. I wandered home very satisfied and looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Definitely the spot to hit up for lunch or a quick coffee break. Cassetta's has a very modern atmosphere, yet it's still cozy enough to post up and relax.   The house coffee is great and the food is equally on par. Ordered the potato salad, Hoboken sandwich (roast beef), and a cookie. The quality and taste are far superior compared to your average chains, so it's well worth the visit. To top it off, the entire crew at Cassetta's seems super personable."}
{"text":"It may have just opened but I've been here 4 times already and still can't decide if I like their breakfast or lunch menu better.. All of the daily specials I've tried so far are phenomenal and the Sullivan on house-made focaccia is an absolute must.  Combined with an extensive wine and cocktail list, including a bloody mix made in-house, this spot has rapidly become my new go-to for breakfast, lunch and happy hour downtown.."}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and ended up ordering lunch to go for later because the food is so good! It's an awesome open space and the service was perfection. Fairly priced, too! I subbed arugula on the egg and cheese for bacon and it's was amazing. We will be back to Casetta for the cocktails for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few places in Minnesota that have great Italian. The red sauce is the only local place that would make an Italian grandmother proud, the pizza is east coast style (large triangles) and the cannollis are legit. Before you leave, check out the market- there are cases of prepared food (stromboli and lasagna are legit), mozzarella cheese is fresh and the meat counter is ridiculous. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Did I like the food?  Yes.  But the wait is ridiculous.  It took about 25 minutes from start to finish for a take-out salad (nothing custom, just one of their menu salads).  This location is in a business building with several large offices.  They need to figure out a way to speed up the prep process."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way through Madison. It was a great choice. Excellent food and great people."}
{"text":"Casetta is my favorite place, now!  This place does great breakfast fare, and then switches over to lunch, late afternoon menu.   Everything I've had there is good!  I truly have never been disappointed in of their offerings.   Price is reasonable, given the high quality ingredients they use.  Staff is upbeat and friendly, too"}
{"text":"Great Italian sandwiches and atmosphere. Went with a party of 5 after the farmers market and ALL loved their sandwiches. Focaccia is great.  Great vibe!  Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot.  Located in an office building so it can be busy during the lunchtime as workers spill out of their cubicles looking for some sustenance.  They have a varied regular menu as well as daily specials.  On both occasions that I have stopped in, I have ordered the special-porchetta sandwich one day and meatball sandwich the other.  Both times ordering a whole sandwich (half sandwiches are also an option). Not only are the ingredients on point, I feel their bread (hogie or foccacia) really sets them apart from other places.  I don't know if they are baked in house or purchased but either way, I am a fan.  They also have a few sides to round out your meal but will say that the whole sandwich option is a meal by itself.  Definitely a go to spot when I am downtown."}
{"text":"Take-away: Great place for a breakfast sandwich or quick lunch. They have limited deli offerings, and wines etc. for retails. The space is clean and modern with attentive and friendly service.   Food:   I've had their Chicken Parm to-go and the turkey sub lunch offering. The chicken parm was pretty solid, could have used a bit more S&P but a good meal nonetheless. The sub was fantastic, fresh sliced turkey bathed in an herbal-y green sauce. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookie I had there was one of the best of my life!  Ambiance/Service:  Friendly and typical counter-service, the place has the vibe of an upscale cafe or the like - clean, white, and modern. Lots of natural light from the large windows. Friendly and straight-shooting service!   9/10"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance. Beautiful setting. The sandwiches are good but I do wish there was a little bit more variety with sides. I got the Sullivan on foccacia and it was delicious! Definitely will be coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about this place. Food is really good and the wine selection is great as well. Love coming here for lunch and their Friday night dinners. Food is always consistent and service is great. It's a great spot to stop and buy wine for dinners etc and James is always around to help me pick the right bottle. Looking forward to their future events and offerings."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Sarah K. for suggesting Casetta as our lunch meeting spot! This beautiful deli had been on my list for awhile but I rarely treat myself to a lunch out. I opted for the special of the day, roasted pork, and took the focaccia option.   First, half a sandwich is huge. At many places it would just be a sandwich. The focaccia was perfectly pillowy. The roast pork was shaved thin and served warm. The meat is clearly of a high quality - no \"sandwich meat\" here. The flavors from the other fixings perfectly melded and melted together into a delicious (and juicy) sandwich. I wouldn't try to eat the roast pork sandwich while working if you stop in on a workday, but you'll be glad you took half an hour to just concentrate on the delicious dish before you.   Many of their offerings sound mouthwatering and they've recently started a Friday-night dinner series I'd love to check out. Looking forward to when I can get back and try the turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in the same building as Sonic Foundry on West Washington. Clean, bright, cozy atmosphere with very comfortable padded seating. Seemed to have a nice wine selection. They didn't have a any espresso drinks but otherwise good selection. I had half the Sullivan on focaccia bread. Yum! Healthy light flavor that was the perfect size. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a favorite deli/sandwich shop in Madison since moving here 6 years ago. Casette fits the bill. The quality meats, cheese, and bread along with cozy atmosphere has made it a favorite for me just after my first visit. A limited menu will bring me back to try all their sandwiches (and just reiterates that if you do something well, you don't need to attempt to do more). The Italian is the best you'll find in Madison. Fans of sandwiches will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok can I say I love this place and the food!!  Service was great! Love when you can talk to my pallet! Olive oil cake/ glazed beets with ricotta salata/ buffalo cucumbers, celery and blue cheese....OMG i love it  Olive oil cake= the top was as if it was toasted and the inside was very moist! Glazed beets= very lite glazed and the ricotta was a nice little extra. Buffalo Cucumbers = the added celery fives it a very nice crunch. Must try...ill be back for sure"}
{"text":"Clean, open, friendly. Met a friend who works in the same building for lunch on a Thursday and had the special, so good! It was extremely sloppy but delicious. They've got an efficient system and friendly service which is always appreciated. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My Madison friend suggested we stop at this trendy lunch spot while near the Capitol and wow was it good!! I had the Hoboken and if you love fresh mozz, this is your sandwich. The roast beef was super thinly sliced, tender and delicious. I'm not a big fan of foccacia, so I would maybe try another bread next time. However, this foccacia was light and not too doughy. I wanted it to be a pizza crust with all that fresh mozz melted on top.  We dined outside in their quaint patio area, but they did have a fabulous bar inside that was very inviting. I'd definitely like to share a bottle of vino and have a bite at the bar some early afternoon.  Even on a Friday afternoon, parking was not an issue which was somewhat surprising.   If you haven't already, put this place on your shortlist."}
{"text":"I got half of the turkey sandwich on focaccia and I think it's the best sandwich I've ever had. The half sandwich was a generous portion, well worth $6. I read an article that sandwiches aren't available after 3pm, so I had to plan to go to Casetta on a Saturday and the effort was well worth it!  I will definitely be back to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had great experiences both times.  I work a block away, so I've ordered for carry-out both times.  First was the prosciutto sandwich and second was the baked ziti.  Both were so flavorful and delicious.  I'm writing this review now because I'm counting down until lunch when I get to finish the baked ziti (it's that good)."}
{"text":"Super awesome sandwiches but I'm knocking off a star for the bloody marys that cost 9 bucks a pop and didn't even come with a beer chaser until we asked for one. I love the sandwiches though.   My wife and I were looking for a nice farmer's market brunch and thankfully there was no line at Cassetta. I got the Green Eggs & Ham sandwich and my wife had a half Vegetalian which even though it was a half was still huge. She's not a vegetarian but leans that way when we go out to eat sometimes. We split a hashbrown. Both sandwiches were excellent. Great bread, great ingredients, just awesome. The Vegetalian has thinly shredded lettuce and hot pepper relish on it to do a halfway convincing job of mimicking a real Italian sub but without the delicious cured meats.   The inside of the place is nice although I'm starting to feel like subway tile and reclaimed-looking wood is becoming a bit of a played-out look. I got a kick out of the hipster dude behind the counter wearing a beard net over his massive beard. Score one for cleanliness.   But damn yo, 9 bucks for a bloody mary, and no beer chaser??? Her sandwich was $6 and mine was $8. But we wanted bloody marys with our breakfast sandwiches so we ordered them anyway. They were alright. Not worth the price tag though.   Come for the sandwiches, and maybe don't be dumb like me and order the 9 friggin dollar bloody marys."}
{"text":"Had a great late lunch at Casetta this week. I tried the Hot Tonno and loved it on their house made Focaccia. Also had their delicious soup of the day. All was wonderful. Loved their decor and the owner was very nice. Also picked up a take-home dinner of stuffed manicotti to try and it was awesome as well. Plenty for 2 people. Great idea for those nights you don't have time to cook and you want a nice meal at home.  Great addition to the Madison deli scene. Thanks Casetta!"}
