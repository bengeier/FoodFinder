{"text":"I have been here many times... The staff is great and the food is the best bar food in town! The wings are better than anyone in our area! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Good drinks. Decent food.  Good prices.  Waitress disappeared for 40 minutes.  Almost walked out on check because we didn't know where she was.  Drinks sat empty for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last Thursday. I really enjoyed it my server bartender was great fun and makes great drinks. Her name was Shannon . The food was very good the onion rings were cooked perfect and the blt had real bacon and great prices too.

It was a fun little spot gpod music and down home feel ."}
{"text":"Have been going here since 2002.  Great people behind the bar.  Food is always good. Great wings and burgers. Kim & Nikki (?) make this a fun place to eat & drink at."}
{"text":"The burgers and wings are great!  The service is nice but soooo slow!!  My husband and I stopped for a beer and dinner before going to the movies.  We got there at 615, thinking that would allow us plenty of time to eat before the 7:40 show.  We didn't get our food till almost 7:15!!  At that point we had to chow it down which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great bar. Went for dinner with my husband. Sat at the bar. I got an order of the mild garlic wings, they were really good. Husband had a burger. The menu is nothing special, your standard bar food. Miller Light and Bug Light were on sale $2.00 for a tall, which is obviously a great deal. Someone else made the comment that this is a clean dive bar, I agree. The bartender was also friendly and the service was good."}
{"text":"This spot is not bad. It is right by the freeway and is a hide-a-way.  Pleasant people and drinks ok. It is a nice spot to get away."}
{"text":"I must admit this is my local watering hole for sure.
Love the atmosphere and the people here.  You always meet someone knew and its a blast to hang out with the girls behind the bar!!

The wings are some of the best I have had for sure with there own homemade sauces.  
Monday night is taco night 3 tacos for $3

Fish Fry's on Friday's

Patio is open always open
Live DJ on Friday and Saturday Nights

Also they have added KENO..........KENO ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. The staff is as fun as the patrons. It won't take long to fit right in with the regulars who are very welcoming.  A very diverse crowd. Weekly food specials and great drink prices. The food may take a little bit longer than expected but it is worth it! Best wings around!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here the other night after dinner.  Didn't eat anything, so this isn't a food review.  For a bar, it's an okay place to go.  We had been to the old location and this one far exceeds that location at least in cleanliness.  

The drinks were strong and delivered quickly.  The prices are lower than most places I have visited.  The bartender was polite and had service with a smile.  High marks for the bar area.

We played some kind of a bowling game that was fun for all four of us.  The bar has a pool table that was in use the whole time.  There was a DJ standing in the corner turning some really terrible tunes with K-Mart disco lights spinning around.  That was a bit of a detraction to the bar overall."}
{"text":"I like it here! Attentive bar staff! Friendly people! Food is good, only had one bad experience here where my bartender was trashed. But every other time has been absolutely fabulous!"}
{"text":"All I will say is that you can tell by the photos that this place is not well known for its food..."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not impressed. The beer special is pretty good for a bucket of 5 beers for $10.00 and that made me happy but the food was a miss. The home made chips were ok but required ketchup to be able to eat them, the Philly cheese sandwich while good was quote lacking In the meat department. A good 1/3 of my sandwich was covered by a very small strip of meat. 

My dining companions also got a philly and an order of chicken strips. She ripped off 1/2 of the bread and threw it away so her sandwich would be meatier and she found a bone in with her sandwich while the little lady said she loved her chicken strips but wished they would have come with something else. 

Tldr; good strips decent beer special stay away from the Philly or you'll be hungry still."}
{"text":"Ordered the wings(Cajun and mild garlic parm) for dinner and they were delicious. Best wings I have had in a long time. The service was good.  Will definitely go back again, highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"DIVE DIVE DIVE... but the cleanest dive you have ever been too.  Reasonable prices on beer, and all the dive accoutrements (darts, jukebox, pool).  Service is ok if not very slightly above average.  Friendly atmosphere 95% of the time.  Some might go in and see the newly constructed bar, and not smell the stale beer and faint vomit aroma that customarily accompanies a dive.  Blue willow... you're a dive.  I don't care how much you mop or wipe stuff down.  You're a dive at heart, and that's a good thing.  I'll see you after work!"}
{"text":"I would like this place except for the fact that it takes forever to get drinks.  If you're at the bar it's not too bad.  But if you sit at any of the tables they basically ignore you and you have to go to the bar to get your drinks.  Also for some reason there's a bunch of kids there.  You can't play pool or any games since they're always in the way.  It's really weird with a bunch of kids in a bar where everyone is drinking alcohol.  It's not like it's a Sunday afternoon.  It's a Friday night with all these kids.  Don't come here."}
{"text":"This is A Very happening place!!!!!  The staff efficient.... Food excellent.... Service great and the patrons are friendly and nice"}
{"text":"Gina is the best bar tender I have ever had! She is quick.. Always one step ahead of me! I watched her take care of a bar of 50+ by herself.. Truly amazing! She seems to know everyone's name too! She even warned my glass up for my Christmas ale!"}
