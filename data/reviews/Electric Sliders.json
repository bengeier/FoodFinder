{"text":"Love the sliders and fries!  Outlaw was cooked perfect and full of flavor!  Fries were seasoned great!  They take the extra step in preparation!  The buffalo chicken has blue cheese and ranch! Can you say \"best of both worlds\"? Try this truck when you see it!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at this truck the other day and it was delicious. I ordered the three sliders and fries meal. I got the outlaw, which was a beef patty, cheddar cheese, bacon, fries onion strings and barbecue sauce. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The meat was seasoned perfectly and was cooked perfectly. Their fries were very flavorful and had just the right amount of crunch. I will for sure be following this truck around the valley!"}
{"text":"The perfect sliders to have. Though the wait is a bit long, you just gotta have patience, cause it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Eric is awesome and took great care of my brother and I . Very good is an understatement as they have perfected their food craft .   I will be back and will tell all my friends about my experience .  Thank you"}
{"text":"The truck was at my complex tonight. Just had the outlaw and porking awesome. Great taste and just the right size. Price was ok too. Wait time was about 10 minutes which was ok since she appeared to be all by herself in the truck. She was friendly and answered questions. The pineapple/jalapeño slaw was not that spicy, as she stated. The sweetness of the pineapple mixed well with the heat of the jalapeños. The fries were seasoned well but too crunchy for me, personally. We will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"This was outside our office today so decided to give a try. Was super crowded, a great sign! By the time we ordered they were out of everything except pulled pork bowl. That is disappointing, I would love to have tried the Outlaw. The wait was over 20 minutes but then the food was cold, (although 105+ outside?).  I will give it another try since they have had so many good reviews and I'd like to try the Outlaw   To  be continued and possibly revised :)"}
{"text":"I have had Electric Sliders two days in a row. I had all three sliders and the garlic parmesan fries. The meat was super tender and perfectly seasoned! My favorite was the Chicken Bang Bang! I love #electricslidersaz! Can't wait until they slide into Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"At today's Madison Bash 2017, I waited for about 1 hour for my three orders (2x Outlaws & 1x Chicken bang bang). The wait was so long that people left to order food at the other vendors, ate, and came back to wait in the Electric Sliders line. Two customers ahead of me demanded their money back and left (one of them a mother who missed her child's performance). One of Madison's employees stopped by to ask the order taker if she was doing well. The order taker said she needed change. Big mistake on the owner's/operator's part; you should ALWAYS have at least $300 worth of small bills for change. During my time at the truck, the Madison employee hadn't come back.  I finally get my food! I bite down into my Outlaw slider and noticed my beef wasn't fully cooked! Only one of the three sliders was fully cooked. By this time, I'm overheated from standing in the sun, really hungry, and irritated. I went back to the food truck and asked for my money back. I've never had an experience like this, nor have I had to ask for my money back. By this time, the other food truck lines were long. I couldn't bear having to wait longer for food. I was so hungry that we decided to leave the Bash early without getting to see the rest of the event. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"\"Am I just hungover or is this the best burger I've ever had?\" my sis pondered as she sank her teeth into a Outlaw slider from her hotel bed. She wasn't just hungover - it was actually the best burger I ever had, too.  Electric Sliders has gotten even better since the last time I had it last year. The flavor combination is perfect just the way it was intended. Believe them.  The garlic fries are even more delicious now and can come \"loaded\" also known as \"The basket full of deliciousness\"  with melted cheese and what seems like a bit less garlic for the perfect balance.  Forget In N Out, and dare I say, Shake Shack. Electric Sliders officially has the best burger in town."}
{"text":"Sliders on Sliders! I've used Electric Sliders to cater a work event and the level of service & food quality is out of this world! Everyone at the event loved the Sliders and fry combo plate! I would recommend this truck to anyone looking to cater or just grab a bite."}
{"text":"My experience with this food truck is always bitter sweet.  The sliders are extremely good, but they never give you enough food.  Two sliders and potato chips is not enough food for $9.00 and definitely not enough for a full lunch, but every time they come to our office complex I find myself down there waiting in line because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Recently I was very disappointed. I looked at the menu online and saw they had over the top fries but when I got to the food truck they didn't have it so I was a little sad but lived with it and ordered the garlic Parmesan fries. The people were so nice though so it made up for it. Sadly though I waited 30 minutes for my fries. Now this was at a community center so it wasn't too busy. To my disappointment it was a very small size with no garlic. It was literally garlic powder. Although I can not say how the rest of the food was I recommend to not get the fries."}
{"text":"Talk about a welcomed break from a summer office day. Eric and Sara were incredibly friendly and the food.....WOW! You can tell these two love seeing people smile from their food and love their work.  I'm a little skeptical of food trucks keeping up quality but no need to worry here! The sliders are juicy and bursting with flavor! Fries are perfectly crispy and well seasoned. If you have a sweet tooth, do yourself a favor and dont miss their heaven-sent deep fried Oreo creation! If you ever see this truck, your belly will appreciate you making a stop for this! Thank you for making my work day enjoyable. Please come back soon."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to eat at this truck when I was at Charlie's bar in phoenix the other day.  I bought the chicken bang bang  and it was amazing. Eric and Sarah were both very nice and accommodating. I would defiantly eat here again if I had the chance. Its a must try!"}
{"text":"I tried this out today as someone posted \"Best Burger Ive ever had\" should have realized the hangover part was real. I ordered The Outlaw Beef Patty without the buns, Cheddar Cheese, Bacon, Fried Onion Strings(none) and Electric Sliders Signature Barbeque Sauce. Overall Ok, not the best though I finished my 2 mini burgers in 2 bites. The garlic fries, which I have had elsewhere would be true garlic fries. These fries are just sprinkled with garlic spice they are bland and boring. Over all disappointed for $9 that I paid."}
{"text":"I'm so dissapointed that yelp hasn't added an  option to rate restaurants less than one star. I am at a grad party that is less than rad due to this poor service.  An experience that could be above a six is now a one (would rate rate lower if possible, see above). I was so excited to try the sliders when I saw the truck,  but now I'm so disappointed because I've spent 2 1/2 hours waiting to get my slider instead of socializing.  I wasn't going to write a review on this food truck until my wait got so boring that I decided it would help pass the time. My peers around me agree thoroughly and are even helping me compose this review for your future betterment.  I have now received my sliders and I'm am really excited to tell you they're extremely subpar.  I was sitting here with hope that this wait it would be worth it and to my dismay it was not.  Yet again not living up to my expectations.  The wait for my jank sliders was anything but electric.  I would also like to inform you that due to your such slow service your lightning bolt on the side of your truck is false advertising.  Thank you for your time,  and I earnestly hope you improve your service."}
