{"text":"Fast delivery, food was hot, veggies were crisp, as were the eggrolls! More than I expected. Food/meat quality was great. Overall will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"A True Hiddenn Gem with the best Thai food in Vegas!   Love this place and love the Owner Aranya! -B"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. If you are like me and love fish and spicy food, you have to try their spicy catfish, it's great. A really relaxed and great place to take a date or even your family. The service is really friendly and is also very helpful when it comes to suggesting great dishes. There is also a bar there for the ones who love to drink while enjoying a meal. So if you are craving Thai food, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is good, but don't expect much as far as service.  We had the red chicken curry.  Ordered it mild but it was SPICY!  Also, ordered the drunken noodles-they were delicious! If you are looking for good quality food-go here, but if you want a server that will help you out, or say hello, then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service is horrible and is really rushed . Complementary soup is not hot it is warm there are better Thai restaurants than."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is never busy but I always receive great service and food. My husband gets the green curry and I get the sweet and sour chicken (cut me some slack, I am new to Thai food!) The portions are great and the dishes could easily be shared. The ambiance in this restaurant is beautiful and peaceful. I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good food and a quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried several times to like this place---we really did.  But the Madam server who seems to run the place during the lunch hour is arrogant and the service is indifferent.   Her main goal appears to be to keep customers in their place.  The food was inconsistent.  You will also have to monitor the order very carefully.  They either don't know their own menu or else they are trying to save money by leaving items off the order.  

No more chances.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night after a Target run in the same shopping center. Should have left immediately after entering the restaurant and seeing only 1 table of customers, buy we were hungry and decided to give it a try. Ordered the Pad Thai which had undercooked noodles and was way too sour. The red curry was sweet, and the yellow curry was bland. The \"angel wings\" (stuffed, fried chicken wings) were the only enjoyable part of the meal. Will avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner ordered Thai egg roll the calamari and pad kee mow . Egg roll and squid awesome ordered the pad kea mow at a 3 but came at a 8 easy too hot called the owner over and tried to explain and he started to yell at me grabbed my plate and in front of a crowd to me to get the F out of there. I will go to the corner Thai kitchen at trop. And tee pee."}
{"text":"This is a place I frequent; mainly for their lunch specials since it's such a great deal and you get so much food for only $8.  The restaurant has a nice decor and it's clean.  The food is flavorful and tastes great!  I've brought at least 4 of my friends for lunch over the past year and every one of them say it's good food.  I love the curry dishes!  Definitely a place I keep coming back to."}
{"text":"I consider this to be one of the best thai places in Vegas.  Very surpised by the other ratings.  I usually get pickup or get delivery and it's always excellent with large portions.  The dining area is the best I've seen so far and has good ambiance.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this Place!  Great Thai food, good portions and Aranya always hooks me up:)"}
{"text":"Had take-out here last Friday. Ordered Tom Yum Goong with chicken. Essentially Tom Yum Gai. My friend ordered his Tom Yum Goong as is with the shrimp. Also had a Massaman Curry. 

My soup was good with TONS of chicken. Good flavor and spice. My friend complained about only a few shrimp in his. Though it was loaded with Mushrooms. 

The Massaman curry was good mix of peanut and creamy flavor, but seemed a bit oily. 

Not bad but nothing really stood out for me either."}
{"text":"I have had several lunches here and never disappointed. I wouldn't say it's the best Thai ever but the atmosphere is nice, the staff is attentive, and food tasty."}
{"text":"Archi's Thai is my go-to place, however every now and then I'll try somewhere new. This weekend we tried Aranya. We've been by it a bunch of times, but we're usually grabbing Fuddruckers and cupcakes from Mad Hatter. We were lured in because my husband's uncle had a discount with the Entertainment Book card. 

The space is relaxed and nicely decorated, but frankly I don't care what a place looks like if it's tasty and priced right. Still a nice atmosphere is always appreciated. My husband and I ordered our standard Thai dishes: pad thai and spicy eggplant. Uncle ordered spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings. The peanut sauce was the highlight and the spiciest of the dishes despite specific requests for spicy. The eggplant was waxy and sweet. I was not fond of it. However, it was better than my husband's too sweet pad thai and overcooked noodles. He gave me a small portion to try and I had no desire to finish it. It was some of the worst I've encountered in town. Uncle wasn't impressed by his selections either.

Service was below average. Timing was off and refills were slow."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in to Aranya and ordered carry-out for dinner.  We were invited to sit at the bar while we waited for our food to be prepared.  The interior is very nice, clean, and well-maintained.  The service was prompt, friendly, and professional.

In addition to offering the usual chicken, beef, and tofu panang curries for $9.95 each, Aranya also offers shrimp and salmon panang for $11.95 and $13.95 respectively.  I thought it would be interesting to try the salmon panang, since I had never seen that as an option for panang before.  

The salmon panang was not served the way other panangs are typically served -- that is, in a tall plastic container with the chunks of meat or tofu submerged in the coconut milk curry sauce.  Instead it was served in a styrofoam flat bed container (over aluminum foil) with the whole salmon steak doused with the curry sauce.  I guess it makes more sense to do it this way with salmon, but it was actually somewhat of a disappointment to me because I think I only got about a third of the amount of curry sauce that I would have gotten with any other panang dish, and there was hardly a need for the brown rice I ordered on the side. However, it's my fault for not asking or thinking about it before I ordered.  Anyway, it tasted very good.

My friend ordered the tofu pad kra pow, which some other Asian restaurants would simply call spicy mint tofu.  The tofu was served in large chunks.  My friend enjoyed the dish, but she thought it would have been better if the tofu had been served ground -- to mimic the way the spicy mint chicken is typically served with ground chicken.

As with some other Thai restaurants, rice is considered a side dish which must be ordered separately.  Sticky rice and brown rice are $2.00, and steamed rice is $1.00 (small) or $2.00 (large).

So, Aranya Thai Bistro has good food, good service, fair prices, and nice interior.  This place is A-OK."}
{"text":"Hands down my Favorite Thai place.The very thought of Yellow Curry Chicken and Chicken Saute w/ Peanut sauce is making my mouth water....... Few places actually cook a potato completely, this place is one of these. My girl enjoys their vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"Damn. Another place I should've Yelped before I ate at.

I was set on Zaba's this evening, when out of nowhere, a wild sign appeared that read \"Thai food!\" I immediately started craving some sweet sticky rice and mango. So, I ventured off into the complex across the way.

Went in, looked at a menu and discovered that they didn't have it ;( but figured, \"what the hell, I'm here already,\" so I ordered some food to go. The place itself is nice looking.. \"quaint.\" I ordered a Thai iced tea, which the lady brought to me quickly, so I started sipping-- delicious! But more on that later...

The food actually came out pretty fast, which seemed a bit unusual. But after reading a couple reviews, I'm guessing what I got had probably been sitting out for a bit and was popped into a microwave or something. I'm not too picky, it all tasted fine, so whatever.

So I'm sitting at home, done eating, watching me some Breaking Bad and finishing up my tea. I take off the lid and without second thought, began munching on ice, like I do. Well, eventually I decide to look into the cup and see that there's little black specs  in pretty much all of the ice cubes. I shake it around a bit and find a bigger piece of-- Now, for my fellow Yelpers who have worked in fast food and know how gross an ice machine can get if not properly cleaned, this one's for you-- MOLD.

And that right there forfeited all the couple of stars I was going to give this place for being adequate. I realize I've probably eaten at places that don't practice kitchen cleanliness, but when it's so bad that I fucking see mold in my ice, that is where I draw the line. Zero stars."}
{"text":"I fell in love with their Panang Curry!  There's just something about the different spices that marry each other.  I've tried other Panang Curries in Vegas and by far Aranya is on point with the flavor and texture.

Today we ordered shrimp Pad Thai, beef Kung Pow, beef Garlic Sauce, and beef Panang Curry.  All were great dishes! Filled us up quick.  For dessert we had sticky rice with mango, one of my favorite Thai desserts on the menu.

The restaurant looks clean and well kept.  Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The lunch menu here is a very good deal, offering my preferred dish of panang curry with an egg roll, side of rice, salad and drink for less than $9. The food is pretty dang good, especially for that price. 

I have gone to four thai restaurants in town so far (well, 6 if you count the three different Archi's locations with different names). So far, I have ordered the maximum hotness level at every one of them and still had to add everything available on the spice trays.

I think they all figure that I'm a white guy so I can't handle the real heat. Let me assure you, that is incorrect. The lady at this place told me to just order it extra extra spicy next time I come in and she'll try to hook me up. I look forward to it!

The flavor on the panang curry was very very good. It gets a star taken off for lack of spiciness, and I wasn't a big fan of the salad either. The egg roll was pretty good for an egg roll, but I'm not a fan of them in general so I didn't ding them for not impressing me.

At the end of the day, I will *definitely* be coming back here and ordering the lunch extra spicy. Definitely a great lunch spot. 

Oh, and it's freakin' cold in there. Just leave your coat on."}
{"text":"About two weeks ago, had wonton soup in this restaurant, which was the worst I had ever, ever had in my whole life.

Here are the components of the soup:

1. water,  with one big drop of oil floating on the top. This was the only aspect showing the \"generosity\" of the cook, and owner.

2. Two pieces of veg stems:  very hard. with no leaf on either stems, I could only guess: kale stem. Also this was the first time, I learned that such hard stem were used in soup. 

3. Four pieces of wonton, all wrappers were in rugs, The stuffing of beef meat was tiny, yet very hard. Since it was so tiny, one had to just swallow down, leaving the job of breaking it down to stomach.

4.  two pieces of  shrimps,  overcooked, hard with no flavor at all.

5. three pieces of sliced meat: I guess pork. also hard, no flavor at all. 

Among the five items, except shrimp ( finished with disguest), and water ( did not taste at all), I just had a tiny bite of each of the other three item, then dropped, stopped to eat. So the lunch was a sample tasting for me, I only had two pieces of shrimp. The rest of them was left in the bowl.

Without any exaggeration, every compoenet was a failure, a compelte failure.

 The total cost was around $1-2 at most, sold for around $10. I left nearly the whole bowl behind. The owner even did not bother to ask about any issues for future improvement. Or improvement was not what she cared about in the first place.

I wrote my review with two purposes in mind: 

first of all, the owner should raise here sense of responsibility for customers. She simpley did not any sense of responsiblity shown in the soup at all. Yes, either side has responsibility for the other: As a customer, I should pay for the cost of material and  labor. As the owner and cook, she has the responsibility to produce a meal up to the charge, or at least edible. But she failed here completely, even without any sign of caring about why it nearly remained untouched.

Secondly, I really don't want others to repeat what I experienced. The good thing is that I am local and I can have another lunch at home. What about non-local customers?"}
{"text":"I was refereed by a friend to give this place a try and honestly I'm really glad I took him up on that offer.  Me and my girlfriend both had a great time eating at Arayna the food was superb and they made us feel super comfortable the whole time. All the workers were friendly too which is not something you find often nowadays. Overall 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost. Worst service ever. And the food, not good. Sticky rice not cooked at all. Soup, all broth with a few chunks of nasty meat (I think it was meat)."}
{"text":"Another neighborhood Thai place NOT in Chinatown area.  Love when we can save time and not have to drive all the way to Chinatown.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were quickly greeted by the server and seated, and I have to admit that I was quite impressed by the well done decor.  That aside, I would have to say that I was pretty satisfied with the food experience.

Had to order some our usual fav's (Being that it was our first time here, we decided to play it safe and order 2 out of 4 level spicy just in case we didn't want our bootays kicked too badly):
1.  Papaya Salad - We couldn't taste the spiciness at all.  However, I still enjoyed the tangy and sweet refreshing and crunchy papaya shreds.  Perfect for summer.
2.  Tom Yum Gong - This soup I felt was way too sweet and also lacked any spiciness.  Someone was a little heavy handed with the sugar ladle, but the bf seemed to slurp his up happily.
3.  Pad Kra Pow - We ordered this dish in the chopped beef form and it actually had some spicy kick.  Maybe they forgot to add the spice in the other two dishes?  *shrug.  Either way, this dish was my fav of the night.  Spicy, minty and flavorful.  =)

Conclusion 08.02.2010:  I've certainly have had better Thai food at other places, but this place is very a-ok in my book.

Conclusion 08.03.2010:  Yup!  I went 2 days in a row, but it did help me solidify my conclusion that the food here is definitely on the wayyyy sweeter side.  Still just a-ok and prefer other Thai places over this one.  Sucked in by the nice owner and the wonderful zen decor!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming- upscale interior, slightly-inflated regular prices on menu, nice range of seafood options. Since I was only doing takeout, I just made the cut for the lunch specials from 11AM-3PM (also valid on weekends!) and opted for the garlic chicken. 

Per the menu, lunch specials come with soup (when you dine in), salad, fried rice, and egg roll (I thought this was a Thai place?), with entrée protein choice of chicken, beef, or pork,  surcharge for shrimp. My dish was  one flavorless spring roll, a heap of wonton strips (who eats those except on soup?), and a chunk of ice berg lettuce with some matchstick carrots. And my (half?) portion of garlic chicken: lightly flavored sauce, tender chicken, and a good shake of pepper on top? Very odd. Oh and the \"entrée\" section of the takeout box was largely dominated by a gigantic heap of white rice. Not fried. This would be better placed where the wonton strips are.

Service was quick and polite. Order did not meet my expectations. Did not eat half the order: won ton strips and dressing-less lettuce were tossed, could not stomach the flavorless spring roll or more than a few bites of the white rice that was hogging the space that should have been occupied by more garlic chicken.
Likely would not come here again."}
{"text":"They drew a cat on a container like I wanted, no other place has done that for me! They're amazing and sweet!!! Also drew a bonus fish! I'm excited to order from here again!!! Honestly good quality as well. :) 
Yellow curry is good."}
{"text":"I normally goto Archi's...but I just got done shopping at Kohl's and was starving...since I love Thai food...I decided to stop by.

I should've kept going or eaten at fuddrucker's.  I ordered a 10 and got a 2...the food was under seasoned. Some of the cucumbers were rotten in the cucumber salad. They touched my table 3 times so hence the 2 stars. 

Thoroughly disappointed. I well not be going back."}
{"text":"We went back a couple nights ago and had yet again another wonderful dinner.  We have yet to be disappointed with our entrees.  We had our usual appetizers and entrees and decided to try the sweet and sour pork.  We were wonderfully pleased with the dish... the pork was fried perfectly and very light.  The sauce was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food after work and didn't really want to sit down and eat. Arayna was close to my house and I was able to get an order for take out. The restaurant was empty when I arrived, which was a bit worrisome, but a hostess came from the back to take my order. She was polite, but not particularly warm or friendly.

I decided on an order of Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken and sat down to wait. There was a slight smell in the restaurant, but nothing like sewage, thankfully (I saw that in a previous review). My food came out promptly.

My meal was filling, and I had enough left over for lunch the next day. There was a good amount of chicken and shrimp (tails on, but good size), and the noodles were tasty. I ordered a \"3\" on the spiciness scale, but I probably could have gone a bit spicier, as it wasn't all that well seasoned.

I wouldn't go out of my way to revisit Arayna, but if I were in the area again, I'd return."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, I easily eat Thai at least once a week and when I am in the neighborhood Aranya is my top choice. It is hard because I live on the other side of town (by Cheyenne and the 95). Sometimes I drive all the way over there just to eat! I love this place! Easily my favorite Thai Restaurant in town.Their duck curry and Thai beef salad are my favorite dishes, alone with a Thai tea to drink of course. 

Atmosphere is always so comfortable, and it is always clean. I think my problem with a lot of other Thai places in town is they seem really dirty. I want to know my food was prepared well- not wonder if its contaminated!

The staff is super friendly! With all the time I have been frequenting this establishment, I almost feel like I know them! 

When you go make sure to get Mango and Sticky Rice for desert! It is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was feeling for some thai food after the gym and discovered this place. The service at this place is horrible. Once again horrible service. With that said the food is okay but I definitely had better. 

I ordered red curry and a pad thai. They had a 4 point scale of spice. Their spicyness is not very spicy and this is coming from someone who eat spicyness all that often. The food was okay. Curry was a little watery but had plenty of flavor. Pad thai tasted like a pad thai so no complaints about that. 

I walked in and it took a while for me to get seated because the hostess was in the back chatting. She took our drink orders and came back to take our food orders. Our drinks came out with the food which was about 15 minutes later. 

With all that said I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Good food and nice service. A bit Americanized, but probably a smart call for Summerlin. 

Tofu egg drop soup was a fantastically surprise. Light, tasty and just awesome. I almost licked the bowl clean. Pad kra pow with salmon was also a huge hit. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Had the Pad Thai, Pineapple Shrimp Fried Rice, and Angel Wings. It was good."}
{"text":"The spicy catfish is what I get every single time! The fish is cooked to perfection, and the curry has the perfect amount of flavor and spice. The perfect way to cool my mouth down is by having a super yummy Thai tea. We come here at least 2 times a month, so the workers all know what we want every time we come in. I love the small, cozy feel of the place. It's a great place to go for a nice, small dinner. :)"}
{"text":"An average of 2 1/2 stars? Hmmm.....I'm sure it wasn't THAT bad right??

As usual, whenever I'm at a Thai restaurant, I always get chicken pad thai with added spice. You can't fu*k up pad thai...it would be an embarassment to the restaurant if that happens.

They had lunch specials for $6.99. Along with your entree, it comes with soup, salad, and eggroll. This place is not bad actually. It wasn't bland or tasteless and service was fine. Nothing special to write home about...You come in, order your food, eat your food, pay and move on to your merry way."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went with a few friends today. Their pad thai and crab rangoons are THE BEST! Prices are reasonable and they have great service too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at several different Thai places and this is The BEST. It's waaayy better than Archie s or Pin Kaow.  They have lunch special including weekends and you get a soda too. Amazing deal"}
{"text":"This is a great place, i really like the barbecue pork and all there salads are great. It is family owned and the service is great. I like the fact that the food is not greasy. After a workout i am usually very hungry, so i know when i go there i will get waited on fast and my food will be ready quick. If you like fresh clean food this is the place to go. Everything is priced fairly also."}
{"text":"okay, so here the thing! I went back to this restaurant and gotten my favorite item on the menu the \"orange duck\". but this time it was not very pleasant, it was tough and over cooked and definitely salty an not tasty at all. I am almost curtain they fried it in Clorox bleach EEK!!! :^X 

I'm never going back here ever again. disgusting!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This restaurant has really declined in quality all around since a couple of years ago. The location and atmosphere is still really nice but everything else was disappointing. 

We arrived right when the store opened and the waitress seemed unhappy to see my friend and I. No smile, no greeting, she just walked us to our table and handed us tattered menus. Great start. We were the only customers but it took her a while to take our order.

Our food came out first and our drinks last.. Is that a Thai thing? The food was also severely disappointing. My friend ordered green curry and I ordered my favorite Thai dish, Pad Kra Pao. After tasting both, I knew I would never return to this restaurant. The curry was watery and the Pad Kra Pao was somehow flavorless. 

My two cents: stay away!"}
{"text":"Now I've never quite made it to Thailand to have the real deal -- authentic Pad Thai -- but in my quest to find some good Pad Thai here in Las Vegas, I thought Aranya's Pad Thai is pretty good. I can taste that sour taste of tamarind juice and the saltiness of fish sauce. Most of the Thai restaurants I've visited shy away from those ingredients and use something else instead as substitutes, understandably to \"Americanize\" the flavor. This I thought was one of the better tasting Pad Thais. But until I make it to Thailand and have the real deal, this is up there for me as my search continues."}
{"text":"Not the best tasting Thai food here at all. Service was crappy and the price is not worth what the food tastes like. Save your money and go to satay. Way better Thai food."}
{"text":"The food was very bland and tasteless. None of the sauces had a taste they seemed more like a garnish then part of the dish. 

The service was none existent I sat there with 1 other table that was on their way out so it wasn't like it was busy night. I had to ask for a beverage instead of being offered one and minutes before my dish came out they decided to ask me how spicy I wanted my dish. Needless to say if your in a rush and just looking to fill your stomach with substance this is one of those places."}
{"text":"Lots to be desired!

I noticed this place as I was working on the road in this part of town yesterday.  I had a little time to kill and was craving some Tom Ka soup!

Right from the get-go it's hard to note much in the way of positives.  It was approx. 4pm, not a single customer in the dining room.  I walked in, and there was no hostess... (She was hiding behind her make-shift office in one of the dining booths).  I asked her if I could sit at the bar since I was dining alone, sadly there was only ONE available seat at the bar, the remaining seats were occupied with restaurant supplies.  

I ordered my Tom Ka and some Chicken Satay along with a glass of Iced Thai Tea.  While I waited for my food to arrive, I noticed them microwaving several meals, and they weren't even being discreet about it as the microwave was sitting behind the bar facing patrons.  The microwaved food was then packed into 'take out' bags.  

My food arrived and it was less than impressive.  The soup had chunks of tomato so large they had to be cut with a knife, I was offered a 'spicy' soup and it came out a weak 4 out of 10 on the Thai spicy scale.  The chicken Satay was decent, however I refused to try the dipping sauces since moments before serving I saw them take it out of the microwave!!!!

The three items totaled over $20 which seemed a bit steep for the quality.  The Thai food market in Las Vegas is strong, and  in order to compete, you've got to be good.  ..... This place left a lot to be desired"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for the first time with a work colleague.  She ordered the Massaman and I ordered  the Shrimp Pad Thai.  We were both impressed with our food.  I tried her Massaman - delicious!  It was a bit spicy but so good.  I liked the brown rice they served with the meal, I think it had barley in it too.  Very hearty and flavorful.  My colleague said she wanted to bring her husband back.  They travel to Thailand and Singapore, so I take it that's a good sign!"}
{"text":"Aranya Thai is a convenient Thai place I do  take-out at.
I really wanted to love this place BUT.....

CONS
1. The food is on the sweet side instead of spicy side.
2. The people that work there are is not very friendly or sociable.
3. The 'taste' of the dishes are about a 3 star.

PROS
1. Fast when order take-out order 
2. Restaurant has a pretty & cozy interior"}
{"text":"The decor is pretty nice, but it is a small restaurant.   I've had their chicken pad thai, yellow curry, and red curry lunch specials to go. Their food is good, not bad at all.  My real only disappointment is that the portions are small compared to other thai restaurants' lunch specials.  

I would rather go to Basil n Lime or Pin Kaow and get an even better tasing dish and a lot more of it.  Prices are comparable to these two."}
{"text":"We decided to get some take-out after spending too much money at Target. We hit up Aranya since it was in the same area and got the chicken pad thai and chicken with cashew nuts. The chicken and cashew nuts were really bland and tasteless. The pad thai was pretty good, although I'm no expert at Thai food. Would I go there again? Maybe, if I need a quick fix of  Thai food that's close to home. But, if I was really craving good Thai, I would have to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My bf wanted Thai so we went to Aranya.  I have tried their pad see euw, Duck Curry, and crab fried rice before (takeout) so I suggested Aranya.  It's a small Thai restaurant but quite cozy.  The waitress is not a friendly sociable person.  It's as if she doesn't want to be there.  

We ordered this fish paste curry something but that was quite tasty when dipped into this sweet cucumber sauce.   Would definitely order again.

Next, we had the Pad See Euw.  It's overly sweet.  Probably won't order again.

Then onto the Duck Curry.  I really love this Duck Curry.  It was the right amount of flavor to make me come back for more, regardless of the does-not-smile-at-all waitress.

Anywho, will definitely come back for some yummy in my tummy duck curry carry out."}
{"text":"We eat lunch here on a regular basis, there red curry is great, I get mine with chicken ,if you like brown rice I think they have the best. If the dish is not spicy enough for you they have a tray of sauces and powders to heat it up just ask. There lunch specials are a real deal"}
{"text":"Their lunch special is awesome but service lacks! great chicken pad thai and egg rolls. $7.95 for a great meal and one soda the lady pretty much ignores the fact that you want a refill. she's probably pissed because she is the owner and the economy sucks and she has to put in some labor oh well."}
{"text":"We got a mass mailing a couple of months ago for Aranya and decided to try the place yesterday.  I ordered take out over the phone.  The order was taken quickly but I was surprised that I was never asked for a name nor a phone number.  Not a good way of doing business.

We got an order of Thai egg rolls, an order of Garlic with Black Pepper sauce (extra garlic requested), and an order of Red Curry (Gang Dang) chicken.  My wife thought the chicken was OK but not as described.  The menu notes that it's topped with roasted garlic Thai style but it wasn't.  It wasn't topped with the roasted garlic like every other Thai restaurant from which we've gotten garlic pepper chicken.

My red curry with chicken was flavorful.  Their spiciness is done on a 1-4 scale.  I ordered a 3 and it had a nice spice to it.  I also received a small container of ground red pepper to add more spice if I wanted.  I appreciate it when Thai restaurants do this.  The egg rolls were a but greasy something I haven't experienced before when getting them from other places.

Overall, things were OK, but I don't think I'll be going back.  There are way too many other choices that offer better food at a comparable or lesser price."}
{"text":"The food here is great! The price is very reasonable and the atmosphere is fun.  It is group friendly and can be a place for couples to dine.  The service is even better.  I had no problems with any of the  waitresses each time I go.  I would recommend this place if you are interested in Thai food!"}
{"text":"Aranya is ok.  The lunch special offers about 10 or 15 choices including several curries, pad thai, and kung pao, or cashew nut to name a few.  It is $8 for chicken and includes a soda.  

This is a little pricier than other lunch specials and frankly, not as good.  I've definitely experienced better Thai food for a better price.  

That said, it is a cute place, with nice service."}
{"text":"Very good Panang curry! Good Satay too! I like this place, it's calm and has a quiet atmosphere. The lady is always super nice too."}
{"text":"This place has pretty nice decor when you walk in, we can here for lunch and got the lunch specials, which was very inexpensive and a pretty good deal. Comes with soup, salad and soda for $6.95. my bf ordered the pad thai and I got the chicken with bell  peppers and basil. It was just bleh and ok to my taste. They gave us hot mustard which I felt was very chinese and not too thai authentic."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon.  They offered 11 entrees for $7.95 ($8.95 for shrimp) which included soup, egg roll, fried rice, and a 12 oz soda.  

They were located on Grand Canyon Parkway in Las Vegas.  The decor was very nice.  There were 5 booths, a bunch of tables, and a bar.

The server took my order.  I ordered the Garlic Shrimp and a diet Coke.  She dropped off the soda without stopping.  She then dropped off the soup without stopping.  She did not even tell me what kind of soup it was.  I figured it was Egg Drop soup.  It was piping hot.  

The entree took about 20 minutes to come out.  The server dropped off the plate without stopping.  The plate made a big thump and startled me.  She then dropped off the condiment tray without stopping.  I would have liked a spicy tray since I forgot to tell her to make the Garlic Shrimp Thai Hot.  

There were 5 shrimp with the tails on in a garlic sauce and a few mushrooms. The salad was fresh with a light sweet dressing. The egg roll was bland.  Luckily the server brought me a little tray with sweet and sour sauce, mustard, soy sauce, and salt and pepper shakers.

The food was average and the service was abrupt and not very friendly.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was supposed to only go to Target but as I was parking my car I saw the big sign advertising Arayana's lunch special. It was like $7.95 for a meal with a soda....and I do mean just one soda.  I didn't want to drive across the parking lot to find out that it was too late for the special so I called using my handy Yelp app. They said they would honor the lunch special for me even though it just ended at 3:00pm. I thought \"cool\". 

I came in and it was practically empty so I sat in a booth facing the sun. The booths are so high that looking from the back you couldn't even see me but the waitress knew I was there but she didn't act like it . My food and drink were brought out and that is the last I saw of the waitress until it was time to pay.

I ordered the Pad Thai special it comes with soup , fried rice, egg roll and a drink. I started off with the soup which was okay. Then she brought out my meal . The Pad Thai had a really good flavor too it and it was the best thing on the plate. The fried rice and the egg roll were blah! The egg roll really needed to be served with sweet and sour sauce in order for it to taste okay. The rice needed some flavor .I was waiting for the waitress to come back over because I wanted some hot sauce to put over it. She never came though. 

I would recommend that this place orders those condiment holders which can store their, hot sauce, sweet and sour sauce. They should place them on every table if they don't want to bring them out with the food. I would also suggest they come back to check on you at least once with at least water if they don't want to refill your drink."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really beautiful interior and excellent staff.  The $6.99 lunch special includes soup and a drink and is a great deal.  I always go for the yellow curry when I eat Thai and here it was awesome.  My friend got a Egg Foo Young entree and the portions were huge."}
{"text":"Well I got fifty bucks worth of veggies....i feel totally ripped off.  I came across an old menu and thought why not well don't make my mistake ....they must be really hurting or super cheap...and I'm not talking about the prices im talking about my meat and seafood entrees that came with about four pieces of meat the rest veggies but hey we all said the rice was great what a joke"}
{"text":"The pad thai in this restaurant is the worst that I have ever had. They do have panang curry which is available for lunch special. The venue is nice and cozy, but the quality of food could be better."}
{"text":"My mom and I just had lunch at this establishment and we found a cockroach in her chicken curry. Our server blamed it on the fact that they had sprayed for bugs the previous night. Regardless, if the food was stored properly and the restaurant was cleaned properly, bugs would have had no chance to come in contact with our food. BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this restaurant many times and have tried many different dishes. Just recently back from Thailand, I fell in love with their Panang Curry. Best I have had. HOWEVER, I ordered their lunch special today of Panang Curry and found there to be a very large bug in the curry. I will never eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always have the best service when I come here, it feels like a family run restaurant. Intimate ambiance with a modern look. The food is excellent, I always get the pad se ew and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time for lunch and it was good. I would return for sure. The decor was nice and you can't beat the $6.95 lunch special including a drink. For that price I though the lunch would not be that good, but it turned out to be pretty good. I had tofu Penang curry which was tasty and came with a soup, salad & spring roll. This was way better than Prommares for sure. I will be back. The owners also own the King & I (which I haven't been to yet)."}
{"text":"I've had Thai food at many different places and this is now definitely in my top 5! So yummy so fast I got the pad see ewe level 3 spicy it was perfect. Would definitely recommend this to a friend! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Had late lunch/early dinner and did not leave disappointed. We intended on eating in Fuddruckers(there's a review all about it), that obviously did not happen and I'm glad because we never would've tried Aranya. We were promptly greeted by a friendly face and chose our seating(empty room). She swiftly took our drink orders and returned. We ordered the Chicken Satay which will ALWAYS please me! It was a delight. As for the main course we ordered the Beef Pad Thai and Chicken Massaman Curry(served family style). The curry was clean (no skin or bones), which I appreciate. Everything was tasty, hot, and quickly served. Sorry I didn't take any pics but we were hungry and the food looked yummy. I didn't even think about my camera until I was almost done with my curry. I loved the decor and place settings. Service was excellent, prices were fair, and it's in a good location. Will definitely eat at Aranya, or get their takeout, again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I usually get the chicken fried rice which is enough food for me since it is a very large portion. The quantity and the quality of the food is excellent. The Thai tea is spot on as well! 

The servers Max and Ajay had the best hospitality. They both know the ins and outs of the restaurant. They were very attentive to whatever we needed. They are also good at recommending a variety of foods depending what you are craving. I had a buddy of mine who is gay and he thought max and ajay were super cute. Im not gay though. Anyways aranyas thai bistros is awesome! Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a friend.  Average thai. Modern atmosphere, clean but a little small.  Our waitress was very sweet and very quick. Good customer service."}
{"text":"It was our first time there.  The food was good and at a reasonable price.  We did have to wait about 10-15 minutes to get our order taken because the server I guess what doubling up as delivery driver. The cook did talk to use and ensure she would be back soon, which she was."}
{"text":"Just so-so in my opinion.  We went for lunch, and their special is a great price.  Don't know where else I can get a sit down meal with soup, an egg roll, salad, and my main course for $8.

Service was also so-so, they didn't ignore us, but didn't come back to see how things were or if we needed anything.  Though the server was around if we really would have needed her.

Food was slightly bland, and not much seasoning.  Egg roll was burned.

Went at 11:30 and we were the only people in the place, and by the time we left ~12:15 there was only one more person."}
{"text":"1.  I've only ordered to-go (about 10 times), so I can't really comment on the in-dining service.  I always call in when leaving from work (at least 20 mins away), so the food is always ready and waiting when I get there.
2.  Everything I have ordered so far (especially the yellow curry with chicken) has been very good.
3.  I think they are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Aranya has become the go-to lunch spot for the office when we want Thai food.  Food is great, lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and the service is fast and efficient.  I haven't ventured beyond the lunch menu but have tried everything on it and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We mentioned to the waitress is our first time to dine. The food has no flavor as your typical Thai dish and spice. During the course the waitress never checked on us. There was only one customer besides us to say the least that she was busy. Horrible food and customer service.!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Have been coming here for years now. Food is always good and generous portions."}
