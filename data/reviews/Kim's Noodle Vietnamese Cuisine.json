{"text":"If you are looking for a good banh mi in Madison, this is the place to go.  We had the grilled, marinated pork and one with pickeled veggies and the marinated pork one was far better. Finally, a place in Madison with delicious banh mi! Previous reviewers have said their bread is lackluster, yet I'd disagree, the French bread was top notch. We also had egg rolls, spring rolls and the pork and shrimp bun. All were authentic Vietnamese dishes and tasted great. The homemade chili sauce is a must. I would disagree with other reviewers comments about slow service, we had a very attentive server both times we dined here. I noticed they added on Thai and Chinese entrees to their specials, yet I'd say the Vietnamese food here is the star."}
{"text":"I've been looking for an east-side pho joint since moving to Madison, so I decided to try out Kim's, having heard it was new to the game.  Came alone during dinner on a Tuesday, and the place was fairly quiet with only two or three other tables.

The menu is typical and extensive, with several authentic Vietnamese dishes (e.g. Bun bo hue) that don't usually turn up in the Thai-Viet-Chinese amalgamations that sometimes pop up in other cities.  But I was here for the pho.

I ordered the special bowl (dac biet) which comes with everything: flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, and spicy meatballs.  (This dish is one of my few concessions to the non-mammalian diet I usually practice -- I blame my mother.)  

So the key element is the broth: it shouldn't be too greasy or too salty.  Salt is the crutch of the lazy cook, and is too often used to disguise a weak stock.  This broth was suitably rich and beefy, and just a touch on the salty side.  The flat rice noodles were plentiful and on the right side of toothsome.  I much prefer the al dente to the slimy, soggy overcooked variety.  Flank and brisket were sliced nice and thin and perfectly cooked, as was the tripe.  My issue was with the tendon -- far too much, actually, and large, gristly and fat.  \"Hold up\", I hear you say, \"and what exactly were you expecting from tendon?\"  Well, better balance and proportion, for one.  And a little more attention to trimming.  Yeah, so I'm a little finicky when it comes to my meat derivatives, but it's not like I'm going to order tendon anywhere else.

I'll rate the overall dish as adequate in execution.  As usual, this giant bowl of steaming noodle soup is an excellent deal for the money, guaranteed to fill your belly.  (Pho is also the best hangover remedy in the world, by the way.)  So until I find someplace better, Kim's will do for my eastside pho fix."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Service was extremely slow and I sat for 5 minuets without water while the server came back twice without asking if we needed water.
We asked if the vegetarian egg rolls were fried and we were told yes so when it came out and it was more of a spring roll with a few pieces of fried tofu we were quite surprised. When we sent it back having only eaten 1 of the 2 rolls there was no comment & certainly no option to get something different. 

For lunch I ordered Pho with just the flank steak. The broth was quite good even before I add all of my stuff to it. The meat was a little thicker than I was used to but very good. The noodles were the downfall in this dish, way too many and they were not cooked completely. I ended up leaving the dish 1/2 full because it was overwhelming with undone noodles.

I will not be going back this his restaurant for pho- just going to stick with Saigon Noodle on the west side where they have perfect the Pho dish."}
{"text":"I had my first visit to Kim's last night and I can hardly wait to go back. I was very pleased that my friend and I were immediately greeted and seated, given that this was a Friday during peak dinner service hours. Our server was extremely welcoming, friendly, professional, prompt with meeting our needs and fully answered all of our questions about the menu. 

The spring roll order I split with my dinner companion was the perfect summer appetizer -- light, fresh and contained some of the best Asian barbequed pork I believe either of us has ever had in the Madison area. For my entree, I chose the flat rice noodle with seafood, which was a heaping bowl of noodles, shrimp, calamari and an indeterminate, scallop-like fish all submerged in a flavorful, oniony seafood broth. On the side, my entree came with the standard Southeast Asian noodle soup accoutrements of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno slices and cilantro. Really, this was 'sticker shock' in a good way at $7.95 for my medium-sized entree. Medium was an understatement. This noodle soup was enough for two meals. And, the Thai iced tea I chose to accompany my meal did not disappoint. In the end, this is the first time in a couple of years that I've left a Madison area restaurant this satisfied for under $22, inclusive of tip.

I'm perplexed by some of the comments made in previous Yelp reviews of this restaurant, as the negative comments do not jibe with my experience at all. In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to find anything to complain about my service or food, except that my noodles may have overcooked a touch in the hot broth of my entree. Warning signs in previous Yelp reviews must have been heeded and failings corrected, at least from first glance.

I'll definitely be returning to taste some of the other dishes on Kim's extensive and varied menu. What a welcome edition to Monona and Madison East neighborhoods!"}
{"text":"I guess people in madison don't know much about Vietnamese food.

This is the best one in madison. I have had all nice and positive experience with this restaurant: food is good, service is nice, don't have to wait in line over 30 mins, like another Vietnamese restaurant in west side; price is reasonable.

Overall, I highly recommend Kim's noodle."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was mediocre. The servers did not know much about Vietnamese food. For example, she didn't know what \"bean sprout\" was when I asked her not to put it in my spring rolls. They also didn't know what kind of meat came with what dishes. Poor knowledge about their own dishes and what they're serving to their customers!! Pho broth was decent but the meat was hard to chew and  swallow! I would not recommend this restaurant only if you're out to taste a good Vietnamese food!! :("}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  The service is up and down from great to very slow.  The last time we ate there, the server was great!  She was attentive and knowledgeable about the dishes and was able to help my 16 year old pick out the perfect dish for him.  The pho broth is nuanced, fresh and very good IMHO.  There was plenty of tasty meat and tendon.  The sprouts and herbs were also fresh and crunchy.  The noodles were perfect for me, as well, with a little firmness to them.  I love their spring rolls - especially the sauce!  Basically, go there when you have time to enjoy a good conversation while you wait, but otherwise I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The Good:  Friendly service, consistent food.  Spot-on Vietnamese.
The Bad:  If you're looking for Chinese or other Asian flavor, you probably won't find it here. 
The Ugly:  Each time I've been, the place has only one or two other diners - I'd love to see a stronger showing in the dining room."}
{"text":"When I visit Minneapolis, I order a dish of rice noodles with tofu, mock duck, bean sprouts, cilantro and peanuts at Quang Da in South Minneapolis. The same meal every time. I found something similar at this Madison restaurant. Lightly sauced, tasty, not too greasy. How I imagine Vietnamese food should be.

Service was mediocre, as other reviewers have noted. Waitress was slow to return to the table, handles glasses by the rim, not the base (basic no-no). Menus are full of typos, menu pictures aren't of the actual dishes. Bubble tea ordered came back more like a smoothie. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't tea.

I agree--I really want to like the restaurant, I want it to thrive. Touch up these details and diners will be more inclined to return."}
{"text":"The only real-deal Pho in Madison.  Here's a tip on Pho restaurants... if you cant order Nuoc beo with your Pho they aren't doing it right.  It basically means they arent boiling bones.

The bun here is pretty proper too."}
{"text":"I really WANT to love this restaurant. The food is just fantastic and the location and atmosphere are great for my needs. For a restaurant that shares a rear door with a grocery store, they seem to run out of menu items alot, but everything I've tried has been good to great. The salmon special is amazing, possibly the best salmon dish I've ever tried. The spring rolls are better than Ha Long Bay but not as good as Thai Noodle. My toddler loved the Vietnamese pancake. The avocado smoothie is perfect.

Unfortunately, the service ranges from slow to downright glacial. Most weekdays, I bring a book and the service is passable for a relaxed lunch. The only time we visited on a weekend, the service was nonexistent...as was the highchair we requested...and several menu items. After waiting over 20min with nothing but water and chopsticks we ended up walking out. 

Recently the staff have been more service-oriented, asking whether everything is all right with sincerity, apologizing for issues, etc. I hope this continues, since the restaurant has alot going for it and I'd love to see it become a Madison favorite.

Note: The check folders they use say \"We welcome American Express,\" but they don't actually take AMEX. Just FYI."}
{"text":"And, now they're closed,  Should have sold the banh mi on weekends.  Actually, if the owners ever check this,they should seriously consider opening a banh mi food cart.  No one is selling them, they'd be huge."}
{"text":"A friend and I I stopped in to Kims on a Saturday night.  The place wasn't busy at all (I think there were 4 other tables.  We had spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were quite underwhelming.  Noodle wrap, iceberg lettuce, rice and 2 pieces of shrimp served with a thick creamy peanut sauce.  

As for the main meal I had the #17 Mixed Pho and my friend had the #34 Grilled meat (pork) Bun. My Pho wasn't served with the larger scooping spoon as is typical in Vietnamese Restaurants.  They were stacked neatly behind the assortment of sauces and chilis.  I was perturbed until I realized I was a dumbass for not seeing the stack of spoons and chop sticks.  As for the Pho,  well it wasn't the spicy beef at Saigon Noodle (Madisons best IMO).  They had all the sauces you could want with the Pho- siracha, garlic chili, chili, hoisin, and fish sauce. Maybe I mixed mine poorly, which would be my bad.  But again I was underwhelmed.  My friend Bun on the other hand was awesome.  Grilled and season pork belly, with an egg-roll mixed with a buncha veggies.  YUM.  If I go back I'd get it for sure.  

Service was quick and attentive.  Water was kept full- which can be a difficult task for me some times.  All in all a solid 3 stars.  Thought about four but their spring rolls were lacking."}
{"text":"Were passing through Madison area and stopped at Kim's.   There was only one waitress for the whole restuarant so the service was rather slow,  but she apoligized for the slow service.  Food tasted good, and spring rolls were very fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Kim's in search for a mid afternoon Goi Cuon (spring rolls). When we walked in it didn't take long to figure out things were pretty disorganized and sorry to say, uncleanly. Every booth and table was filthy. The condiment containers hadn't been tended too in a very long time. Sticky and almost empty.
We ordered the Spring Rolls and also the Egg Rolls. The egg rolls were decent, but not very fresh tasting. The Spring Rolls were mediocre. There were no beans, veggies or herbs in them. Just lettuce, Pork, and Shrimp. Sadly, they were very bland. The sauce accompanying was too sweet and very gloppy. :(
The prices at Kim's were OK. They were FAR too expensive for the quality of food and to my surprise, higher than some of the other thai/viet places in the vicinity. I am not an extreme food snob. This experience was just plain dissapointing.
The plus side of our experience: our service was prompt and the bathrooms are clean. 
We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just stopped in on their grand opening day.  Since we got the food fast and it was tasty I am giving them 4 stars off the bat. This is truly Vietnamese cuisine so if you are looking for Chinese American fare this is not the place. I am thrilled we have a pho (pronounced \"fah\") house nearby once more. Friendly staff and very clean.The huge jade Buddha fountain is a nice touch, We will be back. I hope if you are up for Vietnamese you will give them a try,.

I did mention the pho I got could have used about 1/4 again more noodles and they were very glad to hear the feedback. 

(Note: This replaces the Lee Asian Bistro. But you can still find the friendly previous owner running the excellent Viet Hoa Foods right next door.) So pho, so good."}
{"text":"Chicken pho is very very good..stopped in for take out on a Sunday afternoon and they were very quick. Kept all ingredients separate so I could put it together at home...it was fabulous!  Resturant isn't very clean but the food is great...would love to go back for more someday"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese food in Madison that I've had. Service was quick and food was delicious."}
