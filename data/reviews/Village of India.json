{"text":"It's a hidden gem. Simply great food, great people and great hospitality. It's way better than any other big name Indian buffets. The food is more worth than the price. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"i just moved from british columbia.went twice to this restaurant, every time as expected excellent service and always fresh food.specially onion nans are so fresh...you won't find anywhere in ontario i bet.....must recommended."}
{"text":"We tried their buffet one evening (couple of months ago). The food was not fresh. Won't repeat."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant last time for a family lunch, so we decided to cater an event from them! Unfortunately it wasn't prepared as we requested instead the food we believe was taken right out of their buffet...so catering wasn't a big success!"}
{"text":"Food sucked. Fruit flies everywhere. Rocks in sonf. Bad service overall.  This place used to be good a long time ago.  I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious. 7.99 all vegetarian Indian dinner buffet with authentic regional ingredients and flavors. About 100 items in buffet style servers. I am not a vegetarian and I often feel not completely satiated when eating at vegetarian restaurants. Village of India leaves me very satisfied and full for hours.  You can order drinks from waiter service at the table and ask for naan which then arrives at your table a few minutes later freshly made when you ordered it! Poori is likewise fresh and on a table for self service. The lassis are very filling and I can never finish more than half, which is probably why they arrive at the table in a plastic take away cup.   I cannot name many of the things that were tasty but this is some of the best Indian food I have had anywhere. Try a little of everything.  Some of it may not be to your liking but interesting none the less."}
{"text":"A few years ago, this place used to be, well, kind of a dump. I returned several months ago and was pleasantly surprised at the changes! The decor has been brightened and updated, the service is warm and friendly, and the all-veg buffet has great variety. Perhaps the best part is that the food is rich and flavorful--not always something associated with buffets. Oh, and did I mention you get a basket of fresh naan? At just ten bucks, this is a steal."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday and we were actually on our way to another vegetarian buffet restaurant called,  when we drove past this place with a big sign in their window that said \"vegetarian buffet $4.99\"!!  Wow, we couldn't pass this price up, as the other place we were heading to was $12.99.   Apparently this cute little place, located at the end of a shopping centre, had just opened up the week before, and I am so glad, as it was wonderful!  So much choice and all very delicious.  We will definitely be going back. 2104 Hwy 7, Unit 1 , Vaughan - Tel: 905 - 460 - 9442"}
{"text":"This place isn't pricy, but sometimes I find that they don't always give fresh food. It is expected because it is a buffet. However when the food is fresh I would rate this restaurant four out of five. This buffet isn't bad, I just wish that they can have fresh food all the time."}
{"text":"Got a chance to visit this place with family. The food was not bad, but the environment was. This place is good only for the truck drivers and those who like to drink liquor, not for the family dinner."}
{"text":"Had not been here in years, food is still great, prices are cheap, the decor is weird though.   But who cares"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I went through in my entire culinary life. Service was terrible, the rice was raw, the tables were dirty, the bathrooms looked like it was for a different spechiemen.  I just want to be transparent here, this experience was terrible and the food tasted very bad. The butter chicken was oily and undercooked and when I pressed the manager or the cook pretending like he was the manager he gave me a long speech about customer service which was beyond incomprehensible.  The naan was undercooked and rubbery.   0/10- ign"}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Toronto, I stopped by at Village of India for a quick lunch. We ordered 4 plates of kulchay with channa. They were delicious! The portions are huge and sure to fill everyone. The service was also very quick and I really liked the wall murals.   For about $4 a plate, it is definitely a steal!"}
{"text":"This is such a nasty restaurant. They used to be good before but things have changed. They served undercooked naan, expired yogurt and old paneer. Do NOT go to this restaurant unless you intend on getting food poisoning!"}
