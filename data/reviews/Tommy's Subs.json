{"text":"We have been coming here for many years. This place is an old Jersey Mike's, but with better quality. It's locally owned and the sub's are huge!"}
{"text":"Best subs wish they were open till 8 like it says tho! Got the club sub and they really make it look like the picture."}
{"text":"Well this was my Christmas present from Mentor, OH. Thank you Thank you!!  My first time in the area and my hubby and I wanted something affordable and Good. Well this place won. First of all the very humble look of it and the simplicity of the place was cool. Everything looks and tastes fresh!!! We got the buffalo chicken and the Philly  steak hot sandwiches. Wow what a merry Christmas I had!! Customer service was great and not slow at all even though they had at least 7 people in line.  Amazing! Would go again:)"}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich shop.  The cheesesteak has a juice that is a mix of meat and cheese that I dream about.  Soda game is spot on. Styrofoam cup + self-serve fountain. Perfectly calibrated. #1 Dr Pepper fountain in Mentor, for sure."}
{"text":"Subs. As long as it's not subway it's already good, but this place... man... this place.... lets just say if it wasn't an hour away from my house I'd be here a lot more. When you first walk in you're greeted by the always welcoming sight of a deli meat cooler. The sight of big chunks of deli meats is always appetizing to me. I ordered a buffalo chicken and a Philly cheesesteak. While they aren't the fastest sandwich producers in the industry the wait is definitely worth it.  The subs are basic and very visceral. They are incredibly simple yet so filling and just gut-satisfying.  The buffalo chicken sub had crispy fried pieces of chicken AND slices of chicken on top. Double chicken! And they offered ranch or blue cheese with it, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO OFFERS BUFFALO SANDWICHES SHOULD!! Seriously...  the philly was juicy and also super basic. Had no extras that you didn't need and was lacking in nothing. Just right. No other way to put it.  Would I eat there again? YES would I recommend it? YES Do I wish they catered weddings? YES"}
{"text":"I am from Florida and I am only visiting Ohio for 4 days and I must say... the Philly cheesesteak is probably best one I've ever had. I've had the sandwich 3 Times already. May I remind you I have only been here for 4 days.   My friends had enjoyed their sandwiches as well. Tommy subs.. we shall return when we visit again!   Great service as well."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty picky sub eater and just from our first visit, this place is my second favorite sub shop.  I got the hot Italian and it was delish! Everything tasted really fresh and the staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Really great subs! Generous sandwiches at good prices. I especially love the Italian burger which is the amped up and improved version of the Roman burger. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Gnawed down a hot Italian sub.  Really good with their fresh veggies and good pickles."}
{"text":"This was fantastic. Great price and one of the best hot Italian subs I've ever had. They slice the meat for each sandwich and the staff is so friendly. I came in as they were closing (which I hate to do), just about left.. but the woman there reassured me that it was no problem at all, had a conversation with me and told me that she would see me soon. It's nice to see a small shop with that family mentality. They've got my business for a long time, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, I got the hot Italian. Over all the sub was good, I've just had better. I'd return for lunch. Prices are decent, and interior is typical deli."}
