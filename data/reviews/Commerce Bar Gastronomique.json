{"text":"We really wanted to like this place but the service really let us down. We made a reservation and upon arrival no one was there to seat us for quite a while. Our server took our drink order (we were a party of 3) when I ordered just a soda water with lemon he seemed really upset and started to explain he only had a large bottle of sparkling water. I'm 7 months pregnant so all I wanted was a fancy glass of water! After our drinks he took forever to come take our food order...I'm talking 30-45 mins later. Then our food took about an hour to come out. At one point he came to our table and asked if we had got our food yet (clearly we had not). When the food did come it was good. I was the fish tacos and they were super tasty. Overall cool spot with a cool vibe. A bit yuppy and snobbish."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. Turn the lights down a little lower and it'll be closed, as it should be.  Not at all worth the prices, and unimpressive overall.   I imagine that this is the place you go to pick someone up when you don't want to know what they look like. The food was passable, but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day while walking through Montreal. We just stumbled upon it. Sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice. We ordered soup to start off and it was super tasty. The burger I ordered for lunch was good - average burger. My spouse got a salmon burger and that was pretty good. They offer a lunch menu for a really decent price where you got a soup or salad, a burger, and some sorbet. Really worth the value.  The best part of the experience was the hot shot the bartender made us at the end! They were delicious and got us addicted! In addition the bartender was super kind and asked us if we wanted her recommendations for restaurants and she wrote us down 5 places with addressees to go to!   Liked the place a lot. Would go back and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Still have mixed feelings about this place. Went there for a drink with colleagues after work : the location is amazing, the decor is fabulous, the atmosphere was great! Music wasn't too loud, so it's easy to have a nice conversation with friends. Happy hour is from 5-7 pm, and most drinks are 5$ - a pretty good deal for a downtown bar. BUT, I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers, the service was just bad...the barmaid was very uninvolved, I just felt she didn't care. No love in any of her drinks! The reason I gave it a 4 stars is that I believe this place has everything to become a financial district hotspot! I may have been unlucky that day sitting at the bar, so will likely give it another shot."}
{"text":"Went with the girls on a Thursday night as part of MTL à Table $31 menu.  The ambiance  - very chic with great music (seriously great late 90s and early 00s!) and a young professional crowd gathered around the bar.   The food was good overall - the $31 menu consisted of:  1. Shared appetizer including  - crudities with dip - pork buns: delicious! I would have eaten about a dozen of them  - popcorn and shrimp: very good and creative, the shrimp was battered with just a hint of coconut taste and the popcorn was deliciously seasoned 2. Choice of main: I had the ribs, more like braised beef but good  3. Shared dessert: Giant chocolate chip cookie and lemon cake which were both delicious  The only flaw was the service; it wasn't bad but it was very disorganized and disjointed. A man came by to take our drink order and was followed by a waitress who had no idea who took our order...we got 2 of each of the shared courses for a group of 3, which were different set down haphazardly across the table (as opposed to a nice larger platter?) and had to ask the bartender to send our waitress over at the end of the night to settle our bill (she was nowhere in sight!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, tasty beer, fabulous service, and a fun atmosphere! The salmon tar tar and burger were amazing."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Must try!!  The popcorn & shrimp is so inventive and incredibly delicious!! Steak so juicy and flavorful. Chicken melts in your mouth. Wedge salad light and airy. Surprisingly,it could use a smidge more dressing.   Martinis could be a larger pour. Wine is terrific. Staff seems helpful but a little inexperienced."}
{"text":"Une belle surprise. J'ai aimé le plateau de charcuteries. On retrouve un bon choix de microbrasseries, notamment Trou du diable et Dieu du ciel.  Excellent service. J'y retourne."}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for brothers birthday this past weekend and this place was our first stop for lunch.  The drinks were ok. The service was good. What makes this a five star? The carbonara fettuccine! It was so good and creamy with a runny yolk on top. It made me want it everyday I was in town that weekend. I also had some of the steak frites which was pretty good not great.  If you choose to stop in here, you must order the fettuccine!!"}
{"text":"Lovely evening visiting from New York with our local friends in Montreal. We had a child with us so we could not be seated inside after 8:00 pm due to liquor laws. But we had a very nice table set up for us right outside. Not a gorgeous street but it was a lovely summer evening. Among the dishes were some small plates such as the pulled pork steamed bun, inventive spicy popcorn shrimp, fresh scallop ceviche, grilled octopus;  entrees included country chicken and steak frites prepared with a gastropub sensibility. Excellent attentive charming wait staff."}
{"text":"From the outside, La Commerce looks like a really beautiful and trendy looking spot in the old port. I've finally made a visit on an impromptu date night with my boyfriend. I went after work so I was already super hungry and excited to try their menu.  Good : The location and decor. It's very hip, definitely a place to be scene or have a 5 a 7. I also had a dozen oysters, which were really good! If you go between 5-7pm, it's $1 oyster special! They make a really good sauce, which goes perfectly with it.  Bad : The Scallop ceviche (with coconut milk and pink peppercorn) is probably the most bland thing I've ever had. I thought it would be a bit more creative, but nah, all you can taste is scallop with coconut milk. Very disappointing. We also had the tartar du moment as a main and it turns out the tartar du moment was the dull salmon. Much too creamy, lack seasoning, minimal flavor, among the most boring tartars I've ever had. For someone who came in hungry, you'd think I'd say everything was friggin delicious, but not right here.   Bottom Line : The food is just nothing special (I guess 'okay' by Pub standards, except the oysters were good), the atmosphere is nice. Overall, you can definitely spend your money elsewhere for better quality food."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite ! Got the duck poutine, calamari, and a sandwich. Loved the little outside seating but there were ants on a lot of the tables which is really unattractive for a restaurant. There was also a spider web at one of the tables. We finally picked one out that didn't have any bugs and ordered our food! The duck poutine was delicious !! The duck wasn't anything special but the gravy and cheese was the perfect amount!! The sandwich was also really good, some bites were a little dry but that was fixed by the delicious BBQ sauce ! The calamari was sadly awful....so rubbery and salty. My boyfriends favorite appetizer is calamari so he usually eats it even if it's just okay and he barely touched it. The waiter was nice enough to ask what was wrong with it and said he would tell the chef. Our other waitress was really nice and recommended places for us to go out after !! Get some drinks and a great poutine but I wouldn't go here for a meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a reasonably priced restaurant that was open late since we arrived in Montreal 2 hours later than we planned and we were starving! Since we were walking, we were limited to the neighborhood around our hotel. We found a place on Yelp but when we arrived at the address, it was not there. A very nice local who was working the door at a lounge helped us out by calling his friend for a dinner suggestion. The friend told us to go to Commerce, a half a block away. So we did.   This place was hopping for a Thursday night! Busy bar, loud music, pretty people. We asked for a table for dinner and they brought us to a 2 person table near the bar.  Not the most ideal location since people were walking around us but we decided to deal with it. The waitress came up to us and we said hello and she immediately knew we were American. She suggested a cocktail for me and it was delicious! I wish I remembered her name because she was very nice!  The food was delicious! I ordered a lobster roll and it came with big chunks of lobster meat in a delicious roared French bread. My husband also enjoyed his burger and fries. The crowd got more rowdy as the night wore on and one man from the loud group at the bar came over to apologize for being loud. It was very endearing and we chatted with him for a minute.   Overall this place was great. A little loud for a dinner conversation but the music was enjoyable and we just wanted good food."}
{"text":"Very cool and contemporary decor, ambient lighting, and a very well stocked bar. Great location, for its proximity to old Montreal. It felt very intimate, the perfect setting for a date.  I came here with a couple of girlfriends, and we tried some of the whiskey and cocktails, which were delicious but service was a little sluggish, even though it wasn't particularly busy that midweek evening.  The menu could benefit from a wider range of veggie options. I ended up just getting the fries and some dessert, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars."}
{"text":"J'irai un peu dans la même vague que les autres commentaires : il s'agit d'un endroit de 5@7 très trendy, mais pas un endroit de choix pour un souper 'gastronomique'.   Nous avons commandé te tartare de saumon, la salade 'légumes', les côtes levées et une bouteille de chardonnay pinot noir d'afrique du sud. Si la carte des vins proposait des choix intéressants, la nourriture était vraiment ordinaire. Quand j'aurais pu faire mieux à la maison, c'est questionnable.   Le prox est définitivement trop élevé pour le service et le menu, mais j'y retournerais pour prendre un verre après le travail, durant la semaine, pour profiter du spécial 1$/l'huitre entre 5 et 7h. . Le week-end : it's so empty ."}
{"text":"A few of my friends and I won lift tickets for Bromont so we decided to make a trip out of it and stopped by Montreal on the way. We got to Montreal on New Years Eve and we were exhausted so we didn't plan on doing anything fancy. We just wanted to grab a nice dinner and then go see the fire works at the waterfront. Everywhere we looked, it was all booked except for Commerce so we went here. The place is very trendy and definitely somewhere I would have dressed up more if it didn't say casual. The crowd was young so it was loud. The food was good but not amazing. We got a chacuterie plate to share and a dozen oysters and a glass of wine. I got a seabass and that was good but not amazing, it was a bit bland. I felt that the service was subpar for the price I was paying. I don't know if it was because it was busy or it was because my friends and I were not dressed as fancy as the other guests.   Overall, this would be a place I would go for after work drinks or after dinner drinks at the bar but not for dinner."}
