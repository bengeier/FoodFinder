{"text":"We went because Yelpers seemed to find this Chinese-owned crepe place favorable. The staff is very nice, and gave us no trouble for staying a few minutes after closing hours. But the crepes are hit-or-miss. I had the Madame Muru crepe (bocconcini, tomato, pesto, olive, fresh basil, almonds), $11.45 with fries and/or salad, and it could've been less dry with more pesto added. My friend had a breakfast savory crepe with smoked salmon, egg, cheese, and mushroom, and it was really tasty and creamy. Tip: if you're a fan of crepes that are soft and bready, you'd like it here; they don't do the crispy, super-thin crepes some other places do."}
{"text":"Like (it seems) a lot of people, my friend and I stumbled upon Crêpe Café while exploring Vieux-Montréal.  I had fromage grillé (grilled cheese for les americains), which was served with a small cup of white sauce, I believe.  Fantastic.  The sauce, well used in French cooking, added a nice spin from the grilled cheese I've become accustomed to in the States.

Definitely a classy place for lunch, and dare I say a less expensive option for the Old Port.  The staff, while bilingual, also were patient with my still-improving French!"}
{"text":"I was told by my cousin that one thing I had to eat in Montreal was a crepe, so I looked up Muru Crepe on yelp. I'm so glad I did! My husband and I walked up here when we were exploring Old Montreal. I ordered the Savoyarde crepe and my husband ordered the Attention crepe. He loved the spicy flavors and the chili in his crepe. I thought mine was better, personally. It was savory, creamy, and perfect. Both crepes were stuffed to the brim, which I loved. They didn't skimp on the filings! We both got a green salad and fries. The salad was very good, but the fries were absolutely amazing! I don't know exactly what spices they used on them, but the fries were perfectly salted and had just the right amount of other seasonings. I had to have the waitress take my plate away because I couldn't stop eating them! Love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My kids loved there sweet crepes. My wife's egg crepe was better than my mushroom and goat cheese. I found the goat cheese a bit too strong. I would return an excellent meal."}
{"text":"This is by far the best crepes I have ever had. We also liked its ambience, decor, and quaint location near old Montreal. The presentation of the crepes was also very well done."}
{"text":"Delicious, filling crepes.  A bit off the tourist path in Old Montreal which made for a better dining experience than some of the other places nearby.  Sangria was mainly juice with just a touch of wine and only sold in carafes instead of by the glass - my wife and I left half the carafe untouched. Food was excellent and I would return, but have drinks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Things looks so much better in pictures.  Descriptions can also be very deceiving.  As in the case for this particular place.  

We were strolling along Notre Dame and came across this restaurant on Yelp.  Pictures of food looked amazing and so did the reviews.  So, in we went to give this a try for breakfast. 

Ordered the breakfast crepe and a savory one (chicken with cheese in cream sauce).  

The crepe was pretty good, nice and thin.  The filing for both were pretty basic and kind of tasteless.  Reviews indicated it was too die for but nothing really special.   Your typical crepes stuffed with stuff.

Don't get me wrong,  it was not bad at all.  My expectations were pretty high after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures. 

Price wise, i would say it is pretty expensive. $12.95  for the breakfast crepe and $13.95 for the savory one.   It was not worth it. 

Will i come back... unlikely.  Too expensive and to small for me."}
{"text":"So goooooooooooooooooooooood !!!

Tried Slamon crepe and Strawberry & banana & hazelnut spread (aka Nutella lol) crepe, forgot the name of it however, speechless. 

Server was very attentive and friendly. Asked for recommendation and of course, scored ! 

Great place in the middle of tourists-aimed shops.
It opens during brunch time so if you want to try, you better be fast lol

I gave it 4 stars bc I haven't tried all of their menus but I assume they will be as good as the ones I already had and the limited opening hours too. So cruel to open just 4-5 hours a day !! lol

Definately going back! I know, I leave in a different country and 7 hour-drive but it's worth it lol"}
{"text":"Just called and asked for information on old creperies in Montreal. The person on the phone was very rude when he learned that it was not his restaurant that I was inquiring about. I'm a visitor from another Province trying to find a favorite old Creperie from many years ago. Thanks for nothing monsieur !  I may not find The Creperie I'm looking for, but I know where I won't be going and that's your restaurant."}
{"text":"Would give you more than five stars.
Staff were friendly and awesome sweets.

And beautiful, don't forget to add extra ice cream.
This ice cream is the best."}
{"text":"Small quaint location. Very friendly staff. Great selection of crepes and all are made to perfection. I think i was most impressed with their delicious fries. I wasn't expecting them to be that good!"}
{"text":"Great crepe/cafe spot.  Had the goat cheese and honey crepes.  Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Yum! And friendly staff = great breakfast place in old Montreal"}
{"text":"Stopped by here when we first landed in Montreal. It is located at the very tail end of Old Montreal tucked away from the most touristy area. The service was great - the ladies that worked there were very attentive and nice. I liked that the crepes were served with a choice of salad, fries or both. Great fries! The butter, sugar, and maple syrup sweet crepe is amazing! They have changed their name since (Muru Crepe), but the shots of the exterior and interior are exactly the same."}
{"text":"the place is casual but the food was surprisingly good. the service was slow-- especially on the wkend, but friendly (also, it was also crowded). We went for lunch one day & got  Crepes Salees w/ salads & fries (fries were REALLY crispy & good) and we went back mid-week for the sweet stuff: I got the blueberry, BF got the Cri D'Amour (bananas, nutella, strawberries) -- his was better, but both were yummy. 

super casual, but really yummy & reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Amazing - had been dying to try some crepes in Montreal and was not disappointed when we were lead here based on yelp reviews.

So many flavors and the coffee was great too - not the normal crap North American coffee, but European style.

We ordered the Nutella Crepe with Strawberries, Banana, Blueberries and Almonds and also the Nutella with Mashmellows, Almonds and I think Baileys.
Yum Yum Yum!!

I will be paying Maru Crepe a visit each time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast crepe!  Amazing macchiato!  Service not that great but not awful. It took longer than it should have to get a regular cup of coffee. Small but not cramped. Clean and friendly. I would come here again."}
{"text":"We visited this little cafe for the third summer in a row during our vacation to Montreal. We keep coming back simply because the crepes are perfect! Have yet to try any of their sweet crepes as my fiancé prefers the more savoury crepes & I usually stick to the breakfast ones. The fries were crispy & the side salad was fresh. Our servers have always been attentive & the place itself is always clean. We will continue to drop in for brunch during our future visits to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Delicious sweet crepes!!! Service a tad on the slow side but well worth the worth. The employees try their best ! The savoury crepes are good as well but I really enjoyed the sweet crepe with bananas, strawberries, and nutella. We had the one with nutella only and that was delicious as well! My cappuccino had a heart - it was well done and really tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with superb service.  Good value on the menu.  In the heart of Old Montreal.  Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"just on the edge of old Montreal so it was not as crowded as the restaurants on Rue St. Paul.  Place is very clean and updated.  Service is good.  Wife and i had the breakfast crepes and it was very good.  Definitely would go back and try the rest.  Their menu is all about crepes and more crepes!   Coffee is good too!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good!! I had a sweet crêpe with strawberries, bananas, nutella, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream. Absolutely delicious. I would eat here all the time if I lived here. You should definitely visit this place when in town."}
{"text":"Great crepes! We got the salmon + cheese + egg crepe with potatoes and fruits, and cri d'amour (nutella + banana + strawberry crepe). Presentations were excellent, love the runny eggs inside the crepe! Never seen crepes like this before. Potatoes were tasty (I think Montreal just have better potatoes...the taste was different than the ones in Calgary!) and strawberries were very fresh! The decor was also nice, feels very relaxing sitting inside enjoying our crepes!"}
{"text":"dropped in with a big group and we all had fantastic service. Each crepe was delicious! The sweet, breakfast and savory crepes were all a hit! Obviously I got a sweet crepe and it was not just lemon, but lemonazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here over some of the crepe places on the main strip of old montreal and happy we did!

We had the whole place to ourselves, though it isn't that big. The crepes are delicious and innovative and come with fries, a salad, or half fries/half salad as an added bonus! A friend had the soup, which was also delicious. Waitstaff was friendly, but quiet. Just a walk down from Notre Dame!"}
{"text":"Quaint, little corner cafe with delicious crepes.  I had a sweet option (berries, nutella, bananas and almonds) and my partner had one of the savory variety (merveilleux - chicken, eggplant, cheese and tomato); both were fantastic.  Also, the savory came with fries, which were great, and the coffee was fresh and tasty.  It is a rather chill locale with friendly staff, a nice change from the other spots in Vieux Montreal which tend to be over-priced, noisy and not that great.  Two thumbs up for Muru!"}
{"text":"It was just fine.. Had a savory crepe and a sweet one, not a place I need to go to again. The fries that came with the savory crepe were good though. 
The staff/service was friendly.."}
{"text":"Croque-monseiurs, croque-madames and croque-BLTs: YUM. Filling. Delicious. The side salad and side fries are both excellent choices (and you can even go for half of each!).

Hot chocolate: delicious. Served in a nice big bowl/mug with chocolate powder dusted on the foam.

Coffee: I'm travelling throughout USA and Canada. The USA is known for sh!t coffee, and my travelling partner hasn't had a good coffee in quite a while so was hesitant. However, we thought surely our best bet at decent coffee was French Canada. Turns out... yep! This coffee was pretty good!

Crepes: oh man. We split a Nutella + Bailey's Irish Creme + chocolate crepe (topped with so many mini marshmallows). I was pretty stuffed after my croque and chocolat chaud but simply could not stop eating this deeeelicious crepe.

Waitstaff: The staff were all really friendly, happy to speak in French or English. We went there twice and weirdly enough it seemed like we got slightly larger servings when we ordered in French, haha. 

Price: Two croques + two hot drinks + one crepe + tip = around $40. For the taste, the atmosphere, the location, the speed of service, the overall experience, I was very happy with the amount we spent.

Would I recommend? YES YES YES."}
{"text":"One of the best crepe I had in Montreal :) Thank you! Love the bailey latte!"}
{"text":"My croque madame was nothing of the sort (cheese and ham on a crusty piece of bread with a fried egg perched atop) - too dry and without that cheesy béchamel goodness that makes a good croque.

The perceptive amongst you will note that I still award 3 stars, and that is because the frites are EXCELLENT and deserving of a UNESCO world heritage award. Plus, they're nice guys and it's open when most things around there are close (e.g., a cold Monday in January)."}
{"text":"Bon déjeuner et belle endroit pour de belle discussion à conseiller.. Les plats très bien présenté et un goût particulier qui nous rappel de bon déjeuner maison dans un décor champêtre de plus avec cette petite neige cela rajoute une belle vue d'ensemble"}
{"text":"It may be a few blocks away from the tourist traps, but this place has delicious, affordable crêpes that make for a delicious brunch! Due to the rare combination of great food with reasonable prices, this place fills up quick in the mornings, so make sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"One word - cute! The restaurant design is modern and classy. It's nice and quiet (at least when we went in the morning, it was), and there are plenty of choices. 

I opted for the Fabuleux crepe and do not regret at all. The chicken found its place in the perfectly melted cheese inside a delicate, square-shaped crepe. The meat was juicy and it was just so tasty. I can imagine .. some baby spinach and oven-cooked chicken instead would've taken it to the next level. Mmmm.....

I would definitely go back for a second run. The drinks look fancy and the prices on the menu are quite reasonable. 

If I were to nitpick this place, it would the speed of service. While I understand that there's only one person cooking so the dishes come out one by one.. it would be nice if our food was served quick enough so our group of 7 could eat all together."}
{"text":"We just stopped here to have a quick snack when wandering around Old Montreal.  I had the nutella, banana, and fresh strawberry crepe.  Yummy!

After seeing all the great food coming to the other tables around us, I was sorry that I didn't order more!  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll make it a point to stop back in."}
{"text":"So we came to Montreal looking for the perfect Crepe. This place delivered. The savory crepes were excellent, and the dessert crepes were over the top. I would highly recommend finding this place."}
{"text":"Adorable and delicious cafe worth the walk out of the way before or after a tour of Notre Dame. We had soups and crepes. The cream of vegetable was excellent. I had the Voila crepe with turkey    Swiss and bechemel sauce. The side salad was delicious and the service perfectly tempered."}
{"text":"Took my best friend here when she came to visit me from Toronto. 

The service was incredibly slow. It took a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledge us and another solid 40 minutes before our food arrived. Nobody even bothered to refill our water. 

 As for the food, I ordered a savory crepe with chicken, spinach and pesto  (~$12) while my best friend opted for a sweet crepe with banana, strawberry and nutella ($15). The sweet crepe was way too sweet and not at all comparable to juliette au chocolat or cacao 70. My savory crepe was mediore at best, but again nothing to rave home about. 

Don't really get the hype and probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered the D'Accrod crepe, goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms, olives, almonds. It was every good, came with salad or fries, or half and half. What a great option/idea, the half and half. Although the fries are battered. Why batter a perfectly good potato I'll never figure out.
My daughter ordered Cri D'Amour, coco hazelnut, banana, strawberries, it could have been great but the chocolate & strawberry syrup not needed. Strawberries were fresh why add fake strawberry syrup! Hazelnut was chocolatey why add fake chocolate syrup! I'll go back but make some adjustments."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Worth 3.5 stars. Very touristy, but decent selection of crepes, both savory and sweet, as well as some other options. The French fries were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch spot in the outskirts of Old Montreal.  Calm, quaint atmosphere, cozy yet classy decor.  Loved our window seat.  My expectations of the crepes were a bit too high due to the high yelp ratings... I did enjoy them, but they were not the best crepes I've ever had.  

Foodnalysis:
- Classique (ham, cheese, egg) breakfast crepe - generous size, almost a large as the non-breakfast crepes. I wasn't extremely hungry, so the breakfast portion was perfect for me.  Came with...
- Side salad with mushrooms and tomato - excellent dressing.  
- Coffee - great accompaniment.  A trip to a cafe like this in a place like Old Montreal is never complete without coffee!

The Bottom Line:
Cute spot for crepes in a quieter part of Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Being in Montreal my wife and I had the craving for some breakfast crepes and decided to try Muru. What a great choice. The crepes were amazing, coffee was delicious, and the service very good. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great stop after an early start of site seeing.  The crepes were of a perfect texture and beautifully presented.  The host was very courteous and warned us that, since we came just as they opened, we would have to wait for about 15 minutes for our food.  We were in no rush.  After all, we were on vacation.  As long as we didn't have to wait for our coffee, we were in great shape.  We tried the crepe suzette, a dessert crepe, and a breakfast crepe and all were a delicious as the pictures that everyone has posted.  It's a \"must\" if you like \"fresh\" and  if you don't mind a little waiting and are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great crêpes, coffees.  I had the ham, Swiss cheese breakfast crêpe. It was perfectly done with beautiful presentation.  My family had the sweet crepes that were inhaled."}
{"text":"Great experience at this restaurant. The waitress was super friendly. She was even able to speak to my parents in Chinese. When she noticed that we were tourists, she was happy to recommend some restaurants to us. She was very kind and definitely made us feel welcome.

The crepe I ordered was filled with cheese, chicken, and mushrooms. It also came with a side of salad. The crepes were really good and I left the restaurant very full. I would definitely come visit this place again."}
{"text":"Old City Crepe joint, its awesome. They have all sorts of crepes, breakfast, savory & desert. Small and inviting corner location. Lovely service."}
{"text":"Both myself and the boify put Muru Crepe on our itinerary for Montreal - great minds think alike!

We came by on a Saturday around 1pmish and were turned away because all the tables were full. We noticed that 1 table in particular had a \"reserved\" sign on it, which Jimmy C. was bullcrap bc they supposedly do not take ressies! Anyhow, they took our name & number and told us to return in 20. As we left, we spotted some beautiful fauna and proceeded to snap some photos when the waitress came out and called us back! Apparently the \"reserved\" party couldn't make it - so we got their spot! Wahooooo.

The waitstaff are all super polite and sweet; the restaurant is family owned. My boify even sweet-talked himself to a 25% discount on his $3 OJ haha...good job boify. We placed our orders for 3 savory crepes and 1 sweet crepe and waited patiently.

Almost 30 mins later, our food arrived. The crepes looked amazing and the portions were big - but the winner here are their FRIES! They're amazingly crispy, the perfect shade of golden brown, and a little seasoned. We ordered an extra side of this! The crepes themselves were pretty good, and the dessert crepe, well, you can't go wrong with Nutella ;) 

The bill was decent for 4 people; I believe each crepe dish was about $11-13. Good value for the size of each dish. If only their service was a teeeeensy bit faster, it'd have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"There weren't that many sweet crepe options on the menu so I ordered the \"Cri D'Amour\". The fruits and syrup weren't wrapped inside crepe but were rather placed on top of the folded crepe. The presentation was stunning and totes Instagrammable! However, the crepe wasn't really anything special and basically tasted like strawberry, bananas, nutella, and chocolate syrup. It was also quite expensive for what it's worth (~$17 including tax and tips). Still would prefer T-swirl crepe as it's cheaper and has more unique flavors."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Big servings,  delicious crepes and friendly service ... especially in contrast to the ultra touristy places nearby.  Also kid friendly!"}
{"text":"Something about Montreal makes me want a crepe (it's the French). Having great reviews on Yelp, and being located around Old Montreal, this was our perfect spot. We came in early afternoon, the place was empty. We were promptly seated and given water. I ordered the banana chocolate crepe (the name of the crepe on the menu completely slipped my mind). It was yummy! I was expecting the bananas, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce to be in the crepe, but it sat on top, drizzled with chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream scoop and a side of whipped cream. It wasn't overly sweet, but alright. Prices are pretty high as each crepe ran about $9-12 each."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast. The coffee was fantastic and the crepes we're great and delightfully presented. My daughter had the Nutella and fruit crepe (how can you go wrong with Nutella). I had the three cheese crepe with bacon. The crepes themselves were cooked to perfection. The presentation was a great touch and the service was fast and attentive but we went around 10am so it wasn't as busy."}
{"text":"On vient d'arriver a Montreal a 2h et on tombe sur cet endroit. La serveuse est très sympathique. Les salades et les croques-sandwiches sont très bons. Petites crêpes en dessert. On ne regrette pas notre arrêt!"}
{"text":"The crepes here are so springy! I love me some bounce to my chew.

HAM AND CHEESE is nice and simple, felt like a grilled cheese.

I don't recall which was which, but between the FANTASTIQUE and the INCROYABLE, one had roast beef and also loaded with cheese; the white wine dijon sauce gave a little tang but def not a saucy dish. The roast beef sounds really enticing but it's one measly deli meat-thickness slice of roast beef. Rather negligible. The other had veggies (potato and peppers if i recall) and a mushroom sauce. We were expecting the mushroom sauce to be loaded on top but it, like everything else, was wrapped inside. Not far from cream of mushroom soup tasting (not bad but predictable, I suppose).

Nothing spectacular here but definitely could be satisfying if you find the right fillings."}
{"text":"Crepe Cafe was the first meal we had in Montreal.  Had a late lunch after wandering down Rue de Notre Dame close to our hotel.  Had read about this place when doing my research about  Montreal, and I'm glad we walked by it during our first \"exploration\" walk.  Both my bf and I had a savory crepe for our meal, which included both a salad and fries.  We both agreed that mine was better, which had chicken, ham, bechamel sauce and some vegetables.  His a pretty good too - I think it had spinach, bechamel, and some other ingredients I can't quite remember.   We shared a crepe suzette for dessert and it was quite delicious!  He had a beer and I had a glass of wine.  Pretty affordable for the meal.

The service was very nice and unobtrusive.  As with other reviewers, I was practicing my French and our waiter was very patient and helpful.

Overall, a great experience and we enjoyed it very much.  Wish we had more time during our trip so we could have returned for another meal.  I would have liked to try the croque-madame.  Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Like the first reviewer I found this while walking by.  Although it wasn't a pleasant carefree stroll as I imagine there walk as, we were on a serious mission to find a good breakfast/brunch joint open in old town Montreal in mid February.  Word of caution: they're aren't many, and its damn cold in February!  It was pretty much between Crepe Cafe, Eggspecations  and some uppity country club style place around the corner from CC.  Though Eggspectations has a pretty awesome name, they also had an hour wait so after a long frigid walk Crepe Cafe it was!  

Anyway there crepes were delicious, and they had a pretty stellar line up of coffees and espressos.  We hit the jackpot showing up on the weekend because that's when they serve their Crepes Benedict.  It's probably the best brunch entree i've ever had.  Maybe it's just me, I've become somewhat of an eggs Benedict fiend lately, I pretty much order it exclusively for brunch.  I had just discovered Crepes Benedict existed a day earlier at the Skinny Pancake in Burlington, VT (baller!) though it was after I had ordered so I had to watch as seemingly everyone around me enjoyed there's.  I didn't make that mistake again, and you shouldn't either, you owe it to your stomach to try the Crepes Benedict!

Definitely would opt for the home fries over the salad for your side choice.  Prices were good and service was top notch.  It is fairly small, probably only 10 tables so keep that in mind if you have a large group.  I would go pretty far out of my way to return back to this place!"}
{"text":"- this place is rated really really high and am semi-surprised....
- i love crepes, and it's typically tough to find a good place when you can't get yourself to france. the food was pretty good and well-priced, but the service was terrible. it wasn't really busy but it just seemed as if our server and the food runner/bus boy were on their first day on the job. (no water or menu until we asked for it, they messed up our order, etc)
- food ordered
** pourquoi pas (chicken, ham, swiss, mushroom sauce) - pretty darn tasty. i would totally recommend this one.
** formidable (grilled beef, mushrooms, onions, swiss, red wine sauce) - this one came with the wrong sauce, and the server didnt notice. and neither did we. because of this, the crepe tasted very similar to the pourquoi pas.
- don't think i'll be back.... sorry cafe."}
{"text":"The crepes are pretty good, but just not as excellent as I have come to expect from a creperie. The atmosphere and service are great, but for a $12 crepe, the flavor left something to be desired. As mentioned in other reviews, the fries are excellent, but we were looking for excellent crepes!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat a crêpe for lunch, and very consistent quality.  Also, their menu's were in French AND English, which I appreciated.  I had a number of their crêpes, and really enjoyed each of them.  The fries they serve here are some of the best I've ever had, crispy, flaky, and full of flavor at just the right consistency.  Also, their Strawberry-Banana-Nutella Desert Crêpe was AMAZING!  

So after eating here for lunch (and dessert) about 4 days in a row, I was never blown away by anything, but I was never disappointed either.  Solid establishment, and I give it my recommendation."}
{"text":"Muru is great! It's a good place for brunch. The staff is really nice and the menu has tons of different cool options to select from I have been to Muru a few times and haven't had anything bad to say about this place yet it's amazing. I would recommend his place to anyone and if you can make a reservation that would be best as the location is small and does fill up fast sometimes. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Absolutely DIVINE crepes.  We stuffed ourselves with three different kinds - Crepes Suzette, the Trois Fromages, and one with just strawberries and whipped cream.  Each crepe was the perfect spongy, chewy consistency, and cooked *just* right.  And while you can't really mess up a Crepes Suzette or just simple strawberries and whipped cream, the Trois Fromage definitely stole the show.  It had chevre, mozzarella, and swiss, with bacon and potatoes inside as well.  We would have kept ordering different crepes off the menu if we weren't so stuffed!

The staff was very nice, and the location was great - just a short walk from the Metro and then to Old Montreal.  If you are in Old Montreal, forget the tourist traps they call restaurants there, and take the short walk to this place.  But yes, they have changed their name, so look for Muru on the door of this corner cafe."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in Old Montreal.  Had a savoury crepe with goat cheese, sliced almonds, spinach and mushroom sauce.  Very good though I would have liked the option of buckwheat crepe.  This was accompanied by green salad and the best fries EVER.  So good that I ate them without ketchup something I rarely do.  And FYI vegetarians, the fries are fried in vegetable oil."}
{"text":"This was only the second time I've had crepes and man, they were amazing!! My fiancée and I came here on a Saturday morning and the service was wonderful. She got a lemon crepe and I got a strawberry, banana, and Nutella crepe and both were filling, rich, and absolutely delicious. The price was also very good and the coffee was exceptional as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in Old Montreal and want to get a really nice crepe!"}
{"text":"After walking the streets of Old Montreal in the cold spring (yes, can you believe that?) we stopped at this little place. The servers are very French about taking your orders and taking their time to serve you. However, the food is great. I ordered a savory crepe with mushrooms and tomato sauce and they can give you either all fries or half and half with a small salad and fries. the food was fresh and reasonably priced.

If you have a sweet craving, the coffees looked amazing and are made with personally drawn designs using the chocolate and powders."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Muru Crêpe twice while we were in Montréal and enjoyed it very much. The first time we went for lattes, which were excellent, and the second time we went for breakfast, which was also excellent. The service is friendly and efficient, the space is bright and sunny, and the location is great."}
{"text":"We were walking through old town and I decided I needed a crepe. Checked on yelp and Muru had really great reviews, so I called to make sure they were open (I've been surprised at how many places in Montreal were closed when they were supposedly open, according to yelp... not yelp's fault, I think it's just too cold outside). Luckily I did call because I found out that the kitchen closes an hour earlier than what is listed on yelp. 

The restaurant is really cute. It was cozy and cafe-y and we were the only once's inside. I ordered my crepe for $14 and my friends ordered other items including a matcha latte. When the matcha latte came out, it was maybe the best part of our night lol. It has the cutest little Totoro drawn ontop. Of course, we later find out that one of the waiters was a latte art champion! Whaaat!!? 

Yeah, super cool. My crepe was good, too. It's very conveniently located next to the water, and we walked/slid down to the Ferris wheel when we were finished. They also offer more substantial food and drinks, like alcoholic drinks. I'd definitely go back here if I find myself in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant with great food, great atmosphere, and great service.  On top of that, the food is beautiful to look at. It's no surprise, the crepes are delicious, but the fries were superb!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal with some college friends. The food was quite good, and the Carmel Macchiato was off the hook! Gave them a 4 star because the service was slow, and not particularly pleasant."}
{"text":"Chinese run crepes?
Hmmm...

Brisk service, balanced seasonings and light creperie...
Worked well as a second breakfast before running out back on the town.

The decor was minimalist and tasteful... great work in a very demur and non-ostentatious mode."}
{"text":"Best crepes I have ever had, by far. I got the one that was full of chili - I think it was called the Oh La La. The portions are fairly big, and come with a salad made from fresh greens on the side. Service is great here too!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by my first crepe experience in Montreal, I still wanted a crepe! Yelp, once again, came to my rescue and I found Crepe Cafe to go to after checking out the Notre Dame cathedral. It's a small, well decorated place that was able to accommodate us for lunch around the prime lunch hour.

Here's what we ordered:

-deliciuex ($9.50): filled with grilled eggplant, parmesan and mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and choice of beef, chicken (what I choose) or veggies
-incroyable ($9.50): filled with bocconcini (Italian cheese; like mozzarella), tomatoes, pesto, olives, fresh basil and pine nuts
-magnifique ($7.50): filled (and I mean, FILLED) with Nutulla, bananas and strawberries with whipped cream served on the side

All 3 crepes were outstanding and the portions are quite filling. The savory crepes are served with fries or salad. Here's a note: your crepe will already come with a small salad so you might as well just order fries, unless you want a bigger portion of salad.

Service was noticeably slow with diners looking around for their food or for the employees to bring them the menu. The owner (?) did come around to each table to make sure everything was okay though. When you're done, go up to the cash register and pay.

If you're not feeling like eating a crepe, they also serves sandwiches and egg dishes, which looked equally tasty as well. In a heartbeat I would definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous. My husband and I shared the fruit and Nutella crepe and the M12 crepe which was eggs, cheese, and breakfast meat. It was the perfect combination to share. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"I had a really lovely lunch here today. My croque-madame (a ham and cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top, but it's really just so much more) was delicious, and the salad on the side was much heftier than what you'd expect to get in a similar US establishment. And the staff is mostly bilingual, which was very helpful. I'm thinking I might go back for a breakfast crepe tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast. The place did not disappoint. We both got mochas, mine with almond milk. They were very well done, not super sweet. The crepes were also really yummy. We got one with honey and the M12 with bacon. Both were delicious and we would definitely come back next time we were in old Montreal"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I loved this place! The crepes were delicious! I had the one with chicken and spinach inside it, I believe. It was super tasty. I highly recommend this one as my boyfriend wished he ordered mine instead. Service was friendly and the waitress was really sweet! I definitely recommend this for lunch if you're hanging out near Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Crepes are delicious! And I'd choose home French fries over the salad! Very cozy and great place!"}
{"text":"Came here a few days ago since all the crepe places I wanted to go to were too far. The latte artist is exceptional and the crepes were delicious."}
{"text":"Crepes is the item to get here. Don't let the size fool you, its very filling. A bit pricey but it is near a busy Old Montreal so that was expected. Service was really good."}
{"text":"Haven't had a crepe this good in a long, long time (full disclosure: i don't get a chance to eat crepes very often in Brooklyn).

My girlfriend had the Cri D'Amour. I was doubtful of its quality when it came out only because it seemed to be covered with way too much fruit to be enjoyable but I was swiftly proven wrong. I tried a bite with a little bit of everything on it - banana, Nutella, strawberry, crepe, and found it to be perfectly weighted. No trouble finishing that one.

For my part, I had the Dejeuner Muru Au Saumon. This is my go-to archetype crepe with which to judge any creperie by and they passed muster with room to spare. Not too much salmon or egg or mushroom-based house sauce. It came out just as hot as you would want it to be and as easy to cut through and stack on a fork as you'd like. The accompanying potatoes were awesome, very complementary."}
{"text":"With tasty, simple crepes and sandwiches, Crepe Cafe is a solid choice for a casual lunch at reasonable prices.

We split a croque-madame and a crepe incroyable, filled with pesto, mozzarella, olives, and pine nuts, both of which came with fries and a salad.  This was my first ever closed-faced croque-madame, and we filled it with smoked meat instead of the usual ham.  It was a solid choice, decent bread, good meat and cheese, and a perfectly cooked fried egg on top.  Similarly the crepe was good.

Hip decor for a small restaurant, friendly waitstaff (though it took awhile to get someone's attention to get mayonnaise for our fries), okay prices, good food.  Solid choice."}
{"text":"Great breakfast crepes and lattes. It is in a good location in the old port. We were very happy to stumble upon this spot."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I made this our First and Final Stop in Montreal. Upon arriving we chose this spot for breakfast and then the day we left we came back for a repeat. First visit not bad, I got the croque-madam and it was ok, although not what I was expecting. The accompanying salad on the plate was substantial enough that I walked out full. My girl ordered the the savoyarde the first time - potatoes, bacon, creme fraiche inside a crepe. It was fantastic she also ordered frites with the salad and said they were sweet, crisp, thinly cut, and perfect.


The second time I did the man dish \"bonne journee\" sausage, bacon, ham, egg in a crepe, and she the bon matin saumon fume...er smoked salmon with creme fraiche or something like that. They lost points this visit because they reversed the order and put my crepe on her plate and then decided to tell us we were wrong when we pointed it out. I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure I know the difference between salmon and sausage. I mean I know they both start with the letter S, but that's as far as it goes. We would have both liked to try their dessert crepes however didn't bring along our larger stomachs, this will have to be a spot we visit on the next trip. Aside from the stumble on the second day, the only other con I can mention is that we wouldn't recommend their tea though, not a lot of choice, just the Earl Grey green tea."}
{"text":"Cute place with awesome crepes and drinks. Shared a breakfast and savory crepe with a friend, both very good and came with fries and salad. When I took a bite of a fry, my friend said that it sounds good since you could hear the crisp and crunch. And it was. The meal was good and I wish I had room for the sweet crepes because the menu looks amazing especially the items with alcohol."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for what it was. Great crepes and coffee. It is a bit small so if you go on a Saturday morning be prepared to wait a bit. The staff is lovely and the location is super convenient if you are walking around Montreal. I recommend the savory crepes but it is difficult to turn down the banana nutella crepe. Their coffee game is pretty legit so you really can't go wrong. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had been craving a savory crepe my whole trip to Montreal and finally stumbled upon Muru Crepe. 

We made it to the restaurant about forty minutes before they closed, and were finishing up with only minutes to spare, but the staff remained extremely pleasant and welcoming.

Husband and I decided to share a crepe which had chicken, ham, swiss cheese and a white wine dijon sauce. It came with a side salad and a side of fries. We each were very satisfied with our half-crepe as it was late in the afternoon and we didn't want to fill up too much before our 6pm dinner reservation across town. 

While this did not remind me of the savory crepe I'd had in Paris, it was still incredibly delicious. Served piping hot and bursting with flavor! The side salad and fries were equally wonderful. We would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a yummy lunch crepe! We did not try the desert crepes so I cannot speak to that, but next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to stop by to try!"}
{"text":"Relax et nourriture et service très bon...À découvrir les crêpes !
Le latté est haut de gamme et le design sur la crema et très bien réussi"}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast and ordered a Nutella Crepe and a coffee. I have to say the presentation of the food is very impressive and made the experience that much better. The coffee and crepe tasted very good l so I must compliment them on that. The reason I took a star away was because I felt like the portion was a bit small and not very filling when ordering the sweet crepes. The service was very pleasant and we were attended to very well. Overall I was impressed with this Cafe."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite while exploring old town. Ordered sweet (nutella and berries) and savory (chicken, veggies, and swiss) crepes. Both were outstanding! The service was excellent, and the French menu included English translations. A bit pricey, but to be expected given the location."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly, and the food was delicious. I had a cappuccino with the trois fromage crèpe with a side of fries. All exceeded my expectations, I only wish we had more places like this in the US!"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance, and so happy we did! My husband and I ordered both savory and sweet crepes and both were incredible. My husband raved over his coffee, and I loved my caramel macchiato. The two girls working were so nice and friendly, as well."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. This was my second time there, I live a few steps away and with respect, I won't go there anymore.

Went there for a small breakfast with my son, we must have been 8 inside and it took more than 20 minutes to get eggs and the plates were BORING!

Little to no fruits, dried toasts and nothing else.

Nope."}
{"text":"So I want to start that my man and I didn't have crepes so I'm a little biased. I had an omelette with potatoes. First, the cafe is super cute. Definitely a French vibe and it's location not right on the main drag in the Old Port area makes this a neighborhood gem and looking at others devour their crepes definitely a solid spot. The omelette was good. Nothing crazy, or anything you'd see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but just a small omelette with some fresh ingredients. As someone on a diet, I was stoked to have some roasted potatoes to accompany the omelette as advertised on the menu, but instead they were deep fried (womp womp). I sampled a few for the sake of this review (the things I do for Yelp) and they were of course awesome but again, these home fries were deep fried. I didn't eat the bread but it was thick cuts of fresh bread. Carbs, hmmmmmmmm.

Overall a definite solid spot for a moderate priced lunch. I'd come again when I can eat some crepes and those fried potatoes!"}
{"text":"This cute café on the outskirts of the main tourist area of old town actually seems like it's patronized by locals and regulars. This was a lovely place for lunch if you're in the mood for crepes. The ambiance was a little fancier than I expected, but it wasn't pretentious at all. My \"Delicieux\" crepe was excellent, with eggplant, cheese, tomato sauce and veggies. The other crepe we had was a bit over-the-top, with some kind of creamy cheese and veggies. I can't recall the name of it. You can choose salad or frites to accompany your crepe. Tip: If you order the frites, you'll still get a little salad as well. I was only disappointed in the fact that we didn't have room for the dessert crepe with Nutella, strawberries and bananas."}
{"text":"There is an early Wes Anderson film, Bottle Rocket, that sets out to be a quirky comedy.  It does not deliver Raging Bull, The Godfather, or Citizen Kane.  But for what it sets out to do, it executes beautifully.  

This the Bottle Rocket of Creperies.  It delivers surprising flavors and savory crepes.  For what it sets out to do, it executes beautifully.  

Easy to enthusiastically recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes. Had the mushroom steak savory. Great sauce. The sweet lune de miel was delicious. Very crowded at diarist but restaurant thinned out. Late brunch time on a Sunday. Slow service at first, but food came out fast. Really good fries."}
{"text":"We went here for Saturday brunch in Old Montreal. While easy to get to, it's a bit away from the sites so you don't feel surrounded by tourists. I had the smoked salmon crepe which was put together perfectly. The fried potatoes on the side were a little dry and could have used some seasoning, but otherwise complemented the crepe well. 

To be honest, my favorite thing about this place was the coffee. I had a wonderful cappuccino. I wish I knew what kind of espresso they used because it was leaps and bounds above what I get most places. Delish. Definitely would go back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Service trop long plats pas assez recherché sec trop simple . Ne pas y aller un dimanche !"}
{"text":"Crepe cafe is a real winner.

I didn't get the touristy feel here, even though it borders the old-city, always a plus in my book.

The crepes here are delicious and quite the value really.  The place is stylishly decorated, nice presentation all around, and yet the menu is priced on par with the food stand at Jean-Talon Market.

The coffee was very good and strong (not bitter), and free refills.

The staff that day was super-nice, giving us zero attitude, and being very happy to explain and recommend items on the menu.  Again, I have to say super-nice.

This place wins for great crepes, coffee, nice environment, and kick-ass people."}
{"text":"Muru Crêpe Cafe is a cozy Crêperie in the Old Port of Montreal, and they mean business when it comes to making crêpes.  Their menu is simple and unassuming; it offers over 30 tantalizing varieties of crêpe as well as sandwiches, soups, and salads, meaning there's something for everyone.  In a nutshell, I'm faced with an impossible decision.

After asking the patient waitress for her recommendation, I like to pretend that ordering the sweet crêpe, 'Cri D'Amour' was my idea. My hungry friend offered 2 savory crêpes and the waitress promptly sent in our order. 

I had but one sip of coffee when my friend's savory crêpe called the 'Tout A Fait' arrived. Unlike some open crêpe, this one was neatly tucked in a square: a parcel of chicken, ham, Swiss, and white wine Dijon sauce. As he cut into the crêpe, hot steam rolled forth, with Swiss cheese parting into fine threads. I jumped on his offer to try my first-ever bite of crêpe. Immediately, I noticed how the piquant Dijon sauce perfectly complemented the richness of the cheese, and the earthy flavors of the meat. The thin and fluffy layers of crêpe added a pleasant texture as well.


When my 'Cri D'Amour' arrived, a giddy smile washed over my face. The presentation was just amazing, and every second spent taking this picture intervened too long with my first bite. The chef piled generous layers of fresh strawberry and banana, with just the perfect amount of nutella chocolate spread over the fluffy crêpe. The strawberry glaze and fresh hand-whipped crème were the perfect additions to an already impressive confection. What I love most about the 'Cri D'Amour' is that it was not overwhelmingly sweet, granting each ingredient the room to work its way around my palate.  

 The final crêpe to arrive was my friend's savory 'Monsieur Muru' consisting of smoked salmon, capers, tomatoes, cream cheese, and chives. I found the presentation to be very similar to the first crêpe, but liked that the chef had chosen to fold back like a blanket the top to reveal the bright reds and oranges of the tomato and salmon within. The plate was delicately garnished with finely chopped herb, and I looked on enviously as my fatty friend enjoyed his second crêpe from first bite to last. 

 After a VERY enjoyable meal, we went up to pay at the cash register wondering what damage we had done to our wallets. I was thrilled to see our HKSN membership card proudly displayed on the cash register. With our full bellies, we were extremely pleased with the price, and this was prior to the 10% discount received by all HKSN members. Also, I want to draw attention to the happy fact that both of the savory crêpes were identical in price at less than 12$ each -- I often find a price premium charged on special ingredients like smoked salmon, meaning that Muru lets ingredient combinations dictate your crêpe decision, not the price.  

Ultimately, Muru Crêpes Café knows the business and creates a great atmosphere to please their customers. The service is warm, fast, and efficient. From what I have sampled, the food is very good, with enough variety on the menu to warrant multiple visits. Finally, the price is reasonable, and with a HKSN membership, this restaurant is a ton of value for the buck. The next time you're looking for an excellent lunch or have the need to satiate a crêpe craving, just remember: Muru Crêpes Café."}
{"text":"This place is really cozy and the smell of chocolate hits you as soon as you go in. I went twice for pancakes, lune de miel for the first time and Cri something the second with a latte, their latte is very good and the presentation is perfect. Only problem is the service is a little slow, waitresses take while before taking your order/getting the food. Also, their french fries is soo crispy and yummy! I would def go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Good crepes. Good fries. Good prices. 

All crepes are served with small salad and delicious fries.Our bill for 3 drinks, 3 crepe entrees, and tip was $55. Not bad at all. The trois fromages crepe was the standout at our table. The other crepes were good. I mean you really can't go wrong with a warm crepe filled with melted cheese and bacon. That being said, it was boring compared to the cheese crepe, and after one bite of the cheese-honey wonder, food envy ensued. I wish we weren't too full for the dessert crepes, as they sounded marvelous."}
{"text":"Cute and charming restaurant with a great staff. Excellent savory and sweet crepes. Not to be missed if you are in the Old Port."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and pleasant. Out of the long menu of savory crepes, I ordered Crepe Fantastique, which had sliced roast beef with tomatoes, sautéed onions, good quantity of Swiss cheese and white wine sauce. It was very delicious!! I want to come back to try the other savory crepes as well as sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch and was very satisfied.  I opted for the breakfast crepe and wow, I was not disappointed.  This was my first experience with having a breakfast crepe, as in NYC I am more used to getting a crepe with nutella, strawberries, and bananas.  

My breakfast crepe consisted of one sunny side up egg, mozzarella,  onions and peppers.  This combination with the sweet crepe was really good.  I would definitely have this combination again! The breakfast crepe was also served with roasted potatoes and fruit (which on my day was honey-dew).

Highly recommended for any crepe lovers or those looking to try crepes for the first time!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely over-hyped.

Known as the \"best crepes in town\", I was expecting a lot of this place. The food was disappointing to say the least, consisting of very standard crepes (reheated?) that made me feel like I could do better at home.

Muru Crêpe feels like it's run by a group of students, both service-wise and in the kitchen. Their menu is pages and pages long, with cryptic-crêpe names that are meant to entice you to order (\"Wake me up\", \"Sunny morning\", \"Again\", \"Quite exactly so\", \"I agree\", ...). Generally a menu focused on one food item, in this case the flatter cousin of the pancake, shouldn't come with a thousand variations - either let the customer completely personalize their dish with a selection of items of their choice (such as making a fruit list and asking customers to pick 3) or focus on a handful of interesting or classic combinations. Otherwise, it becomes unnecessarily confusing, considering the end result is essentially just different toppings inside the crêpe regardless of the 'fanciness' of the name.

Crêpe combos come with a choice of garden salad, fries or both. The fries were the ones from Costco, the Kirkland variety (excellent, do not get me wrong, but I hope for a little bit more frozen products when I dine out). Salad is utterly lackluster.

I ordered some sort of mushroom crêpe, that came folded with all the toppings inside. There was an extra fee (4$!) if I wanted some cheese on top of it, grand theft in my opinion. 

The mushrooms and peppers seemed to have been sitting in some odd mixture, definitely not fresh. They were also very scarce with the filling. When the crêpe came, it was lukewarm. The other crêpes elicited similar uninspired reactions from the other guests I was dining with. Only exception, one guest particularly enjoyed their omelette. At a crêpe place, you wonder if there is a problem that the omelette was the most enjoyed dish...

Their sweet crêpes are similar uninspired, varying on a theme of nutella/strawberry/sugar. 

We dined there for brunch on the week-end, place was relatively empty. 

I will not come back."}
{"text":"Oh deliciousness thy name is Muru!

Stopped in here for breakfast/brunch before taking a last look around the city and heading back to Quebec and was so glad I did!

Ordered the mushroom and spinach crepe with goats cheese and got 50/50 salad and chips. Very glad I did because the chips were delicious.

The crepe was amazing. The mushroom sauce and the goats cheese had melted together and become a fusion of yum inside the crepe parcel. The crepe itself was so good.

Just go here. It's good. I promise :)"}
{"text":"Muru Crepe was just the light lunch I needed to keep me going during a busy day of sightseeing in Montreal.

Upon arrival, we were shown to our small table and left to peruse the menus. I initially thought about ordering a sweet crepe, but instead went for the chili crepe (it came with fries). I was blown away by the french fries, which had that thick flour batter that makes you want to gobble up every one in sight. The thin crepe was delicious, while a little heavy on the jalapenos for me (and I like spicy food), but after picking out a few of the peppers, I devoured the whole thing. If I came back, I would probably go for a more traditional crepe, as I stared in envy at Jared's plate for most of the meal (he went with a sweet banana crepe).

Once you are done eating, you can pay at the front counter before continuing on your way. This spot is super cute and perfect for breakfast or lunch before seeing the rest of the Old Port."}
{"text":"yelp to the rescue again!  I was looking for a not overly priced place to get a warm lunch while visiting montreal, and stumbled on this gem.  delicious hearty crepes and good service at a very reasonable price.  great place to take in a rainy day."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every year with friends when we go to the Osheaga music festival. It is a must-eat location in Montreal. The service is wonderful, the crepes are fantastic, almost to the point of joyful tears."}
{"text":"Food was yummy and decently priced. Great place to go for vacation."}
{"text":"From an american point of view, It was like a gooey quesadilla with ham and cheese in it.  The french fries are spectacular.  I think Montreal just owns fries in general.  I need to go back to try the dessert crepes."}
{"text":"Prompt, polite service. Modern decor. The crepes were delicious. The Trois Fromages crepes could use a little less goat cheese but all the ingredients in the crepe were complimentary and it was beautifully cooked."}
{"text":"Had to have a crepe before I left Montreal.  Can't be inspired by all that french cuisine and not have a crepe.

Food - The crepes were fantastic. They were not served rolled but flat and came with half salad/half fries...so I didn't feel too guilty.  But it was really tasty.  Their ice tea is also out of this world good.

Decor - Cozy and very french cafe like. 

Service - This lost them a star.  Their service was really slow and we let them know we had a plane to catch.  Now I know its not their job to care and to just go at the pace they go, but if we tell you...you say no problem..and then it takes you 10 minute to bring us even water or take our order while we see you chit chatting behind the counter about nails...eh...I'm taking away the star.

Price: Overall, OK for what we ordered.

Noteable Extras: Nothing to note, except I'll mention that delicious ice tea again."}
{"text":"Excellent spinach and goat cheese crepe. Nice side salad. Shared a lemon crepe for dessert. Wonderful!Had an early dinner so also enjoyed a glass of wine. Old Montreal cobblestone streets are moments away. Excellent service."}
{"text":"So delicious we had to go back the next day to try more selections!  Adorable little restaurant ... worth the walk."}
{"text":"WOW!  Three of our traveling party of four had been searching for a good spot for crepes since our arrival in Quebec.  Well, we found THE place.  I was the non-crepe eater so I ordered the ham and cheese sandwich with the fried egg on it - absolutely delicious.  The crepe crew had three different lunch crepes and all were spectacular.  They also shared two dessert crepes - one with strawberries, bananas & hazelnut sauce, the other with bananas and chocolate sauce.  In their words they were both scrumptious.  Prices were reasonable, portions appropriate and the atmosphere comfortable.  It is a small place seating perhaps 30, and the advertised hours were short (1100-1500 daily), so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much and frankly the food was really good and you can't beat the intimate layout and location (beautiful Old Montreal) but the service was brutal.

I walked in to find a few tables empty so I was encourage to sit anywhere.  My order was taken promptly but then things went a bit downhill.  It took over ten minutes then for the waiter to return with water and a regular coffee which didn't bother me too much but my food took a considerable amount of time and the restaurant still wasn't full.

When the food arrived it smelled and looked delicious.  I can say the food was really great too. I ordered their smoked salmon crepe which I couldn't finish given that it was so big.

So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  No one came around again to ask if I wanted more water or coffee or to clear my table and offer me my bill despite it being very obvious that I was finished and wanted more beverages.  Patrons entered the restaurant asking for tables and the staff turned MANY people away or asked them to come back and told them they were currently full.  Had they just offered a bit more efficient service they wouldn't have lost so much business and annoyed me.

I'd go back for the food and just hope that the slow service and one cup of water/coffee for an hour long breakfast was just a one time mistake."}
{"text":"Phenomenal crepes, both savory and sweet. Good coffee. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Mmmm delicious! With an abundance of options and specials to choose from, Muru does a fabulous job living up to my tourist-y expectations of what a crepe cafe should be. Seriously, this place is definitely for tourists, but it's great all around. The staff is friendly and everything is reasonably priced...especially if you're used to U.S. prices. They served fresh pineapple, as in cut right from a whole pineapple with my crepe, along with home fries, but have nice greens for you all health peeps. If you're looking for delicious breakfast/brunch in the heart of old Montreal, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal authentic French soft crepes!  We had a couple other creperies in Montreal and these are definitely great. We had the Incroyable and the oh la la.  Both were AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, lunch or breakfast! Many crepes to choose from and everything I tried at several different times have all been great! The savory crepes are full filling and the sweet ones hit the sweet spot. Wines are basically same price as store so pop a bottle with some friends and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We loved this place. The first time we went here I got a sweet crepe and everyone else got a savory crepe. It was so good with nutella, strawberries, and blueberries that everyone was eating off my plate! The second time we went, my husband and I split the same sweet and then a breakfast crepe. Delicious. Coffee is good too. We didn't have one bad thing here. Service was ok, but we were visiting and spoke very little French. I would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Stopped by after walking around the Old Town for a snack break. The place is nice and clean. Ordered a strawberry banana crepe. 

I don't like it when the crepe is too sweet, but this place did it right. Not too sweet, but the right amount of sweetness. 

One crepe and an espresso with a scoop of ice cream makes its a great start for your day."}
{"text":"While the food was top notch the service was slow especially since there are so few tables there (which is a plus but didn't keep them from giving our oder to another table)."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad crepe... so take this with a grain of salt.  Seriously, I even like those first couple of burned crepes that come out as you're cooking 'em before the really good ones come out.

So, needless to say, when I was looking up places for a day trip to Montreal, this place floated to the top of the list. Walking in, we saw a bright sunny cozy dining area with huge windows that look out onto an intersection for lots of people-watching.  The service was outstanding.

Funny thing was, by the time we got there, I wasn't in the mood for a crepe anymore.  My companion had one, though, and the taste I had was delicious (of course).  I had a salade nicoise, and it was fresh and huge and scrumptious. 

All this is a stone's throw from the shops and sights of old Montreal.   This place was a nice start to the day.

If you're coming into Montreal for one day, this is a great place to start your excursion."}
{"text":"Boy did this place go downhill after a year. Ordered same crepes expecting some greatness and instead, utter disappointment. My fruit crepe could not be cut with a knife, it could literally stand on its own, savory crepes were mushy. Too bad, we made a special side trip for this. Should have just gone to the Atwater market."}
{"text":"This is a charming creperie at the edge of the old city, quiet and surrounded by elegant restaurants and a mix of modern and older apartments. 

The crepe filled with chicken, spinach, and a well-seasoned mushroom sauce was excellent. This was accompanied by perfect battered fries and a salad with fresh greens, tomatoes, and a dressing made from a very flavorful olive oil. It was an excellent light meal all together. 

My husband got a crepe filled with mozzarella cheese, beef, eggplant, and some additional Italian vegetables. It was a little too cheesy for our tastes, so be prepared. 

Their espresso drinks are definitely worth a stop on their own. We enjoyed a cappuccino and a caramel macchiato while sitting by the window and watching a sudden lightning storm roll by. They let you relax and enjoy the space as long as you'd like."}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious, the service was great and the location is an ideal setting for a meal in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"A cozy though busy corner spot for brunch. We tried savory and sweet crêpes... I'd stick with the sweet."}
{"text":"I'd say around 3.5-4*.  

Solid place with reasonable prices, especially in Vieux Montreal/Old Port!  Considering the location, I was actually surprised by their price-points.  

Crepes were around $10+each.  Came with either a side salad or fries or 1/2 of each which was a total bonus!

Minus stars for service on the slow side.  There was basically 1 main waitress that was handling the entire café and this means greeting, seating, wiping off tables, taking orders, and eventually serving the food.  Another waitress did appear to help with the load, but I don't think she particularly sped up our orders.

Shortly after being seated, I did see a couple get up and leave 'cause I think they were hungry.  So I guess it depends on what time you get there.

Crepe itself was thin, didn't fall apart, with a tasty centre.  I really wished that I had space to order a sweet crepe/waffle 'cause I think I would've been able to taste the crepe itself more!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Crepes were good. Service was good. Decent portions but perhaps overpriced. Smores Crêpe and strawberry were beautifully presented. Cookies were excellent. Probably won't go there again for a meal but totally worth stopping in for cookies!"}
{"text":"Et Voilà! The savoury crêpe I ate for lunch yesterday was called Voilà. I wish I could remember all that was in it... cheese, mushrooms and plenty of other ingredients that definitely made it all the more savoury. I couldn't help but chew my food slowly to keep that flavour lasting as long as possible. I had my choice of salad or fries or a bit of both and opted for a bit of both. The fries were hot and crunchy, the salad some mixed greens served with a house made dressing. 

I had a cappuccino to drink with my crêpe which came drizzled with chocolate sauce on top of tthe foam. So good! Who needs sugar when you've got chocolate sauce?"}
{"text":"Maybe it was sheerly the fact that I'm a Jersey girl in Montreal, but these creeps were the most delicious and beautiful little pieces of art I've ever tasted. My friends and I got different types--some of us got savory and some got sweet. Both were equally amazing. I enjoyed my sweet crepe and I also tasted my friend's savory crepe, which was just as enjoyable. The location is great, the restaurant is cute, and the people were very friendly. This certainly satisfied my craving for French/Canadian food!"}
{"text":"It's just like being in France café crepes and it's bitter cold. Try the hazelnut chocolate banana strawberry crepe. To die for-literally. I'm coming back"}
{"text":"It's only the highest form of self-restraint that's allowing me not to just fill this review with expletives and exclamation marks. This place is fantastic. I got the terribly named \"D'accord\" which is a vegetarian savory crepe with almonds, goat cheese, olives, spinach and some other goodness. Wife go the Attention with beef, jalepenos, chile and some other stuff. Both were excellent. You can get fries or salad. We did both. Salad was good, fries were, as mentioned other places to die for. 

Service was sweet, place is cute inside. Took home a collection of their homemade butter cookies and just ate a couple and they too are frackin amazing. 

Short version: It's beyond good. Go. Get fries. Take some cookies home. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch. Little drizzling rain and feeling like udon but opted for the D'Accord crepe.  Really good.  Came with a side garden salad which was amazingly lush and green. The dressing was simple, light and refreshing. 

Nice bright space. Lots of natural light and high ceilings. It's nice here after the lunch rush because its nice and mellow, good music, a perfect place to do a little work.  Took the time to write out some plans for an upcoming project when the young ladies at a couple tables down started talking about Kate Spade. I was like WTF???  So I joined their conversation. Ugh...so heartbreaking.  Remember to love your loved ones people.  And to be gentle with strangers. You never know what they are going through."}
{"text":"Ordered smoke salmon and bailey.
The crepe tasted nice and there are a lot of items on the menu.
The crepes are soft and chewy and nicely flavored.
Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast during our vacation. It's a quaint cozy cafe with a wonderful menu. I tried the strawberry Nutella crepe and hubby had the egg on avocado toast. Both were really amazing. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Nice crêpe cafe. Now called Muru Crêpe, I believe. 

Good location a stone's throw away from Chapelle Notre dame de Bon Secours and Marche Bonsecours.

We tried 2 difference savory crêpes and both were delicious"}
{"text":"One Sentence: I would recommend it to anyone! I would go back in a heartbeat, and I am so sad I don't live in Montreal, for this place (and the Poutine).

I couldn't decide which crepe I liked better - The simple, yet amazing, À Bientôt (\"Butter and sugar, whip cream\") or the decadent Cri D'amour (Nutella, banana & whip cream - I held the strawberries).

Both were really, really some of the best crepes we've ever had.

The next visit we had another À Bientôt, and Matinée Ensoleillée - both were amazing, again.

The restaurant/Creperie is modern and clean. The wait staff are friendly and we really enjoyed our breakfast's there.

It's right on the corner of Rue Notre-Dame Est and Rue de Bonsecours. We were able to find parking both Saturday and Sunday mornings, on the same street as the Restaurant. We arrived at 10am and 11am respectively, and both times found a spot, though 11am was slightly more difficult.

Any time I go back to Montreal, THIS is one place I will always visit."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on my recent visit to Montreal. My wife and I had breakfast and sweet Crepes they were all really delicious. The place doesn't stand out on the outside but the decor is very very nice inside. Service was very friendly and prices were reasonable ( $ 30 or so for 3 crepes and coffee). I would definitely come here on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"This was a perfect place to stop by in the freezing cold--it's a little further out (but still close) from where the main tourist attractions were (museums, Notre Dame, etc) but I actually really like that a lot because of its calmer and quieter setting. 

The ambiance is warm and romantic. We had a breakfast/brunch crepe called the M11 and it was delicious. The ratio of meat, cheese, and crepe were perfect! We had a side of home fries but I would have liked to try the potato hash, looking back. The sweet crepe we got was the Cri D'Amour, really decadent and again, perfectly balanced. They also do their drinks well--we got a cappuccino and mokaccino. 

I read that service was unsatisfactory in someone else's post... for me, it was more than good. Our waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. The wait wasn't long and overall the experience was great. It was like time slowed down a little and we really got to relax, before running off into the cold and seeing the sights."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab a crepe, while exploring the Old City in Montréal and I was not disappointed. I had a sweet crepe with bananas and strawberries, covered in chocolate syrup. Mmmmm it was absolutely delicious and worth every dollar. If you're craving a sweet or savoury crepe, I don't think you can go wrong with this place.

The service was ok. I came in with my own coffee and the guy gave me a bit of an attitude when I asked him to warm it up, referring to the policy of \"don't bring outside food here\". In the end, he agreed to warm up my coffee and even gave me extra cream on the side. I left a good tip :)"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe that serves salads, brunch and crepes. 

We were having a light lunch so we shared a savoury crepe. I can't remember what it was called (they all have quirky names!) but it had chicken, tomato and veggies stuffed inside. Nice, tasty and healthy served with a side salad for $11.

I saw people indulging in the sweet crepes and they looked delicious and sinful. Lots of marshmallows, fruit and chocolate sauce.

Nice chalk menu board with daily specials listed. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Not a tourist spot that we found on Yelp. EXCELLENT, fresh and reasonable!"}
{"text":"Their crepes are unique and absolutely delicious. I ordered take out and the service was friendly, and efficient. I ordered the crepe with spinach, mushrooms, goat cheese, almonds and mushroom sauce. It was fresh, went perfectly with the simple green salad and really hit the spot. Totally recommend this place for every crepe lover."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really hated almost every single meal I had in Montreal, and this place was one of the best. It was an affordable find in the very expensive Vieux Port area.  Good service, the food was really great, and the coffee was warm and bold.

If you are touring the area, please come here... unless you really want to spend three times as much around the corner for lunch/"}
{"text":"So glad that I had Muru in my short two days trip to Montreal. The quality of the crepe itself and toppings beautifully balanced together. We ordered one sweet and one savory, both were on the spot. I had crepes at other two restaurants within 48 hours but this is definitely the ONE."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews here, we decided to get crepes on a Sunday morning. We arrived around noon to a great looking location and presentation. Food looked amazing from what I saw. We were seated pretty quickly with waters.

Unfortunately, my party of two was not attended to (at all) for 20 minutes. I won't speculate as to how or why, but we ended up leaving without placing an order. I hope this isn't a common occurrence, and that other reviews are more helpful."}
{"text":"I took a cappuccino that comes with a neat Rosetta (the pattern stayed the same until I reached the bottom of the cup!) and a Baileys Nutella and almond crêpe, it was really good and baileys blends nicely with the other ingredients! My friend took a caramel macchiato and a D'accord Goat cheese mushroom crêpe with fries and salad, it was weird at first but not bad at the second bite. A nice brunch place that's quite popular even on weekdays, price is fairy enough, I would recommend this café to my friends :)"}
{"text":"My husband liked his salmon crepe, but I really didn't like my chicken crepe. Probably nothing wrong with it, I just was sad I ordered poorly. It's a cute place with quite a few crepes to choose from, but I wouldn't recommend the fabuleux. If I go back, I think I'll stick to the sweet crepes."}
{"text":"The Bailey's latte was amazing! Strawberry and cream crepe was also very good. Ambience could have been a bit better"}
{"text":"Excellent creperie in the Old Port! We had lunch here and the savory crepes were amazing. They have a pretty extensive menu for such a small place. I had the Marveilleux and hubby had the D'accord. Both were delicious! We opted for 1/2 salad and 1/2 French fries for sides. Salad dressing was good and very unique, and the fries were perfectly crispy and well seasoned. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went to this place after the line up at Chez Suzette's was too long. The yummiest crepes I have ever had. Their savory crepes are fantastic too. I ordered the merveilleux and the sweet crepe with nutella and whipped cream.  I also tired their latte which was fantastic. Totally worth the money! Will go there when I'm back in Montréal :-)"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, kind, and welcoming service and the coffee!!!! You can tast the quality! The mixes are perfect!"}
{"text":"On a décidé d'aller au Muru au vu des commentaires positifs. On est dimanche l'endroit est plein mais on arrive à avoir une table pour 6 assez rapidement, point positif. On regarde la carte, assez complète et intéressante, on commande crêpe, ufs et pain doré... Et malheureusement les déceptions vont s'enchaîner, à commencer par l'attente interminable (probablement du au manque d'employé, 1 seule serveuse et probablement pas plus en cuisine jusqu'à 13h ...). Ensuite par les plats, avec du pain sec, pas d'assaisonnement ou de sauce avec ufs/patate. Crêpe peu copieuse pour 15$ hors taxe. Et un pain dorée vraiment décevant sec et goûtant uniquement l'uf, très loin d'un bon pain perdu ... On a peut être pas eu de chance avec le service mais la nourriture ne trompe pas, et nous avons eu tous le même avis, nous n'y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"I don't give out too many 5 star reviews but this place is definitely worth the trip. The food was amazing and so was the staff. I had the egg crepe and my fiance had the nutella strawberry and banana crepe.   Both were amazing. I can only say that the home fries needed some seasoning. The ice coffee I had was delicious and I wish there was more. Her chai was amazing and they stenciled in a snail with the cream.   It's a small place and the staff bust their ads.  Great place to start off your day in old port."}
{"text":"The savory crepes were delicious. I had the Monsieur Muru, which has smoked salmon, capers, chives, and cream cheese. Yum!

The staff all spoke English, and were quite friendly. I would eat here again. It was a great lunch stop after touring one of the local museums."}
{"text":"Muru Crêpe was really good! 

During our stay in Old Montreal in February, we were on the hunt for a creperie within walking distance. Their hours online said that they'd open at 9:30am, however, when we arrived around 10am they were just then opening their doors. Thankfully we got there just in time because after we sat the place filled up immediately. 

The service was so-so, however, when 15 tables are seated at once, it's not going to be easy to take care of everyone in a timely manner. Still, maybe adding an additional server during this busy rush could be helpful.

I had the crepes with banana, strawberry, and nutella and my fiancée had the banana, nutella, and vanilla ice cream. I don't eat crepes very often, but they were really thin, beautifully plated, and served with very fresh fruit.

Overall, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I love crepes and this is a good place to get your crepe fix. Their Crepe menu is pretty big and you will definitely find something to your liking. 

I came here on a Sunday and luckily I made it before the rush came in. Once the rush was in around 12p there was a wait averaging 10-15 minutes. This wait can be eternity especially after a good night out in the city. 

I would definitely come back and maybe next time try a sweet Crepe"}
{"text":"Me and my friends were walking around old montreal for the first time when we stumbled along this restaurant. It's a good looking small restaurant and charming. The food is amazing! I had the chicken mushroom sandwich and it was heavenly, also the food was appropriately price. I will definitely come again when visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is a cute crepe place we saw on yelp. Decided to give it a try for lunch.  

The chicken pesto sandwich was delicious. 5 of 5. The crepe I ordered didn't turn out so well. First it was brought out with the salmon still in it despite ordering with no meat.  Next one out I discovered that the eggs were raw not scrambled. Made the best of it but wasn't my favorite. The flavor was dominated by a mushroom sauce.  Needed a spoon instead of a fork. 

The desert crepe was delicious. 

Service was friendly and attentive despite the mistake on the order."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, low prices, very friendly staff. The chicken salad was incredible. They had a special, a mango creme which was interesting as well"}
{"text":"Too many yelp stars. We were expecting some kind of supercrepe based on the number of stars. $40 for two crepes and a coffee. Went to another place with same amount of stars and was blown away at the same price or less. Yelp star system failed us big time here. Disappointed more in the star system than the establishment."}
