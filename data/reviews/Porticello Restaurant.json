{"text":"Well four stars is definitely too much for Porticello. This is not a bad place, but really nothing to dream about - unless you are seriously hungry and need to eat whatever, reasonably cheap, while walking by Harbourfront.  The place is rather big and absolutely clean. Service is just wow - our server was all around us, helping with everything, very polite and friendly. Excellent experience, pleasant to remember.  Food was barely so-so, though. I've tried the most expensive fish plate - and the portion was very small, with food quality just \"ok\". There were pieces of spine in the salmon fillet.  My wife got pasta - that was an abundant portion, and well prepared. Nothing really special, but a decent, good food. For the price - even better. We were invited to try their special Italian beer, and that was quite nice, too - as well as the house wine.  Overall - I would never order anything but pasta in Porticello, and the only reason to return would be low prices and excellent service."}
