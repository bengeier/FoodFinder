{"text":"previous owner / operator was much better. fish was mushy. called to place order from my car and watched from my car how walk ins got service while i waited on the phone. all the discount coupons are no longer honored and all the prices went up. has become a little pricey. food was okay but not sure if i will continue to go there. did not see a way to contact owner....."}
{"text":"This place has its faults but food is not one of them. The staff is nice along with the owner. Yes at times it may appear that they're slow or don't answer the phone however that's because of the high volume of customers, especially around the first of the month and weekends. They have a downtown location on Superior west of East 9th that is packed at lunch time. The problem is nowhere to park close. Believe me, this is the spot.  I had a couple places in the past that reminds of Fresh Catch. Caribbean Sea on Euclid in East Cleveland back in the day and New Orleans Seafood in Cleveland, but this place is better. What I understand is that the owner had some affiliation with New Orleans but he uses a lot less seasoning on his fish which is just right.  I recommend the black bass dinner if u are use to bones but the perch will satisfy. I only give them a four because of the wait sometimes but they deserve five.  One of the best carry outs around."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no star!!!! They limit the amount you can order and that's not posted anywhere in the place. They tell you after you place your order that you can't have this or that, that you have to call that in, which I tried but kept getting a fast busy for 40 minutes or more. They are losing business (especially mines,) but I guess they don't care. Plus they're very very slow and some of the staff is rude."}
{"text":"I have to say I love fresh catch yes they could be slow at times but this place gets a lot of business the food is delicious I tried almost everything this is a small little hole in the wall kind of spot. You won't go wrong eating here the fish is pretty good if you like fish. I have to save the fish is always fresh like the name says. So if you want some good fish try fresh catch."}
{"text":"Expect slow service on Sunday endings just before close. Staff is usually in good spirits they are never negative.  Passive attitude = positively delicious food! #sogood"}
{"text":"I want my be back. I ordered at 8:03. It's a 8:45. It should not take this long for a perch dinner. While the food is good that's the reason I come. They're not busy and seem to be taking care of call in orders 1st. Although I did try calling the line stayed busy. 

Note: it was after 8:45 when I finished this and I'm still here. #sleepinginthecar"}
{"text":"The young lady that took my order was very nice. She said my order would be ready in 20 min or a little longer, it was ready in 25 min.(it was crowed too) the fish was fresh, seasoned perfectly, and really good!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Customer service could use a lot of work. I ordered inside, approximately five minutes after I ordered they informed me they were out of the fish I ordered, no problem. The fish they replaced it with was cheaper, they offered to refund the .50 I declined. I understand mistakes, I wasn't upset. I'm assuming the cook mistakenly made a dinner (4pcs) instead of snack (2pcs). When she was made aware of this, she took out two pieces of fish and closed the box. In my opinion everything up until this point is human error, taking fish out of the box was unnecessary and poor customer service...not taking into account the fact that my order was taken for a fish they did not have nor the additional wait time. I used to frequent this place semi regularly. I probably won't return."}
