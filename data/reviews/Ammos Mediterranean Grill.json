{"text":"Delicious and a pretty healthy choice when going out to eat.  Oh and the baklava... Amazing!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not the greatest Greek food I've had. Lacks a lot. No flavor. So upsetting."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for my family and me. We love the gyros! Don't forget the spicy tzatziki sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to spot when we need delicious food quick. My hubby loves the gyros platter. Deliciously seasoned. The rice is to die for. I love the stuffed dolmas, chicken shawarma and beef skewers. Their mezza platters (mixed appetizer platter) is perfect snack with a glass of wine! Baklava is delish! They will also cater for large groups. This is a family operated business. You'll find the dad operating the front of the house and his sons in the back. Their dining room is very small, but adequate. They do not serve wine (or any alcohol for that matter) so you will have to enjoy said mezza platter at home with your wine :-)  I would recommend Ammos to anyone who loves Mediterranean yumminess!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place. The service, value and quality are consistent. Food always tastes fresh. The only thing I don't like are a. The extra charge for extra tahini sauce and b. They always seem to be out or never have unsweetened ice tea.  Other than that, rock and roll!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the first time, and we loved the small, family-orriented atmosphere. We shared a salad of delicious lettuce, cucumber, pita chip, onion, topped with an olive oil dressing. Each of us had a different gyro: we loved them! This is certainly a place we will visit again!"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is fantastic! The friendliest staff I've experienced in a long time! Gyros and Gyro Dinner/Plate are really good!"}
{"text":"Love this resturant. Aside from receiving amazing service from the hostess the food tastes delicious and resturant is super clean... I AM TRULY A FAN!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Quick service. A great alternative to some of the more expensive Greek places in the valley."}
{"text":"I had their gyro entree today. The meal was excellent for a real good price. The staff was friendly. I will definitely be back to try them again."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly.  Family owned and operated by great people who treat you well and know how to make great food!  We love the shawarma."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. The staff care and get my order right everytime. The food is delicious, the price is right. Everything is cooked to perfection. They even make their own pickled turnip for the falafel pita.  Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food is delicious and restaurant is very clean. The owner and his staff are always friendly and polite. I highly recommend this place to anyone that likes Greek food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always delicious. The owners are super nice. The place is very clean. I love the chicken shawarma. The hummus is pretty good too. My husband enjoys the beef. Good sized portions."}
{"text":"Wow! Ammos never disappoints. This is one of the most consistent restaurants in terms of taste, quality and overall cleanliness that I've been to in the area. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The owner Bill is very gracious and always makes an effort to get to know his customers. My favorite go-to meal is the chicken gyros combo. So much flavor! Also the hotziki (spicy tzatziki) is delicious!!! Make sure to get a side."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere and fast.  If you like Gyros, you will like this place a lot.  There seems to be a lot of Gyros places opening up these days but, none with service this good.  Nina, is top rate and friendly.  The prices are good as anywhere and the food is good as well."}
{"text":"Pita lunch deal is where it's at. The food is great and the employees are nice. Chicken souvlaki is bomb too!"}
{"text":"Yea! The things you find in your own neighborhood. It's been here for five years and we didn't  even know, now were kicking ourselves. I loved the food, but my wife's reaction surprised me, She let out a WOW. We were just talking about how hard it is to find good baklava and quite frankly most gyros, for me, is just so so. This place changed my mind. I'll give it a WOW also. My wife knows middle eastern food, I'll be back to try the other items."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area and had never been in before until recently....food was outstanding, clean, and healthy...All awesome, other than a bit if a wait, I guess since they make each meal on order.  Very Good and will go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite little Mediterranean/ Greek place. Delicious food and the owner and family are so friendly. Love coming here. Get the Appetizer plate. A little bit of everything."}
{"text":"always clean, always friendly, always fresh and delicious.  I always order the gyro - it is amazing.  Everytime - very consistent."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Lots of meat on the gyro and fresh hummus and pitas. Good price"}
{"text":"So happy Ammos opened near our home.  Excellent food!  I'm addicted to their appetizer platter!  And my husband loves their gyros. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find- an authentic Chicago style Greek restaurant in the suburbs of Phoenix. The chicken kebab was delicious as was the gyro!"}
{"text":"Staff is fine. Pretty pricey for the portions. Food is okay"}
{"text":"I love this place! I'd highly recommend to anyone and everyone. they have the best customer service and food! there Greek salad are to die for! they are delicious! and you can call in your orders to go! this place is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  We have eaten here a half a dozen times and they do not disappoint.  Their Lentil soup is so tasty and good for a lighter dinner with a pita to dip in it!  Love their shawarma either chicken or steak, gyros, hummus!"}
{"text":"Best gyro's anywhere.  Service is outstanding and the restaurant is very clean.  Staff if super polite and helpful.  Would recommend to anyone, you defiantly want to try this place out."}
{"text":"I've come here twice. The flavors were pretty good... but each time I got stomach cramps and had to RUSH home to use the bathroom. I won't be going back. Our new motto is \"No vamos a Ammos!\""}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. Fresh and full of flavor. Greek salad awesome and had to have baklava! Yum!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I stopped in here for a bite after One11 @ CCV. Literally folks, they've got the BEST lamb gyro I've ever had in my life!! And being Armenian, I've had quite a few!!! 10 stars."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to Ammos, but lately their standard has fallen. Their fries are stale and refried. And they add mustard to your burger without telling you. It was honestly disgusting, and I'm so disappointed in Ammos. If they address my concerns, I will take down this review. However for now, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Generous portions of very tasty food.  The lentil soup was delicious.  Tzatziki sauce is flavorful.  We really enjoyed the dolmas."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. Super friendly hosts. Sorry it's so far from where we live but when in NW Phoenix, we'd come back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is a decent alternative to Z Greek if you are in the area and have a gyro craving. VERY meaty (as much as Z). Nice bread (not quite as good as Z, a little doughy). Good fries (Same). Good tzatziki (almost as good as Z). They did charge for it though.  If you've ever been to Z, being in the same ballpark as them is a pretty damn solid review. They are that nerd (me) in class who always screwed up the curve for the rest of the class.  One thing that was pretty funny was the girl who took my order was new and pronounced YEE row as GUY row. F-ing hilarious, especially in a greek place from a worker. The owner was behind her and didn't bat an eyelash, but I give koudos to him not correcting her in front of us."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, fast and friendly  service. Food tastes fresh every time, Ammos never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite restaurant Greek restaurant in town. It's conveniently located just a couple of minutes from my house, but that's just a happy accident. The interior of the restaurant is clean, well-lit, and the open view of the kitchen is a nice touch. But those are just bonus features. The real highlight of Ammos Mediterranean Grill is what it should be: the food, which is fresh, flavorful and clean. Their gyro sandwiches and chicken dishes are the best I've had. And speaking of clean, with the gyros you don't need to worry about that all too common trail of grease running down your arm. Everything is just clean and fresh.  Other menu items worth mentioning: the rice is savory, the dolmas are somehow refreshing, and the baklava makes for a satisfying sweet dessert.  The next time you're looking for great Greek food, go to Ammos and try their chicken gyro with a side of rice. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean spot around town.. Always fresh, always friendly, always clean , & always delicious!!!!!!! So consistent! Love Ammos!!"}
{"text":"Placed a take out order for a Beef Shawerma, Chicken Shawerma and some baba ganoush.  Order was ready in minutes.    The nice lady forgot the pita bread that comes with the baba ganoush; no worries, I had some emergency pita in the freezer.    Chicken had good flavor as did the beef, baba ganoush was a bit on the garlicky side (I didn't mind, but wifey wasn't a fan).  I'm happy it's good and fast.  Will def be back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"So I was craving kebab all weekend and decided to search a couple of spots because I was sick of the usual gyros scene around my area and stumbled upon this one. Wowza, where do I begin?   First, the location is in a shopping center next to a Walmart and very easy to find with convenient parking. We walked in around 12:15 PM and were able to order right away before it got crowded. The ambiance was very light and the place had the perfect brightness. I was literally starving when I was looking at the menu and everything looked so good to me but I chose to order the Beef Kefta Kebab plate and substitute my salad for the red pepper hummus. My friend ordered the Beef Kebab plate and substituted his rice for red pepper hummus too.   As we were waiting for our food, they first brought out the red pepper hummus to snack on with some pita bread, which shows you the great quality of the service. That thing was freaking delicious. I've had a lot of hummus in my life, homemade, store-bought and in many restaurants and this one is definitely in my top five. Not too oily, perfect amount of spice, texture was just right and the decorative olive was right where it's supposed to be. After I gobbled that thing down, my kebab plate arrived and I couldn't even wait for my friend's food to arrive before I began to feast. Oh my, that kebab was so freaking juicy and amazing that I finished 1 1/2 of it within ten minutes. The rice also had an amazing flavor and wasn't your usual yellow bland type grain. There was also a side of garlic/tzatziki sauce which I used on a couple of occasions, but to truly taste the meat I wouldn't suggest using the sauce too often. My friend also said his meat was so juicy (and it sure looked like it) and we both walked out of there so full, but in a good way.   I cannot wait to tell some of my other friends about this place because they usually go to the same old spots closer to school, but this place is a hidden gem and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh yes Az this Mediterranean places is delicious . You will not be disappointed . Nice small place, family owned . Their homemade lentil soup is worth a try . Salads are yummy , gyro's bring happiness to the palate . Don't be shy check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I am very picky with my middle eastern food. I make it all at home and this place comes close to home made. I am thrilled that it opened in Arrowhead!  My only suggestion is that they needed more lemon and salt in their hummus. The falafel was really delicious. We tried all their meats and they were all yummy. My favorite was the chicken kabobs.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Since we live in the neighborhood we were anxious to see a new eatery open up, unfortunately the quality of the food won't have us going back. Twice we went for gyros which were just ok....and tonight we tried the souvlaki entree in which the pork was so overcooked and dried out, no amount of cucumber/dill dressing could save it. We threw half of it away.  With so many dining choices around here, you can do a lot better."}
{"text":"I try a lot of Greek places around town. I tried this place because I stopped by the Walmart next door and noticed this little Greek spot. I walk in and wow is the place nice. Small but very nice. I just don't get the pictures of war on the walls. I look at the menu and everything looked good but the price was a little steep. I order a gyro. The sauce tasted like nothing and they put so much of it that my whole sandwich tasted like nothing. For the price I was a little disappointed especially how nice it looked inside. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Located on the NW corner of 67th and Happy Valley.    I ordered the combo dinner entree with pork souvlaki and gyro meat.  I also ordered an appetizer of dolmas.  The entree was large sized.  It came with rice, onions, tomatoes, a salad, and sauce. The pork had a pleasant seasoning and came with about 4 large chunks.  The meat was tough and chewy so that kind of ruined the flavor.  The gyro meat was seasoned well and had a good portion.    The rice was very plain and needed spices.  The onions did not taste fresh nor did the tomatoes.  The pita bread was amazingly soft and light.  It was the highlight of the dish.  The side salad was also really tasty.  It came with romaine lettuce, olives, cucumbers, and feta cheese and a balsamic vinegarette.  The dolmas were good but ice cold and could have used some more seasoning and acidity.    For two meals with an app it came out to 30 bucks before tip.  Not a great deal but one meal could probably feed 2 adults.  I went back and forth over 2-3 stars but the pita bread and salad made my decision."}
{"text":"If you want greasy disgusting Greek food try this place. Nothing like waiting 20 minutes for complete garbage."}
{"text":"Love this place. If you want a gyros and you are in the area don't hesitate to stop by! The food is amazing and so is the staff and the atmosphere! Love this place! Great food great prices great people! Can't get any better!"}
{"text":"Always delicious, best Gyro I've had. Very reasonably priced and the owner is extremely friendly. Very nice guy, very quick getting your food (which is always fresh to order), the portions are large and filling and the food always tastes so fresh, cooked just right. Cannot go wrong here, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We did an order for take out.  Easy to order and was ready very quick.  Price was right. It was the same price if we had lunch at fast food.  I got the french fries and they were absolutely amazing.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection, best fries I've had in a long time.  My wife got the onion rings. They are beer battered. I tried one and cooked great a little heavy on the beer flavor.  I got the philly cheesesteak.  The meat was tender and plentiful.  It is the reason for 4 stars vs. 5.  The meat was a little unseasoned could use something-even just salt.  For sure adding it to the list of places we will go to on a regular rotation."}
{"text":"Love it! My wife and I go here quit a bit. They recognize us and know what we want. Great service, attentive and really good food! Keep up the great work you have a patron for life"}
{"text":"They probably would have gotten a 4 at least if the review was based on food alone but we are staying locally in a hotel ordered thru Grubhub for the first time and both the restaurant and the delivery service who charged 7.99 where Yelp said 3.99 but that being said both Grubhub and the rest.  Forgot forks and knives etc. No napkins nothing for 50 in food and delivery bill were had too eat a Greek salad with our fingers.  Food was very good and I'll eat there again but no take out and they didn't do anything to make it better.  GH offered 5.00 off on our next order, don't know if there'll be a next.   LAMB gyro, falafel and spanakopita were very tasty.  But big mistake especially when they see it's a hotel delivery.  I don't know too many hotel rooms with knives and forks."}
{"text":"This could be one of the best Mediterranean place I've been to in Arizona. The quality and the amount of food you get is out of this world. I got the gyros meal with fries, which is #1 on the menu and it was under $10. It's so much food and it taste delicious. Also, the customer service was excellent! Best bang for your buck! I will go back again!"}
{"text":"First time here... AC felt like it was out, food was over priced, hair in salad, and there were ants on the wall.  With that said we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My Syrian friend recommended this place so I had to try it. She's very picky and said that it was the closest to the real thing back home. I didn't believe her, but she's tried numerous places in the United States so it meant something.  I came to try the beef shawarma to compare it to back home and it was the closest thing in the states. I was surprised, naturally it wasn't the same but at least it was close. I then had the osmalia and ballourie, the osmalia is excellent and my friend loves the ballourie. Make sure you leave room for dessert because I actually enjoyed it more than back home! Haha how dare I say that. It's not made the same, but it's extremely delicious nevertheless.   The place itself was decorated nicely, and was very clean. So were the bathrooms. The staff was great, fast, hot (haha) and efficient so our food was not cold. The plate sizes were large and decently priced. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"For tasty and fast food, this is as good as it gets for casual dining or carry out.  Have not been disappointed on multiple visits - generous portions of very tasty middle eastern food with great service.  The jalapeno hummus is fantastic, and the yogurt toppings and all of the pita's I've had were excellent."}
{"text":"I love this place,  everyone is so nice and the food is great too! I recommend the falafel and hummus appetizer."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the Chicago area. Moved to the East Coast for many years and could not find a gyros place out there to save our lives. We moved close to this place and found it to be very comparable to what we were missing. The gyros are excellent and the service is always very good. We come here regularly and will continue to do so. Usually I only get the gyros sandwich with fries but sometimes get various appetizers. Their hummus plate is good but could useMore pita and their falafel's are excellent although a little spicy. We will continue to eat here and take out from here. The prices are great too."}
{"text":"I am very curious to your response of my post. You say why did I not address the issue when I was there & go home to make an erroneous post. If you read my post I did bring it to your attention & you ignored it. You also indicate that there was no way I could see what was going on in the prep area. No sure how you could say that when I was standing right in front of it an seen every move that was made behind the counter. You can respond till your blue in the face but I know what really happened. I have better thing to do in my life than unintentionally rip on a business for no reason. Considering this is the only post I have ever made on yelp should be a clear indication of my motives. I have told everyone I know of what happened & they have not went to your establishment since. Good luck, you won't be there much longer anyways."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing!  I will be dreaming of the baklava in my sleep tonight"}
{"text":"Came hefe for the first time and Injave had better. I got the gyro combo and my fries were soggy and warm. The gyro was alright nothing amazing. Can't say that I would want to come back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We ordered the kefta kabob pita and a combination plate with kefta and chicken shawarma and everything was DELICIOUS! Very authentic Mediterranean food and VERY generous portion sizes, so bring your appetite! They also offer a 10% military/ first responder discount. Really enjoyed our dining experience and can't wait to try more of the menu!  10/10 would come back!"}
{"text":"There was weird pictures of the owner at war, (probably about 20-30 pictures) not the most appetizing thing when eating. (Pictures of blown up cars and him holding guns) also the Fattoush salad was very substandard and the dressing was tasteless. And there was an eyelash in our food.   But it's an ok place for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Great fast casual.  I like the food. Friendly service here. Which is huge for me. Will be a regular stop for a gyro or a salad."}
{"text":"Not sure why everybody is raving about this place. I found it to be average at best. Gyros meat was way too salty, tzatziki  was tasteless and 2 slices of paper thin tomatoes on sandwich.  The guys behind the counter were more intrested in watching the soccer game than taking care of customers. And it wasn't the World Cup either! Pita Kitchen & Wraps has much better Gyros."}
{"text":"They gave large helpings and it was delicious. We moved from San Antonio and I didn't think there would be good Mediterranean over here. I stand corrected."}
{"text":"The Philly Cheesesteak and the Chicken Philly were very good.  Will come back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST gyro place in town. The gyros are very generously portioned, the meat is very fresh and tender.  The owner served us today, which is something you don't see that often. The staff is nice and it's a great atmosphere! We live closer to two different gyro places but this is definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I can see why they have a great rating. I had a gyros platter. They really piled it on. Great flavor , clean, friendly reasonable prices. I like my meat a bit more well done and will ask for that next time."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Chicago, and this preggo was craving plants. It was the best baba ganoush I have ever had. It was the best hummus I have ever had. It was the best Greek salad I have ever had! Food was fast and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"My favorite is the beef shawarma...very tasty. The chicken kebabs were also good! There was a lot of rice in the combo plates....yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, they now have 10% off for all first responders and military, nice sincere touch, me and the wife will be back again and again, five stars"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place , the owner was the cashier / waiter, he was super nice , I came with a military member and he took care of us (he was a military member a few years back ) , gave us discount , gave us free desert , food here is fresh and delicious !  I wish I live closer to this place so I would come more often .  The restaurant is very clean , has lots of selections and you get a big portion without paying too much .  Thanks for your service sir and thanks for the amazing food !"}
{"text":"I always love going to non-chain restaurants and I am happy to say Ammo's is definitely not a chain. The owners are very nice and they care about putting out a good product.  I have had several dishes there such as tge Gyro, the Greek salad, Dolmas and Hummus appetizers. All were delish!  I just hope I have room one of these days to try the baklava."}
{"text":"We love this place! The hummus, gyros pita and Greek salad with gyros meat is all we've eaten here. They are so good we've never tried anything else! The staff is friendly and courteous. The place is clean although we most often do carry out. Great sandwhich shop!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood place for good Mediterranean food. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is phenomenal.  I do think the tzatziki is different from any other, but that doesn't make it bad. It's close to my house and speedy to get something on the way home. I recommend!"}
{"text":"Updated review:  Over the years this place has become better and is really great now.  The food is excellent and served in generous portions.  Service has been exceptionally friendly and helpful.  There's one little oddity in that they charge for their tzatziki, but oh well, it's not much and it's very good.  Every meal I've had here has been a great example of Greek cooking."}
{"text":"I come here with the family (wife, threw kids) often. Service is great, friendly and attentive. They're always busy, mostly with takeouts. All plates are awesome. My stomach is sensitive to food that's not fresh, or cooked with a ton of artificial ingredients. I keep coming back here because I can eat all day without getting sick.  Just awesome!! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We had a gyro, Philly, and Chicago dog. Impressive food and great environment."}
{"text":"The food was excellent-- fresh and vibrant, and large portions. The service was attentive and very welcoming.  We will be back soon to try the Chicago style Italian Beef sandwich.  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Semi Fast Casual Mediterranean cuisine. I note for this area a four star rated is suggested.  This time I had the chicken gyro salad. It was basically chicken gyro over a Greek Salad. The chicken was moist and seasoned nicely. The salad was fresh and generous in size. The olives were good quality and with removed pits.  My husband had a combo plate. The chicken shawarma was much juicer this time and the gyro meat was good. This plate was also very generous in size.  Service is always THREW THE ROOF NICE! This is a MUST TRY PLACE!   I didn't give four stars is because of the other places I've been to in the valley that fresh bake the pitas and prepare the falafels in a different style that I prefer, those I rate at 4-5 stars. But Ammos is very good and is much better than two other mediterranean I can name in this area.  They are open 7 days a week  A VERY SOLID 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"... My husband and I have been here twice so far since it's down the street from our new house and we LOVE it! The food is great, good portion and prices, and I don't feel like staff is frustrated at me for asking for a side of ranch!! Haha! It's a cheat meal for me so I'm not here often but when I am, the meal fills me up to the brim!!!"}
{"text":"We moved to the are and tried this restaurant for the first time about 6 months ago. We have never been disappointed. The food is fresh and the staff is very friendly. You can tell it is family owned and they take pride in that. The restaurant does not smell like greasy food and somehow their fries are dlicious without being oily. I can eat there and not feel disgusting afterwards. The only thing I haven't been a fan of is their Greek salad because I don't care for their dressing, but that's just me. I recommend this place all the time. You should try at least once. Prices are very good too. About $10/person plus drinks for dinner and the portions are generous. My husband and I easily share the gyro dinner with an extra pita."}
{"text":"Really delicious food...love the chicken gyros and their baklava is a nice treat! Everyone working there is very pleasant. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I loved the gyro combo and  would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for the dolmas.  I was hoping they would be homemade like I used to get from my neighbor not what I got from the diners in NY(which are bought and served cold). Anyways I am still a fan and will go here when I am in town. Service was great I think it was the owner she was very friendly and food  came out quick."}
{"text":"Very personable service! I haven't had such great customer service on the west side in ages! Also, the food was spectacularly fresh and made to order. I highly recommend this establishment. I ate here with my very picky mother (she doesn't usually like Mediterranean food) and we both loved the food and experience!"}
{"text":"Went again last night.  Happy to see Bill's busy.  I had the beef shawarma on top of a small Greek salad!  No pita (remember, low carb diet!) and it was great.  My wife had the gyros again and was just as happy as the first time.  Nice place!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I always don't know whether to get the shawarma plate or a gyros sandwich. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is great! The tables and floor are always clean whenever I walk in, even on busy days which is very impressive."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. I love the lunch combo gyros/fries with a side of Baba ghanouj and tabouli appetizer."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Gyro plate and the combo plate. The basmati rice that came with the combo was cooked just right. My biggest gripe is they had a sign on the soda fountain charging for refills. If they don't have the soda fountain behind their counter and it's in the dining area and you are already charged over a dollar for a soda it seems like a ripoff. It has been awhile since I was there hopefully they have changed this."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when coming to Ammos . Food is always great. Healthy portions. You won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time last night, and I was impressed. Everything is made in house, and has an authentic taste. The original hummus was very good, but I wish it was a bigger serving. Actually the serving size isn't bad, it was just so good that I wanted more.  The regular gyro combo is what I went with and I was not disappointed. I have had gyros at places before and the meat can sometimes be dry, but not here. The meat appeared to be freshly sliced and was nice and moist. I also got extra tzatziki sauce, which I always recommend having an extra side of at any place.  I am glad we found this little neighborhood restaurant close to home."}
{"text":"I frequent this place about once a month.  The food AND the staff makes each visit worth it. I frequently get the #13 (Chicken Shawarma Entree), and I always get an extra pita and tzatziki sauce). ((I recently made my boyfriend a fan of it. ;) hehe))"}
{"text":"Beat gyros I ever had! The pitas here are amazing! We always buy extra pitas to take home. The service is so friendly."}
{"text":"i love eating here. food is always great, and workers are friendly. but why the fuck do they charge me for spicy tazeki sauce!"}
{"text":"We placed a pickup order for our office of 10 people yesterday and when we tried to pick it up today we were told we had to pay for each order separately. We asked to combine it it on one ticket and we were told we can't use a card to pay that amount? What?? So after leaving to go get cash to pay for the order, which is getting colder by the second, It finally arrives at the office where we discovered one order was missing and all but one of the others was wrong. I doubt we will order lunch from here again nor will any of us personally be back"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. The food was fantastic, clean restaurant, friendly staff I believe it's family owned too. We  are for dinner and Mediterranean  food is our favorite and it's hard to find a good one but we did! Flavors are great, it's fresh and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and the kitchen looks as clean as I've seen. The portions are quite big and their rice and lamb are always delicious."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 during opening week.  Definitely worth a visit.  It's a casual, counter service place serving Mediterranean dishes.  Several tables for eating in.  Drinks are self-serve.  The people behind the counter (possibly the owners?) were all very friendly and pleasant.  I immediately loved walking in and seeing the towers of meat on the vertical broilers!  :)  Menu has a lot of variety and even a kids' section.    I went during a fairly busy time and ordered a couple of plates to go.  It was a 20-25 minute wait, but at this point, I will put that up to being a busy time and working out opening-week kinks.  They did forget one side item from my order, but were very apologetic and brought it out to me quickly...again, it was busy and stuff happens.  Not counting that against them this time.  We sampled the kefta, pork souvlaki, and chicken shawarma.  They were all very tasty, though the pork was a bit dry.  We liked the shawarma best.  Fragrant rice was good.  Side salad okay.  Their sauce was right on!  So good.  It was nice and garlicky, tasted of yogurt, and not mayonnaisey or sweet like some other places. Decent fries.  I can see my family becoming regulars here.  Next time we'll eat in and check out the gyros.  Very glad to see a place like this in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This place has great food! They are right in our neighborhood and my middle son spends much of his allowance on his gyro addiction. Alway great and the staff is friendly. The food is fresh and the gyro meat is lean where other places I've sampled have been greasy. Good week night meal!"}
{"text":"We ended up coming here on a whim because our other go to Gyro stop ended up closing down. So happy it did because Ammo's is absolutely superb! We have a family of six and decided to just get a pound of gyro meat, side of rice, & pitas. It was plenty! We all loved it. The atmosphere is beautiful, its exceptionally clean, & the customer service was above and beyond. We will definitely be back.... It's our new Gyro stop!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Been going there regularly since they opened. Always clean always greeted with a smile and the food, no matter what you order, is wonderful. Their lentil soup is great. Dolmas are never ever soggy. Great place to bring the family"}
{"text":"Love this place. They hook it up with the gyros. One will fill you up. Friendly staff and good value. Best Greek style food in the area!"}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food in the Metro Phoenix area! Their rice is unbelievable! Our orders are always spot on, and the restaurant is very clean and well-maintained. The owners, Bill and sons, are very customer service oriented and always take time to chat. They remember and acknowledge their regulars, which means a lot these days.  Even if I did not live in the area, I would travel here for the food, ambience and experience."}
{"text":"Like this place as an alternative to pizza and the other quick fix items at 67th Ave and Happy Valley.  Picked up to-go food here several times....  Last visit was on a Friday evening.  Ordered the $10.00 gyro plate versus the $4.99 single gyro.  Ordered the wife a Philly steak  They lost my order, argued amongst the workers....I came close to asking for a refund.  Waited patiently for 25 minutes.  My $10 plate was one pita and the same amount of gyro meat as the $4.99.  Had to have the Philly remade as it was cold.  Been back many times since the issue above.  Been spot on since then."}
{"text":"It's my first time here . Something I've been wanting to try fue the location and amount of great reviews ! All I have to say is DELICIOUS ! the service was excellent, friendly and welcoming . Will defiantly be returning !"}
{"text":"The gyro combo is amazing and very affordable. I've had Mediterranean food all over the valley and this one ranks #1. Very nice appearance inside with a friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"We are originally from Detroit, so we had a lot of exposure to excellent middle eastern food.  We have been searching for a place in  Metro Phoenix that would approach this level, and we have found it at last.  This simple unpretentious place serves authentic fresh dishes that are delicious and memorable.  Ammos will definitely go on our heavy rotation list of go-to restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for our family.  Food is always good and affordable....and staff are always friendly!"}
{"text":"This little father/son owned business serves tasty and reasonably priced food. The chicken shawarma was delicious. The best item on the menu? The pistachio baklava! Light, nutty, not super sweet or fatty. My husband said it was \"the best baklava he's ever eaten!\""}
{"text":"I have eaten here more than a dozen times and never been disappointed.  My go-to dish is their lentil soup which hits the spot even on a hot day, but anything in a pita is always terrific.  I love it that the owner is serving there on most days and takes obvious pride in the food he serves."}
{"text":"The service is not good eating is not good and we asked baklava was old is not fresh and had to pay the bill in cash, and the last time I go"}
{"text":"Delicious! Beef Shwarma Pita. Already planning my return! It's tri-tip steak marinated and grilled. Truly delicious."}
{"text":"I'd give this restaurant ten stars if I could! My husband and I have lived in the area over six years now and just found this gem tonight. Thank you Yelp!  The food is absolutely delicious and even better is the fact this is a family owned business. Bill was incredibly nice to my husband. We have officially become regulars."}
{"text":"We have only done takeout, so I have a limited review. The gryo meal is fabulous and affordable. I would love to dine in sometime to try their spanakopita and other items."}
{"text":"Very authentic Greek cuisine. Do get the chicken shawarma with a side salad. Very fresh! The owner was very nice and kept checking up on us. The portions are plenty. You will leave there stuffed. Expect to pay about 20-25 for two people. So worth it. Affordable eats that taste food. I love how personable this place is. They accept cash and credit. It is located right next to Walmart."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a fast, tasty and plentiful Mediterranean dish. Love the fresh ingredients and sizable portions! Thanks Ammos!"}
{"text":"We've lived across the street for years but never tried this place before. We were missing out!   Came here for two lunches and tried the Gyro combo (gyro, fries, drink) and the Gyro plates (regular and chicken). We have also feasted on the baklava. I think the Gyro plate is a better deal, though a little more expensive as it comes with a salad and rice. That, and I like making my own little gyros with the pita. However both the Gyro combo and plate are massive amounts of food and both are delicious. The baklava is also delicious!  On both visits the staff were very helpful and service was super quick. This place is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food fantastic got the Steak Shawarma Plate came with side salad. By far the best tasting salad I have had. Clean environment and friendly staff. Prices are great for the type of food and quantity."}
{"text":"Great plates and delicious gyros, the meat Is always tender and delicious. I love their chicken shwarma and beef kabobs"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. Not much else needs to be said. Local favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"I am half Greek and this is the best local Greek restaurant by far! Their rice is absolutely to die for and their tzatziki is top notch! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"By far one of the better places in the 67th and happy valley corridor to get a gyro. Not greasy at all and the pita is nice and fresh.   The owner is very friendly and so is the rest of the staff . Makes for a good lunch stop around here."}
{"text":"Great  food. They always give you lots of gyro meat if that is what you pick. Pretty gast service. I do wish they offered veggies with their hummus and not just pita bread for us low carbers. My kids always love the different choices of Americanized kids meals."}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars due to decent hummus, good fries and my hubby enjoyed his meal.  Also, the restaurant and the bathrooms were very clean.    Whenever you watch a cooking competition show, one of the big things they talk about during judging is consistency.  Well, that's where they have a problem.  Hubby and I both ordered the same thing...#1 Gyros combo with Greek fries.  If you've read my other reviews of Greek/Mediterranean restaurants, I always order a gyro on my first visit.  Anyway, I got mine first...it was cool to the touch and my pita was hard & crunchy along the edges.  Hubby's came a few minutes later and was warm with a soft, fresh pita.  Also, I received the Greek fries, but hubby's had regular (he had ordered the same as me).    It wasn't bad, but the gyro meat wasn't great, either.  Hubby said he saw the spit in the back where they were cutting the gyro off, but my meat was definitely not freshly shaved off, it seemed like it had been sitting in a pan for a while.  And, the tzatziki sauce was overly seasoned with dill, you couldn't taste the cucumber flavor that's so refreshing in a good sauce.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Oh well, our search continues.  So far, we've only found one Greek restaurant in the West Valley that makes the perfect gyro...and, we'll continue to go there for our gyro fix.  But, we're still looking for another one."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty but I hate it when people order after I do but they are served first.  Just a pet peeve of mine.  Other than that food was good and restaurant was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Philly Cheese in Phoenix North Valley - who knew!!! The Greek menu AND food is always amazing. The best. Love the crispy fries!!!"}
{"text":"Needed to kill an hour, read the other reviews and decided to give this place a go.  Excellent decision (thanks, fellow Yelpers). I had the chicken pita meal and it was just perfect.  The meat was tender and juicy, the tzatziki sauce was just enough, and the tomatoes and onions were fresh.  Will definitely hit this place up more frequently.  Prices are great, too.  Try it out!!"}
{"text":"The best Greek food in town. My teenagers, picky eaters as they are, love the food here. Chicken shawarma (#4) is the favorite but the kebab is good also. The lentil soup is awesome and we always finish with baklava!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a coupla times and these guys have also been respectful and attentive. I especially like their salads since the reason I come to AZ is for training and this place keeps me in the good on my vegetables. The 15 & 17 have been my favorites."}
{"text":"Why haven't I known that people make pistachio baklava until now?!?!  I go to a ton of Mediterranean joints around the valley and this is the first time a place has ever had options when it comes to baklava (my favorite treat).   I had the beef kefta combo and it was 10/10 for the price.   Clean place, nice staff, would recommend."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to grab a quick meal, but lately they have become the worst. I order from them frequently and more than once my order has been wrong. I order a lot of times either on the phone or on Uber eats. This last time i ordered on Uber eats and I can see exactly what I ordered. When I called the manager to speak to him about my order being wrong he denied it and said I was wrong and that they did everything like it was listed. I told him I was looking at my Uber eats screen and I see the right order on there. I understand that we are all human and can make mistakes. Instead of apologizing for the incident he goes ahead and tells me that he does over 180 orders a day and never once gets orders wrong and that maybe I shouldn't order from them anymore. Well you know what sir... that was my last order with you. I was a loyal customer and spent quite a bit of money there and to be spoken to like that, I'm sorry but you don't deserve my business. And reading others reviews on here.... you have gotten other people's orders wrong as well,  so maybe get off your high horse and start acting like a true manager/owner and making sure your customer is happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today found it to be very good (had a gyro ) priced right and very friendly staff I will be going back"}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros in the valley! I hear from my son the beef sandwiches are great to!"}
{"text":"Ummm how have I not had this place before??? Located next to Wal-Mart on 67th Ave and Happy Valley, this place is DELICIOUS. A friend and I ordered meals to go and between the two of us we had the classic gyro, beef schwarma, chicken schwarma, rice, greek salad, and pitas with tzatziki sauce. Everything was delicious. The tzatziki sauce was tasty and had a good consistency, not too runny or thick, and it went perfectly with the pitas and meat! I definitely want to go back and try some of their other meats and entree options. I did not spend too much time inside the restaurant itself but everything looked clean and it definitely had a great ambiance. I cannot wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been to. Their gyros is top notch along with everything else! Super friendly staff and super clean place!"}
{"text":"Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob.. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well. Stick to a gyro, had that last time and it was golden. Seems like good people, they are nice."}
{"text":"Being middle eastern myself,  I tend to be pretty picky about greek/middle eastern food. That being said, I think this is the best \"mom and pop\" greek restaurant in Phoenix.  It's got great portions and a wide variety of ways they cook the meat. The combo plates (side salad, rice,  1 pita, and 2 skewers of meet/or a ton of gyros) is the best deal, ($9-$12 depending on the meat.) Even the Italian beef, fish and chips,  and burgers are great. The only food I am not a fan of here is their cilatro lime hummus, which I normally love elsewhere.    Definitely stop by, it's inexpensive,  quick and awesomely delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Had the appetizer plate with hummus, baba ganoush, grape leaves and falafel. Everything was perfection. Also had the entree plate with the beef kufta and beef shish kabob and rice. Had a side salad of tabouli and a regular tossed salad with cheese on top. For dessert we had a pastry with a shredded wheat and a nut filling.   Nothing was over cooked or dry.  Will definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here... it seems to be my weekly fix.   I generally get the chicken gyro with rice... but once accidentally ended up with fries (hey, if the nice guy behind the counter thinks I could use some fries, who am I to argue??) and they were really good.   This is the first place I had gone to adventure into Mediterranean Food and like what they had to offer, especially compared to a few other chain restaurants, I am personally excited to come back to Ammos."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Staff is so friendly, gyro is legit. What is great is the Philly cheesesteak! Can't wait to try their other specialties!!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent dinner here. Outstanding little neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall. Be careful. My GPS took me across the street to the Frys shopping center. The restaurant is located next to the Walmart."}
{"text":"Friendliest owner and staff. We love the food and atmosphere. The pitas are so fresh, and the wraps are so flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Greek restaurant in the North Phoenix area.  The food is always excellent as is the service. The portions are also pretty large and enough for lunch the next day. I appreciate that the restaurant is always predictably clean and there is usually one worker constantly wiping tables and cleaning up dishes from the eating area."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and great prices for a meal. The Frys could be a little more crispy but that's just my preference in frys :) Great service, great food, my boyfriend and I always go here"}
{"text":"Love this place! It satisfies my cravings. I go here weekly and get the gyro combo which is only 7.99. The gyro has massive amounts of meat and the fry order is large and it also includes a drink. Definitely worth your time if you like Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"We had the Greek salad and added gyro. Been to a bunch of these places and by far one of my favorites. Great portion size great value"}
{"text":"We've been there several times... the food is always delicious and very affordable.  The staff is helpful and friendly.   So nice to have a good  Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very nice (new) little place. Stuffed grape leaves (vegetarian) and baklava are memorable. Felafel, humus, baba ganoush are all very good. I will return!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to for my husband and I when we need a quick meal.  The guys are always courteous and helpful.  They tend to do special requests, but check your take-out before you go just to make sure they got it right.  The baba ganoush and hummus is authentic and I tend to get that with dolmas and falafel as a meal (it is actually an appetizer).  It is always consistently fresh and delicious.  The place has some fun murals and is clean and bright.  A solid choice for dinner with leftovers."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place several times now and every time I leave I know I'll come back. The food is really good and tastes fresh, and the staff are great! Its worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and you will get treated first class. The owner knows how to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Good was so fresh and delicious. I'm so glad I stopped in here at lunch. Just amazing food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  I'm so full that I can barely text.  Seriously delicious food, and the owner is the neatest guy ever.  I got the combination platter with two meats.  The gyros chicken and beef kafta we perfect.  There was enough rice to start a foreign relief effort, and it was super tasty!  Great food, fantastic people!  What's not to love?  ...oh, I forgot. There's no alcohol.  :o(  I'll have a drink when I get home. ;o)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had the most bland and dry shawarma I've ever had. No sauce or flavor.  I'm not sure I'll give the place another try or not. Service was great and the people nice but not impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Delicious Food and super clean atmosphere! I would recommend this place to any who likes good gyros, salads, kabobs, chicken on the skewer or any other middle eastern/Mediterranean food. The staff is so friendly and helpful and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Ammos for a quick lunch.  This Mediterranean Grill is wonderful. The food was excellent and served in a timely manner.  The Gyro was delicious as was the tabbouleh.  We can't wait to visit again to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast. Reasonable prices for Greek food. It's the only one in this immediate area. Had the supreme entree with chicken kebab, beef kebab, gyro meat. Was great."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with middle eastern food ! Friendly service, wonderful atmosphere . I love everything on the menu . Thank you for a comfortable service ."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I've eaten!!the food is full of flavor and the portions are large.  The hummus, chicken shawarma and Greek salad were all amazing!"}
