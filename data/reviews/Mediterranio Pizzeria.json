{"text":"I go here at least once (usually twice) a week for lunch. The pizza is just plain awesome. The crust is perfect, the sauce is delicious and the cheese is just right. I usually get Plain or White although I have had the Calzones as well and I've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly (and Italian) and the service is always quick. The price is pretty much the same as any other pizza place, so if you're trying to decide where to get your slice on, go here! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only tried the pizza here, but it's not half bad. A nice place to stop in for a quick pizza break if you're shopping in the area."}
{"text":"I have gone here many of times while in the area and i feel that this place has decent slices of pizza!  The cheesesteak pizza is VERY filling and just amazing.  

Go here, get slices of pizza don't get anything else and you'll be happy.   The pie is good, nice italian pie, which i like.   Good for where you are and while you might be out at lunch."}
{"text":"in a strip mall that resembles almost a food court, this place sticks out as a good option for grabbing a cheap bite to eat.  the slices are varied, tasty, and big.  The salad bar is a little sketch, so I avoid it - but the staff is friendly and the place seems clean.  I have tried most of the other options in this parking lot (soup, cheeseburger, mexican, noddle, ice cream, salads - one stop for each one.....) and this is the only place I think about coming back to.

I am a picky bastard with za - this place does za good"}
