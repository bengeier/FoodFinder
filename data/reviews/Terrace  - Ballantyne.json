{"text":"This was a weird dining experience.  The atmosphere is like a casual dining spot but the prices we high for the offerings. My wife and I spent almost $80 on 1 small app, 1 dessert and 2 entrees. No drinks.  Both entrees were wrong as if they ran out of food and were plating dishes on the fly with whatever they had. Nothing we ordered came out correct except the water. 

App:  Deviled eggs - good flavor in the filling but the whites were extremely rubbery. 

Entree 1 : Sea bass topped with crab / veg medley.  The Sea bass was good except it didn't come with anything that it was advertised on the menu. It came with fried mashed potatoes instead of the veggies , no crab meat, and had pesto sauce on it. I actually asked for the menu and pointed to what I thought I was getting. They brought my plate back and there was literally about 1/4 of an oz of crab meat. My wife and I just chuckled. 

Entree 2 : salmon and cheesy mashed. Salmon was great, but came with veggies instead of mashed.  Come to find out they ran out of mashed potatoes and we were stuck wth the veggies.  Who runs out of a main side dish at 6:30p?! 

Dessert: PB brownie cheesecake. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND CALORIES! Huge piece but bland and tasted kinda stale. Was also supposed to be topped with Pb cups. It wasn't. By this time we were fed up and just asked for the check.   We have NEVER not finished a dessert. We took it home and even the kids thought it was bad. 

Service: average at best. Everyone had super awkward personalities and it was painful to have a conversation. Our waitress seemed to be frustrated with everything. She would ask us how we are doing and then walk away while we were answering. We waited for silverware on 2 different occasions.   

To top it off the UPS driver wheels in 10 giant boxes right beside our table to unload in the kitchen.  

Like I said, it was a strange experience."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My family and I moved here from Houston. We always enjoyed going to cafe and small places like this that serves yummy breakfast, one of the best omelets ever, YMCA omelet! :) Lunch is also pretty yummy. We need to come for dinner one day."}
{"text":"Just okay, not worth a return trip. Service was good, the outdoor seating area is great, but the good is lackluster."}
{"text":"Saw the 4 stars thought we would try.....bad choice....waiter very slow...
food cold...high price for food quality....I would not recommend...tables dirty...."}
{"text":"We went to the South Park location when they first opened and wondered how this location would compare. Hands down, Terrace Cafe is the BEST breakfast place in Charlotte! The food is reasonably priced and FRESH! The first time we came we couldn't make our minds up on what to get so we ordered basically a side of everything! Eggs Benedict, pancakes, fresh fruit, biscuits and gravy.... 

Cannot comment on how lunch/dinner is yet - however, I'd have to assume it is 5 star quality too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Surprised and disappointed to see that they now charge a service fee to patrons who pay with credit cards. This is only posted on one tiny card at the front. Should have turned around and walked out, but instead, because I was with a couple of friends, decided to stay. The food quality has declined, the service was mediocre at best, and they are even chintzy with the paper towels in the restrooms. In the very competitive restaurant market in Charlotte, Terrace should be bending over backwards to provide excellent customer service. My friends and I won't go back. Get with the times, Ralph Meranto, Director of Operations!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I enjoy every time I am in the area and have never been let down. Two eggs, two homemade sausage patties, hash browns and biscuit for 6.95."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food quality steadily declining, long waits for food, just unbelievable poor experience.

Me and my family have been coming to Terrace Cafe for years now, back when they use to server crafted coffees like Burnt Banana Latte and the food servings were full sizes and quality was outstanding.

Sounds like a distant time based on the service and quality we saw today. We sit down and order our kids food immediately and drinks to try and get the kids eat. After 25 minutes we had to complain to a manager to finally get our drinks, after 45 minutes we finally received our kids meals. 

We have officially hit the point that we will no longer come back to Terrace Cafe!"}
{"text":"This was a nicely decorated restaurant,  staff was exceptionally nice and attentive.  I had red velvet waffles and chicken and it was a great portion and very delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent options for breakfast, lunch or dinner. To some it may seem a bit pricey but I don't mind paying a little more for  food with an emphasis on fresh ingredients.  My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times and we always come away impressed. We love the Fat Tire mussels, Ahi tuna salad, Terrace fried chicken and perhaps my favorite is the San Francisco chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Figured I'd try this place out while taking a vaca day from work during the week. I assume it can get pretty busy on weekends. The hash browns are to die for!  They could be a meal in itself. The red velvet waffle was amazing of course. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is everything I like in a brunch spot. Quick service, Interesting and unique food that tastes delicious. I had the salmon frittata with pepper jack cheese and guacamole served with a side of salmon fritters and fried green tomatoes. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star review is that one of the diner's at our table was served cold sausage. The server immediately remedied that and we were on to a fantastic brunch!"}
{"text":"My wife & I were in Ballantyne for five days, we were staying at the aLoft who recommended the Terrace Cafe our first night.  The dinner & service was so great that we went back an additional 4 times.  We enjoyed a breakfast, a couple lunches and a final dinner, all were lived up to the first night.  Some of the best freshest food I have had in a long time.  Thanks Terrace Cafe"}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and dinner and it never disappoints. The quiche of the day and the hummus appetizer are my two favorites"}
{"text":"Lemon Poppy Seed French toast! Need I say more? This is definitely a new favorite. Like most I normally come for the Red Velvet Waffle but I highly recommend you give the French toast a try, you won't be disappointed ;)"}
{"text":"The friendly people at terrace Ballantyne make it a great place to grab a drink or dinner. I enjoy the salmon with the melted tomato sauce always cooked perfectly. Johnny our server has been there for years and always remembers what you like.

{"text":"Shrimp and grits were amazing!! Atmosphere was really nice as well. Service could have been better, only saw our waitress a total of 2 times had to chase her down to get the check."}
{"text":"Great menu!  Located in Ballantyne Village.  One of the best lunch's I've had in a long time!!  If you are in the area check them out!   Terrace café reminded me of some great places to eat in Asheville."}
{"text":"I tried this place out with a friend because I heard they had AWESOME red velvet waffles! unfortunately we came to late for the waffles BUT we tried other menu items such as there fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese , chicken loli-pops , and chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries EVERYTHING WAS PHENOMENAL! the whole time I was eating I was thinking I cant wait to yelp about this food! Im already making plans to try this restaurant again in the very near future! take it from me try this place out you wont be disappointed =)"}
{"text":"Holy cow. I had the chicken and waffles, it couldn't have been better. Each would be perfect in their own right, together they were fantastic. My wife had the SEC Biscuit and she loved it too. The service was very good and fast. They sat us immediately at 12:30 on a Sunday. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on July 4 for breakfast, since it is so close to where we live and got great reviews. The hostess was excellent and seated us quickly. We then sat for 15 minutes with open menus, watching wait staff serving people all around us who came in after us. We decided we'd had enough and left. The hostess was mortified and, to her credit, offered to intervene. We declined but thanked her for her efforts. With respect to service, there is either a management or training problem in this place-haven't figured out which. Since it's been open for more than one year, it can't be a start-up issue. We've been in restaurants far bigger and more crowded than this with better service."}
{"text":"Love red velvet waffles and eggs Benedict. They have wonderful sweet tea. They can get a little hectic for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very interested in dining here for breakfast as it's close to the house, the menu looked good, and we wanted to try something different from Another Broken Egg Cafe. 

We attempted to dine in on father's day. We waited about 5 minutes before finding a spot at the bar and everything was fine. Ordered with no problem. Water refills never happened. But that's something I can look over as I understand it's a restaurant holiday. 

What I can't accept is what happened when we got our food. I ordered the Turkey Omelette.  The food runner presented me with the Veggie Omelette.  My boyfriend quickly pointed out to me that it was wrong. Ok things happen. I advised him that I ordered something different. He quickly apologized. I watched him talk to the server, who told him no that it was the Turkey Omelette.  I took his word for it (the servers should know this food better than me...right??) but as I cut into the omelette there was no meat let alone turkey... I even had my boyfriend check it.  

I'm not one to complain. I would have loved to have just had it recooked properly.  I pushed my plate to the side. And waited for ten minutes....no one checked on us but I made eye contact with EVERY barista/server/bartender in the area (at least 3 people returned the eye contact, even the bartender who was taking care of us). As a server in the industry this is UNACCEPTABLE. No one seemed to care or find it odd that my boyfriend was halfway through his meal and I wasn't eating.  I was done. There's nothing worse than a server who doesn't care and I'd lost my appetite. I finally interrupted my bartender who was too busy to check back on us but kept working in front of us, ignoring my plate. 

Of course the manager took care of everything, which I appreciate. My boyfriend didn't finish his food and we just left. It's just utterly disappointing because it could have been easily resolved when I told the food runner it was wrong.....and maybe if someone would have done a 2 minute check back to make sure everything was fine (an industry standard) we would have stayed. 

Not interested in going back. I can find good food anywhere. Lack of service was a turn off even for a holiday."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had an omelette and a cinnamon bun latte which I HIGHLY recommend. It was DELICIOUS. They should bring back the S'mores French Toast though!! :'("}
{"text":"The food is normal nothing splendid that you can not get anywhere else. The wait for seating and food is just not worth it.
I'm not going back.
FYI they don't take  reservations."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great coffees and soups.  I could go here every day.  It's not cheap but totally worth it.  The chicken and red velvet waffles are inspired and they put a huge piece of bacon in their Bloody Mary's (perfect for hangovers)."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. My husband and I keep trying to, as you have the potential to be our best breakfast restaurant in the area for sure with great food and decent coffee (why is it so many \"breakfast\" places in Charlotte have such a terrible, cheap coffee selection?). Unfortunately, what's holding you back from actually being great is a complete lack of consistency and very poorly trained team members.

As a restaurant, service is key and proper training is essential. This includes guest interaction, accountability, efficiency, knowledge of the products, and attention to detail. We have experienced things such as empty water or coffee cups for 10+ minutes until we can flag someone down (in which case it may take another 10 minutes for them to reappear for the refill), a server saying \"slow down I can't write that fast\" in response to a guest's order, saying \"I don't know\" in response to a question, never proactively checking on the table, claiming you don't have any specialty coffee drinks (which are located on the back page of the menu), saying the green leaf symbol next to menu items means they're gluten free (so this would include the bovarian cream French toast and crab cakes?), and going a good 20 minutes without even seeing our server.   

As for consistency, here are some examples:
1. Pricing list for coffee drinks on the digital sign next to the bar do not match what is printed in the menus
2. Number of bacon pieces you get for the $4 side option (3 definitely seems like too few)
3. Hash browns served with or without ketchup
4. Burnt underside of pancakes
5. Different answers to menu questions depending on who you ask
6. Bacon just barely cooked, chewy, or extra crispy (no matter what you requested)
7. Burnt coffee or grounds in the bottom of the cup
8. Inconsistent sanitation scores, ranging from the shocking B in December to finally going back up to 98 later in the winter and now back to a 95. There is no excuse for any food establishment to ever fall below a 93, while we prefer a 96 or higher as it shows the care that the restaurant puts into their quality and food safety.

Lastly, I have a few questions:

1. What does the green leaf symbol actually mean, as there is no key on the menu
2. Why is it that you can't swap out the plain pancakes on the full breakfast for flavored pancakes, but it's perfectly fine to swap them out for a red velvet waffle? (Or was this server's answer another training issue?)
3. Do you have an official training guide or standard operating procedures for the front of house team members to make sure they are fully trained and confident before working on their own?
4. Do you not hire any bussers? We always see the servers having to clear their own tables, sometimes with assistance from a hostess, which is not good. This can be a sanitation issue while it reduces time management and takes away their attention from their existing guests at other tables.

If the above items are addressed to greatly improve the service and consistency, then Terrace will truly be a great establishment. Until then, this morning was such a drawn-out disappointing experience that we will likely be taking another break from eating here for a while. 

If you would like some inspiration from the best (and most consistent) breakfast chain we have ever visited in our travels around the country, look up \"Snooze: an AM Eatery\". They are affordable, coffee drinks are on point, and the food is both incredible and fully customizable to the guest's desire. They even do a flight of mini pancakes with their specialty flavors. Charlotte is truly lacking in the breakfast seen as everyone cuts corners somewhere. You have an opportunity to change this trend and join the best in the country."}
{"text":"Always love the food & the service here. If you can, have Brooke serve you ... she'll give you lots to laugh about & she'll take care of your every need!"}
{"text":"This place has a mean Sunday breakfast all day long. Highlights, $5 mimosas s'mores French toast and red velvet pancakes. Biscuits nd gravy are awesome, nice light fluffy biscuits."}
{"text":"Very disappointing visit - have been here several times and this was way way below normal.  Service slow and very spotty - arrived around 3:30 on a Sat afternoon - only handful of people there but took a long time for drinks to arrive.  Were also handed a mini-menu and were told because of \"Restaurant Week\" their menu between lunch and dinner was reduced to only a handful of items normally on menu.  While I heartily approve of Restaurant Week I do not understand the reasoning behind downsizing your regular menu - so we were forced to choose between a few \"bite size\" items.  Mussels were in an unappetizing broth.  Chicken pot pie was tastless.  Chicken drummettes were fatty and overpowered by a gooey unappetizing sauce.  I hope this was just a one time bad experience.  But they need to go back to allowing patrons to order from regular menu regardless of what special events are taking place."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe has been one of my favorites places in Ballantyne for breakfast and lunch.  I always  like to take people there for the first time, up until today.  My Mom, sister (first visit) and I went for lunch today we sat outside.  Two people who came in after us had their drink orders in before the server came to us - not a big deal because we weren't in a hurry.  We finally placed our order and I asked for the breakfast fruit salad without melon, my Mom had a turkey sandwich with onion rings, my sister ordered chicken salad croissant with onion rings.  Our meal arrived 35-45 mins after we placed it.  In the meantime 4 tables who came after us had their meals, paid and left before we received ours.  I asked why it had taken so long and the server told me because I had asked for fruit without melon it took LONGER to prepare.  When the server brought our food (not the waitress) he acted like he was annoyed because he had to bring us our food.  I told him Thank you and he barely mumbled - perhaps he was afraid I was going to say something because of how long it took us to receive our food.  In the past the onion rings have been great, today there was so much batter and looked like a clump of dough which we peeled off.  After this experience I probably won't be going back and will not recommend like I have in the past.  Yesterday I sent them an email explaining the situation and haven't received a response back."}
{"text":"The evening started out with the wrong vibe.  Our reservation was at 7:00 and we were 5 minutes early. There were plenty of empty tables, however, we were shown to a table next to the kitchen with the Reserved sign.  
Cocktails were prepared well and prompt. 
Our waiter told us about the evening specials, they happened to be the two most expensive items on the menu. 
We ordered two starters. Scallops and fried green tomatoes.  The scallops were cooked well. They were moist and flavorful. The fried green tomatoes were  over cooked.  I also ordered a crab bisque soup. The soup was warm with a lump of very cold crab at the bottom of the cup.  
I ordered the Grouper (an evening special) over risotto. The fish was mushy and the risotto was gummy.  My wife ordered the New York Strip (the other evening special). It arrived covered with corn and an glob of mashed sweet potato over half of the meat. The steak was tough. An uneven cut, thin on one side. So it was over cooked on one end.  Our two guests were equally dissatisfied.  I think a special should really be special and not just a expensive menu item. 
Our waiter never once ask how our meal was.  We paid the bill and tipped well. We most likely won't return.  There are too many good choices in Charlotte.
Maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"Turkey omelet was flavorless and cold. It looked like the just threw every on the pan. Very unappetizing looking also. Chi tea was extra sweet. Not a place I would go back to"}
{"text":"Updating my review of 6/26/14 as since have heard from management and they have addressed the problem in a prompt, courteous and professional manner.  We shall continue to dine at the restaurant as there was no issue with the food but with the staff and the way a request was handled.  We look forward to another visit in the near future.  Thank you Stewart."}
{"text":"I was disappointed when a meal previously order had been significantly changed.  It's the breakfast bowl which includes eggs, sausage and other ingredients with has browns.  My mother ordered it based on her last experience with the dish, which was delicious.  They changed it to a spongy square dish compacting all of the ingredients into this spongy square, including the has browns.  It wasn't good.  I should have had them take it back.  Big disappointment.  I'm unsure why these restaurants change popular dishes that people obviously order as a favorite.  Sometimes I think restaurants do what's easy for them with no concern for their patrons.  Ya'll need to revert to the prior receipe.  Also you must do a better job during Sunday brunch.  You know it's going to be busy.  I'll never come back on a Sunday.  I didn't mind when I visited that the wait was over 30 minutes, but when we sat down the waitress, when I asked what was taking so long, said on Sunday expect it to take at least 25 to 30 minutes to get your meal.  Really?"}
{"text":"My experience to Terrance cafe was amazing! The hostess was super friendly. My bartenders Shane and Nigel were extremely helpful with suggestions on wines! The manager Nicole was very attentive and making sure myself and guests were comfortable and satisfied. Definitely a place I will return next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love this place but will not be returning due to the service we recently received from the server (ADAM)
He is very arrogant and down right RUDE. He has the \"ur just the stupid customer so you dont know what your talking about attitude\" 
I will not be belittled by my server. I just had a couple questions. Isnt that what the server is for, to assist. I was bothering him it seems.
Hate to leave the place. Bad representation of the restaurant. 
Ill let everyone i know to specifically ask for anyone other than ADAM!"}
{"text":"After seeing such rad reviews about this area. I am quite thoroughly disappointed. 

We had come on a beautiful sunday afternoon at 1:30pm. Our host has sat us (group of 4 people, including one child) in the wrong section where absolutely no servers inquire us for 20 minutes. For the first time ever in my dining experience, I stood up to ask for the manager whom bleakly apologize, grabbed the closest server who showed mild irritation while taking our orders. The orange juice is really delicious. The decor is wonderful and beautiful. 

However our breakfast came out cold. Chicken and waffles, croque madame, shrimp and grits and a kids entree. The wait was too long. Bland to our taste buds. Our server came by only twice. One to take our order & the second to give us our check. Upon exiting, the nonchalant manager was just sitting by the bar watching the football game. I don't know an experience that can get more flabbergasted than this. I would like to give it a second chance to see what others are raving about but I just don't know from the lack of treatment from this establishment."}
{"text":"Today I walked in and sat at the bar and Laura was behind the bar with a full tray of drinks about to serve another table. She immediately greeted me and asked what I'd like to drink and took my order in the middle of her haste to get other things done. I appreciate great customer service and Laura made my day. She's driven to do whatever it takes to serve others regardless of the load she's carrying."}
{"text":"After seeing their menu on line, I have been salivating for weeks wanting to try the place. Tonight we went.

The ambiance was great, they had live music, I was excited!

We were sitting for at least 10 minutes before a server appeared. We got our water and I ordered a glass of wine. When she returned with our drinks, we placed the order -  which appeared within minutes of us ordering. Completely famished, we were pleasantly surprised. It was all downhill from there...

The plating was good, but that is about it.

My steak was ordered medium, came to the table semi warm. Heated in some parts, cold throughout other. Inconsistent at best. The carrots on the plate appeared raw, dipped in butter, salt and pepper. One bite and I knew they were not steamed or remotely cooked, they were raw. The mac'n'cheese was inconsistently warm as well. At that point it become apparent - the food had been microwaved! Not what I was looking for when coming to a restaurant.

My husbands salmon was okay - just okay - he had a similar issue with the carrots and asparagus. The sauce on my child's chicken BBQ sandwich tasted more like ketchup than barbecue sauce. The only ones that were content with their meal were my other two boys who ordered the fried chicken plate.

The service was mediocre - our server disappeared and reappeared when it was time for the check. I would have loved another glass of wine to wash down the disappointing steak and I think my youngest would have loved another soda. 

The only reason I am rating this place 1 star is because of the ambiance and the fantastic personality of the hostess who seated us. This dinner was not worth the $100 + bill not including the tip."}
{"text":"Dirty filthy bathroom.  Old salad.  Ordered tomato bisque and when they brought the salad they said no more soup.  Weird."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing brunch experience.  The preparation was not unlike something you'd find in a common chain restaurant.  The service was inconsistent, overall, terribly underwhelming."}
{"text":"So much good!  So much...so-so. 

With fellow Eliter, Angie P and another friend, we arrived at 11am for brunch. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but we CLEARLY saw 3 open 4 tops, cleared and ready for seating.  Hmm. In the end, we got seated in about 5 minutes. 

There are some nice details of this Terrace Cafe.  The salt and pepper shakers are stylish bushed stainless and fit together like some kind of Alessi  design, or modern art. The teapots and bright ceramic.  There's a nice tea caddy with nylon mesh bags, not the everyday filters. The water glasses are asymmetrical, as is the flatware. Pretty. 

The special, a lobster benedict.  Oh, but this benny featured TEMPURA shrimp on a buttery and crisp English muffin.  The hollandaise, buttery and just te right viscosity, not lumpy or runny.  (Did I just use the wold viscosity in my review?  How dorky!)  The eggs, poached just right so the yolks were runny and dripped into the muffin.  Served with a few pieces of watercress and mixed greens.  Very, very flavorful and well executed.  For $17, it was worth every penny. 

The fruit salad is worth mentioning as well.  The fruits weren't the average under-ripe cantaloupe and honeydew, but ripe, sweet strawberry, blueberry, pinapple, grapes, kiwi, mango and melons.  

The not-so-good: 

A somewhat indifferent server who was almost smug at times.  We were unsure of what to order and spent about 30 seconds mulling over the menu...and we weren't told \"take your time, I'll be right back\"...and instead, we were stared at!  She was a nanosecond away from rolling her eyes...but thankfully I spied the lobster benny and put in my order. 

Another minor detraction from that 5th star...the lack of communication.  We asked for honey, and it didn't arrive for a few minutes.  Two different managers, within 30 second of each other to ask us if everything was satisfactory.  

Oh, and the water for the tea wasn't all that hot.  Hot enough to steep the leaves, but just barely. 

Overall, the food at this location was stellar.  The Peidmont location is better in service...but I think judging on breakfast/brunch alone, this location in Ballantyne does a more consistent job. 

Fin."}
{"text":"Great place and my favorite for having brunch. I go there once a months Sunday's and it's always packed.
Expect a 20 minute wait on Sunday mornings but it's worth it. 

Service and food is always great. 
Last time I went my friends were running late and I already put us down for a table, after my name got called twice they even had me have a table in the back because my friends didn't show up yet and felt bad for me waiting so long.

Even though it's busy on Sunday mornings nobody is rushing you and they still let you take enough time to make your selections."}
{"text":"the best Ballantine brunch for the money. .fully staffed so food is hot and fast. .eggs benidict perfect"}
{"text":"So the brunch food at terrace cafe for brunch is excellent. I recommend the breakfast casserole if you want something hardy!! Great variety and I haven't had one thing I dislike. Drinks are also top notch! However, the service is sub par at best. We waited a long time after being seated for someone to take our orders and then had to ask for drink refills. Also, keeping me from giving a 4 star review are the dinner food and pricing. Dinner here is a completely different ball game, food was OK but not for the price. Service was a little better at dinner."}
{"text":"I started with a slightly customized house salad - it was MUCH larger than I assumed it would be and fantastic and fresh. Everything was fresh-cut and fresh-shaved (carrots, radishes, etc) and the tomatoes were like eating right from a garden. For an entrée, I had the trout with risotto. It, too, was amazing. I don't eat a lot of heavy/buttery foods, so the broth (actually a very buttery sauce) was a bit rich after a while, but I still ate almost all of it!"}
{"text":"We frequently dine here on Sundays, however this Sunday was the worst experience we have ever had! Service was extremely slow, I watched staff handle food without gloves. Once I mentioned it to staff they began wearing gloves. It took 45mins to receive our meals. Our daughter glass broke while she held it, glass was everywhere. She cut her hand and we had to pick the glass off of her lap...but no one addressed our concerns. No customer service recovery!"}
{"text":"Brooke, Brooke, Brooke the world's greatest!! Excellent food served by a wonderful staff. She suggested the red velvet waffle, I was hesitant but I ate the WHOLE thing. Shrimp & grits better than any I ever had in Georgia or Louisiana. If u desire flavorful food cooked to perfection & a staff w/ smiles, humor and professionalism...TERRACE CAFE"}
{"text":"We had the BEST servers! Brooke and Melissa! They we're super upbeat and really added to our dining experience. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch spot in the Ballantyne area! The food is great, very reasonable prices, excellent service, & delicious lattes! The atmosphere is nice too!! I usually come here for brunch a few times a month & have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"This is a casual, yet stylish, restaurant in Ballantyne Village. Expect a friendly staff and moderately priced entrees. I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes and the Terrace Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite place for breakfast...ever. I saw that someone gave this place a 1 star rating based on the waiter Adam. We had Adam this morning and he was great. Everyone has bad days. I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy, hash browns, and their omelets are second to none."}
{"text":"Kalabunga! Dive right in to this restaurant. Me and the kiddos, Jake and Logan, were wanting to have a nice family dinner to discuss some private business that I won't tell you about so we went to Trance Cafe. My experience there was breathtaking. At first when I saw someone tell me this place had the best chicken and waffles in the world I thought - \"Clickbait, Clickbait for sure.\" So I went there to prove it was  unquestionably Clickbait. When we first got in there was a 10 minute wait but it was fine because I ate at least 20 of there mints. I almost spoiled my appetite. Also they had heaters to provide me with warmth. Those peeps who work they're are nice. They like smile and smile happily and stuff. I got a table for Logan, Jake and I and we decided we wanted to drink something. I ordered a nice Dr. Pepper and Logan ordered Dr.  pepper and Jake ordered a Dr. PepperThe drink came in these nifty cups that were made of glass! We then took our order and I got the good old Chicken and Waffles. When they arrived (after I watched a full episode of Clifford the Big red dog (the one where he fights with the blue dog)) I decided to take a bite of the chicken first. The chicken was hurkullinen which is delicious in Finnish. The waffles were pyszne which is delicious in Polish. I'm so glad I have google translate. Sorry for getting off topic but what happened next was just UNDENIABLY THE GREATEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE! Clifford and the blue dog stop fighting and instead become friends. I wish I could do that with the rat that keeps coming into my house. Everything about the meal was great including the price tag. I forgot what the cost was but I earn enough money being in the Spring olympics. I do the egg hunting event and I earned a pink medal. Anyway I grabbed 25 more mints on the way out and nobody tried to stop me! Sorry for grabbing so many their just exceptionally Jaw Dropping."}
{"text":"Showed up on a late, rainy Sunday morning for brunch.  The seating capacity of this restaurant is very limited during inclement weather, so when they get busy under these conditions, expect a 15-25 minute wait.  Sorry, no reservations are taken for breakfast-brunch.  Had the lamb frittata and my companion the eggs benedict. The frittata is served with a copious amount of lamb and goat cheese, which blew the egg portion of the frittata away.  The lamb was well cooked, but was rather blandly seasoned.  The lamb was cut into many rather thick \"chunks\", rather than thinly sliced which would have been more appropriate. The benedict was above average, but not exceptional.  The eggs and canadian bacon were well prepared, but a rather drab hollandaise sauce held the dish back.  They prepare fresh jam for bread sides which was very good. The service was also very good.  Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant if one is in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"The food quality is good however the price is considerably higher compared to other bistros in the area. I have only been there for breakfast/brunch a few times so this review is only focused on that particular menu offering. 

Was there just this past week, two people (non-alcohol drinks) totaled $38; a veggie omelet is $12.50 plus a side a bacon which ran $4.00 and then add in a $3.00 drink; easy to run up a hefty tab. With tip, we had a simple breakfast for $46 bucks! Not your everyday breakfast place because of cost."}
{"text":"Breakfast and service at the Ballantyne location was fantastic! I definitely plan on returning and making sure I let everyone know about it."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for breakfast, lunch and brunch in the Ballantyne neighborhood.  Service and food are perfect and they are kid friendly."}
{"text":"Went there again today (after 8 months) and the problems I noted before have not been solved. It took 40 minutes to get our food (they weren't crowded). It was lunch. They still do not put any avocado on the Cobb Salad.  They don't offer any bread with the salad. There are too many other choices in this shopping block. Pick something else. There are so many great options. I will most definitely not be back. Twice burned, shame on me."}
{"text":"Delicious! We loved the food,staff and ambiance! Perfect for date night! Their chicken is delicious! In fact,everything we have tried there is amazing! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing! First time customer and the red velvet waffles and chicken is a must try! Fried green tomatoes were a pleasant starter. 

The potatoes (hash browns) and cheese grits were nothing to write home about but ..... the rest of the food overshadowed this flaw.

Oh, they have mouthwash in the bathroom!  So random but cool."}
{"text":"Portion size too small and juice was watered down. Luke warm food. Service was excellent though."}
{"text":"Great service and great breakfast. Love taking the kids there for their birthdays. Makes them feel special and you can actually get semi healthy breakfast there."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with Terrace Café.  I've been here twice and both times have loved what I ordered.  The bacon bloody mary is amazing and definitely recommend getting this with brunch.  The bacon egg cheese on a biscuit is perfect.  It comes with a side salad and a choice of fruit/hash browns or something else (I can't remember which right now).  The fruit medley is fresh and it's full of berries and good fruits not just a hodge-podge of mushy melon like most places give when you get a side of fruit.  The fried green tomatoes are to die for.  They come with a great sauce too.  This place is amazing and everyone should go check it out."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday to avoid the crowds as we had previously tried on a Sunday and it was a 40 minute wait. Service was prompt and friendly- ordered the strawberry French toast with cream cheese drizzle and it was mouth wateringly delicious. Will be back to try more!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars but on 2 occasions we have had ho-hum experiences. But overall, the place is great, we typically go for Sunday brunch. Ask your server or bartender for the spicy bloody mary, sometimes it is on a specials menu, but they will always make it for you if you ask, it is with absolute peppar instead of plain absolut. Yummo! On this most recent visit, just last Sunday, it was a gorgeous warming sunny day after 2 very cold, windy and wet days and when we arrived, we noticed they weren't serving outside on their patio. And there was an hour wait. We were flabbergasted they weren't using the patio and asked the hostess why...she said, \"oh, well, we kinda didn't think it would be as nice as it is, so we didn't set it up\". Wow, we thought...you all don't check the weather? And better yet, why not change at the last moment, when it got to 65 degrees and the sun was shining, get someone out there to set it up! Since the wait was so long we got our bloody mary's from the bar and were actually allowed to sit outside at a bare table and bask in the sunshine before our timer buzzed and we were seated...indoors. Very weird. That said, I usually order the benedict over filet and or the first time, my eggs were not overcooked, they were delightfully runny and perfect (this would be the other ho-hum experience we had when we first started going there, my eggs would almost be hard boiled not poached-on one occasion I actually sent it back and they cut 25% off the check) ! My filets were cooked to perfection as well this round. My teenage daughter had the benedict florentine and loved it as well, but her favorite is usually the red velvet waffle. My fiance had an omelet. All was excellent and the service was good too, and always is on each visit. Terrace Cafe is a great stop for brunch, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle was outstanding. The chicken was fried perfectly and the waffle was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The lattes are alway great."}
{"text":"I can't recommend the food.  My bruschetta was very disappointing -- bread too dry, toppings extremely onion-y, cheese not the right type.  The chicken sandwich wasn't bad itself, but the side of cole slaw was inedible -- one bite only, so bitter.  The prices aren't bad at all, and there's an enjoyable patio -- but the food won't draw me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Deb and I dined here last night. She has a favorite salad, and I was going to try one for the first time. Her salad had steak added, which she has really liked in the past. However, about 25% of the meat was gristle. For an entree salad, mine was curiously tasteless, nothing outstandingly bad, but the grilled chicken had no flavor and the salad was completely monotone and boring. Not well thought out. A very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Disappointing all around. Food was mediocre, overlooked and tasteless. Service was slow. Would not recommend and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't found anything they don't do well.

The service is average.

The food tastes heavenly.

I wish I could marry her as a second wife..."}
{"text":"Our server was very professional, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the outdoor patio which was beautiful. I ordered the Veggie Omelette with fruit and a biscuit, and my mother got sausage and gravy biscuits with hash browns. There are lots of other menu items I'd like to try as well. The omelette was huge as was the biscuit. The vibe is more bistro but the sign doesn't do it justice. It's more elegant than that green and brown tree gives it credit for. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Had an early reservation 5:15 not busy at all.  Our waiter was very good explaining the menu and specials, and he was attentive throughput the meal.  All had Might Corned Beef sandwiches..a big sandwich with very lean corned beef and tasty.  The fried green tomatoes were good, the alligator bites were either a little tough or very tender, the small biscuits and dip, delicious.  As it was early, there were three unmanaged children running around the area..finally it stopped, guess they left.  The place was packed when we left."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place, so I took my mom for brunch and while her food was good, my was disappointing and the service was a joke. We waited 20 minutes for water, and even longer for someone to take our order. I ordered the fried green tomatoes which were blackened rather than fried and the pimento was congealed so that was strike one. I got the red velvet waffles which was  good, but no one bothered to cook or season the hash browns. My mother ordered  oatmeal and a side of bacon, which never came and I had to chase the waiter down for some ketchup to try and choke down the flavorless hash browns. If I bother to try this place again, I'd wait until afternoon when they serve booze - maybe that would improve the experience."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times for breakfast/brunch. Food is consistently good. Sometimes there is a wait on Sunday's, but worth it for the most part."}
{"text":"The servers were very nice except for one large man that didn't seem to have anything to do and continuously walked past the tables whistling. 
We were at Terrace in February and had an absolutely wonderful dinner with appetizers, entreès, desserts, and drinks.  I was able to ask the chef to surprise me and he delivered a lovely meal, cooked to perfection.
I don't know what went so wrong in 3 months but, we were back at Terrace a few days ago and the food was atrocious. We ordered our favorite appetizer, the mushroom crostini, and it was absolutely smothered in a thick dressing of brown vinegar sauce.  The waitress called it, \"glaze.\"  This was not how we first experienced this appetizer and we reordered it without the glaze.  When it arrived, the mushrooms were overcooked to the point that they were dehydrated and crispy.  It still tasted better than it did before and we ate it because we arrived famished from a long day.
Next, our entreès, I ordered the apple and cranberry pork which looked absolutely lovely in the photo that is in the menu.  A delicate, reasonable portion with a lovely golden potato pancake on the side.  What I got were browned chunks of dry pork playing hide and seek beneath way too many apples, craisins, and a chunky sweet sauce that looked like vomit on the plate.  Two large, soggy potato pancakes on the side with sour cream on top and some chives.  Why?  Having dined there before, I know that the presentation and the flavors were better months ago, I was so disappointed in the lack of pride that I saw on my plate.  
My husband ordered the Mushroom Gnocchi with chicken.  He got a plate of gnocchi and each piece of gnocchi had black char Mark's on it and was dry.  Every dumpling.  There were mushrooms- dry, crispy onions-more dry, and grilled chicken-dry.  Not a spot of sauce, creaminess, or hydration anywhere in that dish.  Again, presentation was horrific, why?  
We thought we found a place close to home that served beautiful dishes and had a kitchen that took pride in what they served. Unfortunately, that did not last long and we will not be returning to Terrace. What a shame."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was amazing. The chicken extremely tender and juicy almost melts in your mouth. Their onion rings are by far the best ive ever had. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yummy and delish - many choices and wonderful service"}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited the restaurant on Mother's Day and we enjoyed ourselves. We shared the  Red Velvet Chicken and Waffles w/ fruit and it was amazing. We didn't have to wait for a table and we showed up about 8:20am. The service was decent but the food was amazing as always. We will come back and enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"I wanted to write an update for Terrace Café.  We have not visited them or their other location for the scrumptious breakfast recently, but we decided to visit this location for Charlotte Restaurant week this past Friday.

They are a little more pricey than what we would spend for dinner, but since we love their breakfast we wanted to try the dinner.  We started off with family style bruschetta, which was nicely done and had great flavor.  

Second up was our choice of appetizer.  I chose the salad and Kevin chose the scallops.  He said they were great, but my salad lacked great flavor, a little underwhelming.

Third up was the main course.  Kevin had the ribeye and crab legs with potatoes and brussel sprouts, while I had the chicken with some kind of sauce with potatoes and asparagus.  We thought both were good and we even made leftovers of it the next night - still had great flavor!  The only complaint - the ribeye can't compete with our favorite place to get steaks.

Lastly was dessert.  I knew I was going for my favorite - cheesecake and Kevin went with a Chocolate mousse cake.  My cheesecake was pecan cheesecake and it was some of the best cheesecake!  Great creamy consistency and the pecans added awesome flavor.  The chocolate mousse was good and rich, but it was not going to come close to my cheesecake! :)  I did not ask, but I hope they have that cheesecake all the time, not just for restaurant week.  I would love another slice right now!

Look forward to our next time there - likely breakfast again, but dinner can be a good option there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were driving home from the mall on Sunday when all of a sudden she decided that we needed martinis... I'm not quite sure how we ended up here of all places... This is a place where I've eaten many a delicious and decadent brunch, but never more than a mimosa as far as drinks are concerned...

And yet... this was the place where we ended up...

We sat down at the bar at 2:30pm and ordered two dirty martinis, and were told that they closed at 3pm.  Ok! :)

The martinis were perfect.  Good sized, yummy huge olives, in short.. JUST what we were looking for!  Then we got our checks... they were $5.  We were blown away!

If you're craving a dirty martini early on a Sunday afternoon after shopping, go here!  They're delicious, classic, and cheap... I loved it!  Bravo, Terrace Cafe!"}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy the dinner food, though they were very good at trying to make the situation right. Great service from our waitress Shelby (sp?), and the manager (we didn't get his name) was open to our comments and seemed to really take what we said to heart. Candidly, we won't be going back anytime soon. We were quite disappointed, but perhaps they just had an 'off' night in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Terrace is one of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte. They are ALWAYS busy, but parties of two are generally seated within 20 minutes at peak brunch time on the weekends.

The actual location/decor is nothing of note. The Ballantyne location is in a shopping mall filled with families; lots of action going on. I've never eaten inside. The interior isn't particularly nice and it's relatively loud. The patio is also busy but feels calmer.

Their waitstaff is extraordinarily friendly. They've forgotten a few things in the 4 times I've dined here, but they are always apologetic and come around frequently to refresh water and whatnot.

Now the food: there is a fabulously wide selection for brunch. They have many traditional dishes as well as inventive ones. Their lemon poppyseed French toast is simply divine. Their egg dishes have been mixed but overall good. Any sweet food you order is going to be delicious. I had coffee cake straight out of the over - UNreal. 

As a vegetarian, I am THRILLED that they have \"fake chicken\" AKA seitan on the menu. Their vegan chicken & waffles is fabulous. I recently ordered a skillet that had sausage in it that was happily swapped for the seitan. That means a lot to me, especially in Charlotte.

My only complaint is the price. It's REALLY hard to justify a standard-size, standard-ingredient skillet being $16. 16!! It was a special, but as I said, none of the ingredients were particularly rare or unique. But, I like the food, so I pay for it. But be aware before going that this is not a cheap brunch venue."}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle and fried green tomatoes were just OK for me. I was expecting my tastebuds to dance for joy based off the reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but not out of this world good. If you order the waffles make sure you taste it without syrup first, because the cream cheese frosting is already sweet. Save your calories for the shrimp & grits and ask for their homemade hot sauce for an extra kick. 

Scott was our server for brunch and he was friendly, attentive, and quick. Great experience overall and with a variety of food on the menu, this is a great spot for brunch with a large or small group."}
{"text":"Just wonderful on every level! Atmosphere, ambiance, decor, staff, and the chow of course.

My wife and I have had breakfast and dinner at the Terrace Cafe. Everything was gourmet level cuisine. For instance the hash browns were perfectly crisp and non greasy. This is a tough side dish to get correct. Best I've ever eaten. The highly creative ravioli was a pure delight. Stuffed with a pumpkin puree it was unique and perfectly cooked. All the other items we have sampled there were terrific also.

Awesome overall restaurant!"}
{"text":"The lemon poppyseed French toast, one of the daily specials, was amazing - even if there was no resemblance to French toast. It was three thick slabs of very good lemon poppyseed bread that had been grilled and slightly crisped on the edges and then drizzled with a lemon sweet sauce and berries on the side. Get this... It's great. But overpoweringly sweet and carb-y, so I also got eggs and toast and a side of fried green tomatoes. 

The fried green tomatoes were perfectly done, with a crispy nice exterior and a firm tart green tomato interior.  The aoli sauce that comes on the side is necessary but also really good. 

I asked for eggs to be over easy, stressing that I needed the white to be completely cooked and I preferred the yellow to be runny. Unfortunately the white, while cooked on the outside edge, was still very much raw. Sourdough toast is great and served with a side of strawberry preserves that were also not too sweet but perfect. 

The generic breakfast platter comes with eggs meat potatoes and toast/pancakes. This platter was all very average and nothing that couldn't easily be accomplished at home for far less money. 

If I come here again, I will stick with one of the sweet specialties like the poppyseed French bread and simply order a side of eggs ($2.5) or fried green tomatoes ($3)."}
{"text":"There is nothing I didn't like about this place. As soon as we walked in the door you were met with a nice welcome. Since this was our first time the waitress helped us with our menu choices. My daughter and I both got the same thing, cinnamon swirl pancakes, hash browns, eggs and chicken and apple sausages. My other daughter had the Apple French Toast and the same sides. Let me tell you, this breakfast was nothing short of excellent! I use to brag about Famous Toastery and Another Broken Egg being one the top rated for breakfast and brunch on my list, well not anymore!  At Terrace you not only get a good atmosphere, you get your money's worth. You may leave heavy, but you won't leave hungry! I'm looking forward to trying the chicken and waffles the next time I visit and it will be in the near future. If you're looking for something different from the norm come and try out Terrace, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've heard of a lot of restaurants lately and tried some of them.  This is the first that has lived up to it's hype.  Wow!  Eggs benedict was amazing as were the velvet waffles!  Their own take on a Mimosa is amazing as well.  

I highly recommend this place, I went on a Tuesday around 1pm so I can't vouch for how crowded it can get but I imagine it's super busy during peak times (weekends).  They don't accept reservations except after 5pm, which is a downer for me as I really want to go on Father's day.  I may still, but I know I'll have to wait, maybe a long time, regardless, it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"I would LOVE to give a 4 star rating of Terrace Cafe based on the food, but my review is based on experience as the food and experience with hand and hand for an overall score so I average it out to 2 stars. Management at this location is fully aware of my issues that were experienced while I had several guest in town for my birthday which was totally embarrassing. I will say that management was great in taking the steps to apologize and offering us a return visit on the house (which I declined because my complaint wasn't to obtain FREE anything it was to make the establishment  aware of the people who they employed).
I will write what's GOOD about the restaurant for those using Yelp to see what's good to eat.
- Egg white veggie omelet 
- Cheese grits 
- Red Velvet Waffle
- Chicken Sausage
- French Toast

For those who also want to know about service:
My 1st experience was AMAZING which intrigued me to go back and take all my guest who were visiting me and my family in our new city for my birthday (party of 20) by making reservations and arriving ON TIME with all guest present. We were put in the little room up front which was perfectly fine however we were assigned one server (also okay if they are able to get things right) and when the people began to bring food out they were bringing out incorrect food so we made them aware as nicely as possible and had a server get aggravated with the order (that was put in by a server) and take it out on us by yelling and cursing when children were present which shocked us completely. When we asked for a manager and complained the manager on duty was very short and said something on the lines of \"this is a large party which we really don't take so people are just trying hard and getting a little flustered\" 
HUH??!! I couldn't believe him justifying the disrespect and unprofessionalism which is why I choose to not patronize the restaurant. Maybe we will try the SouthPark location in the future.

My incident happened 2013 but this review was sitting in my drafts and I'm just clicking post. I still haven't tried the other location because the taste in my mouth is still bitter from the situation."}
{"text":"We visited today (Mother's Day) because I had read such great reviews.  I understand that today is a busy day and since we had driven 30 minutes to get to the place, we waited for another 90+ to be seated.  We then waited 20 minutes for our server to arrive and another 45 for our food to arrive.  My wife and I had steak and eggs and it was nothing to right home about.  My 11 year old daughter had french toast and had to use a steak knife to cut it.  This food was not worth waiting for.  For this food, you should not have to wait at all.  My family travels quite a bit and trust YELP to steer us to great places to eat, but it appears that the people reviewing this restaurant need to expand their horizons if they believe this food to be high caliber.  I have had better tasting food at Waffle House and much more reasonably priced.  I am taking into account that today was Mother's Day but I don't see the food tasting better on a different day."}
{"text":"We visited yesterday for breakfast and got there soon after they opened.  It took for ever to be greeted by our waitress. The service continued to be sluggish throughout our entire meal.  I follow a pretty strict way of eating for health reasons and asked for a side of spinach with my eggs and was first told no, then they did but charged me $5 for about 10 pieces of spinach.  My husband ordered a side of bacon which didn't show up to our table until after our plates had been cleared.  It was definitely a terrible experience.  Talked to management and they really didn't seem to care.  Too bad, we have been here before and enjoyed it.  Guess we will just stick with Broken Egg cafe from now on."}
{"text":"Oh how I absolutely love Terrace Cafe!! I'm never disappointed at the food or the service. Today I had the Banana pudding French Toast ( Special) and OMG it was the bomb!!!! The perfect sweetness and just yum yum. My mom got the breakfast casserole which I tried and that was also delicious!! Hands down my Favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Menu was okay but my tenderloin came out undercooked.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Excellent!!!! My friends and I celebrated a birthday for brunch. We enjoyed every bit of our food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here just for the red velvet waffle. I had heard so many good things about it and the waffle definitely exceeded my expectations. It was delicious and very sweet! I would for sure order it again!"}
{"text":"I originally fell in love with Terrace Cafe after going to the Southpark location on my lunch hour. So naturally, when I moved to the Ballantyne area I was thrilled that I'd still be within walking distance on the weekends as well! The food is amazing, they serve breakfast through lunch and have come up with some pretty creative breakfast items (my favorite, the berry split, just trust me!). They also serve some healthier items for both breakfast and lunch which are marked on the menu, making it very easy to go here if you are trying to watch what you eat. But don't fear, you really don't lose any flavor with those choices! Despite how great their food is, and the nice ambiance, I couldn't give it a five out of five stars for one pretty big reason. I would not suggest going here outside of peak lunch hours (and brunch hours on the weekends). It seems like they staff the lunch hour with the best of the best servers, but once that small time-frame is over, they bring in some pretty terrible, lazy servers to fill in. Not sure why that is, but it has certainly ruined some late-lunches for me and from what I've heard, some of my friends. Such a shame, but at least you can be confident you'll have a great experience and great food during lunch!"}
{"text":"Most savory brunch I think I have ever had! Not only was my friends dish delicious, but mine was too! We did not have to wait at all for a table. We were greeted immediately and had delightful service! Highly recommend checking this place out if you're near by! Can't wait for their new location in Greenville, SC!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've had very decent breakfast and lunches here, so my wife and I tried dinner, and what a mistake. My wife order shrimp and grits. Her dish was cold and swimming in oil. We sent it back and all they did was microwave it which made the oil look worse (I posted a picture).  I ordered the bouillabaisse which was $23. It had 3 shrimp, 2 scallops, a couple of lobster pieces with weak broth and some pasta (hardly a real bouillabaisse). It was very obvious to us that they have no chefs involved with preparing and serving dishes, but they charge prices as if they do. We will never return to Terrace Cafe in Ballantyne (I also posted a picture of the incorrect suggested tip on our bill)."}
{"text":"I love the food at Terrace Cafe. We go every weekend for breakfast. We had one experience that was disappointing but that was an anomaly."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there last night and everything about it was great.  First we were brought some mini-biscuits - and after we'd scarfed them down, our server brought us more.  We both ordered the scallop entrée ($23/each), which had several scallops in lobster risotto - and it came with a salad of bibb lettuce with an orange vinaigrette dressing.  *Really* delicious!  We couldn't resist ordering dessert, and I had the peanut butter cheesecake & my husband had the cookie cake ($6.50/each).  His was good, but mine was incredibly delicious and the portion was *huge*.

Since the weather was pleasant (meaning, not too warm), we chose to eat outside and it was really delightful (they have a generous amount of outdoor seating, btw).  Also, our server was very pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"If you want brunch and don't mind waiting, this place will make you believe in unicorns and the tooth fairy. Everything is good."}
{"text":"We went for late Sunday brunch and had a great experience. I got the florentine which was delicious. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, just the way I like. My husband had a create your own omelette which was yummy as well. The ambience was great. Our server and other staff members were very pleasant. Will definitely go back to try other things on menu specially their signature dish red velvet waffle."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to grab breakfast at our go-to. The wait was about 30 minutes because everyone was just getting out of church and looking for something to eat. 

Anyways, I ordered what I usually get and it is the Steak and Eggs. When the waiter brings my my plate the salad was missing. I asked my waitress did they forget or they just don't offer the salad anymore? She told me that the salad has never been included with the steak and eggs. 

I gave Terrace Cafe in Ballantyne three stars because my breakfast was not up to par like it usually is. My favorite hostess wasn't there also, I think it is managed by someone new or they have new cooks. I was very disappointed because Terrace Cafe is my favorite place to grab breakfast. Also, my friends plate had a strand of hair. Eeek!"}
{"text":"We used to go here quite regularly. Once to twice a month. However, they last couple of visit weren't as good. The menu has changed, they no longer have some of our favorites. Maybe we will try one more time but I'm not sure. The staff as always is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch! It's totally worth the wait! We visited on Sunday and everyone got something different and of course I tried everything I would recommend the biscuits and gravy, red velvet waffles and shrimp and grits....needless to say I was not disappointed but whatever you do get a side of crispy bacon...because no brunch is complete without bacon!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Tina is the best server hands down! I love the Carmel Apple French Toast and the Fried Chicken Breast is amazing!"}
{"text":"First visit here... House made sausage was very good! 
Hash browns and eggs were delicious as well. CoffeeBut the best part was the poppy seed French toast! Absolutely wonderful! Would definitely return to try red velvet waffle that looks amazing and comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"I didn't get the full restaurant experience as I attended Terrace Cafe for a rehearsal dinner. We were in the back room with private tables and a private server. However, many of the menu options were the same so I was able to choose from their normal food.

I went with the bourbon mustard glazed salmon, with asparagus and carrots. The salmon itself was very good, and I enjoyed the bourbon mustard glaze. However, there wasn't much substance to the sides. I only got 2 spears of asparagus and 3 mini carrots, and they were loaded with oil. I had to rub the oil off with my napkin they were so slippery. I was disappointed in the portion sizes for sure, and they didn't offer a starch with the salmon, so it wasn't a filling meal.

My husband had the ribeye, which had so much more to offer at the same price point as the salmon (~$19.00), which I thought was interesting. His steak came with fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts with bacon and maple glaze. The brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS. I had a few bites of his steak and really enjoyed it. It seems his dish was the winner in getting more for your value. 

The cocktail list was pretty basic. It was disappointing that they don't have more artisinal or unique cocktail options."}
{"text":"If you like spicy, go for breakfast or lunch and grab the spicy chicken biscuit.  It's fried chicken breast, smoked ghost pepper pimento cheese and a jalapeño jam.  Just get it.  You'll be happy you did.  

As for service: the staff is always very attentive and friendly.  Special shout out to Emanuel.  Went for breakfast Sunday and he was great.  Best service I've had maybe anywhere.  I wrote a letter to management saying \"it felt more like we were having breakfast at a friend's house\".  Makes the experience so much better when the server is so welcoming."}
{"text":"No place \"brunches\" like this place. The Benedict's are divine. The icing on the cake here is having Brooke's outstanding service. She's sharp, friendly, and accommodating. All we could ask for and more for brunch!"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous with the name, cafe sound small and limited. The place was great, good beer and good food."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the chicken and waffles! 

I've been here a few times now, and the first time I got the biscuits and gravy. Good, not great. After that I decided to get the chicken and waffles. They are amazing! I'm not a chicken and waffle connoisseur, but I do appreciate boneless crispy fried chicken and a good waffle. Together, they are awesome. You also get a choice of fruit, hashbrowns, or grits. I always get the hashbrowns, and then never eat them, you really don't need them. 

On Sundays they offer a $5 mimosa, and bloody marry special after 12. The mimosas are very good, not too much juice and a good choice of champagne. 

The wait staff is always really nice and the hostesses try their best to get you seated as quickly as possible. 

They do not take reservations for breakfast, only for dinner (but really truly go for breakfast) so there is most of the time a wait before noon (between 15-30 minutes depending on the size of your group). 

Great spot for brunch, I try to get everyone there at least once!"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch twice and everyone in our group loved everything they ordered. Some of the highlights of what our group ordered were the red velvet waffle, banana nut french toast and their spicy bloody mary.

Consistently good food, good wait staff. Deserving 5 stars.

Recommend reserving ahead of time to skip the wait."}
{"text":"Didn't want hotel food so Yelp lead me here. 

Everyone says get the chicken and waffles. So I did but added red velvet with fruit. 

Boy it didn't disappoint. Waffle was cooked perfectly crispy on the out and moist in the middle. The fried chicken was seasoned just right and that the syrup made even more savory and sweet and yummy. 

The fruit was good. The standard blend with added raspberries and boysenberry. 

The staff was amazing super friendly and help me put my plate together which is really sweet. 

I would definitely come back and bring my friends is a good place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Ahead breakfast here after a 14 mile run this am. Got right in and sat at a 2-top pub table in the bar area.  Finally took the plunge an ordered the shrimp and grits. Amazing! Best breakfast ever! Service was over the top as well. Never less than 1/2 full on coffee and the nicest waiter! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Terrace Cafe location 3 times and arranged a business dinner there last night for a group of 15. For one thing, this place is so much better than the Village Bistro that was there before. Hopefully, this will be the anchor restaurant that Ballantyne Village has been needing. 
The food here is very good and the portions are generous enough that I alway have leftovers. An oyster/spinach salad I had on one visit literally had at least 20 oysters on it. I ate half and took the rest home. On my last visit I had a capuccino and the hummus platter. The hummus was freshly made and the capuccino was delicious. I have not visited the bar here, but they seem to have a good selection.
I also did not attend the business dinner, but received very good reviews from several of the attendees. There is a private room there, but it only holds 12 comfortably.
So glad to finally have a good full service place nearby!"}
{"text":"Jimmy is hands down----a Bloody Mary Master on Sundays!!!!   I thought  I made a great  one, but surrender my flag!!  You are the best of the best!!!   So good to see you today and enjoy!!!!  Terrace is lucky to have you!!!

Miss Jan!!!"}
{"text":"As everyone said the wait on Sunday was about 35-45 minutes. I had the eggs and bacon with hash browns. Eggs were over cooked.  My husband had the breakfast casserole and said it was very good. Food overall was ok to good."}
{"text":"So this was a place recommended by a co-worker to try out, so I did.  The place has a very upscale look and their menu is creative.  I did order the Red Velvet Waffle and, I have to admit, was really good.  The dining experience and the food was overall wonderful.  So why haven't I've gone back since my initial visit, well because they are expensive for a place that specializes in breakfast.  They do accept the local \"Ballantyne Card\" (giving 15% off), but only during the weekday morning hours (I went at lunch).  

If you don't mind spending more and/or want to impress somebody, the Terrace Cafe does the job."}
{"text":"I came back to try the Red Velvet Waffle and chose grits as my side. The cream cheese drizzle is definitely what harmonizes the dish. If you haven't had the chance, free up some time and give this place a try. LOVE TERRACE CAFE!

See delicious photo.. NOW :)"}
{"text":"The food and coffee here was delicious. I ordered the full breakfast which included grits, eggs, turkey bacon and wheat toast. My date had the apple chicken sausage with pancakes and said it was very good. The restaurant was clean and nice and the waitress was very good and helpful also. Try this place out for bkfst and I'm going back to try them for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Moved from Charlotte and came back to visit my favorite restaurant while in town and was completely disappointed on how the service and food have completely declined. They were out of orange juice during breakfast/brunch time and we were given plastic cups for our beverages because there were no available glasses although all of the neighboring tables have glasses. After we ordered we waited almost an 40 min for our food. Order two fried green tomatoes for our table and it came out 7 minutes apart. The server seemed like she was NOT trained in restaurant dinning as she expressed to us (the customers) serval times her frustrations in the challenges of working at Terrace. We should not be told that the additional requested napkins are too far away and will get to it, there are no clean glasses because servers have broken a lot of them and \"I'm just trying y'all\". The food was mediocre and not like it once was. My recommendation to my once beloved restaurant, complete additional training in dinning to all of your staff specifically around customer service during peak time and revamp your chefs' culinary skills. I will not be returning when I'm back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I recently ate at the Terrace Cafe for the first time in a long time and this visit was awesome! 

I took my Mom and we met some other family members for brunch on a Saturday.  We started out with some delicious white sangria and fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were perfectly done and were served with some yummy pimento cheese. Everyone loved the combination!

So mom got the breakfast casserole which is served with grits or fruit. It was a huge portion and she said it was very tasty. I decided to get the chicken & waffles and that was very good as well.

Our server was excellent and everyone left full & happy. We arrived at 1:30 so didn't have to wait long even though we needed a table for 6."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!

On this particular Sunday at 11 AM, I was pleasantly surprised there wasn't a longer wait for a table. I was told by the hostess there would be a 30 minute wait for a table of 3; however, we only waited about 5 minutes. The hostess was really friendly & nice.

This brings me to our waitress...she on the other hand wasn't too friendly & seemed like we were an inconvenience.  Throughout our whole dining experience, she may have refilled my coffee once, but didn't ask us how we were doing.  We did have 2 members of their staff (maybe managers?) come by to ask how we were doing.

On to the food, I had the \"full breakfast\" - which was delicious. The bacon was crisp, scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, hash browns were brown & had just the right amount of crisp to them. The pancakes were very thin, but nonetheless they were still good. 

I like the details of Terrace Cafe. The neat plates & beverage glasses, the cute, retro hot tea kettles (hot water for hot tea), the hot tea caddy, the salt & pepper shakers, & even a calculator in the bill folio."}
{"text":"Dear Terrace Cafe, thank you for making breakfast/brunch a meal much to be envied when not enjoying it every day of my life. I'm a happy customer. Each time I've made it into Terrace for breakfast or lunch, I've been pleased both with the ambiance, service, meal and price. Very hot spot for most weekend brunchers/breakfasters. 

This location can get a bit hairy with parking. Once again, Ballantyne Village has a great parking deck with easy access for all businesses. If the front or lot spaces are all taken, the lot isn't a bad secondary. Also, you'll most likely be waiting for a good bit on the weekends. Take a seat on the sunny benches outside or take a short jaunt around the shopping center. There are plenty of great places to relax while you wait for a table to open up. 

The food is fantastic. Fresh and prepared with care, love, flavor and a hefty amount of tasteful plating. 

Breakfast is great. Eggs are fluffy and fresh (scrambled of course), the waffles are magnificent. I'd recommend the red velvet variety. Coffee is piping hot and refills are free. Doesn't get much better for a morning meal. 

Lunch is also much to be looked forward to. I've had one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches from Terrace. The breading is light and the sauce is balanced between spice, sweet and sour. Bread and veggies are not overwhelming and swallow the whole sandwich. Also, their glasses are such a funky and fun shape. Curved and taper up to the rim. Every kid I've seen in terrace loves them! (So do I....but I'm a kid in an adult's body, you see.)

Grab some of their wonderful chocolate covered mints on the way out. They may frown upon you grabbing a handful, but its hard to resist. 

Love Terrace and visit frequently! Thanks for the solid breakfast and lunch options! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always have had good experience here but not tonight, dinner with group of friends had abysmal service. First waiter forgot our table and second waitress had a poor attitude when asked about very late food. Food was OK but definitely not as good as in the past."}
{"text":"I ordered the banana walnut french toast, they were dry and dense. I would have liked them more if they were a bit more tender. Friend got the shrimp & grits which looked and smelled divine. Came w breaded okra, yum. The flavored coffee was tasty. Service was a little slow. They seem to have a well stocked bar and had great variety on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this restaurant . I frequent this restaurant a lot and this is the first time that I have ever been asked to leave because the waitress wanted to have more tips from the next patrons to be seated. We had breakfast, cashed out the first check with 20% tip, then preceded to order Mimosas on another check as we sat and talked. The waitress then approached the table and asked us to vacate because we were affecting her tips. We had spent $65 in 2 hours and tipped 20% which equalled 13.00 in tips alone. We asked for the manager and asked him if there was a time limit on each table where he said no, we then asked why his waitress felt empowered to ask us to leave. Just so you know we will now eat at the other breakfast spots in the area,
NOT THIS ONE. Just terrible."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was so bad I would never go back. Today is my mom's birthday so I took her to Terrace after reading all the great reviews. I arrived on Sunday morning around 10:30. The unfriendly young lady working the host station had RBF and said it would be a 35-40 minute wait. No big deal, it's Sunday morning I expect a bit of a wait. After waiting a touch over 40 minutes I went to check on how much longer the wait would be and was told I'd be seated next.

After being seated our server came by to take a drink order, we ordered coffee and waters. Coffee came in about 5 minutes, water took about 15. There were only a few sugar packets on the table so I asked our server for more. He never returned with any. I then asked the young lady that filled my coffee for more sugar, she never brought any. Finally about 15 minutes after the original request I asked a young man bussing tables for sugar. He was very nice and brought some right away. Finally had sugar for luke warm coffee. Drank it anyway since so no one ever refilled my cup again. 

Our server took our order after being there about 20 minutes. He was very nice but seemed completely overwhelmed. After ordering we were told that they had a few large parties and pointed all of them out and said the kitchen was behind so to just bare with them. Ok it's a regular Sunday brunch hour, if you can't handle this good luck on Mother's Day in a week. Our server came by a while later to say it might still be a little while and tell us none of his tables had food yet. This was not reassuring. 

Our order came after 35 minutes, not exceptionally long but took a while. Would have been better if I could have had more coffee or water while waiting. Two of the three orders came correctly. I sent mine back. While the kitchen was fixing my order our server came over to apologize and tell me yet again that it might be a little while since the kitchen was still backed up. A woman I'm guessing was a manager or owner also came over to apologize. Food came out and was good. This was the only redemption here, all the food was good. If you get thirsty while you eat though, you're on your own. 

While finishing our meal the same lady came by to tell us our server was new and still learning. I understand this and everyone past the hostess was nice but, it was constant excuses and I'm sorry the entire meal. It also took 10 minutes just for them to run my credit card and get out of there. Honestly terrible service and on the worst day possible. Just do a better job, it's Sunday brunch, you should expect to be busy."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! They have the absolute BEST spicy chicken biscuit and their spicy pimento cheese is to die for! You really can't go wrong with it. The spicy chicken biscuit is my go to but this time I decided to try something new and went for the banana nut bead French toast which is exactly what it sounds like. It's a little more nutty than I expected but still pretty good...just not as good as the spicy chicken biscuit."}
{"text":"I have been coming into this restaurant almost 3 to 4 times a week for the last two years. I work in the area. I have to say there has to be new management because my experience today was awful! They need to train the wait staff. They had terrible service skills! The food as well was undercookI definitely will not be coming back or referring any more business to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This remains the best breakfast place in Charlotte hands down.  We went again today, Mother's Day expecting it to be busy.  We were told that the wait would be an hour but the hostess had a basket of some scrumptious apple fritters (I think that is what they were) to hit the spot while we waited.  Well, rather surprisingly, we only had to wait for about 15 minutes.  Maybe we were lucky or maybe she's not gotten the hang of estimating wait times.  If it's the latter, I hope she figures it out quickly.  

Also of note is the fact that there is indoor and outdoor dining.  Each has is its own list and its own hostess.

Nevertheless, after we were seated the service was fantastic, the atmosphere is beautiful--warm, contemporary, and beautiful--if Pottery Barn were designing a restaurant it would look like this.

What is really incredible is the food.  The beef tenderloin eggs Benedict make me feel like I have gone to heaven every time I have them--steak, hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs, what's not to love.  The s'mores French toast  and the red velvet waffles are also out of this world.  The kids breakfast with pancakes, eggs and sausage or bacon is fun since the pancakes are the shapes of animals.  The pancakes are soft, tender, and fluffy.  

The food and the service are always very special here.  It is equally impressive at dinner. It is always a treat to return."}
{"text":"I see there are mixed reviews on the Terrace Cafe, my experience across a half dozen visits has been pretty uniform. This is a well run mid level restaurants with good food and reasonable prices. You can get a good breakfast or lunch for $10 - $15. Salads are good (fried oyster, cobb) burgers are good and fried onion rings are very good. 
I like this unit better than the one in Piedmont Row, not sure why but I do. It is a good place to take visiting guests as their menu has a wide selection and wait staff has no problem with a high maintenance guest (you know the type: \"is this fresh\", \" can I have that on the side\", \"can I substitute x for y\") all these requests are handled with a smile and fulfilled."}
{"text":"To be honest, I am a little confused about this difference between this spot and Terrace Cafe?  Are they the same establishment or not?  If they ARE the same, why the different names???  

Now that we've got that out of the way....the food here, of course, is exceptional.  I've had the shrimp and grits on multiple occasions and can def recommend.  My go-2s here are the steak and eggs or the chicken and waffle.  Both items are super tasty and very fulfilling.  

The service here, just like at Terrace Cafe is amazing!!  I've never had a need that wasn't taken care of.  The inside is always super clean, neat and well-put together.  Depending on what you get, this place can get a little pricey, but I guess that comes with eating in Ballantyne,  

I definitely plan on coming back, there's no reason not to!"}
{"text":"Dinner at Terrace Restaurant Ballantyne  in South Charlotte.  Top notch Southern cuisine.
Calamari with relish appetizer.
Grilled pork steak with country gravy & mashed potatoes.  Greens \"exceptional\". Pandi knows her greens.
Southern/Cajun shrimp n grits done right.
ALL delicious."}
{"text":"My first visit to the TR-B and my Brides 4th. Stopped by for a late lunch and it was a mixed bag. Our server, Elizabeth, was an absolute hoot! Pleasant, knowledgeable and engaging which made this visit a pleasure. But we came to eat!

My bride likes their angus burger and wasn't disappointed! I ordered the Nashville chicken and ....well mixed reviews. The chicken was crispy, with a great hot sauce but the portion size was very small. If your going to charge $17.00 for an entree it needs to be more than a lunch portion. The sides, including a personal fav, brussels sprouts, weren't available. So they decided to substitute fries. Nothing special.....

My Brides burger and Elizabeth made this a 3 star otherwise 2 at best!"}
{"text":"Some things are excellent and others mediocre. If you go at a non-peak time, like 9am on a Saturday, it's not too busy and they're pretty agreeable to little ones. There's animal shaped pancakes and yummy fruit for the kids (nice plump fresh berries). They used to have smores French toast, which was sort of a miss. They replaced it with the lemon poppyseed French toast which is dry and really just thick slices of lemon poppyseed bread on the plate - nothing French toasty about it. Overall, these creative specialty items never seem to work well, but the tried and true classics are great."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It is a little pricy, but oh so good...When my fiance and I were first moving to Charlotte we visited the original location and we fell in love.  He was a huge fan of the Bacon Bloody Mary and I loved the Red Velvet Waffle.  When this location opened right down the street from our house we were in heaven!  I would love to be able to go more often, but when we do go it is a treat!"}
{"text":"First time I have eaten here, I picked up the Shrimp and Grits. It was a to-go order so feel free to take that into account.

Meal : The meal consisted of grits with a chili served on top. Some peppers, as well as a few onions. I only had about 5 shrimp in the plate. I've never had chili on shrimp and grits, but it was interesting. I was a bit disappointed at the amount of shrimp. Decent sized portion. not super small. ( It was a lunch order )

Taste : I like the mix of chili with the grits, but I must say, I don't think that it is the right direction for shrimp and grits. Maybe as a stand alone dish, but I don't get serving any type of chili with shrimps. I would say strange, but not bad ( I'm a fan of chili so that helped )

Price : Yah, Places in the area are proud of their food. I suppose it's good that people feel free to take liberties , considering there are people around that can afford it, but I think this dish may have been over-priced. I've eaten the shrimp and grits from Tavern, and was just as happy , for less.

Bottom line is I think I would definitely try them again, probably a different dish. I'm not sure if the food on the menu is worth the price, but it is Ballantyne, so it is expected. Not a bad meal by any means, just not over whelmed or anything."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much but an overpriced restaurant.  BUT, it was AWESOME!  Had a salad and salmon entree, fantastic.  A little overpriced, but great quality food, my friend and I both loved our meals!  The service was pretty good too.  I'm sure I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Big portions. I had the Canadian bacon Benedict with hash browns. I couldn't taste the hollandaise sauce at all. The Canadian bacon was a bit too salty for my taste. The hash browns were good. 
We called ahead for 6 people and they sat us pretty quickly and service was good. They were super busy yet, food came out pretty quick. I liked the interesting glasses and silverware- it made the place more unique."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!!  Visiting for the week, and we ate breakfast here twice. Great quality food and really great service. Crab cakes Benedict, banana pecan French toast, and biscuits with sausage gravy were just some of our favorites. We will definitely come back the next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visit the Terrance Cafe, and I have to say I'm very impressed. They have great service, very friendly staff and amazing food. When you walk in the door they greet you with smiles. I was seated very fast, the waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu and suggested the best drink. I will dine here again very soon."}
{"text":"They had the patio closed because it looked like rain, even though it was sunny and great weather. The server was very nice and attentive. The bloody mary had kind of a weird taste almost like it was made with saki. My husband said the chicken sandwich was good, but my $11 spinach salad left much to be desired. The onions were practically raw. When we got our check there was a $3 charge for bacon and a $2 charge for cheese even though the menu said add cheese and bacon to your sandwich for $1. Gladly we caught it and the server took it off. Overall disappointed with our $50 lunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to check out Terrace Cafe for Sunday Brunch. There was a 30 minute wait so we decided to brave the colder weather and sit outside. 

Our waitress came outside to take our drink orders. Everyone got coffee except me, I ordered an OJ. The OJ looked fresh but tasted just okay. Our table was hoping to get a few biscuits but with a price of $2.50/biscuit we opted to start off with an order of Biscuits and Gravy with fruit to split. This was bland and I wish the biscuit was fluffier. For my meal I went with the Canadian Bacon Eggs Benedict with hash browns. My friends ordered the Veggie omelet with fruit, Eggs in a Basket with hash browns and Eggs in a Basket with grits. All of the food really lacked flavor with the exception of the fruit, it is nearly impossible to mess that up. My food was okay, I have had better Eggs Benedict elsewhere. 

To me this experience was 2.5 stars so I rounded up to 3. Unfortunately, the service and food were disappointing. The service was slow and she forgot to bring my friend her ketchup and honey after being asked on 2 separate occasions."}
{"text":"Less special than we were hoping, especially after an exceedingly long Sunday morning wait which seemed to have more to do with short-staffing than with full capacity. Breakfast was okay, though not stellar. Lots of food, but not food I wanted to eat every last bite of. My husband and I each had an omelette; both included lots of ingredients but were cooked a bit too dry. Side dishes were nothing special -- grits were so-so, toast was fine. Latte was competent but not awesome. Service was friendly but disinterested. Maybe our experience explains why a few of the other local spots were even more crowded than this one."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the perfect brunch spot, but only if you are willing to wait. It was about 30 minutes wait, but so worth it. The service was great and our server was knowledgeable, and the manager's were walking around ensuring a great customer experience. The food was hot and came out quickly. Would recommend that if you are in the area and looking for a great brunch and family friendly environment, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Get the red velvet waffle combo. The chicken sausage is yummy but the hash browns are not crispy :("}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place.  Wonderful staff, very comfortable environment and always trying to please.  The only negative is the parking which they have no control over so be prepared to park in the parking deck down the block. No hold barred the best chicken and waffles that I have ever had, and if you really want to go off the hook try the red velvet waffles.  If you want tasty try the chicken lolly pops and the biscuits with the pepper jam.  Just plan to get there early or have reservations.  One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Ok, after my initial visit to Terrace Café in Ballantyne I received a very nice note from the manager/owner of the Southpark location who was concerned about my experience.  I was asked to try them again on them.  Really glad I did.  OMG...everything was so fresh and delicious.  I will definitely be back!  My new favorite brunch spot! :))))   They still haven't changed their closing time on their website though...They close at 2pm on Sunday and are not open all day like the website states."}
{"text":"Great food but not family friendly at all. Families would like to eat here, too. Not sure of an exact count but at least 7 other groups were seated before us with the last one arriving 30 minutes AFTER us. And once we were finally seated, they had 5 other empty tables. And not only that, but they even have the right number of chairs. COMPLETELY HORRIBLE experience before we even got the food."}
{"text":"On a early busy Sunday, I'm truly impressed of how well they handle the crowd. My water never run below half of my glass. Staffs check on regularly. \"The man\" have been here numerous times for lunch and dinner but never here for brunch and he's impressed. He likes his Power Omelet a lot. I optioned for the steak and eggs with fruits and one red velvet waffle. Comon, can't come to Terrance Cafe and NOT have their famous red velvet waffle. Everything is on point. Kami who is our waitress and she's superb. Very attentive and she's good at what she does! 
I truly enjoyed my steak and eggs. Steak was done medium just the way i wanted. Eggs was over easy as requested. And of course,they won't mess up the waffle! All in all, the man is impressed so this will be my brunch spot when I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I've had brunch at Terrace 3 times and the food has been delicious each time. Breakfast casserole, red velvet waffle, and banana French toast. (All yum!) Love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice. Service can be good depending on who you get. Will continue to return!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night around 7:00 PM and the place was pretty empty. No problem getting a booth for four without a reservation. Our server (Arty) was excellent... friendly and efficient. I had a cup of crab bisque as a starter and the Terrace fried chicken for my entree. Both were delicious. Others in our party had the bourbon salmon and liked it a lot. The Terrace Cafe is our \"go to\" place to eat in the Ballentyne area, but my wife would like to see more gluten-free options on the menu. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok...I have been here every month at least once for the last 12 months based on my bank account and the south park location scattered through out the last year haha...there is something fundamentally wrong...I don't know if they are short staffed in the kitchen but literally the wait for food is getting longer, the wait staff is the same and runners are the same so it's not inability on their part. So the only conclusion I can come to is the kitchen. I honestly love this place but 30 minute wait to sit shouldn't be matched with a 30 minute wait for your food. It's an omelette after the brunch rush.  I don't mind waiting to sit but not after we ordered. Looks like south park is our new spot. Sorry ballantyne"}
{"text":"I have officially been here three times now and every time has been yummy!! Chicken and Waffles; Breakfast Casserole; and the Banana nut french toast.. these are the things I have tried here. I have yet to venture outside of the breakfast/brunch bubble but you can better believe I will try dinner sometime soon.

The waitstaff is decent and the ambience/decor is also perfectly fine... my mom and I have been here twice and we both find all the curved glasses and silverware strange but they aren't bad.  I come here because the food is so good!! I've only had one thing here I didn't like and that was a side item. It was the hashbrowns, however my mom likes them so it's probably just me. Their grits are also really good in my opinion and I'm picky about those.  

The chicken is well cooked (not overdone), the breakfast casserole was flavorful, and the banana nut french toast was absolutely sinful!! Oh I've also had a blueberry muffin here and that tasted store bought (so two things I wasn't impressed with). Everything else fully makes up for two random items though, as they are just marvelous!! Next time I'm going to hope for a fabulous quiche of the day!! 

I love that this place is so close to my house, and I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place might be good for breakfast or lunch but the dinner menu is weak and the atmosphere is dissapointing.  there are too many other great restaurants in the area, you are better off going to Big View or any of the restaurants in Stonecrest.  Don't waste your money here for dinner  because it's not worth it.  It was much better when it was Village Bistro, this place doesn't compare."}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch and loved it, so I was excited to return for dinner. Dinner was underwhelming. I had the Savory Mediterranean salad with chicken. The portion was small for charging $18 for a dinner salad. The olive tapenade was really salty and kind of made the arugula soggy which kind of ruined it for me. I felt like I was eating oil. Everything else was up to par, but I likely would only come back for brunch."}
{"text":"I really love this place too bad that the village is kind of ugly for such a nice restaurant like this"}
{"text":"Walking into Terrace Cafe, you automatically get a cute bistro feel in the Ballantyne shopping center. It's right next to a movie theater so it's perfect if you want to grab brunch and day movie with some friends. The parking was a little annoying but worth it once you sit on the terrace on a nice day.  

I got the chicken and waffles - which was surprisingly comparable to one's I've tried at other restaurants. The chicken was very tender on the inside and crisp on the outside.  The waffle wasn't that sweet but it was the perfect addition to the savory chicken.  

My brunch partner had the strawberry pancakes. They weren't really worth getting. Literally pancakes made with some strawberries cooked to the bottom and a few fresh ones on top.  You couldn't taste the fruit cooked into the pancake itself much and there were only a few fresh berries on top. 

It's hard to find places like terrace cafe in this area of South Charlotte, so it's definitely a charm! Great atmosphere, great service, & good food (depending)"}
{"text":"Service was great until I found a spider in my food. The waitress's response was eww while the managers asked us \"where'd that come from\". There was no genuine concern nor compensation given for our inconvenience. I am very displeased with the outcome of our visit."}
{"text":"4.5 actually. After a week of business meetings and travel in CLT area, we stopped by for take out food before flying out early next morning. Outstanding and delicious! We ordered 3 dishes and all were excellent, had not checked YELP prior, so a pleasant surprise, nice."}
{"text":"We arrived at Ballantyne Cafe and told there was a 30 min wait.  We had no problem with this.  Pretty soon 30 min passed, then 40 and then 50.  Meanwhile, we had to ask our server at the bar to check on our food.  He did, and brought us out cold food and didn't even apologize for the extended wait, bad service or offer to get us replacement food.  Ballantyne Cafe used to be a favors place of mine and the service has completely gone downhill.  I will no longer be referring this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"It is never too late to enjoy a nice breakfast! I took my mom out here for her birthday, and we were both impressed! 

I ordered the carrot-cake pancakes, and they tasted like heaven! They were not too sweet so I was still able to enjoy it without feeling like I was eating a dessert. 

The hash browns were cooked to my liking as well! Nice and crispy. 

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town! Husband and I have been 3 times and have never been disappointed by what we have gotten."}
{"text":"Food was just okay however the prices were outrageous. Order a side of fruit and get ready to be in shock, they will charge you $4.00 for what costs them 50 cents. They must think that they are The Plaza or The Waldorf. Spoke to the manager about the price of the fruit and he told us that the portion was 6oz, there were maybe 4-5 small pieces of fruit on a miniature plate. Manager needs to go back to managerial school. If you are looking for a good breakfast on a budget then look elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots. Never a disappointment! Today I got the cinnamon swirl pancakes."}
{"text":"First visit and it didn't disappoint. Food was delicious , quick service and nice atmosphere. We had a small wait time about 10 minutes but not bad for Sunday brunch ."}
{"text":"One of our regular haunts and we find the ever-changing menu refreshing and interesting.  It is a clean, well-run cafe/coffee shop located in the Ballantyne Village at the intersection of Hwy 521 and Ballantyne Commons.

Our most recent lunch experience introduced us to the best onion rings we have had.  They are hand-made, thickly sliced and lightly breaded.  They fry up so nicely, crisp, not greasy and are served as an appetizer or side to a meal.

The biggest comment is that they are not the thick battered grease absorbing variety served so proudly as \"beer-battered.\"  Terrace Cafe onion rings are supreme.

All the plates are nicely presented, portions are adequate, service prompt and you can make substitutions on the menu."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and I'm very happy to announce... I've found my brunch place. Terrace Cafe is the bomb.com and I know I will definitely be back to try some of the other things on their menu. 

I live in Rock Hill but drove to Ballantyne in search of some yummy brunch. I had tried  a couple hole in the wall places near Rock Hill but none were anything to write home about. This place most definitely did not disappoint. It was a Monday morning, so I can't really comment on what the weekend wait is like but we were seated immediately. 

The ambiance was nice; trendy but casual. Good for girlfriends, a brunch date with your significant other or even breakfast with the kids. Service was pretty good. Our server checked in a few times and our food was served in a good amount of time.

I started with a Salted Caramel Latte. YUM. I saw that there was a bacon bloody mary, but I'm going to save that for a Sunday Funday. For the main entree, I ordered biscuits & gravy with hashbrowns and fruit. DAMN. The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. The biscuits tasted fresh and fluffy, while the gravy was definitely homemade and very flavorful. The hashbrowns were a little salty, but I like salty. They were also very crisp. Fruit was fresh a good variety of strawberries, grapes, raspberries - I don't really like that average fruit cup with just melon & pineapple, so I was pleased. The menu also had some very interesting items like Lobster Benedict, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and a Red Velvet Waffle that I would love to try. 

It may be a little premature to say this is the best breakfast in Charlotte but it's definitely a solid standby. If you're looking for a place, this is it."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews and menu I was excited to try this place. The first time was last summer and we sat outside where it was nice and warm. We had great service, but the food was just blah and hardly had any flavor at all. I thought maybe it was just a one time thing but we went again tonight for V-Day dinner and the same thing-VERY blah. We started with the crab cakes which were a little dry and had very little flavor. That worried me because instantly it set the tone for the rest of the night. I had the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly but had zero flavor and the same for the brown gravy and potatoes it came with. Just super blah and a steak at Longhorn has more flavor than this did. My wife had the surf n turf and the portion size was decent but again, very flavorless. I'm not sure what the deal is, but the main issue we keep having here despite trying new items is that the food is bland. For $80+ I expect nicely flavored food, not something I could easily make at home. Our server was also short and snooty and didn't even come to check on our dinner until we were finished, thus she did not receive even a 20% tip."}
{"text":"Wow! What a find this place is! Their food is amazing, coffee delicious. Large portions, everything cooked perfectly. They even play great music (the cure and the smiths-how cool!)
I definitely have a new favorite breakfast place :)"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte I absolutely had to try this place. I've heard so many good reviews about it. 

The restaurant was packed ,therefore I knew it had to be good food. We had a table of six but opted to eat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly. I ordered the red velvet waffle and hash brown. I also ordered a chi tea which was excellent. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte ."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, it was for a Yelp event and I felt the restaurant was five stars. The service was on point and the food good. However upon revisiting the restaurant a few weeks after, I cannot stand but that review. Blended I would say the restaurant is a three star. I say that because on top of the wait, it took us forever to get out food. We sat there for 40 minutes with no food. When the food did come out, the avocado put on the plate for garnish was rotten. Most of our food were like like warm and the service just want present. I might try this place again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I first heard about Terrace Cafe from an online list of top brunch places in Charlotte. And let me tell you it did not disappoint! I have only been twice but both times have been great experiences both with service and food quality. I highly recommend getting the Berry Split as an appetizer for your table prior to your entree; it is a vanilla yogurt parfait with banana, berries, granola and honey & also a generous slice of their sour cream coffee cake that is to die for. During my first visit, I tried the Chicken and Waffles and during my second I tried the Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit. Both were great selections. Their Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle is their top seller and I look forward to going back to try it! Be sure to get their early for brunch or make a reservation."}
{"text":"Went last Sunday for breakfast - waited 15 minutes for a table - once we were seated and placed our order about 45 minutes passed. The waiter was avoiding our table and eye contact. We finally got his attention and he said about 3 - 4 tables were ahead of us yet to be served. We walked out - I asked to see the manager, on our way out - and she said our wait time was normal. I will never go there again to wait an hour for eggs."}
{"text":"Okay folks, I only have two things to say about this highly rated joint... Chicken Waffle! It is indeed as fabulous as the Yelpers say it is! The Waffle was a perfectly prepared golden brown as was its co-star chicken filet, which was lightly battered, tender and delicious. It came with a smattering of stone ground grits that were nothing special; however, it was obvious from the moment my order arrived, that my wife was suffering from what we like to call \"food envy.\"

Her quiche was also tasty and was served with a decent baby greens salad and fresh fruit but unfortunately it paled in comparison with my order. I knew from experience this would only mean one thing: We would be sharing this time around and the next time we would both be ordering chicken waffles.

Service provided by Mel (a young lady) was impeccable and the place appeared clean in spite of its (yikes!) 87 sanitary score, which we, uncharacteristically, did not see until on our way out. We will check that closely before dining there again, which we hope to do. That does however ding my overall score, not so much though, that it will prevent me from labeling it a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"Great brunch place for a group or just two. Love the spiked coffees and mimosa menu. 

I suggest if you go on a Sunday, come early and get the breakfast pie for the table. It's rich and taste like all the best of breakfast foods in one bite. 

Chicken and waffles are okay but I prefer chicken on the bone with my chicken and waffles and not tenders."}
{"text":"First time Patron and it was very good.

My wife normally go out for brunch or lunch on Saturday or Sunday so we chose Stewart Penick's Terrace Cafe for lunch today. I had heard a lot of good things about it and my wife had looked over the menu and it had her seal of approval.

Drove down from Cornelius and got there just before noon. Seated immediately and our server was there shortly and presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders.

Back in couple of minutes with our tea's. My wife ordered the Crab Cake Appetizer along with a side of fruit.  I ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken which also had Cheesy Potatoes and Sauted Mixed Vegetables.

Took a good while for these items to come out particularly in light of the fact that my wife asked for her appetizer to be served at the same time as my entree.

Lunch showed up and it was excellent.  My wife as requested that the hold the Garlic Aioli  which they did but at the same time did not bring the Campaign Vinaigrette.On request, it was promptly presented.

My wife enjoyed her Crab Cakes very much and the fruit side was very good and for a change, more than just melon.

The Nashville Fried Chicken was excellent. Nice and spicy with the proper amount of heat.  The Cheesy Potatoes did not have much taste of Cheese however although the Mixed Vegetables were nice and tender.

First time here. Nice Atmosphere, good service and very good food.

We will be back although probably not for Sunday Brunch till after Football Season. My wife insist on being home by 1:00 pm on Sundays and I've learned not to drive to far on game day."}
{"text":"There are no words I can use to describe my love of this restaurant. I am a huge breakfast food eater and they serve it until 3 pm. The place is always packed for weekend brunch/lunch time so be prepared to wait unless you're willing to sit at the bar. 

That being said, the food and service are always top notch. I have had amazing eggs, sausage, hash browns, and French toast here. I keep meaning to try the red velvet waffles!! They have lots of unique drinks and a good beer selection. They are a little pricey if you're on a budget, but so worth splurging!!"}
{"text":"Having been to both Terrace Cafe locations in Charlotte I know feel qualified to form an opinion of them haha.  So what is that opinion?  Terrace Cafe is a great place for a date or small social get-together with friends. The selections are tasty and there's a pretty wide menu so you don't have to worry about everyone finding something for themselves. Customer service is good too.  No attitudes from waiters/waitresses and they're pretty attentive. The vibe is perfect. Relaxed and very social. 

The red velvet waffle looks amazing and tastes...pretty good. It's soft with a subtle red velvet flavor, but aside from the cream cheese drizzle, everything is muted. The boneless fried chicken breast that comes with it, however, is amazing. Tender, served hot, and packed with flavor! You have to get the waffle with the chicken.  Oh, and get the hash browns instead of the grits for your side. The grits (even with cheese) are pretty shameful. Haha. 

The Ballantyne location seems to have a significantly lower wait time on average than South Park and the food comes out quicker (which also makes sense)

Overall I'd recommend this place without a doubt over other brunch spots in the area and I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Hi Greetings An Blessings. The Atmosphere, Culinary Skills, & Ambience Was Great.!:) The Shrimp & Grits, Red Velvet Waffles & Chicken Was Delicious, Plus The Fried Green Tomatoes Were Awesome.!South Park Site Was Great.;)"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Today was my only visit to this location, I will NOT review the other location!  Food seems almost Identical in both!

Chocolate Chip Pancakes are VERY Good, very close to 4 stars,  finishing touch, Powdered Sugar is sprinkled on top... Butter included, though none needed... Never seen this version, instead of Dropping the Chips into the Pancake right after pouring the Batter on the Grille (how I make mine) they put some chocolate chips on the Pancakes after they came off the grill... Did they forget or is this Terrace Cafe protocol for Chocolate Chip Pancakes???  Still very Good Flavor!

Red Velvet Waffle with Cream Cheese \"Drizzle\" ... Light and Fluffy the way my Girlfriend (Wife) LOVES them!!!  She enjoyed this very much... I thought the flavor was that of a regular Waffle and Red Color... It was not what I ordered and has no effect on the yelp star rating on MY review!

Chicken and Apple Sausage (not house made) was grilled very nicely and had good flavor

Their House Made Sausage I do NOT like the flavor

Hash Browns... Not my style! still almost three stars on this dish... I LOVE Cubed and Fried version, this one is shredded and browned on each side...DULL and seems undercooked in the middle or maybe needs to be Cooked longer!!!  More Browned to be Crunchier...

Grits were AWFUL... Our Waitress Warned me I would not like them and I already knew the Hash Browns are not the Style I like or I ordered them anyway and I'm mainly writing this part because I appreciate her telling me upfront that I would NOT like them!  Honest Staff are a HUGE Asset if the Owner is listening : 

Note to the Owner : You could do MUCH Better in the areas of : Sausage, Hash Browns and especially GRITS!!!

Nice Looking Place the Service is Excellent much like the South Park version...

GREAT Play list... First you can only hear the Music if you are really paying attention or in the Restroom (which is GREAT) \"Rubberband Man\" was playing when I was visiting Men's Room, Great \"Spinners\" Tune and fitting!"}
{"text":"My husband & I and some friends visited this place on Saturday, March 25th for bunch... we absolutely loved the food & service. Our waitress was on point, she never missed a beat. Our food came out hot & within 25 minutes of ordering. And the location  was packed... great service! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had the BEST BRUNCH here this morning!! We sat outside and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere. The florentine eggs Benedict was de-lish! Would definitely recommend this as a GREAT spot to visit."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was great however the chicken was a little dry for the Chicken & Waffles. Service was spot on and the syrup was very good as well. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. There was a wait on Sunday morning. Stopped in after the early service at church and grabbed a coffee while I was waiting to be seated (about 20 minutes). They had complimentary lemon mini poppy seed muffins available for those waiting - nice touch. I had an egg white, veggie omelet and stone ground grits. Both were super tasty. I will go back. I did not like paying $1 more for egg whites and then another $1 to add one extra veggie (the menu only allows for three) I wanted four. It seems like I am being penalized for making a healthier choice. Either way, I give this establishment top billing. Friendly staff, clean facility, great food and comfortable spaces."}
{"text":"We've changed our feelings about Terrace Cafe Ballantyne. Have written manager many times about leaving certain items on their dinner menu, returning to half-price wine days - but otherwise complimented the restaurant. When we moved to Ballantyne near them we ate their five times a week. We were always friendly with and known by staff & tipped very well. Never a reply. RUDE. Unless something's changed (we haven't been there for a while), we find the dinner menu less than appealing and the two dishes we loved (and told them so on numerous occasions) stop at 4PM. We rarely get out for lunch. After spending so much time and money there you'd think I'd be offered a \"wine top off\", my husband a complimentary beer. Two years of solid business and nothing. And the beat goes on.  .Try Zicola's instead."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Didn't feel rushed. Overall awesome place. AND they have vegan and gluten free options. Five stars"}
{"text":"Absolutely live this place. Trying out different breakfast places that have options other than the usual eggs, waffles and pancakes. Had the shrimp and grits and it was super delish.  Filled with about 6-8 shrimps, chunks of spicy chorizo meat, lightly fried okra with some spicy chili oil highlighting on top to give a slight kick. The grits had grains of polenta to add texture to the dish.  Friendly and attentive staff. Love this place would continue to come back for their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least three times since moving here and have enjoyed the food very much. 
So far I've tasted:
Breakfast casserole - so good and extremely filling. I was not able to finish the entire thing!
Fried Green Tomatoes- did not dissapoint
BLT- I saw it get delivered to someone else and I just HAD to happen. It was an excellent choice. I had the slaw with was vinegar based and very yummy.

My experience with the service has not been as good as the food. Just them not paying attention,  not giving us silverware things like that. It's disappointing since the food is very good."}
{"text":"Found this place while researching brunch spots in the Charlotte area to take my friend when he came to town. After seeing the red velvet waffle pictures and reviews, I had to give it a try. I ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken, and my friend ordered the Mediterranean salad with chicken. The order took quite a while to arrive, but that is the only negative. Besides, the coffee was great during the wait, and so was the server. When the food arrived, it was more than amazing. My friend enjoyed his salad, but I absolutely loved my red velvet waffle and chicken. This place will become a regular spot for us!  *Side note, check out the cool angled glasses! We got a kick out of those."}
{"text":"Something has happened here. This place used to be the best around. Now things are overcooked. Service is slow. Good things never last."}
{"text":"OH, NO!!  Friday Night.  we went to the bar. 7:00-7:30.  there was not a person there!!!!   We sat at the bar, NO ONE came!!  after 5-8 minutes we just left!!!   Really?  on Friday night  No bartender!!!!   What????? 
Goodbye."}
{"text":"Had red velvet waffels, really good!  The eggs were OK, will be back to try more since I'm always hearing how good they are."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this restaurant when it first opened. Not anymore. Service has become very poor front desk has no idea what they're doing  - waiting over an hour for a table is ridiculous. Better options available in the area avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place a THE BOMB! We happened to be on a business trip staying at the Ballantyne hotel and searched for healthy dinner options. This place pleasantly surprised us. The food is excellent!!Delicious!!! We tried almost every item on the menu and were impressed with each one! The prices are friendly too!"}
{"text":"I came with a large group for a bridal party and had a great time! We were seated in a private room which was a bit tight but allowed us to have some privacy. Our server was great and the food was delicious! I recommend the red velvet waffles and salted caramel latte!"}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday at 11am and as expected it was PACKED. For 2 we had a 35-45 minute wait and once we sat down the wait for 2 was up to 1.5 hours! That only told me that this place MUST be good. The girl taking names was good at seating everyone on the inside but o think she may have forgotten about the outside table because the table we sat at was empty the 40 minutes we were waiting and it wasn't but 10 minutes before we were called that someone took a count of the tables out there. But it was a busy day.

We were greeted almost immediately and the first thing we wanted were pomegranate mimosas but nope they don't serve alcohol till noon which is very strange for a place that has a good list of brunch alcoholic beverages. At least start it at 11am but I think this may be a permitting issue. Anyway we asked that at 11:45 so waiting a bit didn't bother us. My mom and I ordered build your own omelets and wanted the famous red velvet waffle to share. Our waffle came out way before our omelets which was also strange but not the worst thing to happen. At 11:59 our waitress asked us if we wanted to order the mimosas and we appreciated her promptness. The mimosas were delicious! Highly recommend the pomegranate! 

My favorite part of the brunch was one of the bus boys sang while he cleaned the tables and let me tell you he has a great voice! We enjoyed our time here and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Really good food.  Family of 5.
Had everything from the chicken and waffle, grits, steak and eggs,  lemon poppy seed french toast. It was all good.  The house made Tennessee hot sauce was even good. Nice clean family ambiance w/an upscale feel.  Waitress and staff were accommodating and friendly. 
REAL TALK"}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe in all their brilliance and popularity cancelled my Mother's Day reservation.  They simply sent a note to my barely used email telling me it had been cancelled.  No consolation, not apology; nothing.

I get it, you're so popular that you don't need to take reservations.  There will be a line of people ready to eat your food, but cancelling reservations on a customer on such an important holiday for a restaurant known for brunch is just moronic.  You're creating enemies for no apparent reason.

Worst yet, when I called to talk to the hostess about it she offered no help.  She said \"oh, tomorrow is first come first serve.\"  I guess you're more like a buffet than a quality establishment.  Let the herd wait in line for our slop."}
{"text":"Two words to preface this review: pleasantly surprised.

I have visited the other Terrace Cafe in Piedmont Town Center, and have disliked it all 3 times I've been there. I decided to give Terrace another shot--and this one is in a better location for me anyway. We sat outside on a warm summer afternoon. Pleasant! The waiter was quite mellow, but we felt he was thoughtful and overall a nice gentleman. He recommended the chicken salad croissant for me. The chicken salad is made with cream cheese and sour cream (I think it was sour cream) instead of mayo, giving it a totally different flavor. It comes with grapes and pineapples, and it was just awesome. The croissant was light, and a nice background to the chicken salad. Yum! It came with fries that were a little too salty for my taste, but were good. The only thing I didn't touch on that plate were the dastardly tomatoes. I don't like tomatoes, and they didn't look good, so they got to sit and bask in the sun. Haha tomatoes. Mom ordered the salmon and said it was spectacular, and my sister ordered an average french toast.

As I said, service was very good, nothing to complain about here. He nailed the recommendation on the chicken salad. Next time I have to try the red velvet waffle...sounds delicious! A rare 5 star review for Terrace!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch!! Food was absolutely delicious and quick and the service was amazing! Wish my trip was longer. I'd definitely be back. On my to do list when I come back the next time."}
{"text":"I had the fried oysters spinach salad. Delicious. The oysters are crisp and very flavorful and the spinach has a light dressing with Carmelo zed onions,  bacon and eggs. I'm impressed that they have a breakfast menu that they serve until 2:30 during the weekdays.  And they're having some great drink specials right now"}
{"text":"Such an unfortunate situation. I was really looking forward to my first experience in this restaurant. Went with 3 friends for dinner Saturday night and I ordered the scallops and risotto and sadly my food was so salty that I could only eat 1 scallop before I told the waiter; which instead of apologizing or at least offering something else instead he said to me \"good feedback\". After that he took my plate and later on when our checks were ready I was charged for something I didn't even eat and they were at fault. After making the night uncomfortable to my friends, the manager came and gave me an apology and that he had \"discounted\" my entree after I couldn't even eat my food and ended up paying 15 dollars for no dinner...what kind of management is that?! Anyway, after having such an amazing service like Del Frisco's across the street from this place...I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They lose at least one star for lousy service. The food is satisfying and consistently good. The steak Benedict is one of the better in the area. They also have real hash browns (shredded not cubes) that you can get smothered and covered. Still waiting for service so maybe they loose another star!"}
{"text":"Staying at a hotel in Charlotte with no car so I needed a place I could walk to from the Ballantyne hotel. Consulted Yelp! and the Terrace Cafe came up near the very top. It's a short walk across a few very busy streets to a center with lots of food choices.

They server breakfast until 2:30, and it looked tempting. Almost went for the fried green tomatoes and a regular breakfast but decided to get something I can't find in my neck of the woods - shrimp and grits.

The food was outrageous. The shrimp and grits was topped with fried okra. Very yummy. 

Very surprised that the service was not good. I arrive at 1:30 on a Monday and the place was almost empty. It took a while to get seated and while the initial contact with the server was prompt, I barely saw him again after he delivered my food. Took forever for him to bring my check and I was the about the only one there! 

This should have been a five star review. Not well managed when I was there."}
{"text":"I've been twice since moving out here and their food is excellent. Plus, they have a bar and tv's which helps when I need to catch up on games. Came for breakfast with the wifey both times and was seated very quickly by a friendly hostess and/or waitress. 

First time I ordered an egg white omelette with hash browns. Pretty good although the hash browns were just roasted potatoes. Tasted good regardless, as did everything else.

Second time I decided to be a little adventurous/-had the shrimp and grits and a side of the fried chicken (breast, not leg, thigh or wing, unfortunately). All delicious although they might not have known since I left a decent amount left on my plate but that's only because their portions are so huge! I'm not complaining though and quite frankly there isn't a single thing to complain about at this establishment."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for my birthday and it was fabulous!!!! We had a wonderful breakfast and they gave NA a birthday desert!!! Beautiful!!! Impeccable service"}
{"text":"Delicious food great ambiance to bring the family and friends for great service and food, the latte is great will be definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Took our daughter to lunch there today as it is near her office and we came here based on the reviews and we were not disappointed in the least.  We were seated right away, and the waitress was there within a few minutes. Great start to a great meal. We all tried something different, Chicken and Waffles, Fish and Chips, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich w/ onion rings and a child's chicken strips with fries. Food came out fast and hot and all together. Everything was outstanding. The chicken with the waffles was a filleted breast which I prefer as I don't care for pickin meat off the bone when eating it with a waffle. The fish was humungous and could easily feed 2 people. Fries were also large cut and crispy outside and soft inside. They even had malt vinegar for the fish and chips, which is a small thing but it tells you they know what they are doing. The child's lunch portion was hugh, and the chicken was fresh and hand battered. The sandwich was a massive piece of chicken and the buffalo sauce was stupendous. The bun was soft and fresh. This place is a jewel and the price was very reasonable considering the portions. The waitress was top shelf, polite and helpful and we noticed her section included a large number of tables but she kept it all under control. Very professional. I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"1st time eating here this morning.  Very very good banana Pecan waffle and Turkey sausage. My husband got the chicken and waffles and he pretty much inhaled his food. I wish there was a location in Atlanta. Staff was super friendly. Lovely atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything was great about brunch at this location. Leon was a great waiter, the red velvet waffle was awesome, the sausage and eggs were good, and the mimosas were strong ."}
{"text":"Damn good for breakfast/brunch.  They don't take reservations (at least they didn't for my party of 4 for breakfast at 10am on a Sunday). Fortunately our wait was only about 5 minutes long.  The menu is super enticing if you like breakfast.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I will say the sweet offerings look awesome.  My fellow dining companions all ordered sweet stuff (2 got the lemon poppy french toast, served with fresh fruit and one got the bavarian stuffed french toast).  I ordered the reasonably priced($9) biscuit with sausage gravy which comes with a pile of shredded hash browns and added 2 eggs over medium). It was perfect and the eggs rounded it out well.  Shredded hashbrowns don't appear much in my neck of the woods so when I see them I get them!  These were good but could've been a bit more flavorful (even pepper would've helped).  The house hot sauce was a great compliment to my meal too.  Not too hot.  

I would absolutely go there again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Yes! Right down to the saltrd caramel latte. Yes!

Had the trio with lobster bisque, lentil soup and an grown up grilled cheese. 

I would like to say it took me about 15 mins to pick. It was rough. So many good choice. My friend had the chicken and waffles and loved it. 

I LOVE Charlotte for this place alone. I need to return and try everything else. 

I can say my only con was the service. I guess I'm just used to more personable servers in the South which I love. 

Thats all."}
{"text":"Went twice recently, once for dinner and once for brunch. Did NOT have Red Velvet waffles--much as I love sweets, the very notion of those waffles makes me queasy--but all at my table ordered either breakfast or lunch items and all were quite pleased. My omelette was well-made, just enough without being the gluttonous portion some restaurants feel obligated to serve. 

The dinner was likewise done well and all in our party were pleased. I did order one of the desserts, which took an inordinately long time to arrive at the table and was still cold from the fridge and more than a little dry (a coconut cake). I wouldn't order a dessert again, knowing now that they're pre-fab and sitting around in the freezer until ordered, but I also don't hold that against them.

Service was better at dinner than brunch but both servers were pleasant, engaging and professional. 

We will definitely return, which is not what we said long ago when we last left the old Village Bistro. I think we will begin to incorporate this into a dinner-and-a-movie evening routine, which includes the Ballantyne movie theater upstairs (and which requires a whole different review)."}
{"text":"We wanted to see what the \"red velvet waffle hype\" was all about... well, it was... okay. The Bavarian cream stuffed French Toast were a hit! Their side dishes were very basic. 

The service can improve, especially because the location is in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I went for dinner Friday night and had the shrimp and scallop linguini. I could not believe how good this dish was. The scallops were tender, moist, cooked perfectly and very fresh. Same with the shrimp. The sauce blended beautifully with the seafood and pasta. I did not think that I could get a meal this good in South Charlotte. If you don't mind spending a little extra, this place is worth every penny. I've been to good restaurants in Charleston, New Orleans And San Fran; this dish was probably better than anything I had there. And I wasn't even starving. Check it out."}
{"text":"For the longest time, my cousin has been trying to take me here to try the famous red velvet waffles. Finally, I was able to visit Charlotte during yeah week so I took the chance to check it out. 

I ordered only the red velvet because we had pizza for lunch so this is dessert. My only take back was the icing. If I knew how much they put on there, I would've asked to have it on the side. I don't have a sweet tooth, so it was too sweet for me. From what we little bit of waffle with minimal icing I could get, the waffle is very good. 

I would I order it again but this time I will know better"}
{"text":"Got this for delivery from Postmates-

The smothered chicken and peanut butter brownie cheesecake were awesome!!!

The chicken itself is dressed a delicious cream sauce, and the mashed potatoes were the best comfort food imaginable. They were especially good with the creamy sauce (from the chicken) on top! 

The veggies included with the smothered chicken were cooked to perfection, and my order was surprisingly hot for delivery (as if I had actually dined in). 

The cheesecake was a slight let down because my selling point was \"topped with Reese's cups, whipped cream, and pure chocolate drizzle.\" These things were unfortunately absent, but the cake was still yummy."}
{"text":"Dafron's is the type of spot a foodie craves.  Off the beaten path this locally owned treasure has been serving up dishes made from scratch everyday for just over three years.  I ordered the shrimp and grits made with a heavy creme sauce and accompanied with stone ground grits, andouille sausage, green and red peppers and it was as good as any in Charleston.  The garlic essence permeates the amazing jumbo shrimp.  This meal will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast and am so glad I did. The ambience was charming, the service top notch,  and the food was great. The choices were clever takes on breakfast foods, such as lemon poppy French toast. I love it here and will be back when I return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is NOT the best brunch in Charlotte. It's a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children. The food was decent but I'm sad I made a drive this way for brunch."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Brought family to dine here when they were in from out of town. 
We frequent both locations  and have always had excellent service and delicious food.
We enjoyed our wine and salad, but our steaks were nothing special. In fact, we were quite specific on the way we liked our steaks prepared, and each of ours, were more done then we care for. My sister-in-laws was way too done for her. And she was specific in her request. She ate her veggies & risotto, left her steak.

 We would have said something to our waiter, but he was very in attentive, and did not come back to check on how our meal experience was going until we were almost finished with the entrée.
He was also quite flippant, trying to be witty, to the point of rude.
Being it was Thanksgiving time, we all let it pass. When I mentioned our waiters behavior my family, they all remarked, they were so surprised at his behavior and lack of professionalism. I regret not getting his name, or reporting this to a manager. If the owner reads this post, maybe he will know the waiter I am speaking of the evening of November 29th at 7:00PM. 
The restaurant was very quiet for a Saturday evening, so he wasn't overly busy at all, but being Thanksgiving weekend may have been the reason it was so quiet.

This is my first ever negative review for food and especially service. I was embarrassed we brought our family here and apologized saying we really love Terrace Cafe. Not sure we will be back any time soon. Couldn't get our check fast enough to leave. So very disappointed!  I may think about giving the South Park location a try again, just won't be recommending the Ballantyne location for sure.
Very off putting waiter. Never had that in any restaurant in the Charlotte area. My husband is a Culinary Institute of America chef and is proud to show off the many restaurants we love in Charlotte! So we will continue to showcase many other establishments like Good Food on Montford as our go to restaurant when we entertain guests.
Again, first ever negative review, but felt so strongly this needed to be addressed."}
{"text":"I am here to rave about my recent meal at Terrace Café. We've had appetizers many times at the bar (mainly before a movie), but last weekend we made it in time to have dinner before the movie. The appetizers always amaze...particularly fried green tomatoes and the hummus (served with toasted sesame seed pita, sooo delish). 

The table tried the pork tenderloin, scallops and shrimp & grits - everyone was impressed and cleaned their plates! My dinner was the Brick Chicken with herb risotto. Can I just tell you, this is the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. Seriously, am I raving about chicken? It was that good. I even saved the leftovers and they were still delicious! And I rarely get chicken at a restaurant since I eat it all the time - but the brick cooking intrigued me. I'm so glad I tried it!

Every time we've been, we get excellent service. Last visit was no exception, our waitress visited us right away and our food came out quickly. 

I don't know how popular Terrace Café is for dinner, I think most people rave about their breakfast. But that kitchen really churns out some great food after dark too! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, pretty good food. Had a nice breakfast with my wife today. Bloody Mary was tasty, as were the crab cakes Benedict my wife ordered. The biscuit gravy was good, but the biscuit itself a bit dry. Hash browns seemed slightly undercooked in the middle, next time I'll ask for them scattered on the grill to get more of that crispy goodness. The pancakes were light and fluffy though, and our server was attentive and back with refills before we had to ask.  A little expensive for everyday breakfast, but good for a nice morning out."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, the entire experience was awful.  Today was hitting on all cylinders.   Service impeccable.  Food was awesome.  Atmosphere festive and perfect for a gathering of friends.   I always think of this as a breakfast place because they serve it around the clock.  It's also good for lunch and dinner. Today,  I had a veggie omelet and the cheese grits.  Loved the raspberry jam they brought with the wheat toast. Sometimes it's those small things that make a big difference!  One nice surprise was when the server told us how to save money on our bill by posting a photo of our food on social media and doing a check-in on YELP.   Obviously I was all over that and had some money taken off the bill.  One more example of how social media pays off!  Two thumbs up and if everything stayed like this, I'd return more often."}
{"text":"Chaos is only way to describe our dinner tonight. Had to grab the manager to take our order because we were seated and server never came back. Ordered appetizer that came AFTER our dinner (fried green tomatoes that were bland and salty).  Two of the orders came out after we complained to our server (an hour after we had been seated).  Restaurant was short staffed, disorganized and running out of food.  A server dropped a glass of wine next to our table and was cursing out loud (continuously) in front of my child and family.  Our server also had to step in as bartender. She was apologetic when she infrequently came to check on us.  She offered my wife another glass of wine 'on the house' and said our appetizer would be comped. When the check came she said they took 25% off the bill.  Frankly, the original offer was a better deal. We didn't ask for a discount but felt it was deserved.  To their defense, the food was good however Grilled Salmon Salad was super small for $17.  Ugh!  I gave our debit card to server before she brought the bill. We just wanted out of there!  This will be our first and last visit @ Terrace Cafe.  Wished I could share better news."}
{"text":"Triumph!!! The delicious breakfast casserole is back like it used to be. Delicious, hot and creamy soft. Every bite is delicious. Talked to the chef today, Carlos and sent him my congrats!! So happy!! Bottom line: if it's not broke, don't fix it!! Thanks to all the dedicated employees at Terrace Cafe who put a smile on our faces after a long day at work or a long night at work!! Salute!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my wow! I love this place! As pointed out to me by my cousin, they are known for their breakfast selections, so I'm VERY glad that they still served breakfast when we got there around 2:30pm for a late lunch.

My meal: red velvet waffle, hashbrowns, blueberry tea. ALL were fantastic! They don't have a very wide variety of teas from which to choose. It's the usual green, chamomile, black, earl grey, BUT the one unique choice they did have was blueberry. So of course, I had to go with that one. Yummy and sweet.

The waffle was like melt in your mouth good. I asked for whipped cream to add to the cream cheese icing already on top. Very impressed with the hashbrown presentation, too. It's not like the scattered hashbrowns you'll get at waffle house or IHOP. It's neatly shaped into a circle, giving it a nice crisp all around. Salted/seasoned just right too, so it's not bland whatsoever.

I did look through their lunch choices, but breakfast definitely sounded much more appetizing. So for sure go for breakfast food and not dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite breakfast joint in Charlotte. My wife ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and I got the biscuits and gravy. Both were amazing! The good was incredibly fresh and everything was homemade. Even the plating was top-notch. 

The food was so good we both had to share! It was (by far) the best biscuits and gravy dish I've ever had in my life and the eggs Benedict dish was to die for. 

Service was friendly and the wait time for seating was manageable.  Also, the prices were very reasonable (amazing actually for this caliber of food).  The biscuits and gravy dish was $9 and eggs Benedict/Florentine was $11.50 - when you consider this is what you'd pay at IHOP for inferior food, I'd say this place is a steal. 

Recommending this place to all friends and family. Go there - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We ordered the oatmeal and this place exceeded our expectations. I will definitely eat here again if I'm in be area. Service was on point."}
{"text":"We went to Terrace Restaurant on a Sunday morning around 9. The wait was shorter than expected and we were seated. We were seated in the new part of the restaurant, it felt like we were being punished by sitting in the other room. We were surrounded by children, loud screaming children.
We ordered and the food didn't take too long! We ordered 3 Chicken Biscuits and one order of Chicken and Waffles. The chicken was fresh and tender, and the portions were large, perfect size. 
The biscuit was the spiciest thing I have ever eaten. I understand it comes with ghost pepper pimento cheese but we asked the waitress if it was crazy hot and she said no. The food was good and the server was nice. It should be noted that N.C. doesn't serve booze until noon... WHY EVEN OPEN?!"}
{"text":"Terrace cafe is located in a beautiful area of shops where that are very well maintained the atmosphere of the area is truly great.  You can eat outside with a great view or inside.
This was my first time here and wow the specialty items make this place worth going.  I had the banana pecan french toast which was amazing.  The fresh ingredients and flavor made this worth the fat grams I ate!  My girlfriend had the Carrot cake waffles which also were amazing I was so stuffed after eating here.  It is very rich food my suggestion to all is if you want specialty items go here like the waffles and french toast.  If you just want eggs ham ect go elsewhere only because it is a little pricey compared to most places."}
{"text":"Nice, pleasant server and the tomato basil soup was warm and thick but the grilled cheese was the worst .. basic bread with barely any cheese and chopped tomato..it was dry and not good. The pulled pork sandwich had ok flavor was was also dry, needed more sauce and the onion rings were some of the worst I've ever had..onions cut thick with a batter that was too thick and greasy."}
{"text":"Terrace cafe has really good chicken and waffles. The chicken is boneless making it easy to eat. The meat was tender, not over cooked and really well seasoned. Mixed with some buttered waffle with syrup the sweet and savory combination worked really well. The coffee was also delicious. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was alright but customer service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious freshly made food. The coffee beans are ground everyday so if you're into that (which my wife and I are) they've got that going for it. You can also get a French press but the star here is the food and service. If you have to get here a bit during the rush it is so worth the wait. We came here for breakfast and the hash and the quiche was great. I can't wait to try this place out for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary I've ever had. The touch of bacon makes it soooo delicious! Shrimp and grits are a super hit here. This place is very busy on a Sunday but over all if my server had came and check on us I would've gave this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"Wanted to share a really poor customer service experience.  Thinking I had reservations for 6 booked solid for Mother's Day having booked Terrace Cafe through Open Table weeks before, I received a random email indicating the restaurant had cancelled our reservation - no explanation, no call.  Thinking perhaps it was a mistake, I called.  Someone named Michael answered and said they do not take reservations and it had been a glitch on open table to accept reservations...well okay, but that means they have cancelled all reservations (they were booked full) that were made and didn't even have the courtesy to call their diners to let them know personally, just hoping they got and checked a random email...for mother's day!  So now a week out,  we're left scrambling for mother's day plans.  When asked to speak to the manager, Michael said \"sure\" and placed me on hold...I'm still on hold 20 minutes later - clearly he made no attempt to get a manager and just wanted me to \"go away\".  Read the reviews on open table - clearly, it seems they have had a management change and with that, their service has gone downhill, this instance a prime example."}
{"text":"Terrace Cafe is great. I love coming here for brunch and for dinner. The pimento burger and the fried chicken are SO good! I love their biscuits n gravy and their pancakes! The only thing that I'll say is the service can def be slow. Came at lunch one time and it took forever. We come here about once a month and have always had great servers. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I torture myself.  It's been over a year since I've been to Terrace Cafe and didn't have a great experience the last time, but I thought we'd try it one more time.  

It's Mothers Day, and they don't take reservations but do call ahead seating.  We called at 11:00 am and were told it would be 2 hours but to show up at 12:40.  Fine, we waited at home, and since I knew it would be crowded and I hate crowds this is fine with me.  I had a party of 6 which included my 2 children both under 5.  The place was very busy, and since it was gorgeous outside there were A LOT of people eating outside.

We were promptly seated (good thing), and greeted by Adam, our server who took our drink orders.  I then opened the menu and saw that \"to better serve us, they were only serving breakfast on Sunday\", well crap I wanted lunch but then saw they had a few \"specials\" which were \"lunchy\".  My party ordered and we're off to the races.

So we're waiting.....and waiting, and waiting.  50 minutes later, after my Dad took my daughter for a walk and the food STILL wasn't there I informed Adam that I was tired of waiting for my food and he said they \"were doing everything possible\" to get my food out, but they were backed up.  He must have said something to the Manager because he stopped by and by this time it was a full hour after I placed my order.  He explained to me that we were still 7 or 8 tickets back.....I immediately went into \"jerk mode\" and told him that it sounded like poor management to me.  He got defensive and told me that it indeed, wasn't poor management.  Au contraire mon frere, that is EXACTLY the definition of poor management!  When you're menu is 98% breakfast which is more \"custom\" and you're in Ballantyne on a holiday you do either one of 2 things......you staff up, or you cater your menu to some breakfast, some brunch and some lunch which will speed things up and not cause your customers to sit over an hour to wait for their dang food.  He then went on to say that he understood if we wanted to leave!  Who trained this guy?  Was he trying to get us to leave?  He then came back a few minutes later to inform us that we were in fact, only 2 tickets back.  After 1 hour, I was not leaving on principle!

Ok, so the food comes after 1 hour and 5 minutes, can you tell I was staring at my watch the whole time?  My Prime Rib hash, I have to be honest was pretty good.  There was a nice amount of Prime Rib chunks, mixed in with onions, peppers and potatoes, there were 2 over medium eggs on top and everything blended well together.  Sweetie had the Lobster Salad also which she said was delicious and she enjoyed it.  My number 1 Child had the 3 pancakes and 1 strip of bacon kids meal.  We thought since my 2 yr old doesn't eat much we could have her share one pancake but the pancakes were basically 1 regular pancake cut with a cookie cutter to make 3 pancakes....VERY CHINCHY IMO.  It was served with fruit which was ok, except for the bad cantaloupe which was replaced swiftly by the manager.  I did notice they charged $3.50 for a side of 3 pieces of bacon which should be against the law.

My issue with this experience was, with as long as it took to get my food and eat, it was a total of over 2 hours spent here.  The time spent to tastiness of the food ratio was very off which will cause me not to return, ever.  After scrolling down the rest of the reviews, maybe I'm the only person in S. Charlotte who doesn't get this place.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Ok, let me say....I'm never going back! How can I say scrambled eggs and crisp turkey can? Sounds like a simple dish, not too big of a deal! Eggs came out cold twice and bacon tasted like it was cooked hours ago and thrown on my plate. And my HOT chocolate was tepid at best.

Too frustrated to wait another 40 minutes. I ate nothing!! Thank you for taking it off the bill, but you should have comped my husband and daughters meals too, since their was also cold, but too hungry to wait another 40 minutes (I know I said that already)! Final note, they took 10% off the non hot chocolate. Really? Just bring me a HOT one, but the waiter knew no better. 

Btw, where was the manager and his apology?"}
{"text":"Great and polite service. We had reservations for 6, but we arrived at 5:30 and we were accommodated and seated right away. The food was great also."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch! We stopped here on the way home. I had their special the red velvet waffle with cream cheese icing. Wow was I impressed! I don't normally get sweets for breakfast but this looked to good not to try. It was very good. The waitress and staff were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Terrace Cafe- Southpark many times before, but this is my first time going to the one in ballantyne. I have never had a bad experience previously, but after eating brunch there this morning my opinions have drastically changed. To start, our waitress took 20 minutes to get the whole table (party of 5) water. We then proceeded to order addtional drinks, such as coffee and tea, and she kept saying \"she'll be right back\"...but didn't come back for another 15 minutes. 

We ordered our food- carrott cake pancakes and 4 benedicts. When the food was brought out we were not able to initally eat because there were no untinsils on the table. The carrot cake pancakes didn't have the pecans or coconut (like the menu specified it would have). When asking the waitress, \"isn't there supposed to be coconut and pecans?\" she responded...\"I don't know is that what the menu said.\" In addition, the pancakes came with a side of fruit, which was also forgotten to be brought out. 

As for the 4 benedicts, they forgot to make one and accidently brought out the wrong entree. Instead of being sympatheic for forgetting the order and hurry to make another one, it took 30 minutes to bring out the intended order and by that time we were already all done eating. The other 3 benedicts, that were supposed ot have poached eggs, were completely hard-boiled eggs. The finally delivered my moms meal, but the entree they brought out was wrong again. She requested them to just take the \"benedict\" off the check because it was not worth it at that point. The waitress was not respondent to the situation and gave an extreme amount of attitude and backlash when we asked to have my moms entree removed. 

After having a very unsatisfying meal experience, with a lot of waiting around for incorrect and incomplete entrees, we ended up getting our $12 dollar benedict taken off...great customer service right? To say the least, I will not be returning to the Terrace Cafe-Ballantyne anytime soon. 

To give an example of the carrot cake pancakes I received vs. what they are supposed to look like, please see the photo comparison."}
{"text":"I have been here twice before, once for brunch and the second time for dinner.  This third time will be my last time.  We waited for lunch for over an hour with no food and then had to take our meals to go.  The chicken salad sandwich tasted sour and the salmon was undercooked.  The manager seemed disinterested that food was being sent back to the kitchen. The service was fine, but the food left a lot to be desired.  I don't know if it's under new management, but the last time I was here it was not this bad."}
{"text":"Always a solid food experience. I have had a Western omelet and a Brie & spinach quiche. Every time I go I have breakfast, makes me feel like I'm back in Jersey and at a diner because I can get breakfast all day. 

Coffee is darn good, hot and fresh. Service is quick and friendly. 

I think the portions are fair and appointed well on the plates. Room enough to talk privately and just quiet enough hear the person across the table. Seats are comfortable. Lines form quick so get there just before the rush.

Bar staff mediocre at best, had a long wait for breakfast in Sunday and had coffee at the bar. Server didn't provide cream, sugar or a spoon and acted pained to have provide them. Good thing the waitress made up for Mr. Sulky Pants."}
{"text":"Friday night, we went to Terrace Cafe for dinner and drinks. I couldn't keep up with everyone, so I ordered coffee. I love going to Terrace cafe because you can sit outside under the lit up trees (at the Ballantyne location) and they have unique dishes that are incredibly fresh. The cafe is hidden in the Ballantyne Village shopping plaza. 

The waffle fries are probably in my top five favorites for restaurants. Their lobster BLT is really yummy too! I tried to recreate it at home and it was nowhere close. We also ordered their fried green tomatoes and YUM! Another fun appetizer they had...fried alligator. It tastes just like chicken. It's actually pretty good!

The first time I went there, I ordered the grilled chicken cobb salad. It came with egg, avocado, onion, cucumber, lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, croutons, grilled chicken, cabbage, and ranch on the side. It's a great healthy choice. 

I've also ordered their roasted salmon salad and it's so good! The salmon is moist and crisp on the edges. My salad came with walnuts, green apple slices, spring mix lettuce, spinach, dried cranberries, parmesan cheese (swapped for the blue cheese), and ranch on the side!

I highly recommend getting their tomato bisque soup if they have it available! It's to die for! 

I also LOVE their breakfast!

I ordered the vegetable egg white omelet and added turkey bacon. It came with sautéed onions, peppers, tomatoes, and spinach. I chose the wheat toast and fresh fruit for my side. The dish came with a homemade strawberry jelly and it was unbelievably tasty! 

I really want to try their bourbon salmon next time!

The service is always great and professional!"}
{"text":"Went on Father's Day and realized they only serve breakfast  on Sundays as they are only open until 2. No big deal. Omelette was pretty good and menu items reasonably priced. My only issue was that no itemized bill when check came and found out hours later that I double tipped. I was with part of a party of 8 but still should've been notified \"tip was included\". Just be on the watch out for that and you should enjoy yourself with no problem. Just kind of annoyed I wasn't notified. Ask about private rooms to eat."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch after having looked at the menu.  As a vegetarian, there was ver little I could eat except the waffles and pancakes.  And if you're vegan? Fuggetaboutit! I opted for the red velvet waffle--this has been advertised so much as a delectable menu item, so I gave it a try.  The batter was light and fluffy, which made for a light and fluffy waffle.  It wasn't overcooked and hard like most waffles. The cream cheese icing on top was set enough that you didn't need to add any more syrup.  

If you're going on a Sunday, be prepared to wait about 30 minutes at least.  There always seems to be a line here.  The service was good; no complaints there.

If I had to make a gripe it would be to add more vegetarian, savory options to the menu, besides just eggs.  An investment in non-meat sausage or something like that would be ideal.  If you're an omnivore, you'll likely like this place a lot."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal and our server was so sweet.  I ordered banana pecan french toast.  It was like banana nut bread pound cake slices made into french toast.  It didn't really remind me of what a traditional french toast is.  BUT I was happy with what they served.  I asked for 1 small pancake for my daughter (just turned 1 year old) and they brought out a huge pancake and was charged $2 for it.....& of course she didn't eat 1 bite.  I was assuming since it was for a small child it would have been complimentary like most places.  
I also ordered their well-known Red Velvet waffles to-go for my husband.  AND.....they were delicious.  Tastes exactly how you would imagine it. With my husband being a huge red velvet cake fan, he was very impressed.  It was even served with a cream cheese sauce.  We will def be returning for the breakfast/lunch service again."}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch if you don't mind the loud atmosphere. I usually visit every other Sunday. Everything I've ordered I've loved."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to this restaurant! I come with my family on Sundays after church for brunch and they're always reasonable with seating time as well as Delicious hot meals for brunch. The wait was only 20 minutes which is very reasonable. The service is great! It's in a very cute spot. For the winter time to have nice hot Pilates and drinks, and in the summer you can eat outside! It's a family friendly atmosphere that is welcoming and warm."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times over the past few years  for breakfast and I always leave thinking it was okay but not that good of a value for the money. They have the normal breakfast fare - omelets pancakes, waffles etc and a few specialty items but in general I feel the food is overpriced. On average it costs $40/ per couple for breakfast. On our last outing, I got the Red Velvet waffle which was 11.50 and I added fried chicken for $6 for a small fried chicken breast. It was tasty but not really worth $17.50 IMO.  My husband had an omelet  for $13, which he stated was nothing special, with cheese grits; they charged an extra  50 cents for the cheese. Not a big deal but the waitress did not disclose that was extra, nor is that noted on the menu. In fact she asked regular grits or cheesy grits as if it were included in the price of the entree instead of saying you can get cheese for an extra .50.  Later in the meal he asked for some salsa for his omelet. He believed that  she would bring a small condiment sized portion of salsa,  but the waitress put in an order for a small bowl of salsa- way more than he needed-without telling him it would cost an extra $3.  

It's fine if they want to charge for extras, but they need to be up front with you that it is an extra charge, not just surprise you with it on the bill. There is no way he would have agreed to paying $3 for salsa had he known that up front- that is way too much for some salsa! When we complained, she did take if off the bill, but it just seemed like they could be more transparent about extra charges that are not reflected on the menu. In general, I  believe you could get many of the same items offered cheaper and better at the other restaurants."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot.  Best yogurt, granola and fruit I have had in a long time.  Great French pressed coffee.  If you are in the area - this place is worth a stop"}
{"text":"Service was embarrassingly slow--- 20 minutes for 3 glasses of water. Service was so bad we went inside and spoke to the manager to gain help. Manager never once checked on us to follow up. I will never bring my money here again."}
{"text":"I have to give this place five stars based on our first two visits.  My mom and aunt were in town visiting my 2 year old daughter (I know the score, they weren't here to see me!) and we went there for lunch on Friday.  My mom wanted breakfast but also lunch, so we agreed to return on Saturday morning for breakfast.

First off, we got there before the lunch rush and didn't have to wait... so that addresses some of the negative reviews I've read here.   It did get packed just minutes after we sat down.   Our server was wonderful, so that addresses another negative I read (ask for Libby's section).  Our food was FANTASTIC.  We ordered adult grilled cheese (the review was 'best grilled cheese I've ever had'), tempura chicken fingers and corned beef sandwich.  The tempura fingers were really good... but then again I love tempura.  I had the leftover of the corned beef sandwich today, and it was really good.   Not Rascal House in Miami Beach, good.. but good!  My wife said the onion rings she got with her grilled cheese were awesome.

For breakfast today we again did not have to wait... but it did get a little crowded after we sat down.  I just  had to dig in to their famous red velvet waffle, and it did not disappoint.  When it came out it appeared small to me.  I was thankful my wife ordered the lumberjack breakfast (what I called it, I think it's called \"complete breakfast\" on the menu) because I figured I'd be eating half of that.  Well, by the time I finished the red velvet waffle, I was done.  Small in stature, large in richness!  Wow, that was a powerful breakfast.  Also ordered were the Belgian waffle with fruit, and the banana nut french toast, which my mom raved over.  We had the same server on Saturday that we had on Friday and she again was great!

All in all, we had two phenomenal meals at Terrace Cafe.  I've heard from friends that dinner there is not so good.. and that does not surprise me.  Based on the speed of delivery of our meals after ordering, this place specializes in \"quick and very tasty\"."}
{"text":"i had a great experience with the food. i took my boyfriend there for his birthday. I had the chicken and waffle, side of fried green tomato  which was amazing. He had the red velvet waffle and sausage. Everything was perfect but the waitress. she was extremely rude and no help. the other waitress were very helpful on their tables. that was the only thing that wasnt great."}
{"text":"Unfortnately I cant comment on the food since we didnt eat but thought I'd share my first experience.  Went yesterday after church to eat, we were told it would be a 20 mins wait with empty tables everywhere.  Finally got a seat only to realize they only service breakfast items until 2:30 and then  they close and reopen at 4.  WTF?  Not everyone wants breakfast food at 12:30 pm.  There were no signs anywhere indicating only breakfast served.  By watching some of the staff, I'd say service wasn't that great either.  You could tell some had no clue even regarding cleaning off a table."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Drinks were cold and perfect. I had the red velvet waffle and it was amazing. My bf had an omlette and said it was the best omlette he had ever had. I can't wait to move here and bring all my MA friends here! They also serve breakfast until 2:30 for you late risers ;) I can't wait to come back and try their lunch and dinners. If they are anything like their breakfast then I am in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles... So far some of the best I had.  There was no outside sitting big bummer because inside it wasn't that much fun.  We had to sit right in front of the bathroom because we had strollers.  Our server was super nice and gave my son a chocolate muffin with that awesome cream cheese sauce they make, that was super sweet."}
{"text":"It took us over an hour to get our food this morning.  Now we are going to be late to the football game.   Got there at 930 so it shouldn't have been a problem. The waitress did not acknowledge the delay until we asked.   The food was fine but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Red velvet waffles are the best.  I thought the chicken and waffles would be wings but it isn't.  I got over it.."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing. Great coffee, perfect biscuits and gravy. Chicken and waffles were perfectly done with delicious grits that didn't get soggy. The steak and eggs were delicious with a heaping portion of hash browns. The place is great for meet ups and big groups. Plus plenty of outdoor seating for a gorgeous Saturday morning for brunch. No compliants. Def coming back."}
{"text":"We love Terrace cafe! It's delicious for brunch and really good service. My husband typically gets the chicken and waffles, and I normally get something off their daily specials menu. We always have a very nice server and the food comes out pretty quickly. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it seems a bit overpriced for what it is and the portions are less than generous. Other than that, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"It's gone totally down hill or the staff that day didn't care. I've had brunch here once in early 2016. It was pretty good and seating was readily available even though there was a brunch surge. I just went Halloween weekend 2016 with my girlfriend and it was very disappointing. There were at least 15 tables, plenty of staff, but we had a 15min wait with the black buzzer pager. We went over to the bar to grab mimosas while we waited and the bartenders acted like we didn't even exist. We waited there for 10min with no service; the guy next to us got so frustrated because he couldn't get their attention to pay with his credit card he finally just left cash with a very meager tip...he hardly touched his food either so it really must have been bad. Fortunately we didn't find out because we left and went elsewhere. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, prompt service. We went here for brunch on a Saturday. While it was busy, there was no wait. The service was friendly and the good was good. (Tip, get the biscuits and gravy as a side!). Parking was the only challenge since the other stores around where busy too."}
{"text":"After living here, in Ballentyne, for over a year, we finally found a jewel just around the corner. The crab cakes were acceptable and the fried chicken breast was excellent. Be sure to have Terri your server. Can't wait to I go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"The health department was present while we were dining for breakfast so we had to wait a little over 2 hours to get our food and we didn't get the right food but they corrected it as I know they were probably stressed while they were being graded by the health department. I had the eggs benedict  and the salted caramel coffee. I really liked it. I'm very picky about my Canadian bacon eggs benedict but this was perfect. I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict but they ran out but I'm not dissapointed about what I got instead. Our server was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"A staple brunch spot in Charlotte. There is always a wait but be on the lookout for the bar seats, they are fist come, first serve. Food never disappoints, I have been here multiple times. Known for the red velvet waffle (delicious)! Today I order the make your own omelet with grits and has brown. I was pretty hungry. lol but it was good!"}
{"text":"Ok...what is the fuzz about! We just left this place with a very unsatisfactory experience, from the moment we got seated. We requested a table outside and even when front tables were available we got seated in a back table next to the garbage and register table.
The waitress tried her best but looks like most her attention was somewhere else, a bigger party she mentioned. We ordered the Deviled eggs for appetizers and there was no taste to it except for the piece of bacon in the middle, seemed like the eggs were refrigerated for a long time. The waitress was gone for a while and never even asked if we liked the appetizer, for diner I ordered the salmon with carrots and asparagus. When I got my plate it was covered on what tasted like pancake syrup, super sweet but the salmon was cooked perfect hence the 1 star.
My husband ordered the filet with crow fish and a hollandaise sauce that was very heavy he was glad the waitress suggested to have it in a separate plate, when he took a bite of the crow fish he literally spit it out it was so fishy, we never had it before and this plate was a recommendation from the waitress so he thought that's what it's supposed to be, so he pushed it aside and just ate his stake with the Mac and cheese. 
And that will be the last $60 spent at the that place we will not be returning. Oh and yes I agree with some comments the vibe is a little weird."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast brunch. Service is great and friendly. Love the eggs Benedict with crab cakes."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow on Sunday's and waitress didn't even come by to ask if we needed refills."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this location months ago on my Yelp and vowed I would make time to go there and today was the day. It's a very busy little spot and when I originally went in there was a 30 minute wait. The hostesses were very personable; I loved their attitudes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait, but i was determined to make it back after; which is what I did. It was way less busy around 3:00 pm than at noon when I originally went in. I sat at one of the tables near the bar and the lovely hostesses became my waitresses! They were honest with their suggestions and so I ordered the red velvet waffle with the fried chicken breast and a cup of coffee. It came out in a timely manner which was another plus. I usually do not like icing on anything, but since I forgot to inform my waitress, I rolled with it. Good thing I did! It was delicious. It was not too sweet nor too thick. I didn't any syrup. The chicken was moist, not overly cooked or dry. I topped it with some good ol' Texas Pete and I was in a small piece of heaven. I defiantly will visit here again!"}
{"text":"This place can be great, but is just good.  The menu is creative and exciting, and that is part of the problem.  It builds up expectations to a point that the kitchen cannot execute.  I had the hangar steak and it was fantastic.  Unfortunately, the appetizers and my friends entrees did not match up.  For starters, we had sausage and cheddar bills which had virtually no flavor and fried green tomatoes which were nothing special. One of my friends had trout wrapped with bacon, which we all wanted to order, but she ended up having trouble finishing it it was so mediocre.  Overall, an okay experience but could be so much more."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sit down culinary experience so far!

Since my boyfriend and I moved here a couple of years ago we've been having a personal culinary tour of Charlotte. We go out to eat at least twice a week, and at least one place a week is usually from a list of our favorites.

We came to Terrace Cafe on Valentine's Day, and the experience was so awesome we had to come back the following weekend. I won't ruin it too much for anyone, but EVERYTHING on the menu seems to be a great choice! We bought a 3rd person the last time and ordered A LOT to make sure

The chef even came out to talk to us on Valentine's Day but I'm sure on other nights that's rare because they were jam packed the following weekend. When you go, ask for Terry! Best waitress I've ever met & you'll have laughs for days!"}
{"text":"To start I am doing a 4-star only because I am waiting for the new dinner menu and want to see what they come up with.  This I can say - the staff, especially Sherry (mgr) and Laurie and Sean are really great and Sherry, especially, goes the extra mile to make sure the customer is happy. Other mgrs and staff, Robert, and others are equally great. Granted we are pretty regular (at least once a week), but I don't think that matters. Their patio is really nice and is also very dog friendly.  Their large turkey salad (unfortunately only available during lunch hours) is without a doubt one of the best deals in town.  The good news is that lunch runs until 4:00.  Their turkey sandwich is also outstanding and the fact that they slow roast and pull their own turkey is a real pls. Highly suggest you give them a try"}
{"text":"I ordered the southern chicken sandwich as a to go order and added pimento cheese and onion rings.  I got back to work and there was nothing on my sandwich other than chicken so I brought it back.  I picked it up 10 minutes later and they didn't give me fresh onion rings so those are soggy and I'm still missing bacon on my sandwich and its the original chicken that they didn't even heat up so that is cold.  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Came with some girlfriends on a Saturday night and we didn't have to wait that long. Atmosphere is nice and clean. I got sweet tea to drink and it was definitely on point. We got the garlic hummus appetizer and I was really surprised how big the portion was. There was 3 of us and we still couldn't finish it. Hummus was good and smooth and had a great flavor. I got the shrimp pasta but I don't see it on their menu anymore. But it was good. I would definitely go back. Great for a girls night or even date night. Service was great too! I can't wait to come back to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"We love Sunday breakfast at Terrace Cafe. Often my daughter and I split a breakfast, but not here; it's too good to share!  Whether it's eggs or oatmeal--it's all very good.  Get  there early to avoid a long wait."}
{"text":"So good! The red velvet waffle with fried chicken is unbelievable! I love eating here but you either have to go early in the morning or later in the afternoon or else the waiting time can be up to an hour."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to S.C. And decided to try since it was a 4 star. My husband had the Full Breakfast with hash browns, eggs, bacon and pancakes. I just had the chicken & apple sausage, which was very good! I ate some of my husband's pancakes, eggs and hash browns. The pancakes were lite and fluffy which suits me well. The eggs were average and the hash browns were too hard but the presentation was good. The sweet ice tea was one of the best I've tasted because it wasn't too awfully sweet!  Our waiter was nice and the food came out rather quickly. We came right after lunch about 2:30 so there was not many people dining. Would I go back? Yes I would love to try the waffles!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The hardest choice when I come here is deciding breakfast or lunch food! The red velvet waffles are to die for, and I also enjoy the chicken fingers. The staff is always kind and helpful, and I enjoy every experience I have here."}
{"text":"we had a fantastic time! Our waiter was very informative and his service was impeccable,The food was AMAZING. Will definitely be returning SOON"}
{"text":"I have passed this place tons of times but never been in! My mom was coming into town and wanted a great little brunch place and this seemed like te perfect spot! When we showed up at 11 I thought we might be beating some of the crowds, but no luck there. 45 minute wait. There is always a crowd here, but that is usually the sign of delicious food!! 

We were seated outside and it was a nice cooler day (in the fall this would be perfect!!) I had an omlet with a few veggies in it while my mom had the turkey and egg white omlet. The hashbrowns were so amazing. Crispy and delicious! Food is definitely worth the wait alone. Service was wonderful and he was personable and contributed even more to an already pleasant brunch. I heard many things about the red velvet waffle but just couldn't bring myself to order it. They also have a coffee bar type set up behind the actual bar so I imagine their coffee drinks are delicious as well. A great little spot for brunch if you are close by!"}
{"text":"I came in for dinner and got the shrimp and grits! It was a good size portion and very tasty. It had plenty of shrimp and there was a barbecue type sauce on top which helped to balance out the cheesy flavor. I was disappointed that I left without trying their famous red velvet waffle but I'll be back to try their breakfast items which sound more appealing to me than their dinner options. The food was a little pricey but it's in a very nice location."}
{"text":"Very good for lunch and brunch. In Ballantyne so its very convenient. The red velvet waffle has a reputation of its own. Love the grilled cheese. Can't  wait to go back."}
{"text":"Still have the best Biscuits and Gravy of all the breakfast places that I've tried in Charlotte.  This is the place I take people who come to visit to when we want breakfast.  I've been for lunch a few times, but I pretty much always order breakfast since it's just so good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch now. Both times I tried something new and both times the food has been excellent! The first time I had the grilled cheese. Very delicious for a childhood favorite. The second time I had a club sandwich off of their specials menu. It was super flavorable. The only reason I knocked it down a couple stars was the fact that their non-smoking section was outside. If you are a non-smoker you instantly get punched in the face with cigarette smoke as soon as you walk in the door."}
{"text":"While I was vising family in Charlotte, I had a taste for some delicious Crab Benedict.  My sister referred me to this place for brunch and I was excited after seeing all the great reviews. As planned, I ordered the Crab Benefict. Very disappointed. It came out over cooked, basically burnt, and the Benedict itself was very dry. The apple sausage was amazing however. Just very disappointed in the overall outcome of my meal.  My sister's red velvet waffles were also amazing, as she offered me some of her brunch. The setting was nice although a bit cramped. Although a place may be in a popular neighborhood, that doesn't necessarily mean the food will be up to par. I've been to diners with better benedict. So overall I gave this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!

Food was the best; I had chicken and biscuit wand my husband has the steak and hash browns; juice was very good and coffee was not to strong.. Wewill be back."}
{"text":"After one visit, I can say I was pretty impressed with this location of Terrace Cafe and plan to return to see if they are consistently good.

I visited for lunch and arrived just after 11:30; we were immediately shown to a table.  Our server was quite nice and remained attentive without becoming annoying and offered what his favorites were on the menu and why he loved them.  The interior is decorated in an elegant, sophisticated manner with hints of trendyness. Large metalwork sculptures and original paintings are paired with the warm oranges and dark reds, with plenty of flowing curves. Even the tableware and glasses have an artful curve and elegance to them - it's classy without being stuffy.

We started with the bruschetta, which was a step above most others, with melt in your mouth bread as opposed to the over toasted sheet rock a lot of places serve. For my entree, I decided to see what the \"grown up grilled cheese\" was all about. It was certainly a gourmet grilled cheese, with colby jack, tomatoes, and onions between toasted sourdough.  My only critique would be that the onions were sliced a little too thin and tended to make for slightly messy eating. Flavor-wise, though, it was spot on. I upgraded to the onion rings for a side and I am glad I did - these were massive onion rings coated in a tempura batter.  My partner tried the soup of the day, an apple and fennel, and was thoroughly content.

I certainly plan to return and try the red velvet waffles they are known for, and maybe give their new dinner offerings a shot too."}
{"text":"Some things are basic and fundamental to a restaurant. The food must be hot if it is suppose to be hot. When you order side items they should be served at the the same time as the entree. What ever comes with the sides or entree should be brought out in advance of the order. These folks don't get any of the basics. They have really good food and they blow it by bringing it out lukewarm and piece meal. This causes a flair up in the family and results in a ruined overall good time. The staff tried to make it right but after the family outing is ruined what is the point in a 50% discount. Keep your discount just learn the basics."}
{"text":"The server was super nice, but it took way too long for my martini. The spicy carrot soup was way too salty. I tried the tacos - the steak was ok, fried avocado was my favorite and the salmon was my 2nd favorite. I'll try it again, but for the pricing, I'm not overly impressed."}
{"text":"My daughters and I have been to this numerous times. This morning we were surprised to learn that if you are using a credit card to pay for your check, they now charge a 4 percent service fee. That's disappointing that the owner decided to pass the cost of doing business along to the customer.
While their Red Velvet Waffle is delicious, it is pricey at $11.00. For me, it's probably time to move on."}
{"text":"Been here twice for a late breakfast and both times were very good minus a few tiny hiccups.

The best thing about the Terrace is probably their menu and the refreshing variety of food they serve. It's not overwhelming but they have unique breakfast and lunch dishes that make The Terrace stand out. Even common items like the Fish and Chips have a unique twist to it (which is one giant super-crispy fish filet instead of 3 smaller. Although due to the size, it can vary on how well it is cooked through).

I got the Open-face BBQ Pulled Pork Breakfast Biscuit with jalapeno relish and tomato jam (I think), and it was very good and actually much more refreshing than I anticipated, but perfect for a brunch. Their bloody Mary's are also pretty good and spicy.

The staff is usually nice although sometimes forgetful, where someone in my party got a french press coffee and they forgot to add the coffee, and they forgot to add the mayonnaise and onion to my angus burger. 

Overall, I enjoyed the Terrace and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Just a great place to eat. Take guests here frequently. Service is always the best and the food never disappoints. So glad we live near as it is convenient. Just a wonderful experience. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm ordering the wrong things but I'm not impressed and probably won't return anytime soon. I came on a weekday morning and the place was maybe 1/3 full, yet our server seemed very rushed and it was hard to flag her down. I ordered an omelette with mushrooms, onions and gruyere with a side of fruit and toast. I love omelettes but this one barely had any filling inside. Maybe 3 pieces of mushroom and 5 pieces of onion? Plus the gruyere was still in its shredded state and not melted at all. On the bright side, the fruit seemed fresh and the toast came with a yummy jam and whipped cream.

It's a nice place but I just couldn't justify paying $12 for what I got."}
{"text":"This used to be a good spot but the level of customer service has gone down considerably, and this applies to the South Park location as well. 

But this review is specific to the Ballantyne location. If I ask for a drink with no ice, don't bring me a drink with ice in it and ask me if it's ok. That's what happened  to me today. I politely told the waitress \"No\" and had them prepare me a drink with no ice as I requested. The appetizers took longer than they should have to come out, a few of the dishes weren't as clean as they probably should've been and our brunch took a while to come out as well. I probably won't be back to a terrace cafe anytime soon. Two bad experiences in a row are enough to keep me away."}
{"text":"I ate at the Terrace Cafe Ballantyne on a Friday night and was very pleased. There were several servers bustiling around the dining room and we were seated immediately. The server made very good wine and food recommendations. Our salads and entrees were very tasty--well seasoned wth a minimal wait. The portions were generous, and both myself and my fellow diner took home leftovers. The only drawback to my experience was that we had to ask our server for mini rolls after observing that the tables to both sides of us had received them. We also had to flag down our server for a wine refill. I definitely recommend Terrace Cafe for a nice dinner in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Ohhh myyyy gahhh is the food amazeballs here!! Its usually my first choice for breakfast/brunch if i know im not in a rush to be somewhere. They usually are packed on the weekends but that's a given since their food is sooo YUMMY! It's definitely worth the wait though. I've personally never had lunch or dinner here but have heard good things from other people that have dined here for all 3 courses."}
{"text":"Everything here is good! I mean everything! Fried Green tomatoes are a must every time you order. Tip well people!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Ballantyne! I hate that the parking could impact their success, this place is really good and service is always top notch. Worth the Sunday morning wait...."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this eatery. I was promptly seated and the waitstaff was courteous.  I ordered breakfast and it came out in short order. The meal was overall \"good\" but nothing about it was memorable or made it stand out."}
{"text":"I just tried Terrace for brunch and it was delicious! 
My omelette was perfectly prepared and the Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever tried!
The only drawback was the wait. The patio seating wasn't even half full yet they had us waiting for almost 20 minutes, I'm not really sure why. We also saw this kept happening to others throughout our meal. Perhaps they were just short staffed for a Sunday."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was busy, but it was worth the wait. The red velvet waffles were delicious!!"}
{"text":"So, we decided to stop for brunch based on the rather positive reviews. We were told it would be a 20-30 minute wait, but we were pleasantly surprised to be seated in less than 5 minutes!  Once seated we  met our server, Brooke.  I was happy because I'd already read positive reviews where she was praised for her excellent service. I guess today was an off day for her, because she was marginal, at best.  We seemed to wait endlessly for coffee refills and her willingness to help when we were struggling with menu options for the kids was minimal. Despite all of that, our meal was okay."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch last week. It was pretty tasty!  The only off putting thing I can say is that the cook had thrown fresh piping hot fries on top some fries that must have been sitting for a while, which was a very poorly executed way of getting rid of old fries in my opinion. Other than that I think I would visit again."}
{"text":"I like the terrace cafe, but since they changed their menu I think it has gone slightly downhill.  Lot of grese and oil in their dishes.  The one in Piedmont row is better and I feel the food is fresher."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Terrace Cafe. I've been to both locations a few times and still top notch. Whenever I want chicken and waffles, I come here. The chicken is seasoned and cooked perfectly. Not only that, I love that it's a filet and not chicken wings. It allows me to cut my chicken and waffle at the same time. Just wonderful. One of these days I am going to try something different. My friend got the eggs Benedict with filet and she loved it. I don't like eggs but her dish looked good if you loved egg based dishes. You should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Decided to try again and big mistake. If I could rate 0 I would. The place now doesn't seem very clean, the floors were covered with food and super slippery from the film on top. Took over 10mins to get a simple coffee. Server just didn't seem to care on speed. Husband got French toast with fried chicken he said it was good. I got biscuits and gravy with fried chicken. The meal was luke warm at best other than the chicken. I just ate that and nothing else. They offered to remake but I didn't want to wait for another meal to be made. The food itself was still average at best other than the chicken, that's the only thing I would ever eat there. They also sat us in the little hall area between the two main dining areas and it was so dusty my allergies were terrible sitting there. Manager came off and took my meal off and was nice I just don't think their food is remotely good.


I have to be honest both food and service was disappointing. We went on a Sunday knowing it would be busy, we didn't wait too long. Was probably about 5 mins before the server came over to get drinks, getting a hot chocolate took another 10 plus mins. We orders and our food took over 30 mins to be delivered. Note the people next to us sat about 20 mins after us, received their food prior to us and left at the same time. Our food my guess was sitting because it was luke warm... Not hot at all. Of course we didn't tell the server because we were done by the time she came back to even check on us. My husband got the red velvet waffle with fried chicken... Thought the waffle had zero flavor to it. I got the biscuits and gravy added fried chicken. Same was ok nothing special for $45... On top of it we both added fried chicken and we got two different things. His looked correct and mine was a chicken breast fried and cut in half, must of not cooked fully because the breading I could see and had a gritty taste because it wasn't crispy. Overall the best thing I had was a hot chocolate. Won't return due to such poor service and crappy food. No idea why this place is rated so high"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and waffles! The chicken was tender and the skin was nice and crispy. It was complimented with a soft and fluffy waffle! 

I used to think it was not appetizing to pair a sweet syrup with the chicken, but the duo is great. Service was good. She was very attentive of our table even when it was fairly busy. Next on the check list is the red velvet waffle!"}
{"text":"We enjoy this restaurant and visit from time to time for a change. It is classy and reasonably priced. We do find it small and am not a fan of out door seating. Food is usually very good and the coffee is excellent. Have only eaten breakfast there. I understand there is a new meeting space for special ocassions."}
{"text":"This is probably my #1 go-to spot in the area. It's affordable and I never really have to wait long for the food. If you sign up for the text alerts you can get your first drink free. Today I came in with one of my coworkers and we had Brandon as our waiter. He was a nice young guy and got our food out to us pretty fast. I usually get a to go order every time I come in and have it for lunch or dinner later. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Red velvet cake w/drizzle on the side, grits, extra crispy potatoes, and a whole milk cappuccino = heavenly.  Excellent service too."}
{"text":"I love Terrace! I get the Terrace fried chicken.  Service is ok. Sometimes takes a while but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The Terrace Café is one of my favorite spots in the QC.  They specialize in upscale Southern food and do a fantastic job at it.  IMHO, The \"Terrace Fried Chicken\" is the best fried chicken in town (Yes, it beats Price's Chicken Coop which I honestly haven't been overly impressed with).

Terrace also has an excellent breakfast and brunch menu.  Items worth trying are the shrimp & grits, the red velvet waffle, and the fillet medallions and eggs.  I've yet to try their fried alligator as an appetizer, despite the fact that I'm an FSU alumn and a natural a gator hater.... But it's next on the list.  

T.C. gets 5 stars because they ace every area a restaurant should focus on:  1. Food 2. Service 3. Atmosphere 4. Meal Presentation.  I've caught a glimpse of the kitchen on occasion and can tell that the guys back there really know what they're doing.  This indicates to me that they pay their staff well, resulting in better food and service than the norm."}
{"text":"Came in around 9am on a Saturday for breakfast and was seated with in 10 minutes.  I checked out their menu ahead of time and knew the Red Velvet Waffle was a must try.  Bonus, it comes with a side option. The Red Velvet Waffle did not disappoint, the cream cheese icing on top was perfect; sweet, but not so sweet that I feared a sugar coma.  I got the hash browns as a side and they were good. They did come on a tiny little plate so it was very difficult to eat them without making a mess.

I can see where parking could be an issue during busier times, but we had our choice of 3 front row spots when we came here.  A little more expensive than other breakfast spots that we frequent, but that Red Velvet Waffle is SO worth it."}
{"text":"The service is great, the atmosphere is welcoming, the food is outstanding!  We ordered the chicken & waffles (make sure you get the red velvet waffle)...AMAZING!  I got a side salad with their champagne vinaigrette to go with it.  The chicken was fried to perfection, and the food came out fresh and hot so it was devoured quickly.  Don't forgot to try a Bloody Mary if you are in the mood for a cocktail, definitely worth it.  This is a must spot to put on your list for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast, lunch not so much. We ordered half sandwiches and soup/salad. I ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant which was so bland, but the croissant was good. I was brought the wrong soup and spilled onto my sandwich and make my croissant soggy, but it was ok.I ordered the Creamy Tomato soup with it. THAT was delicious. It was rich and tomatoey, not too creamy and croutons were fabulous. My BF had the half turkey which was delicious, but I was surprised there was mustard on it. It just didn't fit into the flavor profile with the rest of the ingredients in it. It had caramelized onions, cheese, tomato, bacon and you add mustard?? I think not. The salad was great, had blue cheese, radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. Server was cool, attentive. I'd be back, but just for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had brunch there for the first time with my family and we pretty much licked our plates clean. Best veggie omelet [the \"Y\" one] ever and really awesome coffee...their iced sugarfree hazelnut latte specifically! Everything was cooked perfectly, with fresh jam and fresh fruit. The service was also outstanding. If I lived in the condos across the street I'd be there every weekend!"}
{"text":"Es sin duda un restaurante exquisito ame el desayuno y el almuerzo aun mas. Lo recomie do."}
{"text":"The Ballantyne location is my favorite of the two in Charlotte. The service and food are always amazing! On one of my last visits the server suggested the pitcher of mimosas -- be sure to ask about it, it wasn't listed on the menu. The only con is the wait time for brunch on the weekends. Go early if possible."}
{"text":"Delicious and one of the best brunches I have been to in a while.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and was very pleased.  It comes with fried okra on top! Definitely recommend it to anyone in the Ballantyne area.  As an app I ordered the fried green tomatoes with smoked pimento.  It was a pain to eat as it was a little tough.  The smoked pimento was average.  However, the shrimp and grits were so good...I couldn't give them anything less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to enjoy Sunday brunch.    Some of their popular items are: red velvet waffle, fried green tomatoes and their chicken and Apple sausage.   

I love their French toast as well.   There are some choices to choose from.   All delicious.   You can't go wrong here.  

Also, I love the Sunshine cocktail.  So make sure you go after 12pm on Sundays."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch spot. Immediately when you walk in, the atmosphere is warm, bright and modern. There's an energy without being noisy.

For a 11am on a Sunday morning, I was surprised there wasn't a longer wait. (Note: I arrived late, but my friends only waited 5 minutes for a table.) The crowd was steady, but all around us, things seemed to move quickly.

My dish was excellent. It was so hard to decide! Terrace Cafe has a lot of unique dishes - like a Red Velvet Waffle and S'mores French Toast. I ended up with a special - Bananas Foster Waffle. Woah! Almost more like a dessert than a meal - it was so good. Waffle was baked perfectly. The bananas foster was sweet, with enough sauce that I didn't need syrup. It also came with eggs - I chose scrambled. Not too runny, not too dry. I was most impressed by the fruit. It was not your typical lame brunch - with some sad-looking melons. Oh no, not at Terrace Cafe. I got a few pieces of melon, but mostly strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, kiwi and mango. Mango! If fruit is an option for a side, I highly recommend it.

A few other nice touches - my hot tea came in an individual pot of hot water. Our waitress brought a box full of teas from which to choose. The dishware is very chic: curved water glasses, rectangular white plates, interestingly curved silverware.

My one complaint was our waitress. She seemed a bit detached and wasn't very attentive to our table, though we noticed she paid more attention to others around us. She did not check on us after our meal arrived. However, two managers stopped by our table to make sure everything was ok and they were very friendly. 

Overall, a fantastic restaurant. I will be back for brunch -- and to try lunch or dinner as well!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is usually  the best bet. It's a crap shoot if you got for lunch. Little slow on this side of town"}
{"text":"We give this 5 stars! Everything was delish: Chicken and Waffles; Chocolate Chip Waffle; Animal Pancakes; Lemon Poppy Seed French Toast; Cheesy Grits; Bavarian Stuffed French Toast. The only thing to know is that the specialty French toasts are suuuuper sweet (like funnel cake/dessert sweet). So it was a little bit much by the end. But we enjoyed it and the service was good ... once we realized the sweet tea dispenser was actually dispensing unsweetened tea :-)"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I read the reviews and anticipated a long wait, as I am here at peak brunch time. The wait wasn't long at all (I got here around noon) but the food takes a while to come out. The chefs messed up my order so I had to send it back. From what I was able to briefly taste of my food, it seemed pretty good.

**Update: they made my order wrong AGAIN but the manager came out and stated that she would be taking care of my bill for all be mishaps. That was very kind of her, I wasn't expecting that at all. I'll definitely come back but perhaps at a less busy time. The food is amazing by the way. (:"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on yelp and having a few friends tell me good things about terrace cafe, i decided to go and give it a try. As i walk into the restaurant a guy greets us by saying \"what can i do for you?\" With a blank stare, Not a hello how are you guys? Are you dining in or to go?. I had to tell him well i came here to eat. I had ordered the terrace fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. When i got my food the mac and cheese was watery with a little to no flavor, i then cut into my fried chicken and the flavor was good but when i looked at the mashed potatoes under the chicken i was grossed out. My mashed potatoes was covered in what looked like grease or tons of butter which made it taste strange and salty. Overall the meal was disappointing and gross and for the price of the meal i was upset. Not to mention the time i was there i had to hear the servers non stop talking loudly at the bar while i was trying to eat my food. Very disappointing and will not come back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Terrace and it was AMAZING! The service was great and the food was delicious! I would recommend the red velvet waffle and chicken to anybody.

{"text":"Brunch sandwiches are pretty good. Servers are friendly. I suggest you get there early if it's a nice day so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Terrace cafe and it was a little disappointing. The fried green tomatoes were uninspired (and yes I believe that FGT'S can be inspiring). The beef noodle soup was too salty to eat. If you have kids don't order their chicken fingers - they are mini grease balls. Their chicken salad is on point -very fruity which I love. While not bad, should be way better with lunch ranging in the 12$-16$ range."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The only issue that I had was the glass had lipstick on it.  I know that things happen but my concern was completely dismissed. The server Melissa took the glass said that there glasses are normally like this came back with a supposedly new drink and new glass. It looked like she just wiped the lipstick off. I gave my review to the manager and he again dismissed my concern and didn't even address it.  Food great but wish the service matched the great food."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  Need I say more?!!! The bloody mary rocks too!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and drink options. Would have to say it's one of the best bloody marys  I have had in Charlotte. Be prepared to wait on weekends, we typically try to get a seat at the bar which you usually can do to try to cut down wait times. My to go to is the benedicts, my fiancé loves the chicken and waffles and adds  bacon in the waffle! You can also customize your hash browns- adding cheese, onions and other fun options."}
{"text":"What a great surprise.  This place has fantastic food options.  We've gone several times for lunch and it is definitely earned its way into the rotation.

All of my colleagues have enjoyed it as well.  Whether you want breakfast or lunch, the meals were great.  I can't get enough of good breakfast food.  We need more places that serve breakfast in Charlotte, especially ones with this level of quality.

Service was prompt, pleasant and professional."}
{"text":"We were here for a bridal brunch and I was pretty impressed with the food--the quality, quantity, variety, and prices.  Everything we ordered presented quite nicely everyone enjoyed their meals.  We ordered everything from the fruit platter (served with greek yogurt and a coffee cake), to chicken and waffles, quiche, pancakes, etc.  The only issue I had was the bacon was like translucent...there was very little meat, mostly just crispy fat.  Very thin.  It was odd.

The mimosas were perfectly balanced and the private room was perfect for the 8 of us.  The service was so-so and the management was not super helpful while planning the event but we will let that slide for now.  

Overall--solid brunch spot and a lovely environment for a bridal party!  We enjoyed it!!"}
{"text":"2 stars is for the service ... the food def deserves 5 stars!! So we went in at 1230ish on a sat and the place was not that busy they had a handful of tables empty so we thought we
Would be able to sit within the 20-25 min quoted..
 ... well the staff including management were walking around like they had 100lb weights on their ankles... I have never seen food service employees move so slow ... the hostess or it looked like she was the manager was talking with one of the servers while we were standing in front of the hostess stand for a few minutes we we're not acknowledged or greeted until we kept staring at her for a long time ... we had 10 in our group so she quoted 20-25 mins ... that was fine we expected that... but when 30 mins passes and we see there are empty tables that are getting set up for us  we are excited bc the kids are starving ... but 10 mins pass and they are still pushing the tables together there is something wrong another few mins pass and they are just getting silverware set up ... it doesn't take 5 mins to put 6 sets of silverware on the damn table ... and it took her 3 trips back and forth to the hostess stand bc she kept forgetting to take all the kids menus it literally took her 3 trips back n forth to get 4 kids menus!!!!!! Omg ....
Now for the food it was great so good so fresh perfect! We ordered red velvet waffles with fried chicken yummmm the waffle was perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside the chicken was tender and juicy sooo good ... the grilled chicken Cobb salad with the house ranch was fresh and delish the shrimp and grits were super good a little salty for my taste but well seasoned and cooked to perfection... the burgers were burgers but they were still good but the fries were super good and the hashbrowns omg the hashbrowns soooooo good!!! Like I said the food was so good the wait was worth it however the staff really should be re-trained on how to move with a little urgency ... the waitress we had was attentive but idk of it was bc gratuity was already being added she def didn't do much to deserve the whole 18-20% of too that was added! I'm a really good tipper in general to those that deserve it but we all
Had empty cups for more than we should have and our plates were being cleared before we were even done!!!! I really hope the staff gets retrained or just reminded of what exactly their jobs are bc the food is amazing!!!!!! Unfortunately No pics bc we waited over an hour a half to have food in front of us..."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Sat on the patio this morning with my beautiful girlfriend and enjoyed a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, amazing food excellent service.  Red Velvet waffle is excellent, shrimp n grits are excellent.  I love brunch and this place is legit, next time I visit, it is top of my list for brunch."}
{"text":"Best chicken and red velvet waffles I have eaten thus far.  Nice atmosphere plus good and fast service.  I will be visiting again real soon."}
{"text":"What has happened to the ballantyne location? I was there Saturday and the service wad terrible."}
{"text":"Good food but extremely overpriced. A breakfast for two people without any alcohol should not cost $50!!! The wait is always awful, we Like it but sadly will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really like Terrace, and I like that they are locally owned and operated. While I cut my teeth at the Piedmont Row location, I found this Ballantyne restaurant to be fulfilling as well.

The space was once something else...and I ate there once. It wasn't very memorable. So I was super excited to see that Terrace was moving in. 

Having been for dinner (3 stars), I direct my attention to their extensive breakfast and brunch offerings (5 stars). I have had several menu items here, but the standouts are:

* Oatmeal (so, so good)
* Omelette with tomato, spinach and mozz (if they feel like letting me have mozz that day, since it's not on the omelette menu)
* RED VELVET WAFFLE (not for the faint of heart. quite sweet.)
* Blueberry pancakes 

I appreciate that they're trying to do the dinner thing, but it's just not happening. I'd recommend going for breakfast/lunch (they serve breakfast every day until 2:30). 

I'm getting hungry... Who wants to meet me for lunch?"}
{"text":"My family and I went here during the Queens Feast because we had heard great things from co-workers who had been here.  The service was really great and nice, but the food was pretty substandard.  I'm not sure if they did it this way because it was the Queens Feast, but to expect someone to come into your establishment to try your food out and then deliver blah food is not acceptable.  We likely will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice restaurant. Its situated in Ballentyne Village. Once you find the restaurant, you have to find parking. This complex has a bunch of stores and restaurants. You may have a little walk if you cant find anything nearby.

As for the restaurant itself, it has a nice vibe. The wait staff is friendly. The wait to place our order was very short. I had the full breakfast, pancakes, grits, sausage, and scrambled eggs with cheese and mushrooms, plus a large OJ. This place does really good business."}
{"text":"I came around 12:45 with the Lunch crowd. At the hostess stand I told her a party of 1 requesting a booth. I watched 3 parties of 1/2 people, who arrived after me, get seated immediately & before me in the booths in the back. So I walked back to stand and asked her why I wasn't being seated. She said because she thought I wanted a large booth. Bull! For 1 person? She basically snatched my pager from me and then sat me with the others in the booths in the back. Not a good way to start off my 1st visit here because now I'm annoyed....

The rest of my service and the food redeemed her. My waitress was very attentive the entire time. I ordered the Chicken & Waffle(Well Done) with Grits, & a Sweet Tea to drink. Hands down the best Chicken & Waffle I've tasted so far. My Waffle was light with a slight crisp the way I like it. The chicken was seasoned to perfection. It was fried where it was still juicy and tender on the inside yet crispy on the outside. I wasn't a big fan of the Grits but they worked with a bit of TLC (Salt & Pepper). They were also very creamy. When I was finished I was offered a Togo cup of my tea which was awesome because that tea was so refreshing. The right amount of sugar! 

Then the bill came & knocked me back down to reality, $18.13!!! Very steep for chicken and waffles. Doubt I'll return too often, but it's definitely a nice place to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"I understand that the Charlotte area doesn't possess the food scene to end all food scenes. And locals can dock me cool points for saying so, but a set of foodie friends from the area have tended toward a few standbys for their culinary cravings rather than branching out and telling me about all the great new places they're finding all the time.

Terrace Cafe is one such standby, and as a visiting patron, the one I know best. My first Terrace visit, to the Piedmont Row location, was such a treat that I was more than excited to hear that a location opened up in Ballantyne, closer to where my friends lived. Dock me a few more cool points for picking on your sprawl, Charlotte, but the commute into Southpark from Fort Mill is a bit much.

A recent trip was typical of Terrace's high standard. Let me start with this: Bacon Bloody Mary. I'm not sure why this isn't available everywhere at all hours, but Terrace is one of the first places I can remember seeing it. A friend ordered it, to my great envy, and loved every moment of the experience. I'm told it's got some heat, but still, get a little extra spicy, and -- take it away, Jack White -- make the sweat drip out of every pore. (Can I get some of those cool points back now?)

Our orders arrived faster than some of our drinks, save the obligatory waters in their Dali-esque curved glasses. This speed could make one wonder if they hadn't been on a trip to the nuke-atorium. But the food quality allayed all such thoughts. My salmon eggs Benedict (not smoked salmon, mind you, but full fledged mini fillets of the fresh catch) came out very flavorful, with eggs on top that had just the right amount of ooze. From omelets to shrimp and grits to Benedicts, we were all sated, though my one friend wasn't quite satisfied until he fished out the last bits of bacon from the bottom of his glass.

There are a few borderline signature dishes here -- the s'mores French toast or the red velvet waffle, perhaps -- but the key is that at Terrace Cafe, it's all pretty damn good. Eggs and dead-animal-variation-du-jour Benedict? I'm there. And that's more than enough to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"This is, hands-down, my favorite place to eat. The red velvet waffle, crabcakes, and lemon poppyseed french toast are staples! Staff is always friendly and attentive. Will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I came in 11/14/17 around 7:15pm. The greeter never acknowledged me at all!  I waited at least five minutes. No one was in front of me. The greeter was too busy talking to a friend about how broke she is and how she needs to make more money instead of greeting her Guest as they came in. Very disappointed. I went to the bar and asked if I was supposed to come to her for an order and the bartender gladly game me a menu and apologized on behalf of the server. I asked to speak to a manager but it took too long so I left. I've heard great things about this place but I will never be back.  I did not eat. I left."}
{"text":"Amateur hour . Sunday brunch seemed to be run by children. Hour and a half wait with many many open tables waiting to be bussed . 
Eggs Benedict poached eggs were hard boiled.
Chicken an waffle was a fried chicken filet on a Belgian waffle, with maple syrup on the side.
Hash browns were fried discs . Waffle House is better.
Put this restaurant out of its misery."}
{"text":"The manager was a jerk. Believe the poor reviews on yelp, Facebook, Google that talk about the uninterested staff and crazy wait times. I tried to give benefit of doubt but I got burned. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.

I went through a lot of effort to try to have my wife's birthday brunch here. It was a party of 12 people so I contacted the restaurant more than a week ahead of time to try to arrange reservations. They don't take reservations, but the hostess said to call the morning of the party and it should be OK. On the morning of the party I called and the hostess said there was no wait and plenty of open tables. No more than 20 minutes later I was there and there were two large parties already seated which meant at least an hour wait. When I explained all I had done, the hostess said she thought another party was me and they were already seated. 

This was frustrating but there was still a solution. The patio was wide open aside from one table that was being served. I asked if we could sit there and the hostess needed to get the manager. She approached me saying \"What do you need?\" I again shared my story and asked if we could sit at the patio to which she said the patio was closed. I mentioned there was a table being served and she said that was a customer with a dog. I don't understand why the restaurant manager would turn away a party of 12 but serve a couple with their dog. I said I could go get my dog if that means we could sit and she actually said \"if that's what you want to do.\" 

This is beyond unprofessional."}
