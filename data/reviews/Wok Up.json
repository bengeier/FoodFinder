{"text":"I had it delivered to my house and they were pretty quick with the delivery. I ordered the teriyaki and panko katsu chicken with one lo mein substitute, crab puffs and spring rolls.  It came in really big portions, so I thought the price was pretty good. The only one thing I would say was bad was that I ordered spring rolls, but ended up with egg rolls and I don't really like egg rolls. I'd order from them again though!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars.  Went to this based off of reviews but what a joke. They charge $2.00 more for \"fried\" rice which was horrible. The sweet and sour chicken was full of fat, super soggy and not much flavor.  He ordered the \"spicy\" chicken which looked like a frozen piece of chicken  that was disgusting and soaked in a non spicy, no flavor sauce. Worst Chinese food I've ever eaten. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Hot & Sour soup!!!  All the other food we've ordered has been great too.  I believe there are some misunderstandings when ordering over the phone (language/accent) but those don't detract from the great food."}
{"text":"Online ordering a breeze. Best egg drop soup Ive had. Generous fresh veggies in the soup and entree. Large shrimp in sweet and sour dish. Shrimp cooked perfect but was a touch soggy. However I would still order again.  Went to pick up food and staff super friendly.  Fried rice done just right..not greasy at all.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been ordering delivery from Wok up on my cheat days and it was better than what I thought it was going to be , I first ordered the sweet and sour and asked for the Sauce on the side and I got the crab puffs and I was more than pleased ! They batter the chicken how it should be they don't over batter like other places where it's a big piece and once you bite into it it's like a small cube of chicken lol anyways I would recommend this place for delivery over other Chinese delivery spots in the mesa area, ALWAYS GET THE SAUCE ON THE SIDE I promise you will not regret it ! I would recommend the following:  Orange chicken  Sweet and sour chicken or pork Mongolian Chicken   pao chicken  Pha thai  Crab puffs  Chicken egg rolls  I would have gave them 5 stars but the chicken lettuce wraps were not good i was very sad about that but other than that good place !!!"}
{"text":"Didn't like there food orange chicken was soggy my wife got teriyaki chicken she took one bite got grossed out Definitely was authentic Chinese food wouldn't recommend this place to anyone wasted 50$ on bunch of food didn't enjoy anything"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Rice was seriously lacking in flavor. Brown sauce in the chicken in broccoli was very thin and lacking in flavor. The chicken tasted boiled. Veggies were over done. Honey chicken was overdone. Delivery was quick but now I see why. Never order from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the family feast, had 3 entrees, rice, fried rice,  egg rolls and wonton and egg drop soup. Additionally the calamari.  The entrees were delicious, and the wonton and egg drop soup. Not a fan of the egg rolls. The fried rice was just not good. The delivery driver was on time and the convenience of having it delivered was huge. It was way better than any chain like panda express. Will order again without the fried rice and egg rolls, will try something new.  There is a large selection on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, not heavy or greasy like some Chinese food can be. Very well packaged and delivered in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Excellent delivery Chinese food, best in the east valley and very quick service. Potstickers are fantastic! House chicken is excellent too!"}
{"text":"I wish yelp can give 4.5 stars because of the location of this is like a scavenger hunt. It is a bit hard to find because it is hiding in an empty mall lot but it is most definitely worth the hunt. This restaurant has some unique items on their menu that you can't find in most Chinese restaurants. For example, I had the coconut soup and the spiciness was the right amount of spiciness in it. It wasn't too overboard and it wasn't too mild. I've heard the crab puffs were extremely delicious from my friends, and MAN it's true. The spicy lettuce wraps had good flavors, the mix of the chicken and bellpeppers all intermingled in the right way. However, it was a bit too spicy for my taste so I had to drown several glasses of water because of it. The restaurant itself is a cute, clean place with great service and an all around great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The owners are super sweet and they make sure that your experience is as pleasant as possible! The food is really good, I had the yellow curry and although I dislike spicy food, this was good enough for me to keep eating while not worrying about burning my mouth off. It was made so you can enjoy the taste with the slight spice in it. The owner checked up on me and he was very humorous, try talking to him if you get the chance. Check this place out, it'll be worth it with the cheap prices too."}
{"text":"The best thing about the food is the take out containers.  I tried it because of the coupon - buy one entree get one free.  I got a togo order of  the Teriyaki (that's how it's spelled on their menu) Chicken and the Panko Katsu Chicken.  The dishes tasted exactly the same - awful.  The sauce was cloying and had a funny smell and taste to it.  The Katsu Chicken said it was served over egg fried rice.  The rice in both dishes was the same.  There was a couple small pieces of carrot and peas and a very tiny piece of egg over the top of the rice on the Katsu Chicken, but the rice was no way fried. Both dishes were not edible.  Never again."}
{"text":"Pretty good my lady and I have tried all the places around val vista lakes area and decided to give them a shot. Very good and not bad in priced. Will go back again. Had the orange chicken and egg rolls great flavor."}
{"text":"Just remembered this place because of the cute name and finally stopped in one afternoon for lunch and am so glad I did. Nice modern decor for a Chinese take out place and clean comfortable atmosphere made me almost want to eat in. Customer service was great- very friendly and he offered to substitute the salad for an egg roll (small but tasty- and had  some chicken so not all cabbage). Prices are around $6 for lunch and they offer a varied menu from Mongolian Beef to Red Curry. Food was all very fresh. I had the Shrimp Pad Thai- plenty spicy and the shrimp were cooked perfectly- not overdone like so many other places. Crab puffs were a little too sweet and not as light and flaky as I prefer but at least they actually had some imitation crab and weren't straight cream cheese. I'll definitely be back. *Manager said they deliver locally so I'll have to try that out too when I'm stuck at work.*"}
{"text":"fresh mushrooms to eggrolls that were thick and yummy. outstanding strongly recommended cant wait to return. thanks"}
{"text":"Awful food.  They use Minute Rice.  Over-priced.  Food is terrible.  Will never order from here again!!!  Not authentic Chinese food.  BLAGTH!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it! First time here and I will be back. I picked up after ordering online. Food was waiting and still hot and fresh when I got home. Everything was delicious. I tried the General Tsos, Mongolian beef and honey chicken. Also tried the house fried rice and crab puffs. All of it was tasty with good sauces. Generous portions and meat was tender. If you are nearby it is worth a try!  Found some surprise sugar buns in the bag that were fabulous too! Hard to find good Chinese in the Valley. This place is my new go-to!!!"}
{"text":"Raising the bar for average Chinese food.  It's solid enough.  It has slipped since opening."}
{"text":"I saw a coming soon sign and saw it was open. I was going to go to a chain Chinese restaurant but instead I said I'm going to try this place since it was in my neighborhood. I walked in and was greeted by the staff. I had the beef chow fun and orange chicken and it was bomb. I will be back on the grand opening this Friday. Legit!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after work today because of all the great reviews. I have been looking for a fresh Chinese food in the east valley  for a few years. Finally a great place with great food and plenty left over for lunch tomorrow.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Easy access not far from the freeway at Staply and Baseline. Skip the greasy BK and eat here!"}
{"text":"There was a flyer on my door from this place. Decided to give it a try today, the lunch specials sounded good and at a reasonable price. My boyfriend and I ordered the lettuce wraps as an appetizer, I ordered the orange chicken, and he ordered the Mongolian beef. The main dish comes with a small salad before the meal comes out. The salad wasn't bad kind of small, maybe a little too much dressing. Then we got our appetizer.............I will never ever EVER eat here again! The lettuce wraps came out and it looked quite delicious, as we started eating it I discovered a hair in the dipping sauce for the lettuce wraps. It wasn't a big deal we hadn't eaten it, so we just asked for a new bowl of dipping sauce. Then as we looked at the filling for the lettuce wraps we discovered that the entire dish was filled with short black hairs. We have never had this happen before!!! They just opened up not too long ago, I can't believe this would happen!!!!!!! Needless, to say I will NEVER be going back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Wokup's teriyaki is delicious! I love their service and lunch special :-)  I go there once a week. Great atmosphere,good service and Icompletely recommended  Wokupto anyone who loves good chineese food YUMMY"}
{"text":"Very good service, clean environments, DELICIOUS spicy coconut shrimp soup. I will be back."}
{"text":"I had been jonesing for some good Chinese food and I found this restaurant on the Eat24 app. I ordered and waited over an hour and got no nothing, no call, no visit, nothing. By the time I figured out they weren't coming the place was closed.   So I decided to stop in the next afternoon (since my card had been charged). I talked to the sweet (and cute) manager on Jordan and it looks like it was app error vs theirs. They filled my order with no problems and even threw in a drink and some wonton chips.   I ordered the coconut soup, the chicken lettuce wraps and the wontons. The coconut soup is really delicious and they put in some good sized shrimp in there; the lettuce wraps were my favorite (they came w/ hoisin sauce). The wontons were good as well, a little heavy on the breading but not bad at all. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this place was and how reasonable the prices were.   I will definitely be ordering from this place again- though next time I won't be using the Eat24 app. :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice and hot.  I'm a very picky eatter and they followed directions to a \"T.\"  Called in order and was ready in 10 minutes.  I can't even say that I want to find another fast food Chinese food location to eat at.  Not to mention, there are other fast food locations nearby for my kids who don't like Chinese food, lol.  Very convenient!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot on my days off. I usually get an order of broccoli beef with fried rice, and wonton soup. I loooove their wonton soup and have been here on several occasions for just the soup. They offer carry out and delivery as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese restaurants that I have been to in a long time. The restaurant was clean and the food was delicious. The waitress was courteous and attentive. My husband and I left very happy and full."}
{"text":"Wow! So good! Got the lunch special it was so much food. I've had Chinese food here in Arizona another time and it was bad. I did find good Chinese food in AZ."}
{"text":"Lunch specials filling and very reasonably priced. Not very spicy however. Also I'm not sure what lemongrass is but it's not edible. Definitely inexpensive quick filling lunch."}
{"text":"This has to be my new fav spot for take out!! So many vegan/vegetarian options along with reg. Meat options as well. I ordered the sweet and sour pork and substituted the pork for tofu...I don't know about any one else but I feel like when I substitute things for vegan options some how the order gets messed at up at other places... so I took initiative and called just to make sure ... the employee who answered the phone was great! I asked him if he could swap out the pork for tofu and he answered \"sure, I could do that. I'll cube it up and fry it for you\"  So easy!! So not only was their customer service on point but the food came In like 25min! AND it tasted great!   Wok up will be my go to for vegan Chinese from now on. Can't wait to go back and try more"}
{"text":"We have been ordering here for a while. So far, the customer service is amazing! The food as well, of course! ^_^  Our last order consisted of shrimp fried rice, and lemon chicken. We sincerely appreciate that there were lovely plump whole deveined shrimps! They were well cooked! The fried rice was not greasy. The lemon chicken was sautéed in flavourful pinch of salt and pepper, fresh green and red bell peppers, and onions. The chicken was tender and moist. We were delighted that it was not battered and deep fried, and swimming in sauce. Also love that there were layers of flavours.  ***Wok Up, please continue being consistent with serving better Asian cuisine, and maintaining great customer service! We appreciate you!***  We will definitely continue enjoying Wok Up's food!   They also offer gluten-free dishes! Brilliant, ain't it?"}
{"text":"The food is really really good here.  Granted I haven't had everything on the menu, but what I have had was delicious.  I recommend the Yellow Curry and Thai Basil.  The Hot and Sour Soup is also very good and the Crab Puffs are delightful, as well.  They don't serve booze, but I guess I don't always have to drink, lol."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery in Gilbert. The food got there quicker than the estimated time, and was very good. We got the family meal for 3-4 people and it was plenty of food for my sister, myself, and my one year old daughter. The only complaint I have was the wonton chips tasted like they were cooked in burnt oil. BUT the rest of the meal was delicious and cooked perfectly! My daughter loved the egg rolls and chicken lo mein the best. Will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Very friendly staff and fast service.  My favorite dish is the lemon pepper chicken."}
{"text":"Order this through Eat24, food was good, order chow fun. (Chow me in but with flat noodles) it was good! Even though they forgot my second order, they were polite and friendly."}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened the business, the owner(s) gave out amazing deal for first time customers, and I know that was when I got hooked with their flavorful lunch specialties. What I have tried so far is Pad Thai, Sweet and Sour Chicken Lunch Special, and the Chow Fun, but I'm impressed most with the Calamari and Bell pepper+onions. The portion is decent and the price is good for the serving size.  Bathroom is clean and always maintained. Cashiers will always welcome you with a smile and friendly small talks, while offering extra condiments and drinks upon request. I'm seriously a fan of this place."}
{"text":"We used GrubHub.com to place our order and it was so easy.  The food arrived in under the time promised and our delivery driver was very friendly.  All of our special requests were fulfilled and the portions were generous!  Very delicious!  I had the lettuce wraps and my husband and son ate teriyaki chicken, one with fried rice and one with white.  We also ordered a side of crab puffs.  We were provided with ample sauces and fortune cookies, too.  Plenty left over for dinner!  We will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The salad was delicious, good dressing with some fried won tons. I ordered some kind of crispy chicken dish the chicken was good but the sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Gross. There's a place down the street with great lunch specials and good food, try it! Simi's Cafe!"}
{"text":"It's good Chinese food. It's fresh and they are really nice there. I just don't like it enough to go back a third time. Again nothing bad it's just not the right taste for me. I love Chinese food and would rather go to a local place than a chain. I've had the orange chicken spicy and I've had the teriyaki chicken. Again not bad but not the greatest."}
{"text":"I waited a day to write this after my issue.  We don't order asian food delivery......ever. Tonight we did a quick yelp search and found Wok Up 2 miles away. Delivery said 45-60 minutes and was at my door in 12 minutes. We ordered Orange chicken, veggie fried rice, veggie lo mein, crab puffs and coconut spicy soup. Everything was good except the soup.  We each took a spoonful and it wasn't good. It almost tasted as if something was wrong with it. I set it aside and for the first time ever, I returned the soup. They were very courteous and polite about it and refunded my $7 for the soup.  THAT WAS GREAT. With that, I will continue to return to Wok up and look forward to trying more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Food was not to awesome. We ordered orange chicken, kungpow chicken, and egg rolls for delivery. They forgot the chop sticks, sweet and sour, and soy sauce we requested. No big deal buuuuut the food was just not good, we were both super hungry and had just a few bites each. And that's crazy because I eat almost EVERYthing! We definitely will not go back and would recommend others to go else where too.... I hate writing bad reviews, hopefully they were just having a super off night."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering from here. Very unprofessional. Placed an order to be delivered. Called back after an hour and they said they had no order. Since I hit my redial, I am sure this was the place I called earlier. No \"I'm sorry\" or anything. Bad business."}
{"text":"Housesitting a foodless house in Gilbert; too hot to leave the house in search of food. Found Wok Up on Yelp. The online ordering interface is the easiest I've ever used, and they even accept PayPal. Cashew Chicken, Pad Thai, egg rolls and summer rolls-- all delicious, and delivered lightning-fast. Friendly delivery. Wish they had this in Tucson."}
{"text":"I would try a different place for Chinese. I am still trying to get that great place I know I can trust for service, quality and speed. Still looking.  For the food the flavors we're alright but the vegetables were cut too large. It was a struggle to eat because of the distraction of having to eat it in two or three bites for 1 piece of bell pepper.   The delivery guy was like \"so you have a tip?\" And I'm sorry I just would like a hey how are you so I can at least thank the person for coming out. I dunno it just made the whole thing super awkward.   The speed was great though, they got to my house in way under the estimated time."}
{"text":"We did take out.  We had the beef and broccoli, it was really good.  The sweet and sour chicken, really good.  The orange chicken, I won't order that again.  Crab puffs, best have had.  Pork pot stickers, okay.    Over all it was a good meal, we will eat there again.  The employee was really nice.  We did our order on line through Yelp.  It was easy and quick."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup! I order from here frequently and never received food I didn't like!  They are very nice and remember you when you come in or order for delivery. Love the egg rolls! I will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"Really good Asian food. Haven't had authentic like this since I've moved to Arizona. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in the area! We got Orange Chicken, General T's, Veggies, and Spring rolls and everything was great! You can tell it is fresh chicken, fresh veggies, fresh/homemade sauces. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Bland soggy orange chicken. Bland fried rice. Took them an hour to get us our food when they quoted us 20-30 mins. Not good. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, 2 orange chickens and a Kung pao chicken. The food got here on time but nothing was very good. The orange chicken had to be the worst orange chicken I have ever ate. The Kung Pao was not spicy and had barely any chicken."}
{"text":"Surprisingly it was totally delicious! We've lived nearby for years and finally decided to try their orange chicken, honey chicken and vegetable spring rolls. The orange chicken and rolls were outstanding! Great crunch, flavor, and exactly what you'd hope for. The honey chicken needed some more sauce or something because it wasn't good, but there are so many other things to try that I'd just skip that. Oh, and the wonton soup was perfect!!   I would absolutely recommend this place for a tasty meal. The portions are very, very generous and the take out extras are the cherry on top- wonton chips and a doughnut. Totally hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Quite literally the most insipid impression of \"Asian\" I've ever had the misfortune of tasting.  We tried the Coconut Milk Soup (1/10 stars), the Beef Chow Mai Fun (1/10 stars) and something called 'Lemon Pepper Chicken' (-5/10 stars) which we had 1 bite of before tossing our $9 in the trash.  This dish tasted like they took sliced chicken, green bell pepper, and black pepper, and boiled it beyond recognition in a mixture of water and Lemon Dawn Dish Soap, and sent it to our home.  I've seriously never in my LIFE had worse \"Asian Food\" than what these people delivered.  We ate 1/4 of the soup, maybe 1/2 of the beef noodles, and like I say threw away the Lemon Pepper Chicken immediately before the stench polluted our home.  This was $30 down the drain.   I kid you not, Panda is like a 5-star restaurant in Downtown Beijing compared to this place.  If you're looking for Thai delivered, Thai Chili is quite decent, definitely order from them.  If it's Chinese you want, hopefully you're in the delivery area of King Wok, which is fantastic, given it's Gilbert AZ we're talking here.  I promise you, either of these blows Barf, err, sorry Wok Up AWAY ... so, so hard.  Never, ever, EVER been so disappointed in a food order.  Wife still not speaking to me ... I cannot possibly stress hard enough how awful ALL three dishes we ordered were ..."}
{"text":"delicious food! the delivery time was quick and our food was made perfectly. i would happily give up my first born son if it meant i could eat here for free. i would recommend to everyone in the phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Food was perfect. Fiance and I ordered food on a day when I didn't want to cook and they delivered straight to my door. Only bummer is in order to get delivery you must order a fifteen dollar minimum.  We ordered three lunch plates and liked it so much we ordered three dinner combo plates the same day and ate those too."}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place out yesterday and I'm glad we did! I had ordered the orange chicken and my boyfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken and we also ordered the crab puffs as an appetizer.  The food was all very good! I actually really enjoyed my boyfriends teriyaki chicken. I will definitely get that next time we go. The crab puffs were very tasty. We also didn't have to wait very long for anything we had ordered.   The staff was very friendly and attentive. They were on top of getting our drinks refilled and they would sop by to make sure everything was well. The restaurant was very clean looking. The only thing that was weird was the decor. The front desk area looked really nice and the rest of the place kinda looked like it was unfinished.   I will definitely be back to this place. I think next time I will try their delivery service. I'm glad I've found a good Chinese food restaurant so close to my house!"}
{"text":"I came to Wok Up back in November when I visiting my relatives for Thanksgiving, but never got a chance to write a review.  I was recommended to Wok Up by a relative of mine when I said I wanted some authentic Chinese food. This place did not disappoint!   Customer Service (5 stars) The customer service here is great, the waiters are very attentive and very sweet. I had trouble deciding on what to order, which means I was staring at the menu for quite some time. The waiter was very patient with me and even recommended me their popular dishes!  Food (5 stars) I had the spicy coconut soup. I was very hesitant in ordering this since I can't handle extremely spicy food, but this was not that spicy at all! It was spicy enough to taste but not too overpowering. I would highly recommending this especially on a cold night.  The beef broccoli was so delicious! There were perfect amount of sauce to have the perfect flavor. The beef was cooked just right, it was not overcooked unlike the other Chinese restaurants around the area.   The food portion is decent especially for the low price! Everything I ordered tasted authentic and delicious!  Parking (5 stars)  This restaurant is in a plaza, so there's plenty of parking spaces!   Overall (5 stars) I will definitely come back to Wok Up when I'm in town again. The food is comparable to the food in LA! I would highly recommend this restaurant. They also do delivery and take-out, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Just got food delivered this afternoon and I was impressed by the quality and taste.  Not overly greasy or saucey - good balance."}
{"text":"First time there last weekend. Let me start by saying many chinese places have shot their prices through the roof but wok up still has reasonable prices. Clean place with decent service.  Food was good and we will be ordering from them again. They even deliver in the immediate area. Take out was booming on the friday night we were there. Great neighborhood place !"}
{"text":"Wonton soup was great but the teriyaki chicken was very dry and if anything tasted old delivery took a good amount of time as well"}
{"text":"The best thing was they delivered in under 45 minutes and the food was not oily. We got tofu soup and wor wonton soup both were okay but the broth has little flavor . The triple delight was good but a small portion and the chicken fried rice was only boiled chicken pea carrots no eggs or green onion or flavor"}
{"text":"The food got delivered much faster than expected, and was hot and delicious. I got the stirfry veggies and Edamame, along with the fried rice. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I ordered orange chicken with fried rice, teriyaki chicken with lo mein and 2 spring rolls... I ordered delivery and they said it would take an hour, the restaurant is only 1.2 miles away, so it seemed a bit ridiculous time frame... They did arrive a lil early, at only 43 minutes into the hour... The lunch specials come with a small green salad tossed in Miso dressing, which is delicious, but the lettuce itself was on the brink of being old and shouldn't have been used unless it was in your own home... The orange chicken didn't taste like any I've ever had, but it was still tasty... The fried rice was nothing more than the steamed rice with some egg and veggies thrown in it... They weren't cooked together so the flavors didn't infuse, wouldn't order it again... The teriyaki chicken was blandly cooked, no seasoning at all and then just drowned in teriyaki sauce, wouldn't order this again either... The lo mein was decent, nothing to brag about... The best part of the meal were the spring rolls... They were a good size with a great crisp and flavor... Overall, the food was mediocre but there are a few more dishes I would give a chance before shunning the place all together..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from Wok Up twice since moving here.  The delivery guy has been here faster than the estimated wait both times, and the food has been hot and fresh.  I thought the chicken lo mein was just okay (noodles were softer than I prefer), but I really liked the orange chicken. Both were the regular menu items (as opposed to the combo items), and I would judge the amount of food from each order to be plenty for two people."}
{"text":"I cannot judge the interior of the the facility as I have never stepped foot in this establishment. I ordered delivery to my work. The delivery was prompt, and correct. I ordered two meals, the lo mein and the pad Thai, the lo mein was on the lunch special. Total was twenty bucks delivered before tip. The lo mein noodles were great and the chicken was super tasty and all white meat. I got the fried rice and it came with soup too, for delivery that is amazing! Usually its \"no soup for you!!\" when you order togo or delivery. The soup was really good and came piping hot. The fried rice I liked alot because it had a LOT of egg in it (YAAAY!!).   Now, the bad....dun dun dun....I should have some blame here, what idiot orders pad Thai from a Chinese restaurant? Oh that's right. this girl. FML. The absolute worst pad Thai EVER. I mean, it was ten bucks and the whole thing went in the trash. The wrong noodles were used, there was no sauce, no flavor and so terrible. It had a boat load of inedible vegetables and was soooo dry. I think eating a piece of sidewalk chalk would have been about fair for comparison to this completely lackluster, tasteless, dry junk.    That about sums it up. Order Chinese food from a Chinese restaurant. Order Thai food from a Thai restaurant. Lesson learned :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place:  great food, good service.  Unfortunately, the latter has become poor.  I ordered my food online, and I received my usual email confirmation stating that it was placed.  I was given a time frame of 55 minutes for delivery (6:38pm).  Usually they show up within 30-35 minutes.  My order was placed at 5:43pm, and my food was delivered at 7:10pm so I called them.  I received no call telling me that they were running behind, no apologizes, no free food as compensation - no nothing.  The driver was very polite, like they always are, but the person had no pen on them and I had to find one in my home.  The food was hot, but the eggrolls were soggy.  I suggest pick up for this place, if you choose to order from them."}
{"text":"There is a clear difference between bland and flavor. Unfortunately a few people are confused between the two. The food here is absolutely great. It's not greasy, it's light and fresh. Too many people are use to panda express, and forget what quality tastes like. I ordered the won ton soup, sweet and sour pork, egg roll and a Chinese doughnut. EVERYTHING was absolutely perfect. Great prices, small and quaint, and not a massive chain! Thank you Wok UP! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hate to say this place is terrible. But it is. Sigh. A Chinese place that doesn't serve Chinese tea. Our tea was lukewarm and terrible. Our soup had a super spicy broth with mostly undercooked vegetable. What a shame. My meal was blah. Everything clashed from over cooked tofu with utterly terrible layer crispness and then some vegetables rare, some mushy. I couldn't tell what had been sitting out and what was thrown in as an after thought. The wall art was terrible, in the taste and the arrangement. Who puts art on the smaller space and leaves a whole wall going from front to back completely bare? Unbearable indeed. Aside from the terrible food, there was two tvs playing Spanish dubbed shows.   At least the lady was kind and the fortune cookie leggit. Alas I will not come back. I felt ill after eating there and most of the night. So much so I felt the need to come back and review after a week so I wouldn't violate yelps terms with colourful etiquette."}
{"text":"I ordered from them for delivery and an hour and a half later still hadn't heard from them other than the confirmation email saying my order had been received and would be ready in 40 minutes. When I called to see how much longer the wait would be I was told that my order had been received \"but it looks like we forgot to deliver it\". They proceeded to tell me that they were now closed so I would need to just cancel my order. I will not be trying to order from here again."}
{"text":"Happy spring to my fellow yelper foodies :)  Ok... So you know how all those menus pile up on your front door waiting to be read... And finally one day you succumb and finally glance thru them?  That's how my review starts!  Found a menu for WOK UP and wanting some Chinese decided to glance a little deeper into the menu and found some curious dishes.  I grabbed my tablet and reached out to my fellow yelpers .  The reviews were pretty mixed so I gave in and tried a few yelper recommended items.  The young man who answered the phone  was pleasant  and offered suggestions when I asked.  Although he said the \" Spicy  coconut soup\" was hit or miss he admitted he never tried it as he doesn't care for spicy... Thank you your honesty!  I ordered it hoping it would be a hit... Not a miss...  Also ordered sweet/sour chicken and potstickers ( which one reviewer said was great).  I asked very nicely almost in a begging way to make sure everything was hot and fresh... He assured me they make the food to order...just what I hoped to hear!  I even let him know that I am super picky and that I am a Yelper!   Thinking back now I guess I did forget ( when asking for it to be hot/fresh) to ask them to deliver the whole order!  I guess you know where I am going with this...?  Ding dong... A reasonable amount of time later the food arrived.  I was pretty excited to try that soup... I will say the soup was hot temperature wise and had a kick that burned ever so slightly down my throat but other than the burn there was not much taste.  There was one small shrimp and 2 pieces of chicken.  The sweet and sour chicken was ok... Your average stuff...  Nothing great nothing bad.  And the pot stickers???? Wait... I know I just paid cash for them? Hmmmmm  Now I am bothered by being inconvenienced by having to call and tell them they forgot the pot stickers... Of course they offered to send some out.  Again I asked to make sure they were hot and fresh and I was assured they would make new ones.  No offer made for their mess up....  Got the pot stickers after dinner was over... of course... And in all honesty is was not only the worst looking pot stickers I have seen in my many years of life but also the worst tasting!  They were hard and  tasteless .  I am sure dining in is a whole different experience but for delivery/ take out... No thanks!  Will we try again?  Nope... No reason to... We have HOT WOK (ray/McQueen) close and it is the same average Chinese fare but HOT WOK is closer to us... Food is consistent... Employees are super friendly and they cater to a customers wants.  And I think it's even a buck or so cheaper!   Remember as always... Never go by one persons experience....  Try it for yourself... You be the judge!  So for now... Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Tried again and major fail... Since they have \"changed\" this place is awful.... We were the only party in the restaurant.. no service only got water after 15 min... They repeatedly screw my to go orders up.... No more and I suggest the rest of you stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've found in the Mesa/Gilbert area. Hot and sour soup is really good. Vegetables are always extremely fresh and cooked just right. Decor is unpretentious, but I would rather pay for outstanding food than fancy surroundings."}
{"text":"Thumbs up on that crab puffs, beef lo mein, and Mongolian beef. I was disappointed in the orange chicken...soggy and not much flavor. The sweet and sour sauce tasted like ketchup even with a whole packet of hot mustard mixed in. Everything else was good though so I'd definitely give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service! People customers tip whatever they choose. You don't get to bully them into doing. Well, you found the right one doing it to me. Done! Deleted from lists of restaurants! ! Food is not good!"}
{"text":"Food was good had yellow curry and pad Thai.  Service was good also.  Two entrees and drinks with refills to go all under 20$"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had food delivered from this place.. but I was totally satisfied!Fast delivery, food was fresh and hot.. would definitely recommend.. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really impressed, for many reasons. 1. They we're open when a mid Sunday afternoon Chinese food craving hit. 2. They delivered super fast. 3. Guy answering the phone was easy to communicate with and accurately accepted my order. 4.the food is delicious which should be # 5 & 6.. It's my ONLY delivery spot now I will be back.. Best general Tao chicken EVER."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they are always so friendly! My favorite is the Pad Thai. Gluten free choices are available too... And they deliver."}
{"text":"So excited to try something new but I gotta tell you the food was bland. Excellent speedy delivery but the food not so good.  I have a family of 6. We all ordered something different along with egg rolls and crab puffs. No flavor to any of the dishes.  Not even the fried rice.  Although,  I liked the crab puffs even though they were xtra crispy. So disappointed. Never again."}
