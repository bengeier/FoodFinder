{"text":"Oh NO! This was an amazing spot for sandwiches  and pastries of all kinds!  The bread was baked in the shape of animals - turtles and alligators. Having lived downtown in the 80's, it was one of my must stops for every visit."}
{"text":"The raspberry pastry is so good I let the lady behind the counter slap me to wake me up.  The chocolate croissant and regular croissants are great too."}
{"text":"I am devastated to see this place is closed.  I hope it is temporary.  If Quebec truly cared about preserving the French culture, the Provence would have made sure this place was around forever.  Almond Croissant here was the gonzo croissant 20 yrs. bf DAB.  The meats, bread and sandwiches were so good they could have charged twice as much in my mind.  In a great food town, this place still shined.  adieu vieil ami."}
{"text":"A very nice traditional French bakerie & deli. They have fresh baguette, rolls, desserts, cold case with cheeses, pates, and duck confit. 
We got a very nice cheese and spinach quiche. They boxed it up with string. Great customer service and wonderful quality."}
{"text":"Lucky I'm too lazy to make the trip to this yummy place. Because if I were not so lazy, I would be a thousand pounds.

The pastries here are SO good. My suggestion to you is to say that you want one of EVERYTHING. Then eat them all one by one in the comfort of your own home. And pick the ones you like best. And go back again and order more than one of those ones. And then go home. And eat them all one by one. Repeat. Endlessly.

Because it is better to eat them right away while they are fresh.

Try this! You might just make yourself feel sick and never want to eat pastries again. And that would be ultimately very good for your health. But trust me, it would not last for that long... because this place is good."}
{"text":"Wow! Everything looks amazing here. 
After a heart wrenching 10 minutes, I settled on some kind of almond Danish. It didn't disappoint. Fell apart in my mouth. Flakey and gooy at the same time, and surely fantastically fattening. But totally worth it. I want to eat many, many more, but I'm in Montreal and that means I gotta leave room for poutine too."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever. I have tried it again recently and it was underwhelming to say the least. Some easy to do pastries were fine, but their \"Mille-feuille\" was really not that great."}
{"text":"Cette pâtisserie est l'une des rares pâtisseries indépendante offrant des produits de grande qualité à Montréal. Malgré que son nom nous indique qu'elle est belge, on y retrouve les principales pâtisseries françaises, dont les incontournables Paris-Brest et les éclairs au chocolat. On y retrouve également davantage de petits gâteaux que de tartelettes (est-ce la une caractéristique belge ?), de même que du pain, de la charcuterie, du fromage et des plats préparés. Cette dernière catégorie de produits a tout particulièrement retenu mon attention, car les plats semblaient très savoureux, mais surtout, parce que les portions étaient généreuses, ce qui est rare en matière de plats préparés. Le plat de cassoulet proposé, qui était très alléchant, offrait une très grosse portion, ce qui est normal pour le cassoulet, qui est un plat de campagne, qui doit par définition être généreux. Et, à 13,49 $, les amateurs de ce plat typiquement français en auront pour leur argent."}
{"text":"I visited this bakery during a recent (and first ever!) trip to Montreal.  It was located down the street from our hotel, so I walked over pretty much as soon as we checked in.  I brought back a chocolate croissant, a chocolate 'opera' pastry as well as a bag of hard candies.  The pastries were delicate and and tasted as delicious as they looked.  When I return to Montreal, I will definitely stop by before leaving!"}
