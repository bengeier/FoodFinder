{"text":"The membership is only offer to people who are in the creative industry (i.e films, arts, music...etc.).  My friend who has membership there invited me out for brunch, and I have to say it was amazing.  I love the freshness off the food, and the options available.  The decor. makes you feel like your in New York or London.  If your in the arts, music, film, or entertainment industry I definitely recommend applying & paying for the membership.  Its a great place to have client meetings, drinks, dinner, breakfast..etc."}
{"text":"As was stated before, aside from the pizzas, the food is terrible.  Except maybe the grilled cheese.  But if you're actually health conscious?  Forget it.  You can get a small portion of a salad that is lacking in ingredients, and it will be inedible due to the amount of salt.   Soho Toronto, why can't your menu be more like the one in LA?  I also tried to cancel my membership half a year early because i'm moving out of province, but they wouldn't let me.  So I have to pay $700 for a club that I will be unable to use.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent guest not a member and always love coming. Great vibe, excellent location, nice ambiance. Brunch is great. Bathrooms are charming. All round winner."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am biased though because all of my friends hang out here and my boyfriends brother's company designed it!  You must try the drinks, dinner and brunch!"}
{"text":"3rd floor is a great spot for private functions. We had dinner and drinks for a birthday. They set it up buffet style which was great so we could nibble and mingle."}
{"text":"Oh, folks. I hate to break it to you, but this place isn't nearly as amazing or exclusive as you might think. Time to drop some truthbombs on you.  I have been to Soho House Toronto twice over the last few years, most recently two nights ago. Both times, I didn't pay to get in. I didn't go with a member. I overheard someone mentioning how they had access at a film festival party and namedropped it at the door. The first time I did that, I was very nearly booted out because they had a strict +1 and I was with two other people.  Don't get me wrong, there's some value here if you look hard enough. Still, this is a case where people are more in \"love with the legend\" than actually basing it on its merits as a venue and patio.  It is not worth the $2,000 membership cost to come here. Not by a long shot. The building itself sticks out like a sore thumb amid a sea of steel buildings around it, and the mystique is far more impressive than what you actually get.  Do you know a celebrity personally or are on a first-name basis with a studio executive? No? Then you're not getting anywhere even close to the top floor during TIFF, and the rest of the events at the place barely warrant a mention. They have separate guest lists -- a general invite list and the \"other\" invite list studios use to screen people trying to get up to the third floor. The Thompson Hotel has far more varied and interesting events, with better views, and most of the time they're free or it's easy to get on the RSVP list.  I get the feeling that a lot of people puffing up this place are either awed by celebrities or they've never been to another ritzy patio in their lives. I could tell you story after story about celebrities I've seen and met at TIFF. Hell, when I was at Soho Toronto two years ago, Jason Reitman was hanging out front talking to people while smoking a cigarette. Nobody cares. You don't care, even if you think you do. We're so starved for honest-to-God personality in the local film industry that we idolize any celebrity from abroad who rolls into town. Hell, it's the same two-dozen Canadian actors and actresses everywhere I go.  What you're left with is a social club that's about 40% more private than your usual rank-and-fare, drinks that aren't much better than any other bar in the city, and most of the time, you're stuck sitting and looking around at people who are just as confused as you, wondering when the real action starts. It's an okay venue for parties and the like, but considering its pedigree and how much some people try to puff this place up, it falls far, far short.  Want my advice? Save your money, go elsewhere for film parties and find a nice dinner club elsewhere to hang out, talk shop and hold meetings at."}
{"text":"As a guest I was very impressed and might consider a membership. Very relaxed fun space with attention to every detail. I've been to many private clubs around the globe and I have to give Toronto credit for trying, but that's the problem, they feel like they are trying, they don't just do. I think the trouble with Toronto's private clubs scene is they allow anyone that can pay, no screening so you end up with a lot of wannabes."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to attend an event held on the third floor of Soho House.  It sort of reminded of the Spoke club: members only, multi-levelled, rooftop terrace, etc...  I didn't want to take a million photos of a place I will probably never see the inside of again, but that's ok.  I had my fun and that was about it.  I'm not in an industry where I might even consider getting a membership for this type of place.    The dining rooms and lounge areas all looked very inviting though.  The bartender was excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the city. Bring your laptop and work for the day, have a business lunch or brunch with friends on the weekend. The food is reasonably priced and pretty delicious, Sunday feast is great value. The wine list is solid and not pretentious. I'd give it 5 stars but the service is inconsistent.... I've had several bad experiences with the wait staff."}
{"text":"Great food, and top-notch service. A members-only social club catering to the arts community. Unpretentious, relaxed and fun."}
{"text":"I was invited here by a member, but unfortunately was not hungry enough to partake in dinner.  However, I could not stop myself and did try a few bites of the Mac and cheese and the eggplant parmigiana, both which were delicious. I also loved my drink (something paloma, made with grapefruit soda).  I wish I had not come with a full stomach. All of the food that the table had ordered looked super tasty, and I enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been here for work lunch a few times and the food has always been great. The rooftop patio can be a bit too hot in the summer because of all the glass and sunshine - it's not outside.  I have had dinner here once and I remember it was really good too."}
{"text":"I've been throwing events for years and I have not been able to replicate the service I get at the Soho House. I'm extremely detail oriented and take care of every little thing. They barely need to be reviewed but their impressive team deserve 5 stars, so here they are!"}
{"text":"I've been a member here for a year and now I can't go anywhere else. Place is chill. Nothing like the d-bag places on King W.  It's intimate, welcoming and cozy. Nobody is allowed to take pictures anywhere on the property or talk on their phones in the common areas which gives it a nice environment.  Drinks can be expensive. The food is great. Staff are all wonderful. Definitely my go-to place in the city.  The roof top patio is nice but there are better patios in the city like Spoke club.  Overall a great place."}
{"text":"Love this place. great food and i love the indoor patio up stairs. its a really nice place at night time with all the lights in the city.. great place don't be a stranger!"}
{"text":"The Soho house hosts some pretty sweet events, and the space itself is nothing to sneeze at either. It's a membership based club, so you have to be or know a member to get in. I just happen to be lucky enough to know someone who is a member, so this is my keys to the castle. Maybe I should consider getting my own membership as every time I go here it's fantastic.  The staff that greets you is pretty standard private club staff. I've done it before, and it does make you get inventive when you have to say hello as of you know 300 different people 300 times a day, but the concierge staff are polite and offer to help you with your coat and where you're supposed to go.   Was here for the California Sandwiches demo where they showed you how to bread and cook the veal cutlets for their signature veal sandwiches, this was the best event. My God, free California Sandwiches! Does life get any better than that?! And they had lots of left overs, so people took food home.   The club itself is well taken care of. The ground floor houses the saloon and a great margarita pizza. The bar tending staff are very friendly and genuinely so. Also if note: the ice in my Negroni is the best ice I've ever had. Seriously. It's beyond amazing. The drink is great, so I sip it a bit slower than normal....and one hour later the ice is still there! Almost the whole cube! The same shape!How is this even possible??!   The rest of the club has comfortable seating, and the atmosphere is great to the point where the inevitable urge to want to move in occurs to you at least a few times a visit, but alas, this is only for rent on a visitation basis, you just have to learn to accept it.   The second floor has this buffet bar where there are jars of gummy treats and candies, a favorite of mine so that gets them bonus points. Another solid bar as well. The third floor has this great indoor patio feel and some of the nicest bathrooms I've ever seen...aside from at the Shangri La...which is next door...which they have a partnership with.  This place is definitely pretty choice. If you have the chance, I would recommend picking one (a membership) up"}
{"text":"Like any Soho House, membership is key or at least know someone who has one. It may not be your cup of tea and that's fine, but I personally enjoy the aesthetic and vibe of Soho House.   Don't expect to find any branding on the building as it's more of a \"if you know, you know\" concept. Upon walking in you'll be asked for your membership card or wait for your friend to get verified before you can walk up with them.  The top floor is the co-op space, and the floors below feature a restaurant and bar. Since we went during the day we went to the top floor (they have their signature photo booth here) and worked away.   You can order food and drinks on the floor since there's a bar and staff to take care of you. We ordered a round of tea and coffee and nibbled on their meatballs and their mac n' cheese. Please for the love of food, order these two plates and hesitantly share with your guest.   If you get the chance to enjoy Soho house then take advantage of it. It's a neat experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best breakfast buffets I've ever had. The spread was incredible, the food was so delicious and well prepared, it was really amazing. The staff are friendly and very attentive. It was a pleasure eating here, hope I get invited again."}
{"text":"No place sums up the current shiny-glass-condo incarnation of Toronto better than the Soho House.   Beautiful to look at, but transient and structurally unsound.    An essential link in the three party axis-of-evil that also includes Toronto Life Magazine and the Goodlife in Liberty Village.  A place where everything screams \"look at me!\" and \"I'm special\" as loud as humanly possible to an audience that's too special to listen or to recognize the irony.   A hall of mirrors.    A city I don't recognize.   They talk about how exclusive and discerning they are when accepting members.  God only knows how I got in.  On my 'membership application' I'm pretty sure that I  literally just quoted the lyrics to Def Leppard's 1981 power ballad \"Bringin' on the Heartbreak\".   Perhaps that's the problem.  Because they're willing to let anyone who's initiation cheque clears into the doors, you end up with a pretty solid membership base of wannabees and hangers-on.   Let's be honest... I'm nowhere near an A-lister.  I'm neither beautiful, creative, talented or special... and I was welcomed in with open arms.   The good:   - It's a really nice space.  Chairs on the main floor are angled so that you can see all of the other special beautiful people who are also staring at you stare at them.    - They've got a wall of candy.  It's like having a really expensive season pass to the bulk barn.  - They run some cool events.   Nothing that you couldn't find at anyplace else in the city, but relatively well curated and executed.   Things like trivia and wine nights.     - The people on the phone have these beautifully fake accents when they call you to confirm your attendance at events.  As if you're speaking to the \"London\" version of Detroit's Madonna.  - They have great pizza and occasionally they show movies at the hotel next door.  - It's really not as date-rapey as it seems.   - The staff wear awesome costumes.   The bad:  - It's billed as a social club, but in reality there's almost nothing social about it.  No one talks to one another.   You don't meet anyone.    - Anytime the place is actually full of 'important people', they find a way to keep members out.   This is particularly true for the film festival, where members are granted the privilege of being second class citizens as the movie studios hold their private parties upstairs.       - Any events that are even remotely interesting get completely booked up before you ever hear about them.   Most of the people who RSVP never show, and so there's a constant last-minute calling the waiting-list game always in play.    Hey, this velvet rope is virtual!  - Aside from the pizzas, most of the food is terrible.      - Vapid stick insects flock to this place come nighttime.     The silly:  - They have this hilarious habit of trucking in celebrities, I think just so members can say to their friends \"I was out drinking with Laurence Fishburne last night\".    No.  You weren't.   You were in a bar where he happened to be upstairs for a moment while he ignored you and then he left.  - Then you have the Canadian personalities.   There are lots of them.   At one point you have to ask yourself if it's really worth the price premium to be drinking coffee beside the ghost of Jeanne Beker.  - Absolutely nobody keeps the 'no phone' rule.  It's almost as if it primarily exists just so people can think that they're hardcore rebels by breaking it.       It's not all bad, but it's not all good.   If you're in your mid 20s, single, social climby and secretly addicted to US weekly,  this may be the place for you.       I decided to not-renew my membership."}
{"text":"Okay, so I didn't even know what this place was when I came here a week ago on a mysterious date (just moved here from the West Coast). Apparently it is a swanky big deal. I would not have guessed that based on my fairly average experience. My date was a great guy and his friends were all interesting folk. That was what made my experience of this place a good time. The food and drinks were not particularly noteworthy and the ambiance (street-level bar) had a nice My Fair Lady kind of old fashioned feel, but once again not that noteworthy. I think the only thing that tickled my fancy was the dim lighting and particular coziness of the corner nook me and my date found ourselves in.  I'll have to check out the roof top patio sometime. That appears to be the selling point according to Yelpers."}
{"text":"We went for a Birthday dinner and were served a family style meal, everyone left full and happy! Surprisingly reasonable pre-fix menu pricing $35/pp which included:  Grilled Romaine, Caesar, chickpeas & sunflower Selection of cheese & cured meat Roasted beets, pistachio, maple syrup & mint Salt baked salmon Margherita, basil, pomodoro, fior di latte Speck, Asiago, basil & parmigiano  Brussels, garlic mayo, sesame & green onion  Everything was delicious, seriously! My personal favs were the Brussels, salmon & beets. Only thing I wouldn't order again was the Caesar (the taste was good, but I didn't love the way it was served) and I think the charcuterie board needed more crackers for such a large party, that being said everyone left full!  Cocktails are pricey $17 (which I expected) or you can get a bottle of wine for $45, and a beer for $8 so it's doable.  Dress code is trendy, casual & cool.   Be sure to go upstairs and get some photo booth pics! As well as a bag of candy from the candy bar.   Nice to have coat check as well as really, friendly, attentive staff ensuring you wait for nothing!"}
{"text":"I remember Soho House fondly as a place I met with some mentors before I started my career path. It was a warm and pleasant place where I felt good energy. People were doing things. It felt productive. The food however was mediocre.   Today, it has the same atmosphere but the food is surprisingly amazing. It is a classy and exclusive location with a very high regard for quality.   It's a great refuge in downtown Toronto.   This place is also invaluable for networking. It's a great spot to hold a meeting, to meet people, or to just have a drink. It shows that you would pay a little extra to have that extra quality in life. It's the details in life that prove who we are and it will show through the service and atmosphere at Soho, which will extend to your date, meeting, or brainstorming session.    Try out the membership if you feel like this would fit you. Truthfully, I don't have a membership right now, but it's on my list of things I'd like after I've reached some milestones in my career."}
{"text":"This summer, my obsession has been rooftop patios and that how I found myself on the patio at Soho House sipping cocktails and nibbling apps on a Friday afternoon.  Thanks to my friend with a membership, I checked in quickly with the front desk and then climbed the stairs to the top.  I was rewarded with a seat on an enclosed patio overlooking Adelaide St.    The Soho House offers a 5-7pm happy hour menu with $5/$7 drinks and plates.  I started with a glass of sauvignon blanc ($7) and we ordered a couple of apps:  meatballs ($5), pizza with spicy sausage, tuna tartar with taro chips, and grilled octopus (all $7).    I eventually downed my wine and ordered the Message in a Bottle cocktail ($13) which tasted as great as it looked - gin, aperol, and grapefruit juice gave it a super pretty pink hue.    Since the patio is glass enclosed, it did get quite warm in there.  Eventually, the staff opened the top awning and let in a nice breeze.  Staff were friendly and service was overall good.  Now I need to find an excuse to get a membership at Soho House."}
{"text":"The decor is almost identical to my eclectic re-use/re-claimed/re-purposed materials kitchen. Freaked me out for a while until I got use to the idea that what we designed 10 years ago is now very trendy.  Food: Stupidly tasty, fairly priced.  So tasty I would consider becoming a member. Wine list is a nice combination of accessible and extravagant.  Service: Gracious and attentive.   Quirks: no phones or food photos allowed. I disobeyed the former and honoured the later."}
{"text":"OK, I am biased .... they opened during TIFF, and didn't have their liquor license yet - so all of our booze was free :) ... so, I can't help but like this place.  It is the private, Toronto is growing up kinda swanky, but still dudes in jeans hanging off their ass and a ball cap (yet fashionable?) alongside stylin' ladies and guys in crisp suits.  Strange.  We'll have to see how this one plays out.  The whole \"private\" members deal is a mystery to me, but apparently you must go with a member who has paid for the honor of drinking and eating here.  I only checked out the first floor, but the upper floors are supposed to be devine.  I bumped into the who's who who I figured would be at this kind of spot.  So, overall, good for the styling upper scale moose lodge scotch drinking dark trying to be hip with the music too loud spot.    Should be interesting.  I'm sure will become a staple in Toronto."}
{"text":"Unlike the Chicago location, this house is REALLY open to members only (like NYC). So it's nice to have that private dining option without such high traffic. The octopus is incredible and all of the locally sourced vegetable are terrific. Cocktail menu  has some terrific options and if the weather is nice enough, they have a cute little patio."}
{"text":"I like soho house. It can be a good time and sometimes they have good events. But.. It is usually a bit too snobby and hipster. If you go, go with a bunch of good people. That's always helped me. Overall not overly impressed."}
{"text":"This places aspires me to have rich friends. The location is amazing, the venue is beautiful, and the service is out standing. Their under 27 special after 11pm is simply amazing for young gunz. Hands down the best Bloody Caesar I have ever had. When I grow up, I will definitely spend my child support money on a membership here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Soho Houses around the world.   Since they pride themselves on keeping a little bit of mystery alive, I'm going to keep this review short and not discuss the restaurants, activities and roof of this Soho House location. Do know, if you go with a member you are in for a treat.   I am going to say, if you're a fun-loving artsy-type in a business world, you'll likely really use your membership. If you're under 27 membership it's 50% off, and it's likely something you will renew well into your later adulthood."}
