{"text":"This place was East Side Marios before. They've got over 30+ beers on tap or bottled, the food has improved significantly since it's reincarnation. Thursdays is ladys night with a dj. Worth checking out for those in VSL, Laval and the West Island."}
{"text":"I thought the food was generally good. The Italian wedding soup was flavourful.  The  pizza my kids ordered was very yummy. We ordered the Mediterranean salad which was great but the dressing was not flavorful. The brushetta was good. The 16 ounce ribeye steak was cooked medium rare as I requested however one side was overly charred and there was no rub. The dessert, nutella pizza, with fresh strawberries and a crisp base was the best. Glad they only give half cause I would have finished it all. Overall all a great place for family dinner!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food in a relaxed yet vintage urban environment.  The bar section offers one of the largest selections of international draft beers I have ever seen. Great place to relax among yuppies and professionals after a long day at the office. Happy hour here is great. I was served by Sarah-Maude, a nice blonde barmaid with an incredible smile that offers great service. Definitely worth the detour for moderately priced food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great burgers and awesome pub fries. Forget was here before, go for the food and ambience."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant in Saint-Laurent. I really like the décor. There's a good selection of dishes and drinks. The items that I've tried were all very good, from the cocktails to the pasta to those awesome little sliders. Would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"WOW! what a great discovery...cool, trendy decor, great fresh pasta. I had the gnocchi and it was the best I ever had. My friend had the cavatelli. Even better! Great beer selection too. I think they have over 40 beer taps. I had the bombolone italian donuts for dessert, served hot with nutella. I was licking my fingers. Good looking, attentive staff too. One word: perfect."}
{"text":"We came here twice and enjoyed the food both times. The service was amazing. On our second visit, our server recognized we were having a rough day and treated us wonderfully well!!!"}
{"text":"This place is inside the mall across from Sears. It clearly has a \"bar side\" where there was a low-key DJ (we were there on a Thursday night) and a more \"family friendly\" side. Amazing beer selection with 30 (?) or so beers on tap. Fun menu with a nice selection of wood-fired pizzas. Kids menu was not printed but included pasta, burger, or or pizza. Our server was very friendly and brought a couple of beer samples for us to try. He was also quite willing to speak English which was helpful since our French is abysmal!"}
{"text":"Great presentation on food and drinks!! Nice and upbeat atmosphere and a good looking all around place. 
Waders are on point, fast and helpful. 

FOOD......

Food was ok... lacking a little seasoning in the food. 
-Pizza was good but need more of the toppings on it. 

- Club sandwich chicken was a little dry but not to bad. (Almost as if it was reheated taste if you know what I mean). 

-BATHROOM.......

Bathrooms were Way below standards... Not very clean. 
The wife went to the washroom and came right back and said she will hold it till we get home... 
Very dirty in side the bathroom..... 

After she told me this I decided too check it out for myself and she was right.... Way below standards....."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks amazing!! I really like the decor!! Our waitress/bartender was really cordial and helpfull..   A big thank you to her!!
The cocktails were great we had the strawberry mojito and the black beard..
The cheese platter was good but when you read the menu it seems like you are going to get 3 different kind of mozzarella (that is what we tought) but it wasn't the case.. Still it was well presented.
The ceasar with tuna was ok.. I was expecting a house made ceasar dressing and fresh grated parmesan cheese. And the tuna was seared ahead so it had a nice pepper crust but was stone cold.
The lobster pasta were good! You didn't have to dig to find lobster that's a big plus but it was a little chewy. In total I would give this restaurant a 3++ but not enough for a four!!"}
{"text":"We visited Montreal for my birthday weekend and stumbled upon this place near my hotel. Everything we ate here was absolutely delicious and our waiter was very polite and attentive.!

The food came out quick and we had a great time. I will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"C'est un excellent restaurant. J'y ai été une couple de fois et je n'ai jamais regretté. Il
Y a une bonne ambiance, et l'équipe est tres sympathique. J'ai bien apprécié les pizzas, et la biere. Il paraît aussi que le rizzoto est incroyablement bon. J'y retournerai c'est sûr, et je le recommande."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place by accident, and I'm glad we did. We saw some good reviews for a Vietnamese spot at this address (hint: it's a mall) only to realize the Vietnamese place was in a food court. We passed Itali.co on our way into the mall, and decided to go back.

We ordered the calamari fritti as an appetizer; I would pass on it personally since the calamari itself was a little too chewy for me, and the breading fell off easily. My entree was the lobster pasta, which was very good. My dining companion ordered the sweet potato gnocchi and it was pretty tasty; well-balanced and not overly \"sweet\" tasting at all. We tried ordering tiramisu for dessert, but they were out of it, so we took the waiter's recommendation and got the Italian doughnuts. They were DELICIOUS! The doughnuts brought me straight back to Italy with their orange citrus sauce accompanied by some Nutella. Order them and you won't regret it! We were already stuffed after pasta but ate all those little doughnuts. They had a pretty good wine list, and beer was good and cold. Awesome spot close to the airport! Give it a try. Espresso is excellent as well."}
{"text":"After a long day at the mall, I would prefer to go to this place rather than the food court. It has an entrance from inside the mall and I can also have a drink. 

It is a family friendly place with a lot on their menu! So many choices! We've tried a few so far and the food is good and price wise it is within the range. 

In general it is a nice place to have a warm and nice bite with the family."}
{"text":"First of all the customer service is great.My drink was super good !! One of my pizza's topping was supposed to be  spinach but it was actually rapini so very disappointed because it doesn't taste the same at all. The Bruschetta there are amazing and so is the fries so keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Shitty service. Waiter and waitress seemed they didn't want to be there. First waiter didnt even greet us and told us to sit in a place. Second waiter comes and tell us that this place is already taken and ask us impolitely to move. Once sitten, 10 minute later. No waiter even came to pick up our order. We left without even trying the food."}
{"text":"Service during my recent troop was excellent. We grabbed the special almost every day. Soup was good, main was great, and the coffee was very good.
Yummy"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this place! It's a beautiful restaurant (and very clean as it is a relatively new location), the service was courteous and the food was delicious. I had the linguini with chicken and mushrooms which was very tasty. Decent portion sizes.
The menu is pretty extensive and covers many bases: pasta, pizza, burgers, salads, charcuterie, poutine, etc. They also have a nice drink menu including wine, beer and cocktails. For this reason I imagine it would be a good place for a group outing. 
I would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Personnellement, ce restaurant ne vaut pas les 4 étoiles qu'on lui a attribuées. Le service reçu par moi et mon groupe d'amis était très mauvais, sans parlé des plats que nous avions commandés.

Mon amie avait commandé un Bloody Caesar qui est arrivé sans alcool ! Quand on l'a signalé au serveur, ça a pris 25 min pour que finalement le serveur arrive avec un shooter de vodka qu'il a posé à côté de son cocktail -_-....

J'avais pour ma part commandé une pizza prosciutto, artichaut, olives, arugula...etc Puis en commençant à manger ma pizza, je réalise qu'il n'y a presque pas de sauce tomate et qu'ils n'avaient carrément oublié de mettre le prosciutto  !!!!! Je le signale au serveur, il prend mon assiette et me la ramène... ils ont tout simplement ajouté des tranches de prosciutto sur le dessus!

Le burger et les frittes de mon autre amie étaient dégueulasse. Les frittes avaient très mauvais goût sûrement a cause de l'huile ... sans parler du burger sec et trop cuit!

Bref , je ne recommanderais ce restaurant à personne !"}
{"text":"Location: Ville Saint-Laurent (at Place Vertu). Ample parking. In all honesty, there aren't too many options to grab a drink after work in this area, unless you want to hit up the West Island. 

The place: The interior is quite spacious, with a big bar and lots of wood accents. There are plenty of windows too, so the space is pretty bright. There's also a terrace of a decent size. 

The goods: I ordered the Sicilian sangria and my friend ordered the peach Bellini. I'm not going to lie - the drinks sucked. First of all, hers didn't look anything like a Bellini. It looked like white wine in a martini glass. She said it was vodka and that was about it. Apparently they ran out of orange juice, but frankly, even if they hadn't, it still wouldn't be a proper peach Bellini. On my end, the sangria was ordinary and while I could taste alcohol, that's about all I tasted. We decided to get some food and I ordered a pizza with Sopressata and mushrooms (extra) while my friend ordered the risotto. The pizza was thin crust, which is totally fine with me, though the bottom was slightly burnt. Taste-wise, it was good but there were exactly four slices of Sopressata and they didn't even cover the pizza. The amount of cheese was perfect for me since I don't really like all that much to begin with. Overall, the pizza lacked in toppings and while good, it wasn't the best I've had. In terms of size, it's pretty big. My friend thought the risotto was decent but it wasn't the best she's had. That said, it wasn't heavy so she appreciated that. 

Service: Friendly. 

Price point: The pizza was about $20 which is steep considering the shortage of stuff that's on it.  I think in total, I paid about $35 for the pizza + 1 drink and my friend paid about the same."}
{"text":"OK, I have to admit, I go here primarily for the dessert.  You absolutely MUST try the Bombolone Italian donuts.  They are served hot, with lemon curd in the center and drizzled with chocolate sauce.  OMG... DELICIOUS!  

They have an amazing vegetarian burger served with hand-cut fries that always fills up my husband and I usually go for the club, which is made with a grilled chicken breast and served on a yummy bun.  I love the quirkiness of drinks being served in jars and food being served on wood planks or in metal baskets.  It all adds to charm.

I also have to give props to the staff.  No matter what time we show up, the service is always fast & friendly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great 5 a 7 place or place to watch sports or just chill out with friends, this place is a must go to. Cozy ambiance,  warm  and friendly service. Great selection of beers and really great food. Great for groups. I would definately recommend their wood oven pizza , mussels and fries and their salmon tartare. Conveniently located in the heart of downtown Montreal..only a few steps away from the Bell Centre. Recently went with a group of friends and everyone loved this place. Great quality of food and reasonably priced. If you haven't already been, please do so ..worth the trip!"}
{"text":"In on a Friday night at 8pm. Sat quickly. Had a meat and cheese charcuterie, old fashioned and a martini. Food was great, just right.

Two reasons I won't give this 5 stars. Service was okay, but seems like the waitress was also serving the bar, so painfully slow for second round of drinks.

Second knock would be initial presentation. Priced and taste like a good mid range gastro pub but utensils are delivered in paper napkins instead of cloth.

Would come back, but they need to fix those two items."}
{"text":"We loved this place on our trip for a week in Montreal early June 2017.  It's close to where we stay and the server said they had a new chef; we were not disappointed!  We had:
* Seared Ahi Tuna Sliders - really excellent!
* Grilled Octopus - surprisingly amazing
* Charcuterie Board - one of my best yet; some really don't make me happy

We sat outside and it was a great night for it.  The service was really excellent and kept us drinking more beers.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the seared ahi-tuna sliders.  Description said it had wasabi sauce and Kim-chi. The description couldn't be more far off. The Kim-chi is St-Hubert coleslaw and the wasabi (usually green) was sirracha (so red). Tuna was pre-cooked god knows when cause it was freezing cold. Even the \"cooked\" exterior. Tuna quality was also sub par.  With this I'd stay far from the tartares. My friend had the club which I tried. Chicken was juicy and fries were good. I guess I should have tried a pizza which seems to be their specialty.  Service was also so-so (you get the impression he didn't wannabe there). First and last time I eat here."}
{"text":"This was our first restaurant experience when we arrived in Montreal for a 7 day trip. We chose this restaurant because it was fairly close to our hotel. It is attached to the Place Vertu Shopping Center which was a nice walk after sitting on a plane most of the day.

The restaurant itself is very nice, open and rustic, a lot of wood tones. We were greeting and sat quickly but after that we hit a huge stand still. First off, the menu was in French, which is understandable but it took several minutes for a waiter to come greet us so that we could ask for a menu in English. He finally came by our table and requested waters and new menus. The menus took only a couple of minutes but our waters took quite a bit longer. 

We were finally able to order our entrees. I ordered the chicken skewers with quinoa which also comes with a house salad. The salad was well dressed and very delicious, as was the entree. The chicken was grilled and seasoned nicely, the quinoa was perfectly cooked and had bits of cranberry and orange segments which gave it a great depth of flavor, and the presentation was really nice.

Where this restaurant really falls short is the service. After our entrees were done it again took an unreasonable amount of time to get our check. At one point we looked for our server and he was nowhere to be found. It took an employee getting ready for their shift to notice our irritation from around the corner to then seek out our server for us. 

One interesting thing that restaurants in Montreal do is bring a handheld card machine to the table to pay out your bill. If not for this handy little device, I am quite certain we would've been there much longer just waiting for our card to be returned. 

Overall the food is good but that alone would not be enough to get us to come back if we lived there. The service staff needs some serious help."}
{"text":"So for those of you in the know, this was East Side Mario's and then it was Badda Bing. When it changed to Badda Bing it had the ESM menu which I loved. Feed me bread and salad all day everyday and I'm happy! 

I told my husband I wanted to go to have the unlimited salad and soup. He told me it wasn't ESM and I said I know...I wish I would have known it wasn't even BB anymore.

The entire menu had nothing appealing to me. My hi and tried the osso bucco and it was bland. The meal came with some kind of rice dish which was bland. He asked to switch for pasta on the side and that was less than impressive.

I had a cheese pizza and it was okay. The wood burning pizza oven gives a nice crisp crust which was great. 
We had this amazing dessert with Nutella and lemon. Yummy.

I don't know if the food was bad, bland, or boring or if I was just upset they didn't have my salad but I didn't like anything but that dessert.

I would recommend the bar side for those of you who are into beer. They have like 30 beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with friends. I usually choose their pizzas on the menu to share for 2 or 3. We ordered BBQ pizza and fried calamaris. The pizza was delicious. Crispy crust, warm, and cheesy. I find that they give a small portion for fried calamaries as some other places give a bit more at the same price (10$). They also have a bar section with TVs so you can watch games."}
{"text":"Grilled octopus is delicious!!!!!!!!!! A must when you come here. First time eating it and was amazing!! Great selection of beers ."}
{"text":"Would love to give this place 5 stars and support the owners who worked hard to develop a great place, but time and time again the service just isn't up to par. The food can be hit or miss but there are plenty of menu items that will always be delicious (pulled pork burger, calamari diavolo and cheese platter for example!)

As an anglophone, I find it incredibly disrespectful to have staff refuse to serve me in english. I don't care if you reply in broken english, but to only answer us in french and not offer bilingual service really grinds my gears. I can't see why someone would bother going into the service industry if their don't care to serve their clientele in a friendly and approachable way. Bilingualism is kinda a thing in Montreal. This has happened with more than one barmaid at this location. Also, I know what 2 oz of alcohol is so the staff that don't know how to free pour should use jiggers. Trying to upsell me on a double or mentioning that I'm getting a double for happy hour when you're giving me 1.25-1.5 oz is not a good look.

To make matters worse, the bar staff seem to have issues managing their volume. If I sit down at the bar, I shouldn't have to wait more than 5 minutes to get a drink in front of me, especially when I'm ready to order as soon as I'm seated. To watch the male clients have their drinks replenished more than once while the one female at the bar hasn't been served yet despite the montage of \"I'll be right with you sweetie\"s (in french of course), adds insult to injury. It's a bar with a lot of regulars, but if these barmaids want to grow their clientele they should start offering a passable service."}
{"text":"I had a good meal here and our waiter was quite friendly. The initial greeting was kind of meh but the rest went well. 

The food was very good! The beef meatballs with homemade pasta is quite the comfort food. I did find the tomato sauce to be uninspired but it tasted fine. Also tried their mussels in the white creamy sauce. This one was just okay to me and I wouldn't order it again. I really liked that they used whole grain Dijon mustard but the presentation was quite odd, as though they had dumped the mustard haphazardly in the plate. There were also some broken pieces of mussel shells which was a turnoff. Just based on the mussels, I might have been inclined to give a 3-star review. 

The fries, however, were fantastic. Crispy and a little spicy! The short rib crostini were also delicious and the highlight of our meal. The sauce, the juxtaposition of flavours and the presentation were all on point. One thing to note: these were all listed under 'tapas' so we expected them to be in smaller portions. They actually came in generous meal size, except for the crostini which is good to share as an appetizer. 

For dessert we shared the fried doughnuts. I really enjoyed the crisp and taste of the dough. It was generously drowned in Nutella. I'm pretty sure the description read something like 'stuffed with lemon curd' but in fact it was more like the bottom of the doughnut was 'lightly lined' with lemon curd. I actually would have preferred more lemon curd and less Nutella but the dessert was still delicious as is. 

There were a couple weird hitches in the cutlery department such as one of my dinner-mate's steak being served without a steak knife or dessert being served with a knife only. It was needed but I don't think we should've had to ask for spoon/fork. 

The restaurant might actually be more of a 3.5 in some respects, but overall, the friendly service and some (not all) items being downright fantastic make me want to come back for more. I am actually excited to try their downtown location."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Excellent beer and cocktail selection. The pizza daze is good for 2. Really nice ambiance"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped in late morning for a light meal and good drinks. We were very pleased with our meal (pizza to be described below) as well as our drinks.

Things I liked:
- a good selection of beers ranging from ales, stouts, lagers, wheat beers, and other local selections. It would be nice to have a broader selection (only 2 stouts to choose from), but I was very satisfied.
- We shared a pizza that was appropriately sized for two individuals. The pizza was light, and I felt satisfied without feeling too heavy.
- Pizza was topped with proscuitto, balsamic vinegar, fig spread, blue cheese, and arugula. Overall, it was very delicious. The one thing I would have liked was fresh figs on top, either placed on afterwards or perhaps also cooked in the oven to give a more caramelized flavor (the chefs can play around with that..)
- Staff was so friendly and patient with us. We requesed WiFi service because we were visiting and didn't know our way around. Our server welcomingly helped us with our needs.
- Great environment! Very clean, relaxed, open space. I was a super fan of the layout!!

Things I didn't like:
- The pizza was delicious, and the combination of toppings was an amazing decision. However, I felt that the pizza could've done better with fresh figs, either cooked or placed on afterwards, to enhance the flavors and texture. Lastly, although the pizza crust was incredibly tasty, I would've liked a dough that was a little more burnt on the crust, bigger bubbles. Needless to say, the pizza as a whole was incredibly delicious. I would love to try their other selections.

Overall, a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I am glad i discovered this place, we were passing by and decided to give it a chance. Nice decor, welcoming stuff. We ordered for the kids and they did not like the tortellini the manager gladly offered us another kids menu option ( by the way the tortellini they did not like was one of the best i tasted). We did our own pizza , great taste and amazing crust, the grilled octopus was very tender and cooked to perfection. Caesar salad was tasty , made with fresh lettuce. Really liked this place, highly recommend it. I will definitely come without the kids to try the bar section."}
{"text":"I came here with my team for dinner and had an enjoyable experience. The fried calamari was my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly battered and crispy with a pleasant chew to it. The poutine was slightly on the salty side because they use crispy fries instead of unseasoned fries. We also ordered mussels which came slightly under cooked but the waitress was very nice about it and promptly took it back and made a new order. Overall, everything was delicious. The portions are large and the drinks are good. 

The service was amazing considering it was a busy Friday night and I didn't have to ask for refills, she would quietly switch my near empty soda cup for a full one..it was like magic."}
{"text":"We tried this place for dinner the evening of a huge concert at the Bell Centre and were able to be seated without an issue and served in the perfect amount of time to make it on time for the show. (They took the time to prepare a special menu that night to ensure fast service and no delays, which was a smart and thoughtful move on their part). The location is pretty big and offers seating indoors and outdoors, with a casual laid back atmosphere. The pricing was fair, portion sizes were big enough without being overkill and the service was warm/friendly and quick , so really no complaints there either.  We tried cocktails to start, they have a nice list of cocktails , beer and wine (I had their classic Cesar and my friend had the Mojito). Both drinks were pretty huge (and they didn't skimp on the booze) My Cesar had good flavor with a touch of spice to it and the Mojito was very refreshing without being too bitter or too sweet, really well balanced.  We ordered the sausage pizza and the Cavatelli with Rapini and sausage. The Cavatelli was very good-perfect cook on it , it wasnt too heavy and had such nice flavor from the classic combo of italian sausage and rapini - I would recommend this dish! The sausage pizza was good , I don't really have anything particularly bad to say about it but I don't really have anything that stood out to me about it either- Nice cook on the dough , it was thin crust with a generous amount of toppings. The pizza bar is set pretty high in Montreal and while this one wasn't bad by any means , it just didn't blow me away. (I would be curious to try some of the other pizza's because it may just have been that one that wasn't the right choice for me). All in all this was a good experience , nice place for a sit down lunch or dinner or for a few drinks."}
{"text":"The spicy fries was really good . The pizza was very very normal. Even the basic classic margarita pizza was very normal. Service was okay too. Nothing extra ordinary but can go on a normal day. Heard their sliders are good never tried it. My friend ordered the chocolate mason jar and it is a sure no. The pizzas are big!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food menu yet but the selection of beers is amazing! The service has always been great as well along with the atmosphere. It was very modern yet cozy. The tiramisu is worth getting so always save space, they're fresh and home made every morning so it's only while quantities last daily! Ive been there just for the tiramisu a couple times after work. Totally worth it"}
{"text":"Yes it's in a mall but wow were we impressed. Very good food, great beer selection, and service. We would come back."}
{"text":"Lived in ville saint laurent many years before finally deciding to try out this restaurant after people recommended it to me. The restaurant is part of a mall; typically not a good sign especially if attached to Place Cote Vertu Mall. The restaurant was a bit better than expected but clearly not 100% authentic Italian. Pasta was not al dente. That gives you an idea. Pasta plates are not cheap considering the basic ingredients. Grilled octopus was good but why the melted cheese? Desert was probably the best of all the plates. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beer for decent prices! Lots of imports from Europe that are hard to find (fruli, delirium etc) so that already sold me! I ordered a pasta dish with lobster which was great, but didn't have as mucj lobster as I wanted. My partner had gnocchi which were pretty good. Their desserts were tasty too, and their cocktails are HUGE! Would recommend for sure :) nice service as well, manager came to check in on us to make sure all was good."}
