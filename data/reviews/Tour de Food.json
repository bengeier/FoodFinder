{"text":"We took a tour by Tour de Food in Davidson, NC today and it was fantastic!  Our tour guide, Theresa was absolutely perfect!  She was extremely informative, friendly, and accommodating. She took us to 6 different restaurants/food establishments that covered a complete array of unique foods.  We had southern food that melted in your mouth at the Brick House Tavern,  delicious pizza at Fuel Pizza, and yummy chicken wings and hummus at FlatIron.  Went to Toast for a wonderful breakfast, the Soda Shop for a milk shake and sandwich and ended at the South Main Sweet Shop for a chocolate treat to die for - try the \"Plum & Fig\"! Theresa gave us some interesting history on Davidson, and all the establishments we visited. We would recommend this tour wholeheartedly!  It was excellent and we look forward to enjoying another tour with this company in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Food tours are all the rage in Charlotte right now and we had the opportunity to go on Lisa's Tour de Food Uptown Experience.  Tons of food and a dash of the history of Charlotte mixed in, this walk and eat tour was a great way to spend an afternoon.  We stopped for tastings at 7th Street Public Market, Harvest Moon, Roosters, Amalie's and many more.  And the \"tasting\" was not a tiny bite - I was full after the second stop, but kept eating since each stop offered delicious treats!  We even were able to meet some of the chefs along the tour.  I would definitely recommend this for visitors and locals.  She also has several different tours, so you can go on them again and again.  I can't wait to bring visiting friends and relatives on one of her tours!"}
{"text":"We had a delightful Uptown tour.  Lisa, the owner arranged for us to visit only locally owned restaurants.  The samplings were delicious and the owner/chef/manager who spoke to us were very welcoming.  The walking tour of Charlotte was very informative too.  I will definitely do this again."}
{"text":"We did our tour on November 21st and Teresa was an awesome tour guide!  She was very informative and pleasant :)  It was a lovely way to see the city and try different restaurants.  I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting or living in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The Uptown tour(s) de food was fantastic, I was curious about both Saturday and Sunday, so I went on both 5/27 & 26.  Lisa was so fun and knew a lot about charlotte.  She answered everyones questions with a huge smile and a warm response.  Theresa was also an amazing tour guide, she knew a lot about charlotte as well.  The two styles of these guides were both refreshing and never a dull moment.  I met some great people and loved it!  You have to do these tours, there are other tours which I plan on attending.  Oh, and the Funny bus was hysterical!!!! Brandon was the guide and Rita was the driver, two wonderful people... The whole experience was excellent!!!!!!! 5 Stars plus!!!!!    Robin"}
{"text":"We loved the tour from Tour de Food. Ian was our tour guide and he was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the history of Charlotte. We did the tour of Uptown Charlotte. Every restaurant on the list was great. Amelie's French bakery was amazing and so was the Wooden Vine and the wings are Roosters were so good. It really helped us get acquainted to the Uptown area. We also loved the 7th street market, which is where the tour began. We actually went back another day to have lunch there and buy cheese and honey to take back home."}
{"text":"This tour was great! We were exposed to many restaurants in uptown Charlotte that ranged in style, origin and price. We went to a few places that were upscale as well as some casual dining.  I have to give tour de food a lot of credit. We were perhaps the toughest guests to accommodate for...we bought tickets for one tour but had to change dates unexpectedly.  They helped accommodate this change easily and were very willing to help.  They also accommodated my vegetarian diet as well as a food allergy.  Additionally, we were nearly late for the tour when we had a parking fiasco.  They called to ensure we were coming.  They did all this with a smile on their faces, which was a big relief! We typically aren't so disorganized, and we would have understood had they been irritated with us.  Great food, great history lesson and a great afternoon. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great NoDa food tour. From start to finish. John, our guide was very knowledgeable about food, Charlotte (No-Da) and the establishments we visited. Looking forward to trying another Tour De Food tour in near future.  And I will definitely be back to several places we visited as I had only been to a few of them before the tour."}
{"text":"There are two types of people in the world: those who move into a whole new city and learn about the history and culture of it and those lived their whole lives in one city and never felt the need to explore it. Whether you just moved and want to discover the city without getting lost, or just want to try out new foods risk-free, Tour de Food have got you covered.   Tour: NoDa (North Davidson Art District): Fantastic. Tour guide: John: Wonderful, knowledgeable and fun. Restaurant list: Good. Heist Brewery, Am√©lie's French Bakery & Cafe, Boudreaux's Louisiana Kitchen, Juice Box, Noda Company Store, Trade and Lore & Popbar.  Food Samples: Great choices.   Great tour. Five Yelps"}
{"text":"Tour in Davidson NC was informative and fun!  Our tour guide Teresa was very knowledgeable about the Davidson area and peppered the tour with historic details.   The participating restaurants were good, and I would liked to have toured some places that specialize in dinner rather than a quick bite.  We did tour Campagnia Cafe which was outstanding!"}
{"text":"One of our local friends recommended the Tour de Food as an activity while we were in Charlotte on a Girls' Weekend. We feel it was worth the money and time. The tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. I agree that Viva Raw didn't really fit in with the rest of the tour; but raw juices are all the rage right now. And they were tasty. So, we weren't mad that it was part of the tour.  The Charlotte facts we picked up on the way between stops were interesting and easy to remember.   We went to most of the places listed by other reviewers and the food was divine at each location.   This was a great way to spend an afternoon as a tourist.   It would be nice if each location offered a coupon or discount if you come back after the tour. Though, that didn't stop us from returning the next morning for brunch at Mimosa Grill. (Go there. Go there, now.)  Worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Fantastic afternoon tour today in uptown with Paul! We toured six different restaurants with a variety of foods from Greek to pizza to pastries. The sample size at each stop is plentiful! You almost had to roll me home! Paul was also a fantastic guide! He stopped and commented on many buildings, statues and other architecture along the way without droning on at all. I'm looking forward to trying the other tours offered in NoDa and elsewhere. Would recommend this tour to visitors and residents alike!"}
{"text":"Awesome tour!  It was my tour guides last day on 3/11. 3/11 also happened to be Charlotte's Pub crawl..... people where everywhere! I forgot my tour guides name but she did a great job keeping everything and everyone moving along against the pub crawlers!  In summary, on the itinerary, the tour takes you to 7 spots; each spot offer different type of food. The time spent at each spot was enough for you to enjoy and taste the food samples. I thought the samples were very good. Only one spot comes with a glass of wine to taste. You have the choice to order drinks at other spots so drink on!! A little alcohol makes the walking and everything more enjoyable.   Along the tour, our guide stop at certain historical spots to tell us about the history of Charlotte.. I actually learned quite a bit.   If you are looking for something to do and just exploring the city.. this is a good one!"}
{"text":"The Uptown tour was fun, informative, and a good way to try 7 different places all in about 3.5 hours. Our tour guide, Hannah, taught us quite a bit about Charlotte history during the tour and was fairly knowledgeable about the food at each location. She was also very good about ensuring that everyone's needs were met or to ask the chef/owner/etc if she didn't know an answer to a question. As someone native to Charlotte, I learned a decent amount that I did not know while on the tour, and I think visitors would certainly be able to learn even more. I would definitely recommend it as a fun experience if visiting Charlotte for a few days, especially if you're a foodie.  As far as the food on the tour, we tried small samples at 7 different places in total; some were really good and some were just okay. The locations visited vary from tour to tour slightly based on what our guide said but what we were able to sample was: (in order) -A slice of pesto pizza with tomato from Pure Pizza in 7th Street Market which was AWESOME! I'd been wanting to try Pure Pizza and getting only one delicious slice probably makes me just want to come back more now. -Samples of 3 different juices from Viva Raw: The owner talked to us here and the juices were okay but definitely not my thing -BBQ slider, sample of Captain Jack Pilsner beer and your choice of beer sample at Queen City Q: the BBQ slider was pretty good and the bartender/manager talked to us about their 5 BBQ sauces and the beers for a few minutes. I can't comment on the beers since my girlfriend and I have another year to go before being legal age. -Popcorn, 2 red wines, and 2 white wines at Wooden Vine Wine Bar: again, can't comment on the wines but the popcorn had duck fat drizzle apparently and was pretty tasty -Salad with tomatoes and pulled pork from Mimosa Grill: the head chef talked to us here about using fresh, local ingredients and how he was incorporating a lot of tomatoes because his producers had a surplus and he was able to get them very cheap. He was pretty interesting, and the pulled pork salad was simple but excellent. -Smoked, dry rub chicken wings from Rooster's: these wings were outstanding! Not sure if the wings or pizza was the best food we tried but they were some of the best wings I've had, even without sauce.  -Salted caramel cupcake from Cloud 9 Confection: we wrapped up the tour with dessert, and the cupcake was decent. It was filled with caramel and topped with a whipped frosting, caramel drizzle and sea salt sprinkle. I was not a fan of the frosting at all but it was decent overall.  My 2 negatives about the tour: I would have liked to hear from more of the chefs/owners. The owner of Viva Raw talked to us as well as the chef at Mimosa, and both were pretty interesting. The bartender talked to us briefly at Queen City Q, but I would've appreciated it if 1 or 2 of the other 4 restaurants could have talked to us as well. Also, despite sounding like A LOT of food, it truly wasn't over the whole 3.5 hour time since we only had small samples at nearly all of the locations. My girlfriend and I went out for a small dinner on the way home from the tour actually, and I saw another group from our tour at Hazelnut's Creperie to get food as we left the 7th Street Market as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Charlotte and wanted to go on a tour that would be fun and show us a glimpse of the city. This was perfect! Our guide was super friendly and easy to listen to. We tried different items at 7 different shops. We met at 7th Street Public Market, by the wine shop. Our diverse group tried a red wine from there and some pizza from Pure Pizza, which is also at the Market. Both were yummy! I'm not a big red wine drinker, but it was just slightly dry that mixing it with the cheesy pizza was perfect. We also had a couple different honeys to try with it. I never would have thought to mix honey and pizza, but the cinnamon honey on my crust was  delicious!!! Up next we walked over to Room 112, which has modern Asian cuisine and sushi. We tried samples of spring rolls and some sushi. The rolls were pretty plain, but I'm sure that was to fit a wide audience. My husband and I love sushi, so I'd be interested in trying their signature rolls instead. Next time! The next place we went to was hands down our favorite of the whole extended weekend!!! You might have guessed it, but it was Amelie's (see the locations personal review of mine). The environment is amazing, food is unbelievable, and the people are all sweet! You really can't go wrong with a stop there. Following that sweet experience, we went to Mimosa Grill, which to our surprise wasn't a breakfast place or place that had a variety of mimosas (to our knowledge). Honestly, it looked very nice inside, but there was an odd smell throughout the restaurant that wouldn't make me want to return. We tried some type of duck and potato item that was alright, but not out of the world. After this stop, we went to Roosters to try some roasted chicken. The chicken wings had a dry rub on them with a little bit of a kick that was just enough to make you wanting more! I wish we had stopped there sooner though because I was already pretty full! Our final stop was back at 7th Street Market for Cloud 9 Confections. There we ended our trip with some delightful little strawberry cupcakes.  Overall, the tour was fantastic. All of the food was super yummy and learning bits of history about Charlotte while walking through Uptown was just wonderful. I look forward to going on the NODA tour next!!! Great experience and if you get the opportunity- take it!"}
{"text":"Great Way to Spend a Saturday Afternoon We went on the Tour de Food Uptown this Saturday after my daughter gifted me with tickets.  We met at the 7th Street Market where James took us under his wing.  It was my first visit to the market, so that was a plus.  We visited Viva Raw and Pure Pizza at this stop.  While Viva Raw is interesting, it really shouldn't be part of a food tour.  Pure pizza was one of the best pizzas I have ever put in my mouth.  They gave us the pesto pizza.  I am a purist with pizza and usually only like the classics.  This pizza was something I would make a special trip for.  Excellent crust.  We then meandered toward Wooden Vine tapas and wine bar while learning interesting bits about Charlotte history from our personable guide.  Wooden Vine was a wonderful find and new to me -- we have already made a return visit.  After that, we headed toward Amelies for sweet goods.  Amazing salted caramel brownie. On to Valhalla for a walk that highlighted the new ball field and Bearden Park.  We tried Norwegian Sliders which were good. Next we were treated well at Mimosa Grill where we had a plate that included lobster bisque, gnocchi, and crab salad.  It was excellent.  We heard from the chef and were given a coupon for a future visit. Finally we ended up at Roosters Uptown where we enjoyed a charcuterie board with housemade smoked meats.  Very good! I highly recommend Tour de Food.  I have lived here 20 years and learned a great deal about Charlotte on the tour.  I hope that the tour operators reconsider the inclusion of a juice bar on a food tour and encourage the chefs to take a minute to speak to the tour guests who can become ambassadors for their business.  We heard from the chefs at Wooden Vine, Mimosa Grill, Roosters, and Viva Raw.  It enhanced those visits a great deal"}
{"text":"This was a fun way to spend an afternoon and everyone on our tour was so nice and friendly. Our host, Tom, was funny and chatty and did a great job including the history of Charlotte and inserting little facts and tidbits. We toured the South End which included Pike's, Luciano's, Bulgogi Box, Hot Taco, and Nova's bakery. Pike's was by far the best. We were regretful we didn't eat more at this first stop. The classic American burgers, fried pickles, onion rings, fries, and shakes were all perfection. Luciano's was extremely disappointing. They served us 2 bowls of lukewarm rigatoni with rubbery chicken breast medallions in it - completely inedible. I was hoping for pizza, lasagna, or spaghetti, maybe a little bread and olive oil. Bulgogi Box served us each a small portion of their beef fried rice, which was fantastic, and a snippet of their kimchi and house made pickles with two sauces. The quality was excellent and only made us wish they would have offered something else, like steamed buns or ramen or something. For $65 a person it just didn't seem to be much food. Hot Taco was mediocre; they served us a chicken and ground beef taco. They were store bought tortillas and topped with cabbage, cheese and ranch. Chips and salsa were okay. Go to Superica if you want seriously amazing Tex Mex. BUT I will say the place is cool, decorated nicely with lots of TVs and awesome drink specials. The margs were huge. Nova's bakery was not my thing. I sampled the lemon bar, which tasted like pasty, gummy white sugar with a hint of lemon, the eclair tasted waxy and bland, and the chocolate cheesecake brownie just didn't have any rich chocolate or cheesecakey flavor. IMO everything tasted really processed, like little Debbie cakes. All in all, it was cool for something different to do in Charlotte, but I would definitely drop Luciano's & Nova's and find some better places and offer more samples of food at the places they keep."}
{"text":"Although my friend and I have both lived in Charlotte for over a decade, NoDa is one of our favorite Charlotte 'hoods, so it made sense for us to book a NoDa food tour for our monthly \"Girls' Day Out.\"  We met our group at the back bar inside Heist. With ten minutes to spare, and no sign of our tour guide, I grabbed a beer for my friend. One of the Heist partners, who would later give us a tour of the brewery, chatted with us and another tour couple until our guide arrived.   Once the lovely guide was there, a count was taken, and we headed to the big brewing tanks. I really enjoyed learning about the brewing process and the history and future of Heist. Now that we knew how our beer was brewed, we each got samples of one beer. Here's my first suggestion - give us at least a half pint. Better yet, give us a mini flight upstairs where we go for the tasting of flatbreads.   After we went upstairs, the Heist partner provided us with more stories about the brewery. While these were interesting, it was VERY hard to hear ... and those flatbreads weren't getting any warmer! As for the flatbreads, please put them on separate plates. People were hungry, and as a result, most folks dived in and grabbed the bulk of them. If you're offering a variety of flavors, please let us try each one.   As a bonus, treats from Am√©lie's were provided along with a brief history of this Charlotte landmark. Because my friend and I had been to Am√©lie's just BEFORE the tour, we were a little Am√©lied-out. What I couldn't understand, especially post-tour, was WHY we hadn't just headed over to this eclectic patisserie. I'm confident EVERYONE would have loved it. To me, the shop is just as important as its offerings.  After Heist, we walked to the Juice Box Juice Bar. Why? No, seriously. Why? It was loud, hot, and let's face it, no one in our group was excited to taste Green Machine and Berry Happy. Plus, it's not as if anyone from the shop gave us a history of the place or really talked to us other than when we asked questions.   Moving on, we then made our way to the NoDa Company Store. Again, why?! It's a cute little shop, and yes, Baily, the chocolate Labrador is adorable, but this is a food tour. We got samples of Sangria while the guide popped open a tub of pimento cheese and a pack of crackers. Not kidding.  Probably the most enjoyable part of the tour was an unscheduled stop at the NoDa Dog Bar. My friend and I laughed because when I picked her up for the tour, her dog wanted to come with us, but we told Duke that dogs weren't allowed. Duke would have LOVED the Dog Bar! Any dog would love the Dog Bar. Actually, any human who loves dogs would. There were dogs everywhere, including literally ON the bar!  Our next food stop was across the street at Fud at Salud. I love Salud, but have to confess that I'd never eaten upstairs. Whoa! It's an awesome space - especially compared to the cramped quarters downstairs at the bottle shop/tap room. Our food offering was their well-known chicken and waffles. We each received a quarter of a waffle, which frankly, was more than sufficient. It's a yummy treat, but I couldn't have eaten more. Again, nobody from Salud spoke to us or gave us any info about the restaurant/tap room/shop.  Right around the corner was the much-anticipated Boudreaux stop. I was especially excited because it's one of my friend's favorite restaurants, and I was super stoked that she'd get to meet the chef. We all got separate mini-plates of their signature jambalaya and a piece of cornbread, but no chef, no history, nothing.   Our final stop was at Popbar, a fairly new addition to NoDa. This was my favorite food stop because the owner spoke to us and explained how they make the delicious gelato bars. Surprisingly, we each got our very own WHOLE bar. It was delicious.  Overall, I really enjoyed the tour, but let's face it, my friend and I are two busy moms who needed to get out of the house and catch up with each other. The weather was perfect, and it wasn't too crowded. And it's NoDa. 'Nuff said.  Here are some suggestions for improvement:  1. Take a few minutes for participant introductions. Trust me - it would help. A LOT!  2. Don't meet downstairs at Heist. It's crowded, loud, and not conducive to starting a tour. 3. Rethink your restaurant choices. Seriously. There are LOTS of awesome restaurants in NoDa. Why in the world do you include places like Juice Box and NoDa Company Store? They were such a waste of time and offered nothing to make this a good tour. 4. Bring out the restaurant folks. You advertise that we'll meet the chef or owner. We did in only two places. This was my biggest disappointment. Without a restaurant rep, anyone can create their own walking tour and get more food for less money. Just sayin'! 5. Provide more samples, or at best, offer more when they run out. I would love to meet the people who said they were full from your tour."}
{"text":"This was our second tour. the host was super nice. Wish they had mentioned where we were to meet and not just an address. Thankfully the tour guide did call me as we were outside. Everyone on the tour wee super nice. Love the wine place, the Italian place was a bit disappointing as I was expecting a hot sample and they gave us chocolate. They said because of the wine but you don't eat dark chocolate with Rose. If you tell us you moved to the back so you could have a kitchen to cook and you sell items to cook, show us the sauce.  Mimosas was the best place as we were served on a plate as I think the tours shoudl be. The test of the paces were more of a hand out. Amalie's shoudl have given a variety as the one item cut in threes just did not show how great their items are. The taco place should have give one chicken and one fish as some people had no choice.  The best part was our host and enjoyed the walk around."}
{"text":"We went on this tour on Sunday the 23rd.  Our guide was pleasant and well informed. It was a nice outing. That said, we felt the price was a bit high for the caliber of places we visited. For us, we look at tours such as this as not just a way to see the city, but to sample some small tastings at some of the nicer restaurants in Charlotte. Truly, the one nice restaurant was Mimosa's and it was lovely.  We also enjoyed the Orman's cheese tasting and Amelie's. One example- it did not seem like your standard pizza parlor was a fit. The last stop back at 7th Street Public Market was a crepe, which was good, but the server made no presentation to talk about what was being served or what else her business offers.  For the price,we'd prefer to see less stops at better restaurants to really get a feel for what the city offers."}
{"text":"What a great time my husband and I had this afternoon!  Not only a fabulous array of restaurants but an interesting history lesson on Uptown Charlotte.  Keep up the excellent work!  Incredible price for such an opportunity."}
