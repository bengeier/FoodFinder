{"text":"We had this place for the first time tonight. They have great prices and some of the best thai food I've ever had. I was very impressed with their Tom Yum soup and the quality of the food is amazing. We have definitely found our new Thai spot."}
{"text":"Let me first say this staff is beautiful. Such warm and lovely service with fresh delicious food, I would come here after a run or after gambling. The portions are great and I luv spicy food and they would make it so spicy for me... I luved it. It never lost flavor at all. Really clean bathroom, smells so good when you come in and the favorite for me in all of it is the Thai tea. Oh and they have Durian flavored candy"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Take the office for lunch, and order delivery when we are all working late. They even make some menu adjustments by request which is great.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I purchased the LivingSocial deal back in June and finally went last week with a girlfriend who also enjoys Thai food. 

My friend ordered the Spicy Basil with chicken with a heat level of 5. The waitress said that the heat level 5 was on par with the heat of a jalapeno. I feel it is safe to say that my friend would disagree with that statement since she normally eats things hotter than a jalapeno and she was sniffling by halfway through the meal. She said it was good, but she would stick with her usual Pad Thai next time. 

I picked the Crispy Chicken with Spicy Plum Sauce with a heat level of 2 (My middle name might as well be \"Wimp\"). The vegetables under the chicken had some light sauce that was deliciously light and tasty. The plum sauce was fantastic! The chicken was very tasty, but would have been a lot better if it had been grilled or cooked pretty much any way other than fried. The fried taste battles too strongly with the tasty plum sauce. Still very good, though! 

For dessert, we both got the handmade Coconut Ice Cream. It was wonderfully tasty, but not really worth $4 since you only get one smallish scoop. 

The service was very good although it was a little odd that my dinner came out five minutes before my friend's dinner. 

I'm looking forward to a return visit to check out what else is good on their menu."}
{"text":"Great Thai food at a very reasonable price. Lunch specials include soup and spring roll and are priced at around ten dollars with a drink. The food is very consistent in quality and the service is excellent. The server is very knowledgeable and courteous while being attentive but not overbearing. I enjoy Thai food quite often and Thai Chilli is among my favorites"}
{"text":"I use their delivery service, and I've only tasted their thai iced coffee, thai beef jerky, and chicken pad thai, BUT I LOVE IT! I have  had previous deliveries from other Thai restaurants where I couldn't even finish the food because it was so gross. This is always delicious. Great flavor. Great price. Great delivery. This is my go to Thai place, don't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I am always up for new places to eat. Unfortunately this was not my best experience. The flavor was pretty good, but instead of chicken (which was on the menu) the meat tasted like turkey. (Big difference) Which set the whole dish off completely. We asked to speak to the manager and sat there for 15 mins, so we asked for our check and that took about 10 minutes to receive. When we went to pay that also took way too long especially since there was no one ahead of us. I am afraid I will not recommended this place to any of my friends or my family."}
{"text":"The food is great; dine in service is good too; but every time we order take out, something is always wrong. There have been times where they tell me it will be ready in 30 min. I get there 30 min later and still have to wait another 45 min. Another time, they get half the order wrong and then I had to wait for them to make it all over again without even offering any type or compensation like letting me keep the wrong order. 

When someone orders take out, more than likely, they have limited time, so constantly wasting the customers time due to these circumstances gets annoying."}
{"text":"I have done a review of Thai Chili 2 Go. This is a sister restaurant. It is the original, in fact. This is the only Thai Chili with waiters and they have a larger selection of food than at the 2 Go locations.

The food here is amazing though. Not just one item either, but every dish I have tried is amazing. The curries are amazingly good. The cashew chicken us to die for. The Pad Thai is what hooked me the first time I came in. It was fabulous, but at subsequent visits all the other dishes were even better. Even the fried rice is worth eating as an entire meal. Also, do yourself a favor and get some spring rolls ... So good.

The restaurant is clean and the staff is so nice. Literally one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The Tofu Triangles were very greasy.. 

The Pad Thai was over seasoned too much spice too much salt too much sugar.
The Green Curry was OK but same thing over seasoned too much spice too much salt too much sugar.

The service was good and quick.

I would like it if they could scale back the seasoning of their dishes.."}
{"text":"Just moved to Val Vista and Warner, Was pleasantly surprised when i found out that a Thai food placed delivered to my new house. So i did what any Thai food fanatic would do, I ordered up the Chicken Pad Thai and a Red Curry because i wanted to try them both. I called, placed the order and 25 minutes later the order was delivered directly to my house. The pad Thai was AWESOME and the red curry was AWESOME! My life is complete now that i live in an area where Thai food delivers, will definitely be ordering A LOT."}
{"text":"I love Thai food!!! They have the best Yellow Cury Arround and a Great Lunch Special!
Try them all! The spring rolls are good! Very Flexible on Making things Gluten Free and Veg Friendly! Love the Staff and Owner they are sweet and take good care of us. They also have a good Rewards Program to keep you comming back!"}
{"text":"Now this place has always been good to me with food and tonight was on the same scale as it has been time and time again.  Got me some cashew chicken and some sweet sticky rice, if you haven't tried mango sticky rice before your missing out, and a simple thai iced tea.  Just simply awesome."}
{"text":"Went to try the lunch special today and was doing a \"Happy Dance\" in my chair. 
I got the yellow curry with chicken # 3 with the spice level 7. And the curry was spicy and sweet at the same time. I loved it.  The egg roll was veggie ( just ok for me) but my Jazzy liked it.   I would defiantly go back for MORE...  Can't go wrong for $6.95 for lunch and its actually filling and Good !!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Thai! They even have a really tasty Thai Beef Noodle Soup.  The scale of heat/spice is off at times.  I order a 5 (scale 1-10) and my lips felt burnt for a few hours.  I would recommend going lower on the scale and adding your own heat."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Vegas - their taste and use of spice (not heat, just spice) is masterful.  Pad kemao (drunken noodles) == amazing!!!

Basil Chicken = the best in vegas.  I get this everywhere I travel to
Pad Prik King = The best thai beef dish I've ever had.  The best 8.00 for an entree I've ever spent in the USA.  

AND!!!

Hands down the best lunch special in ALL of Vegas, not just Thai food!!!!!!!!!!
Salad
Soup
Two potstickers
AND extremely delicious thai food BIG portions
AND vanilla ice cream

7.95

Can you beat that?

Why I know this:

Aahaan aroy mak mak == I know how to say your thai food was extremely delicious... In Thai
Been to Thailand
Sampled most Thai in Vegas and around the West Coast
Love me some Thai
Been to Lotus like 50x since before Yelp existed =)"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food at a good price. We picked it up and ate at home. Tasty. Our son loved the beef and broccoli. The red curry is excellent and the Tom Khao soup."}
{"text":"Great food period. First time I have ever had Thai food, it was excelent. The service was great, friendly as can be, and seemed family owned. The place is a little small but adds great variety to avon lake. 
Like I said Ive never had thai food before but my plate looks just like what i always see on food net.
I highly recommend this one"}
{"text":"Ok, so after several years as a yelper this is just my second review. I lack the time to comment on hardly any of the places I visit. (plus I hardly stray away from my norms) Thai Chili is the best meal that I can honestly remember having. Perhaps a bit of it had to do with the beautiful woman sitting across from me but I had such an amazing dinner. Sat quickly, food was brought out amazingly fast, service was awesome, great ambiance, and the food.... Wow! Drunken noodles @ a level 5 was perfect. Wifey had the mango curry @ level 2 and it was also great. (not as good as mine though ;)) Owners were more than willing to chat and really get what customer service is all about. Oh yeah, and the homemade coconut ice cream....crazy good."}
{"text":"Best service i ever seen. I have a warm welcome everytime i came to this place.
You should try the fry rice with pineapple or number 1 in fry rice list ( i forgot the name)
I always come this place when i go to lasve gas"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Quality ingredients...great service...nice atmosphere. Food is always hot and delicious....even take out. Very diverse menu and great to try something new each visit. Very authentic flavors and ingredients. A local once a week favorite of ours!"}
{"text":"One word: ADDICTING! I am in love with Thai Chili. The spicy eggplant is to die for and the red curry is simply delicious. Pad prang is my favorite but the drunken noodles are a close second. I have never been disappointed and always leave with leftovers. I love the fact that you can choose your level of \"heat\" and customize the dishes by selecting the meat choice. I have honestly not ordered something here that I do not love. Be adventurous and give it a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant. Mid priced but worth it. Best yellow curry I have ever had. Small dining room but the take out is prompt and just a good."}
{"text":"we used to eat here and take out all the time.  However, since they opened their new restaurant in Queen Creek this one has really gone down hill.  The last order was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Ew don't even bother with this so called \"Thai\" place. Came here cause we were on vacation here in Cleveland and it was down right the worst Thai food I've had. The server was sooo rude I couldn't even believe it she was mumbling under her breath because we had to send a couple of dishes back. The overall taste was fishy and nasty along with the same horrid service. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best Thai food in all of ARIZONA. (And I have tried a lot of Thai places here). The chicken Panang is off the charts good. Everything on their lunch special menu is excellent. The lunch comes with a great little salad and spring roll. Can't beat that deal. 

Our office is down the street and we come at least once a week. Probably my favorite restaurant out there right now!!!!!

And the servers are awesome!"}
{"text":"So good! I had the Shrimp Chuchi curry and loved every bite. Shrimp was perfectly cooked and the serving of shrimp was of good quantity. We also had the duck curry and pumpkin curry; all amazing!  I really appreciated the extra serving of rice at no charge and my little girls crispy chicken w/ veggies and fried rice was super; she loved every bite, even the veggies. So impressed!"}
{"text":"If I could choose zero stars I would've done that. We went here for lunch, and had to wait for a table, which is fine except there's really nowhere to wait. When we were finally sat, we waited approximately 15 minutes before someone took our drink order, and we put our food order in then as well because we were afraid no one would come back to take that order. We waited around 55 minutes, and I decided to finally tell them to pack up our food to go. Someone else in our party actually ended up canceling her order , Which worked out fine because they told us they hadn't even made her food yet. Very poor service, I don't mind waiting at restaurants, I understand that happens, but almost an hour before we even got our food, and it was because we asked to have it packed up to go. There was never even an acknowledgement that we exsisted, how about \"is everybody doing okay\", \"food will be out soon\", \"can I refill your water\" We were completely invisible. I have no idea how long we would've actually waited there for our food to be brought to us. As far as the food, when I finally got home where I could eat, I had ordered spice level 1 and my food was I would guess at about a 3 (where your lips burn and your nose is running a little) and it contained mushrooms when I had asked for none. All around terrible experience unfortunately."}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD IN TOWN, HANDS DOWN. Great service, amazing food. had the Tom kah soup, spring rolls and pad Thai. I've been trying places in mesa for a couple years now and this one is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Small, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff. Waited about 30 min. on a Saturday night for two.

Ordered.....
tom yum Gai (hot & Sour Soup) $3.50 Thai hot & sour soup with chicken, mushrooms, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime - LIKED THE SOUP!

Ordered the; Sa-te chicken $6.95 Tender dark meat chicken marinated in Thai spice, barbecued and served with cucumber sauce and peanut sauce, - I LIKED THIS APPETIZER JUST NEEDED SOME MORE HEAT.

muS-Sa-mun curry $8.95 An exquisite dish demonstrating Indian influence in Thai cuisine. A wonderful mix of chicken, potatoes, carrots, onion and bell peppers in a spicy curry blend - THOUGHT IT HAD OK FLAVOR.

pad priG pao $8.95 Onion and Jalapenos stir- fried in our homemade chili sauce - I WAS HYPED FOR THIS DISH, BUT THE DISH JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE HEAT AND FLAVOR I EXPECTED.

I will give this place another try.  After talking to one of the owners they have Dry Garlic Chicken!"}
{"text":"We have been searching for good Thai food in Mesa and finally we found it!  The curry is amazing and the beef is amazing!  We tried a dish with delicious peanut sauce over beef and vegetables and now I can't stop thinking about it.  This place will definitely become our regular spot.  We can't wait to try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"Slow, no refills and sticky rice was so hard I gave it back and he told me that's how it is and returned it to me, if I didn't like it then why the hell would you give it back?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food in the area! Since they have a gap during the day when they're not open, I've tried 3 or 4 other places nearby, and have been disappointed every time! Well worth waiting until they are open. The BEST chicken pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and I was happily surprised by the authenticity and quality of the food. I had the Chicken Pad See Ew and Shrimp and Pineapple Red Curry, both medium spiced. Both very flavorful and delicious! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Thai restaurants and they are the absolute best,everything is so fresh and authentic tasting and like others said the owners are very friendly.For to-go orders they are very fast too"}
{"text":"I'd say this is so so Thai food. It's not bad and better than most in the area since Swan Thai seems to have changed owners or something. I've been here twice once I enjoyed it and once I did not.I like the red curry but didn't like the larb.it was bitter. They do have an accurate spice level. A five is a five meaning Thai hot unlike most places where a three is for wimps. I will continue to go here when in need of Thai food that is passable and nearby but no Larb."}
{"text":"Best authentic Thai food especially Tum Kha kai ( spicy chicken coconut soup), it tasted exactly like the one I had in Thailand ( spicy, creamy, sour, salty,and little bit sweet) I don't know, it s  just perfect. Must try....."}
{"text":"Thai chilli is definetly the best Thai Restaurant in the valley. We have tried varies thai locations and the food is top notch like no other. I love the choices of the hottness ob ur dish from 1-10. The BBQ chicken is the best n definetly a large portion"}
{"text":"Originally, I would have rated them five stars because I thought their food was awesome.  At the time, I was nine months pregnant (eight months ago).  

So, about three months ago I tried ordering for delivery, the guy answered the phone, said they were closing soon and to order quickly.  I understood but didn't want bummed out food that was made in a hurry.  So, I ordered Chinese instead from a restaurant near me. 

Now today, my husband and I were totally craving this place.  We called to make an order for delivery and the guy said they were closing at 3pm and I can not order.  ALSO, he said they no longer deliver or do carryout as well.. so I wouldn't have been able to order anyway. 

That knocked off two stars.  A restaurant that closes early and is strictly dine in only.  

After that whole mess each time ordering, I will not be attempting to order from them again.  I will not be coming back at all, so not worth the frustration. 

I ordered from Papaya Thai instead."}
{"text":"Very good pad thai and spring rolls.   We live near by and get take out about every month.   Very nice owners.   I also lived in Asia and have had pad thai many times and I always go back here for more."}
{"text":"Great little Thai gem. Their spicy curry fish special is dynamite! Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Good Thai food and portion sizes for the money! Wish they had a location in the southern part of Gilbert! Even though it's a 20 min drive we still eat here once a week. 
Try the Num Sod, it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Heard it was ok thai.
Show up at 1100 am when its supposed to be open. Sign on door says 1100 am website says open at 1100. 
Guess what it was my week to pick whete me and my 11 coworkers eat.
We never got in the door waited till 1115 called them no answer.
Table thai down street eas awesome.  They opened early for us. Excellent food.
Bye bye chili thai"}
{"text":"I first ordered from Thai Chili about a year ago when I moved to this area.  They have a sophisticated, clean, restaraunt, but also deliver within a 3 mile radius.  I love me some delivery!!!  Thai Chili uses fresh ingredients, and you can tell by the taste of the food.  Everything I've had there has had white meat chicken, and I've never experienced gristle or cartiladge.  I love that you can order your spicy level 1-10 because I don't like spicy at all, and my boyfriend is all about the spicy! I always get their Thai Fresh Spring Rolls, and Wonton Soup, and Cashews and Veggies with Chicken (I ask for extra cashews) because it's my favorite.  I've tried their pad thai, pretty good, and some other things, but always come back to my regular.  My boyfriend changes it up, and he loves their Pinapple Curry, the Beef Panang, Red Curry, Gang ped yang (duck curry), and the Broccoli on wok.  Everything we've tried there has been great! I love this place and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and really good food. Service was really quick and staff was very courteous. Loved the garlic drunken noodles and panang curry."}
{"text":"Enjoyed food at Thai Chili, I had dinner with friends last night, Beef Jerky with chilli sauce \" hoo..wooo!! YUMMY!!!,  Pad woon sen with shrimp was great on spicy level 5 Love this. 
Taste and service is excellent, be back there."}
{"text":"Solid chicken pad Thai and a good bang for your buck for the amount you get. Sweet lunch special for like 7 bucks I think. This is my go-to for quick Thai that is always solid."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed date night with the wife here. Had the Yellow Curry w/ Chicken & my wife had the Spicy Calamari. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that our food took awhile. However, when it came, it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Both myself and my family love this place. The two times we have gone were for special occasions (birthdays). It's really hard for us to try out a new place for something as important as a birthday, but the first time we came it was amazing. Not only was my vegetarian and highly picky mother able to find something that she A) Loved and B) Had never had before, but the service was really excellent . The atmosphere is great, their dishes are so good, better than any of the Thai food restaurants I've had in the Valley (which is saying something because I have eaten at a lot of Thai places around here). I would highly recommend the Larb Tofu (the dish my Mom loves), and the Yellow Curry. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Food s good but it s expensive compared to other place ! I think it will be crowded if they reduce the price little in lunch time and dinner ! Over all I like the food ! Yellow curry and ducken noodle are great !"}
{"text":"Greet food  Great atmosphere and great service. What else can you ask for? 

Loved it. Only complaint I would have is it is a bit noisy. Other than that,  Great place"}
{"text":"Another fantastic dinner at Thai Chili tonight!  The server had a handy electronic gadget to ensure that the order was correct (I never do trust the servers who don't write down my order!) and was attentive but not annoying.  Our table ordered the thai iced tea, wantons, pad thai, yellow curry, and sweet sticky rice with mango (only $32 for 3 people and we were stuffed) - all were completely demolished with a smile!  They have an email list that  you can sign up for to get special promos so we'll see what that brings.  They also have a very clean restroom which is not always the case for small restaurants.  I'd recommend a 3-4 on the spicy level if you are a wuss like me but like a *little* kick."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food! Take out was ready in 10 minutes and the prices are great as well!!"}
{"text":"We love this place, fresh food, made to order, gluten, soy, peanut free on certain dishes.  I feel like in the Cheers Bar, they know my name and recognize my voice for phone orders.

Love Amber the manager, she is AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"For the price and portion and authenticity of the food I give this place 5 stars, I've been.searching for Thai food that is as close to home as possible and this place hits the spot, the larb is made just right their sticky rice is legit, everything I've ordered from this place has been good, but I do have to remind them to give me.extra chili, lime, and.fish sauce to make it thai.style rather than farang (foreigner) style."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday and he's allergic to shellfish, the last time we went the for dinner it was no problem, now the chef had an argument about cooking without the shellfish and   yield at my husband and I to go to another restaurant. Incredibly rude."}
{"text":"I love a good hot Thai dish and they are true to their name. A side of lime leaves and extra rice is occasionally in order. The seafood dishes are delicious. The atmosphere is calm and relaxed. The staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great service but the food was average. I ordered several different dishes, one was too salty and the other was sweeter than it should be."}
{"text":"Finally found my Thai place! Great food, decent prices and a rewards card for regulars?! Sweet. Found this place last week, ate there 3 times already, love it!"}
{"text":"Eaten here many many times this last time was our last straw. Continuously delivering poor service is our reason. The food is probably 2.5 stars but is very Americanized. It's too bad we don't have the good places by our house. But no I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Gilbert! Very friendly staff and owner."}
{"text":"There are several decent Thai restaurants in the East Valley (incidentally, there are also several bad Thai restaurants).  Well, I'm happy to say that Thai Chili is a nice addition to the bunch!  Thai food is heavy on the spices, both seasoning and heat level, and Thai Chili doesn't disappoint.  I've only had lunch here - so, I can't speak to the dinner service.  Lunch specials are the standard fare (Pad Thai, Pad See Iw, Thai fried rice, various curries) and include rice, soup or salad (depending on the season, I believe), and an egg roll.  The entrees are tasty, and they aren't joking about the spice level.  I usually like spicy, but a 5/10 was already reaching my limit!  Soup and the egg roll are so-so, but that's okay since the portion size of the entree is satisfactory.  As of today's date, the price for the lunch special is $6.95, which isn't too bad.

Service is polite and friendly, though can get backed-up if there is a big lunch rush."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good.  The owners are the ones cooking and serving so the pride of ownership shows in both quality and friendliness. The wife who does most of the cooking is from Thailand so the food is authentic."}
{"text":"This is simply GREAT Thai food. The menu is extensive and the prices are very reasonable. Each person in my party ordered something different and each was outstanding.

I agree with another reviewer that the service is a bit slow and/or things weren't quite right. (They had a hard time understanding that the soda was flat and our explanation about changing the CO2 cartridge.)  On the other hand the service was very friendly. I am chalking this up to the seemingly very apparent 'newness' to this Country of the staff. They seem to be trying very hard to pick up on the English language and our way of doing things. Give them some time to adapt and the service will be every bit the 5 that the food is.

If you love Thai definitely try Thai Chili, I will be returning often as will all the members of the party I visited with."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 3 years. Always great food! However we just went in today and they now only serve Thai beer. We always used to get kilt lifter but now it's only Thai beer. Don't know if we will be back.

Again, food was still the same great Thai food. 

3 stars for no beer choices."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai restaurant in Avon Ohio. We absolutely love everything at this rocks restaurant. Additionally, they accommodate gluten-free."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the city, hands down. I go there about once a week for lunch. The panang is amazing and the green curry with chicken is also fantastic. Nothing else to say. They have a customer for life."}
{"text":"I really love the food here and the owner is from Thailand which makes a big difference when it comes to authentic Thai food !! 
I've never eaten anything here I didn't like and they are always very friendly 
As a matter a fact I think I may have to get some for dinner tonight !! Over and out"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and probably the best thai joint I'd ever been to. Definitely recommend this place. The servers are very kind and the food is really unique"}
{"text":"Great service and Gluten Free friendly! I have eaten here many times and have never been sick from gluten!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food west of Cleveland! Lunches are fresh in a relaxing atmosphere, tables are beautifully dressed and everything's served with a touch of modest and casual elegance. Highly recommended starters include the A1 Siam Crispy Roll and the A9 Tofu Triangles. We haven't been disappointed with any of the entrée selections - including the \"go-to\" L17 Pad Thai. this place is in the running for Best in Cleveland and certainly has a shot at winning. Double check your Apple Maps location - Google Maps seems to have it right."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff always helpful. Took my whole work there they were very accommodating to a large group with no notice.  I also call in Lunch to go and its always ready to go when I show up. I highly recommend this place my favorite is pad Thai chicken with peanut sauce a+++++ This place rocks. I get zero spice but most got 2-3 it is a little bette with some spice take a little of the sweetness out of the sauce."}
{"text":"This place is simply the best. Fresh, spicy, and fun. Very popular,  always a crowd, so come early"}
{"text":"Considering that I find a lot of the restaurants in the Gilbert area on the bland side, I am delighted with the quality of food at Thai Chili! Their dishes are always freshly prepared, very flavorful, with friendly and attentive staff. I have been going there since they have opened and their food and service is consistently great. The roast duck is always wonderful, never gamey tasting or greasy with crisp skin. Pricing is reasonable, too."}
{"text":"Thai Chili has become my go-to restaurant since I moved to Henderson. I discovered it one day, and I am glad I decided to eat here. There is one woman who works there, and she always says hi. She remembers my family when they were in town and always inquires about them and ask how they are doing. The place is homey and the food tastes likewise - but, that's a good thing! The woman cooks the food herself, and she cooks recipes and in a style that her mother taught her. It's a refreshing taste compared to other Thai restaurants. You can't beat the price as well."}
{"text":"Always good service, even through the busy times of the day. Coconut ice cream dessert and dumplings are must haves! Only issue is there's no where to wait besides outsides, but it's always a small wait !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Thai Chili for about two years now. The food is well worth coming. What I like most about this place is that the staff seems every courteous and helpful when it came to menu items. At dinner service, Julia was speedy and nice every time she came to the table asking if there was anything that we needed. Good job Julia and Thai Chili. I will continue to come here every chance I get. I"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is right behind my house so I've eaten here several times and tried most of the curries and found them all to be very good! Some of the combinations are a little odd (yellow curry beef?) but I think they're just trying to cater to a broad audience. 

I'm quite certain that they're using a store-bought paste but that's not a knock on them as many places do not make their own pastes. Very reasonable prices as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is fresh and delicious and we have had great service from May. She always remembers us and that I am gluten free. There is another male server there that is also very service oriented. They both know the menu well and are eager to suggest items and have it made to our specifications.

The Thai Spring Rolls and Tom Kha Gai are delicious. The Pad Thai and Pad Siew are my favorite entrees. My husband prefers the drunken noodles. All entrees can be made spicy on their scale from 1-5."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here I've had better noodles in a cup!  Horrible food!  The best thing I'll say I's customer service was great"}
{"text":"This our favorite restaurant in Gilbert. 
They are great at accommodating my gluten free requirements. Just let them know when ordering and they will take care of you.
The food is great. I always get the same thing: pad Thai. My wife explores other options. 
The staff is friendly and efficient.
The food can vary in hotness."}
{"text":"Three words - Pineapple. Chicken. Curry.

Seriously, I have cravings for this dish. It is soooooooo delicious! We usually have this delivered using Grub Hub."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and I visit Thai Chili every couple of weeks. The staff are polite, friendly and fast, the food is reasonably priced, tasty, and if you ask nicely, hot enough to melt your brain. A 6/10 is noticeably spiced, an 8/10 will leave your lips tingling for the better part of an hour, and I've never been brave enough to ask for a 10/10.

Their daily specials are good. If you get a chance, try the steamed white fish with ginger, mushrooms and green onions. Very good stuff."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, clean and modern decor."}
{"text":"Four words: Tom Yum Noodle Soup. Blows my mind every time I get it."}
{"text":"Always great service and excellent food! I order Thai food often and unfortunately I'm not always in town to get Thai Chili and it is by far the best I've had. I get the beef and fried rice, number 3 spicy... and for dessert I get the fried bananas with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"As a real Thai-food fanatic, I can honestly say that Thai Chili is some of the best Thai food I've had outside of Southeast Asia.  Finally, a place that actually makes spicy food like I remember from my stay in Singapore!  It is a nice, quite atmosphere with very friendly and accommodating service.  I look forward to going to this place every time I come to Avon Lake!"}
{"text":"Excellent food generous portions and the service was fantastic I'm very  impressed with this little restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is amazing the chef is great the service not to die and hopefully they have better waiters next time."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in years.  Excellent, fast service, nice intimate atmosphere, and outstanding food.  Big menu with lots of variety and very authentic Thai cuisine.  Big portions  too!  I had the Pad Thai at level 6 spiciness - only the bravest should go further! - and was impressed by this standard.  Noddles were perfect consistency, the chicken was tender, and the flavors more complex and enjoyable than I recall ever tasting in this dish elsewhere.  HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"Great lunch with great company. Very affordable, multiple options, and very good service. Good job."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Interesting menu and they are very accommodating for those with dietary restrictions. Thenfish in ginger sauce was amazing and one of the tastiest mussel dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Surprisingly good service. They accommodated my special dietary needs more than I would have expected. The Thai Chili 2 Go that is nearer to my house is also good, but I preferred having this type of sit-down environment. 

I will definitely be back when I am up this way next."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is always cooked to order. The staff is always so very pleasant. Can't beat the price. We have tried lots of different dishes, never been disappointed. And don't forget the sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream, yummy."}
{"text":"Very good food. Each dish was crafted to bring out the flavor of the individual ingredients. We were in a rush to get to the airport and they were very understanding. Great food, wonderful people--what more could you ask for. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time in more than 30 years that I visit a restaurant and just because my son was \"munching\" something from outside the restaurant... My god.... A tiny bag of gold fish!!! We were told that \"we had  to put the bag away!!!l\" unbelievable, deserves to be at Ripley!! After this event the food was Ok.. We did not leave just because the scene the waitress made was enough.. We did not want to make it worse"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai is a hidden treasure.  Thai Chili is one of the best Thai restaurant in the valley.  Their pad thai is to die for. I loved their curry, and appetizers are amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and everything freshly made when you order it! I haven't had a bad meal yet. I eat here like once a week. Not fancy, but they are new and just starting out. Clean and yummy. Can you ask for more?"}
{"text":"I'm a big Thai food fan and am pretty picky when it comes to Thai restaurants. When I saw that Thai Chili was so close to me after I moved to the area, I was excited to try it. When I finally did, I realized I hadn't tasted Thai food this delicious since I lived in Boston several years ago. The staff is always friendly and the space is small and intimate so it'll never get too loud. On top of all that, every dish is delicious. Some restaurants may drown their entrees in sauces or the like but these guys definitely let the flavors do their jobs. Thai Chili is always on my mind when going out to eat or taking out."}
{"text":"I work right by Thai chili, thank goodness!  I love love love them, the food is always hot, delicious and tons of it.  My go to dish is the red curry with chicken, hot #3.
The manager is so nice, always smiling. 
So excited they just opened a to go place in queen creek, where I live, lol now I can have it at work, and home."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit to Thai Chili. The dining room is nice, the service was attentive and the prices are reasonable. They have fountain refills on soft drinks (Coke Zero!), which is a bonus for me.
Panang curry was creamy, flavorful, and perfectly spiced. The spring rolls needed a little extra flavor kick, but they had a nice selection of sauces and spices to take the peanut sauce up a notch. Very good!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I'm picky about my yellow chicken curry. Thai Chili is the best. They rate the heat from 1-5. Five being the hottest, I usually get 2 BC I like to taste my food not burn my taste buds off. In the East Valley this is our favorite Thai food"}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food I've had. I'm a vegan, my mother is allergic to soy, mushrooms, and just about everything else under the sun. My sister is a paleo, gluten free health nut and my dad week eat just about anything. We are all very satisfied and happy to eat here! The service sometimes takes a minute because it's all cooked to order, but it's always worth the wait! The man that is there is a perfect waiter, patient and kind. Never a bad time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Husband and I can settle the what do you want to eat whenever this place comes up."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I ate with two others and all three of us finished every last bit of food on all the plates. Usually there's some food to take home, but no, we couldn't stop eating. It was affordable, too, and the staff was friendly and helpful with advice on what to order. For instance, I told the server that I was really hungry and wanted spicy noodles, but she suggested I get them a little less spicy if I'm eating on an empty stomach because it could upset my stomach. I wouldn't have thought of that, but I like that she was thoughtful about my order. Fast and friendly service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I've had takeout here a few times (last night most recently) and the food has been consistently very good. Pad Thai and Thai basil are my go to dishes and Thai Chili does both very well. The chicken and beef in each dish was tender and cooked perfectly. 

I also had the Tom Yam soup with shrimp. It was delicious and I will get it again next time. 

It's a small place and takeout can take a while but it's worth the wait. This is the best Thai food west of Ohio City and Tremont."}
{"text":"Great service from the nicest people. Best Thai food. Very fresh and taste is the best. Recommendations are Thai iced tea, pad thai, tom yum lemongrass soup, larb is super good, papaya salad and fried rice."}
{"text":"Wow I was left speechless! Now I've been eating Thai food my entire life and I've gone to many different Thai restaurants and I thought I knew what Thai food was, but clearly I didn't. The food was SO fresh and so flavorful it was like nothing I've ever tasted. They blew me out of the water with their Chicken Chow Mein, I've never had such fresh Chow Mein! Also ordered my favorite dish, Pad See-Ew and I've fallen even more in love with it! Also the server we had was SO friendly and so attentive to us! He let us know what sauces went with what dish and was so sweet! Even the candy they give you at the end of your meal is delicious! Seriously GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY OF YOU HAVEN'T. Worth it and so much more :)"}
{"text":"Worth the wait!!!  Unbelievable cuisine!! Best curry I've ever had.  The service was fast considering how busy they were.  The atmosphere was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted really good and Bree the waitress was awesome too!
Price is reasonable, and nice environment. 
Restaurant is open long hours!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and never left hungry from the dinner portion. I strongly recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"I order from them about 3x a week. I'm seriously obsessed with their pad thai. I haven't tried anything else, but I don't need to! They are quick and very nice when I pick up."}
{"text":"I come here multiple times a week for lunch.  It is one of the best, if not the best, Thai restaurants I have ever eaten at.  I particularly love their thick, flavorful curries.    Their noodle dishes such as Pad Kee Mao and Pad See Eww are not excessively oil-soaked or over-salted which seems all too common at other places.  Other dishes I really enjoy are the pad thai with shrimp, the chili basil with beef, and as a side dish the pineapple fried rice.

They always use crisp, fresh veggies.  The meat is always a good cut; never any fat.  For chicken dishes they use chicken breast only.

The prices are very reasonable and the service is great too."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice Thai place to eat lunch with the coworkers today. Decided on Thai Chili, nice little hole in the wall, decently sized and great atmosphere. But most of all food and service were excellent. Their spice levels were measured from 1-5 tried a 3 was expecting more of kick but didn't have that bite to it. Overall great experience and will definitely come back again. ( Had the Drunken Noodles.)"}
{"text":"We looooove it here. Eat here often & always walk away happy. Ray is such a great server & very personal. Enjoy the ambiance at night with the lightening."}
{"text":"Thai Chili was very outside of my comfort zone, definitely something I have never tried before. A place that everyone should try. It was quite interesting because my tastebuds could not identify all of the unique flavors I was experiencing. Even though the restaurant was in America I swear the spices had to have been flown in from Thailand. It was a groundbreaking experience for my mouth to say the least.
Although it was different, it was still good for the most part. I am used to things tasting one way. For example, when you go to take a drink and you are expecting one flavor but it ends up being another. That is exactly how the entire meal was. I of course have had chicken and fried rice before, but the way it was prepared took me off guard. My dessert was sticky rice and mango. I have never thought of rice as a dessert but it was very sweet and pleasant.
I recommend Thai Chili to people who enjoy trying new foods. You can also control how spicy you want your food. The server will ask you what level of heat you would like. Everything is well prepared and well served. Now that I took the opportunity to endeavor into a new culture I will definitely do it again. There is something on the menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Omg omg omg I love this place! My husband and I go there a lot and try not to eat everything... they're quick and delicious every time.... yummmmie"}
{"text":"My sister and I have been on vacation all over Utah Nevada eating at some great restaurants. We were over night Las Vegas to catch early plane and saw Thai Chili on Yelp. 15 minutes drive but worth it!  Best meal of the entire vacation. Humble location in a mostly closed strip mall behind Chevron. Clean, friendly and fabulous! Flavors! Keep the level low though can be hot even on level1. Can't say enough about how good it was. May need to drive 4 hours from my home to have another meal. A sure winner."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Generous portions for great prices. 

When this place first opened they had white table cloths and candles and waiters with ties. The service was a little \"awkward\" but that is to be expected with any new restaurant opening (especially a non-corporate establishment). However, the food was amazing! Not \"white table cloth this food is too pretty to eat \"amazing but great development of flavor and spice. Best part about it is that you get to pick your level of spiciness. I like hot so I went with a 7 out of 10 and it was perfect.
Now, the white tablecloths are gone and they aren't over thinking their whole concept. More focus on the food and less on the formality of the service. 
All I can say is that if you have tried it before and had a so so experience, go back and give it one more try. They have something for everyone from combo fried rice ( my husbands favorite) to pad Thai to vegetarian dishes. The pineapple chicken curry is my personal first choice but I am making my self branch out next time."}
{"text":"I lived pretty close by this restaurant for the past 3 years and didn't even know it. I'm glad I found it on Yelp. Thanks Yelp! My family and I tried about 4 different dishes. Each of them were equally delicious. We have eaten Thai food all over the Valley and you know how it is with Thai food, sometimes its too sweet, sometimes they use too much fish sauce, this one is really good and they season there food just right and I'm glad it's close by. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!! The food here is so delicious. They'll make it as spicy or as mild as you want. The seating inside is very limited but I usually get take out anyways."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and delicious. Let the Thai owners make the food as spicy as they eat it, and you won't be disappointed. We had green papaya salad; instead of the usual dried shrimp, they used big prawns, which was delicious. The green chili with beef came with a complimentary huge bowl of rice, enough for the three of us. The Tom Yong Gong with shrimp was as good as in Thailand, with galangal and lemongrass. Service is very friendly. We will be going back for dinner again tomorrow too!"}
{"text":"Am really bummed out at the last meal there. The service was great, as always, but did you get a new chef and kitchen staff? This was not the pad thai we know and love, and even the coconut ice cream was terrible- like crystal ice milk, and blah. please don't make us have to consider re-trying Papaya Thai, was a distant second to your food, but may now be pacing you."}
{"text":"Awful service!! The young waitress with braces was absolutely rude. The service used to be great. I would advise not eating here. Mr. Thai bistro has way better service. Will be eating there from now on."}
{"text":"Thai Chili was a very different restaurant to me because I've never experienced Thai food before. For my first time ever trying it, Thai Chili seemed to be the right place to go. I ate Tom Kha Gai soup, green curry, Thai fried rice and chicken spring rolls and drank Thai iced tea. If I ever was to crave Thai food that would be my restaurant of choice. I enjoyed almost all of the food and the flavors were like nothing I have ever tasted.
  One of the foods that I tried was the Tom Kha Gai soup. The Tom Kha Gai soup was one of the most different soups I have ever tasted. It is a sour and sweet soup with Chicken, Lime Juice, Coconut milk broth and different Thai spices. I didn't really like the soup. All the flavors put together really didn't mix for me. I would still recommend it to anybody that tries Thai food for the first time because you never know you might like it.
 I also ordered the Thai fried rice. In this dish were vegetables, rice, chicken, egg, and Thai spices. I really enjoyed this dish because the Thai spices mixed really well with the rest of the ingredients. The item at Thai Chili that I would recommend the most is the Thai iced tea. It was made with black tea but also had cream at the top of it which in my opinion made the drink so good. I recommend the Thai iced tea to anybody that goes to this restaurant and I would definitely drink it again."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars if the food was consistent.  The service is slow so I couldn't give it 5 stars. It's hit or miss here. I always order the pad thai and it's  delivered differently every time. It's either very tasty full of flavor or bland with no flavor at all. If only it's flavorful every time,  I would consider eating here more often. Such a bummer having to keep my fingers crossed each time I order to see if my dinner will be a good one."}
{"text":"Its April 23, 2017 almost one year from my original post. 
I've ordered from here about twice a month.
The food is always, always delicious. 
I'm still 100% satisfied with everything.
Since I'm lazy, I haven't gone to the restaurant yet. No need to if the food is hot, abundant, tasty,  and can be delivered so we can smack and slurp at home!
Kudos, awards, props, trophies and all to the cook!
Please keep it up!!"}
{"text":"A good change from my normal routine.  The food is very good. We had the tom yum shrimp soup and the yellow curry chicken. Both hit the spot. Service was friendly but we had to wait longer than we expected."}
{"text":"I like the food. Portion is good. However, their judgement on level of spicy is very different from what one usually perceived. I got a level 2 but feels like level 6. Better to call in ahead to order food since it gets busy during lunch"}
{"text":"I was looking for quick take out and I was craving Thai. Thought I'd give this place a try. I kept it simple and ordered the pad Thai with tofu and Thai iced tea. 

The food kept fresh and hot on the drive home. The pad Thai was very good as was the tea. I look forward to trying more off their menu. One thing I noticed was tiny bits of chicken in my dish. I'm not vegetarian so this didn't bother me much but true vegetarians may want to take a close look before digging in. 

Service wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible. The inside dining area seemed clean."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall. Food and service excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service
We had fried shrimp which where the best we had. I had panang curry they offer spice 1-10 I got the 4 the dish came out perfect just enough heat great flavor."}
{"text":"The best Thai food! Nice decor, and we had great service.  Water glasses were always refilled promptly, and our waiter was attentive without being obtrusive. 

Food: pad thai - good, but texturally the noodles were a smidge overcooked, and therefore clumpy.

beef salad - very, very flavorful.  we ordered this one spicy, and I had to stop eating it because my eyes started watering! They aren't kidding around with the heat level here :)

curry - fantastically rich with nicely cooked vegetables + chicken.

The SO isn't the biggest fan of Thai food, but we'll be back when he's in the mood for something spicy!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! They have the best Thai tea ever and the best bang for your buck prices!!! Brought my girlfriend now and she loved it too! Got the Chow Mein chicken and pad-see-eu both just taste fresh! Come check this place out Owner is amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I ever walked out on... My girlfriend and I ordered a few things and noticed little fruit flies flying around... I lost my appetite as soon as a couple landed on my food.. I showed our waiter (young gentlemen) the issue, and he knew exactly what was going on so he notified a manager.. The manager comes we show her the little fruit fly and tells my girlfriend \"oh that's just garlic honey\" are you kidding me?? When does garlic move?? Anyways this place is ridiculous I also ordered a boba drink and the boba was rock hard. Also I feel bad for the young waiter who had to act like nothing was wrong because in sure the manager told him to act like it"}
{"text":"Love this place. We are regulars here. My favorite is spicy eggplant and house fried rice. Yummy!! The service is always fast and friendly. Julia is the best server, she knows us by name, wish she worked more days. Best Thai food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Good tom kha! I wanted to give it 3.5, my wife thought it was a little salty and she prefers a little sweet where i prefer it a little salty. Great service, very friendly. Will go back and try more meals."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but I won't be coming back here because of the customer service. I placed a pick up order over the phone for a level 10 spicy curry dish. The worker said I could choose between 1 and 10, 10 being the spiciest. I chose 10. When I got home and started to eat, I found that it was NOT spicy whatsoever. Maybe a 2 on the scale, 3 if we're stretching it. My friend who can't eat spicy food could even eat it. It was even less spicy than his 4. So I called back and explained that I had ordered my food at the hottest level and that perhaps an order had been mixed up or something, as mine was not spicy. The man helping me was not helpful at all. He said that they had added spice to my dish and that there was nothing they could do for me. As I live just down the street, I suggested that I bring the food back for them to taste and see the lack of spice. He then explained that he eats spicy level 30 and wouldn't be able to tell what a level 10 was. He kept telling me that I was wrong. He actually used the phrase, \"We can't do anything to help you.\" This is the poorest customer service I have experienced in quite a while. There is Bangkok Orchid up the street, and Ping Pong Thai in the other direction. You would think that he would want to keep my business instead of making me go to them instead."}
{"text":"It's a small place, but clean. The food is delicious. The service is great. The price is fair for what you get. They made the coconut ice cream and it was really good. I haven't found a Thai place this caliber locally, and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It was hard to find the building, but their food was delicious. I will definitely stop by again when ever I head out that way."}
{"text":"First off, the place smells of sewage. Second, They do not offer lunch specials.  Despite these two strikes I still decided to give it a try.
I ordered the chicken pad thai and egg roll app. The pad thai is tasty. They use white meat chicken. The egg rolls are mushy inside. I really wasn't impressed by this place.  Oh and the chatge you 50 cents to run your card for payment. 

Probably will not return to this place."}
{"text":"Did take out here a little more than a week ago, still trying to find my Thai place in Henderson:(   I have my staples, usually Pad Thai, Panang Curry and Drunken Noodles. As this was my first attempt here I just went with the Panang which pretty much tell me if I'll be back... unfortunately I won't be back. The curry sauce was very peanut buttery and had crushed in it... Peanuts in curry just don't belong in my opinion. I also found the portion size minimal. The upside is that there was a LOT of chicken which is usually a complaint I have at other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  Would have been 5 stars, except I wasn't thrilled with the Pad Thai, which is the quintessential Thai dish... But omg the Panang curry beef and the yellow curry chicken and the Thai fried rice were EPIC.  EPIC.  EPIC!!!   (And there isn't much in the culinary universe better than fried rice, right?)  Great Thai iced tea and iced coffee, too.  Everything I've tried other than the Pad Thai is 5 star!"}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for several years so I am spoiled  and have high standards for authenticity. This place does it right. Even their determination of level of spiciness is fine tuned. Because they use fresh chilis rather than overloading the food with the dried chilis--big difference. Service is great and it has remained great since I first went there 2 years ago."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Thai Chili through BiteSquad. Overall the food was mediocre. The house salad doesn't have a description and it's basically only tomatoes, onions, cucumbers with a  little lettuce. The spicy fried rice was more vegetables and less rice. The yellow curry was okay, however they add cucumbers which is not a good touch when you want to reheat it. For an order of 50$, I've had better Thai food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The service was great. The atmosphere, relaxing. So nice to get a great value for your money! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal fan of this restaurant for almost two years now and have always had a great experience in every regard.

Ambiance:

The restaurant is always kept clean and the service is top-notch. They are very attentive when you walk in and go out of their way to greet you as a friend when they notice you come pretty regularly. The lighting in mood feels very right for the type of restaurant it is. It has a pleasant and warm atmosphere. The bathroom is always clean and well stocked and their silverware and tables are well maintained, even during rush times.

Cuisine:

I've tried quite a handful of dishes and they all give a taste of freshness and quality. I personally can handle all spice levels here so I'll suggest my favorites.

Yellow Curry: I personally enjoy ordering this dish at a spice level 3 with chicken. The sweetness of the coconut blends incredibly well and this is easily my favorite dish here. The potato, carrots, bell peppers and onions always have such a succulent texture.

Thai Sizzling Beef: I recommend this at a spice level of 2 for optimum flavor, this is a good dish for those people who aren't all into the curries and Thai cuisine, it's a good transition and has very good flavor.

Garlic and Peppers: I like this dish with chicken, the spices blend really well and the sauce is well-balanced, I enjoy this dish at at 3 or a 4.

Wonton Soup: I've tried this soup at Pei Wei, PF Chang's and a couple other places and this location definitely has my favorite. The ingredients in the broth are perfect and the wontons have the right consistency to them.

Coconut Ice Cream: This is a very light dessert and is great for cooling off after eating the spices. It's easy to share and comes with a side of peanuts that mix surprisingly well. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times. My favorite is the yellow curry which is delicious!  Lunch combo includes soup and spring roll. Thai iced tea is also great !  Nice people too."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I've been here 3 times in the past week. Love the flavorful food! The Thai tea was great. My husband loves the spicy hot dishes. Kids love it too. The owners are lovely knowledgeable and very curteous. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"We yelped this place looking for solid Thai food and were impressed. The mango curry was poetry. Run, go now, while mangoes are in season.  Beau had a lovely beef brisket curry concoction. We'll try the lunch specials next time and will be sure to order the salads as other yelpers suggest.  Also want to try the Thai soups this winter, our real bellweather of Thai cuisine. Who knew this place was so close to our beloved \"Happy Feet\"?"}
{"text":"I went on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised, don't you just love when that happens.  Great service and clean.   The shrimp toast is very very good, I love the panang chicken with sticky rice too.  Kinda pricey, nice cosy Wednesday night dinner date restaurant.

They don't sell shrimp toast anymore, bummer"}
{"text":"Love there food and friendly staff.
Tried something new today... shrimp & scallops in their peanut sauce with noodles and it was good. I like that the shrimp and scallops were big and not baby ones like other places.
We try to go for lunch at least once a week cause they have great lunch specials but today we order from their dinner menu to try something different."}
{"text":"Always good and love that they deliver. I have gotten the pad Thai spring rolls and soup. Never disappoints"}
{"text":"I have been a frequent diner of this hidden gem since it opened over three years ago.  There's not a single item on the menu that has disappointed me. The owner, Oii, works very hard to ensure that her customers are taken care of and leave satisfied.  Her food is reminiscent of a home cooked authentic Thai meal, not the commercialized variation that most places here in town have. If you want a real \"taste\" of Thai, visit Oii. I promise you won't be disappointed.  If I could leave more than five stars on this review, I would."}
{"text":"I'm picky about Thai food and I must say.. I was very pleased. My husband and I ordered some chicken pad Thai, beef and broccoli, and fried rice. Everything tasted very fresh and smelled amazing! We had it delivered to our home and the delivery was about 40 min after placing the order. We paid $40 for those 3 items (food, $4 delivery charge, and tip for driver) portions were generous and the quality was excellent. I will definitely order here again next time I'm feeling lazy to cook."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Have spent time in Bangkok and was taking a chance with this restaurant on vacation with family.  3 of group never had Thai food. They are converts because of Thai Chilli and their manager Ray, he was fabulous"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We've been coming here more and more over the past couple of years. My husband is a meat and potatoes type of guy but now he's always crazing Thai food.
We went in the other night and both ordered Pad Thai. They described the spicy 5 as being a hot jalapeno. We both love spicy food so I got a 6 and hubby got a 7. It was much spicier than we thought it would be, but still delicious. The waitress was awesome and was refilling our water while she was taking phone orders (which seemed to come in by the dozen). The manager noticed it was a bit spicy for us so he sent over complimentary coconut ice cream after to help cool our mouths. This stuff was great! Hubby doens't even like coconut but he loved it too.
Overall the food and service were phenominal. We will definitely be going back asap."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I love the chicken satay and pretty much every entree I've ordered. Eaten here three times now, and every single time I eat here, I get slightly ill afterwards. One time, the same thing hit my husband as well. Definitely not full food poisoning or anything, but definitely there is some GI distress after. I wish it were otherwise because their food is nomalicious but alas... we will probably not be eating here again due to the aftermath."}
{"text":"I frequent this place quite often because it's near my work. I have ordered the yellow curry, pad thai, chicken satay. The yellow curry is definitely my favorite. They are pretty fast with their service and their food consistently delicious! Every time anyone asks for suggestions to eat in the area, I always suggest this place. I've tried other places in the area and I always come back to this place."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Henderson. This is a family owned business with great customer service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome thai food find in Gilbert! We loved the duck curry, mango curry and coconut ice cream. Service was awesome and everyone was so friendly!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, we struggled to find non chain restaurants in Gilbert and were very pleased to find this gem. Their panang curry is outstanding, tom kha gai could be my favorite soup ever. and don't forget to save room for the custard and sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I've had better. It's average place.
Nothing special on my book. 
Tried the beef sizzler but not a lot of meat for  $14! Sauce is like the burnt bottom of the pan and I hate that. Seafood was ok should of had a more ginger taste. Actual most needed more Asian falvor. 
Customer service is ok, didn't refill waters in time.  If I felt like Asian food in this area I'll come again, but I'd rather goto Siam Orchid or one resto at Mekong market area. Sorry wish it was good!"}
{"text":"I am reading some of the other reviews....not so much.  We had the Green Curry Thai with shrimp, medium spice.  The flavors were ok, albeit a bit too hot for my other half.  The pot stickers, at 1.00 each....not close to being worth it.

I will probably not be going back....I am sure there are other Thai places in the Vegas area worth my while."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Though my hours conflict with theirs, this place will certainly take care of you from the time you walk in, or call, til the time you leave. Great suggestions, and they cater to vegans! I've talked to many of the staff here and they are prompt and friendly. Great food. A little pricey, but the food is worth a once in a while treat!"}
{"text":"Love this place! pad thai and spicy eggplant are amazing. plenty of vegetarian options. we go there for lunch all the time because their lunch special is bomb! egg roll, rice, entree, and soup or salad for 7$ of deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I love everything on the menu especially Tom yum, pad Peking, cashew chicken and bean thread noodles! If you want to taste love in your food. Thai Chili is thee spot"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Staff is very friendly and very attentive to their guests. Very service. The food is excellent. They also deliver within a certain distance from their restaurant. I order from here at least 5 times a month and I can always rely on them for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. Small restaurant that's very busy - for either
eating there and they also do a huge take-out business. The food is consistently great."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and I can be a bit picky about it because I eat it so often.  The food here is very tasty and quality is consistently good every time."}
{"text":"I don't even like Thai food but I love this place.  Their complementary salad is delicious. Everything I have ordered here has been SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! I had the red curry shrimp and also some noodle dish pad something or the other....so good. so good go try u must.  So clean inside, and fresh fresh yummy food.  I'm hooked"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in the Avon lake/ Elyria area.
The food was very tasty. Service was great and I left full and happy :) 

I was actually surprised by the humbleness and his wife who is Thai. They purchase their ingredient fresh from Cleveland everyday, which shows the level of efforts they put in their restaurant.

The food is great and I also would recommend the bubble tea, which mind taste different but if you are open to trying new things, IT IS TASTY!"}
{"text":"I have never had Thai food before. My husband is always ranting and raving about it. We had been asking friends and looking at yelp to help us decide on my first Thai experience. Based on what we've heard, we picked here!
I believe it was the manager, Ray, he greeted us right away and was super personable. Throughout our entire meal he was checking in with us. 
It was slow, but we try to do that on purpose. We hate when restaurants are crazy busy (by the time we left, it was filling up!)
When our waiter, Dennis, came over, I explained I had never had Thai before and I  asked what he would recommend for someone new to Thai. He asked me a few questions, what I liked and didn't like, if I had any allergies, and then off he went. 
We got spring rolls as an app and my husband got pearl of Thai land and I believe I got rad nar. 
It was delicious. My husband tore through his! He said it was awesome. I had a bit me of his and my mouth was on FIRE! The waiter noticed and brought me over some Thai tea. He was SOOO attentive!!! 

Our meals were good but to be honest, the service made the experience. I will defiantly be coming back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to feel like that's matter and they aren't just another customer."}
{"text":"Super fast and super delicious Thai food! The restaurant is very small and quaint. I usually order delivery and I can't believe how fast they get here! The food is always very high quality with lean cuts of meat, super fresh spices and herbs and just all around fantastic Thai food. I usually get their red curry which is delicious and creamy but have also tried their beef panaang and that's wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Spicy eggplant with beef was amazing and delightful. I will ALWAYYYYSSS come back here when my chili itches for Thai food."}
{"text":"Let's start with the greeting. As soon as my wife and I entered the building, we were greeted by a younger man and a middle aged woman. Both of them had huge smiles on their faces and were so, so eager to welcome us. We were offered to sit where we'd like, so we chose a seat close to the window. The gentleman asked for our drink orders and brought them out promptly. Shortly after, we were presented appetizer salads, which were dressed with a delicious semisweet dressing. We ordered our food, which is available at different heat levels. Our food came out fresh, hot and smelling great. I ordered level 3 heat pad thai and man, it was AMAZING!!! Some of the best Thai food I've had. I highly recommend this location to anybody looking for a great Thai experience."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is a hidden gem in Gilbert. I have been to Thailand a few times and love the food honestly this is the most authentic I have found in the US and haven't had a bad meal here. 
Some of my favorites are the crispy chicken with plum sauce and the sticky rice.
Lets talk about the handmade coconut ice cream. Holy moley it is amazing. You cant not have a scoop made in house. When mango is in season the stickey rice with ice cream and mango, cant go wrong. Just try this place. You will just as in love as the rest f us."}
{"text":"Love love love Thai Chili!  Everything is freshly made and delicious, and owner is so friendly and nice.  My husband and I appreciate how they adjust the spiciness level for us - we are at opposite ends.  Our favorites - the crispy spring rolls...panang curry...masaman curry...and coconut rice and mango for dessert.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Such a great, if small place with lovely, caring people. They remember our order and its specific variations and are honest about how long it will take.   Plan ahead as even take out orders get backed up. Good food, attention to detail on vegan meals"}
{"text":"Great food and service. This place has a great atmosphere and we were lucky because it was a holiday weekend so we were able to get a table as soon as we got there. the waiter was awesome and he explained all the dishes and the heat level and it helped so much.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili in Gilbert,  AZ Cares about allergies, including Gluten.  Their food is absolutely Delicious!  They do not up charge for GLUTEN FREE!  They will work hard to customize whatever you desire in order to take special precautions with allergies!!!"}
{"text":"Really liked it here. The lunch special is great and comes with salad and egg rolls. Flavors are very clean. They gave us extra rice for take home as well. Wish it was closer so I could come back often."}
{"text":"Hey I asked for a 7 on the 1-5 scale and it was nice and super spicy. Got to like a place that is willing to \"warm up\" my food for me. I had the wontons and Chu Chee dish and they were great."}
{"text":"I really like the yellow curry chicken and the peanut sauce is good. The delivery is very fast. My only problem is that it is expensive....I'm not sure if I'd call it overpriced because all Thai places seem to charge to much these days but the price defiantly keeps me from eating here more."}
{"text":"Holy Hot!! I ordered the Drunken Noodles and requested a 7 out of 10 on the spicy scale & my mouth was on fire!! To think I almost got an 8!! Wow! Love it!! The portions were plentiful but I still had to order dessert, STICKY RICE!!! MMMMMMMMMMMMM! So good...."}
{"text":"For a Thai restaurant, my wife and I felt that the quality was quite ordinary.  There was nothing in the flavor profile that stood out as unique or distinguishing. It kind of reminded me of an unadulterated curry paste we get from Lee Lee's. The Thai Dumpling appetizer also tasted like  store bought dumplings. For the entrees the pricing was quite reasonable. I wish I could say the same for the appetizers; they  were overpriced."}
{"text":"Called for delivery in response to an ad on my front door, but they said I am outside their delivery zone. Asked to speak to manager (I think his name was Alex) who said I could get take out or call Grub Hub. I am 6.4 miles away."}
{"text":"This place was good and the service was attentive. They do not have lunch specials on the weekends so you'll have to order off the dinner menu."}
{"text":"One of favorite Thai food places! We've ordered here a few times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is tasty and spicy comparable to Swadee Thai, or even better. I've ordered Pad Thai, catfish with chili sauce and duck in curry (Gung ped Yang. All three dishes were delicious. I'm pretty picky with my thai food and I think this place does a great job with them. Service is great. They gave us a complimentary dessert because we had to wait a little longer for a dish. A typical Friday night expect about 15-20 minutes wait. The place is very cozy with cute decor. Prices are decent. I will make this my frequent dinning place when I'm craving some spicy Thai food!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places I've been to. 
My fiancé and I come here at least twice a month, the servers and managers have made a point to learn our favorites. I don't even have to order anymore, I walk in and they say, \"the usual?\". The food is great, the service is sound, and the environment is very relaxed. I recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"The friendliness of the staff is still shocking.  The owners came out to talk to me, and  shook my hand.  They wanted to know my name so they could remember me and that I should always call ahead or opt for delivery.

My food was great!  The Beef Salad, the beef/meatball soup had the most warming and frankly, loving broth.

The stick rice portion for the price was definitely on the small side.  I was a bit disappointed with that. :o(

I can't wait to return.  This was a wonderful discovery!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find great Thai food in a strip mall in Henderson, but Thai Chili has the best Lad Nah I've ever had. The staff is incredibly friendly as well, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place... People work there are very friendly, but food is not that great anymore.
We ordered a Pad Thai noodle and a yellow curry with sticky rice.  The portion got smaller than before. The yellow curry used to have different vegetables (potatoes, carrots, baby corn, etc), but this time it was mostly bamboo shoot.  The sticky rice wasn't good at all.  What happened?"}
{"text":"Made a last min delivery order. Came on time and was piping hot! Everything was delicious, packaged neat and nothing spilled. Very pleased with the quality...slightly pricey BUT the quality matches so I was ok with the whole thing. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times. This is more Americanized Thai food. The food is pretty good, but the to go service is not. 2 stars because the food is good. 0 stars for service.
If you are calling in an order during a busy time, expect them to underestimate the wait time. The last two times I've been there they told me 20 minutes. I showed up at 25 minutes. They took my payment, and then told me it would be right out. The first time, I waited by the counter thinking it would be \"right out\". 20 minutes later after being ignored by everyone, I asked again where my order was. Lo and behold it was just sitting there. 
The next time was a Friday night at 8pm. Again, they told me 20 minutes. I got there at 25 minutes and when they said it would be \"right out\", I tried to pin them down on an exact time. She glanced back at the line and said \"oh at least another 20\". I had them refund my money, and I went to Mint Thai down the street, who told me 20 minutes and had it ready in 10.
If it's going to be 45 minutes, they should tell the customer up front. It would seem that they deliberately mislead to go customers so they don't lose business. After the last experience, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am so dissapointed! 

It started off good. I ordered 3 dishes from the menu they dropped off at my house ~2 months ago and the food was delivered in 20 minutes instead of the 45. I'm thinking 'OK, awesome', super fast delivery, the food is packaged in these neat snap-top plastic containers, everything is looking good! The portions were on the small side, but that is not unusual for delivery. 

However, there were a few big problems. The first was that the delivery guy was super rude, just grunted at me and shoved a receipt in my direction. The biggest problem was that the food was not good. Then to top it off,  the menu prices had all increased by at least 2 dollars in the last 2 months. I understand menu prices change, but 40$ for 3 dishes of Panda Express quality food.... Definitely will not eat here again.


Tofu Lovers- 3/10 
-Most of the tofu was overcooked, the rest was UNDER cooked (how did they accomplish this???). The sauce was bland.
Silver Noodles- 5/10
-Noodles were over-cooked so they stuck together in a huge, dry clump. There were not enough vegetable for my liking. 5 or 6 broccoli florets and a handful of bean sprouts. The flavor was decent it was pleasantly spicy.
Drunken Noodles w. Shrimp- 7/10
-Shrimp was clean and cooked well and the sauce was flavorful."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! I didn't like the pad Thai. Asked if I could please order something else. Was told that I could order something else, but had to pay for the meal I did not eat. Then the owner came out and told me that she didn't want to make me something else because I might \"not like that either\". She said I must just not know what pad Thai is supposed to taste like because she makes it right and will not make me anything else. Very very rude!"}
{"text":"Ate here again last nite. at 5pm. What can I say. I ordered  mushroom soup and vegetable curry. mushroom soup was ok, I liked the broth, however I was disappointed that the only mushrooms in the soup were button mushrooms (the same kind you find at every grocery store, the least expensive ones) I would have thought for $4 for an on the small side bowl of soup they would have used different mushrooms perhaps chanterells, shitaki, or morels or another exotic type of mushroom. The broth was tastey for me anyway could have been more spicy or sour but over all it was fine. My vegetable curry was fine I asked for 41/2 on the spice scale and it really wasent hot or spicy The curry sauce it self was fine. 2nd was they really don't give you a lot of vegetables a few zucchini, a few broccoli florets, and the remainder was sliced(tinned) bamboo shots, onions, and baby corn. and for $10 and vegetables are not expensive. I was expecting more.... They do give you a descent portion of brown rice and they should they charge $2 for it.

I would come back the food tastes good and they are very accommodating to vegetarians and vegans and they will ask the chef if they can make what ever it is you might order without MSG. and if they cannot the server will let you know so you can choose if you want it of if you want to change to some thing they can make without MSG. And that is extremely important to me.  

Again The server was a middle aged Asian gentleman and he was very friendly and attentive. could not have asked for better service. this time and my prior visit the servers were both exceedingly helpful and attentive. just great."}
{"text":"I been eating here for 5 years now. Still hands down best Thai in Las Vegas. I use to live in the area but moved to Centennial Hills yet if I want good Thai I don't mind driving all the way back down Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and prices are reasonable! Food was very fresh and was served in timely fashion. Very casual and pretty plain decor. We had the Panang curry and spicy fried rice. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was our first time trying Thai food.  The waiter was very helpful however when we ordered our food he was very confident that we didn't realize how hot the food actually was or should I say \"was suppose to be\".  He asked us on a scale of 1 to 5 how hot did we want it.  Both my girlfriend and I said 4.  He assured us that that was going to be to hot.  He asked if we like jalapenos and my girlfriend said,  \"We use Ghost Peppers in our cooking at home.\"  He assured us that a 3 was going to be plenty hot.....not the case.  We went there for lunch and the small place was packed.  We actually had to wait about 10 minutes.  For lunch we had the Crispy Chicken with the spicy plum sauce and the Chicken Red Curry.  First the curry.  It was very good.  The chicken was tender and it had a very rich flavor.  The Crispy Chicken was a big disappointment.  All it consisted of was 3 or 4 chicken planks breaded and deep fried on a bed of sautéed veggies.  The sauce came in a little bowl that had dried hot peppers sprinkled on top of it, not much thought into making this dish hot.  Anyway, I would like to go back, but for dinner."}
{"text":"Well it saddens me to have to post this review because this used to be one of my favorite Thai places to go to..... but I was VERY disappointed in our meals tonight. I was craving Thai food and was excited to come back to Thai Chili but the food was just ehh. My meal barely had any sauce and when I asked for more I was told that I had to pay $1 extra!!!! What the heck! I wouldn't be asking for more if you actually put enough sauce on my meal in the first place! The chicken in my husband's Pad Thai tasted weird and as a whole didn't taste the best. 
When the waitress asked us about our meal I said that it was only ok ..... she's like \"ok great\" and walks away! Seriously!!!! 
I am sad to say that it wasn't worth the money AT ALL. I couldn't care less if I ever go back truthfully. We used to go there because the staff seemed to care and the food was excellent but now it is poor for sure. The lack of care or concern in our service and quality of food will keep me from ever coming back to Thai Chili"}
{"text":"I was drawn by the Yelp check-in special for the 5% off order for pickup or to go.

I called and ordered a fresh shrimp spring roll and a wonton soup as a snack. They said it would be ready in 10 minutes and when I arrived, it was all packed up and ready to go. I looked at the bill, $8 for the spring roll which was rather steep and $4 for the wonton soup which seemed fair. I scurried home eager to eat my snack. 

I checked out the spring rolls. It was stuffed with white and purple cabbage, noodles, lettuce and small shrimps. The peanut sauce I ordered was warm. I ate one not particularly impressed and gave the other to someone else to try. They had a similar impression. The cabbage made the spring roll very difficult to eat with a bland and residual acrid flavor. The wonton soup wasn't any better, the broth was dark, oily and filled with chopped garlic, chunks of chicken, and 3 pieces of wonton. 

Their service was great, but the food wasn't the best. I may consider stopping in to try other items on their menu and getting a true dining experience in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely great Thai food and awesome customer service. We recently moved back to AZ from the San Jose area and I can tell you Thai Chili's food beats any Thai food we found in San Jose, San Mateo, Fremont, and Newark. AND they remembered exactly what we used to order nearly a year ago. Try the food and if you're not familiar with Thai, ask them for a recommendation and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and after having consistently delicious food every time, I finally decided it's time to write up a review! This is the best Thai food I've had in Gilbert. It's slightly pricier than other places on certain standard items, but the flavor is well worth it. The fresh vegetarian spring rolls were so-so, but the delicious vegetarian peanut sauce made up for that! We ordered red and green curry with tofu ($12 each vs. $10 at most other places). They were great about accommodating vegetarian, vegan, and allergy issues. The food was piping hot and nicely stayed that fresh throughout the meal somehow! They offered us a large shareable pot of rice with the entrees. There was a good portion size, ample veggies and tofu, and lots of creamy flavorful curry. My son ordered the silver noodles ($10) and it was equally delicious with lots of veggies and tofu. This restaurant did so well with accommodating vegetarians and vegans so far. It would be great if they consider keeping a small separate fryer to fry crispy spring rolls, crispy tofu, and other vegetarian dishes one day. But I still highly recommend this place! Kid friendly, great place for a date, or even family outing. Beautifully decorated and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I have had. I found it very bland and too greasy. It seemed to be more about the chili than thai spice."}
{"text":"I live in LA and while visiting my bf in Hebderson, I've been looking for a good Thai restaurant. I have to say, the lack of atmosphere is more than made up for by great service (genuinely nice) and great food. Price is more than reasonable, portions are generous and most importantly, again, the food is great. We were quite surprised. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"There just aren't enough words for me to express how much I love this restaurant and their out-of-this-world food! 

Thai is probably my favorite kind of food and I've eaten a LOT of it in my life and I have to say, this place is my absolute favorite that I've tried! Their panang curry and pad thai are phenomenal. I'm not sure what they do differently from other Thai places, but there is a distinct flavor that I love so much. 

The service here is great! I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, but I'm always met with a smiling face and friendly attitude when I come in to pick up my order. 

Do yourselves a favor and stop by here when you get a chance. I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a Thai place in Mesa, so since the reviews and rating for Thai Chili were quite good we decided to give it a try. 

We ordered the spring rolls,  Woon Sen soup, Pad Thai and Pad Siew. 

Spring rolls were huge and very tasty. The soup was delicious. This soup was comparable to my favorite Thai restaurant's. The Pad Thai was tasty but a little dry and lacked some overall flavor. The Pad Siew was spicy, but it was also sweet. Good balance; only problem was lack of vegetables. There was just too much noodle to broccoli for me. 

We weren't overly impressed, but we might have found a decent Mesa Thai spot. We will have to go back again and see. 

One thing I'll tell you though, nothing beats Yupha's in Tempe."}
{"text":"Tried really hard to get past the smell of bathroom as soon as I walked in!! Food was decent but I've had better Thai food and for lesser price and better service. No lunch specials. No boba although they have a photo of Boba out front on the window. Just not impressed considering high reviews on Yelp. I drove all the way from Summerlin area to try this place. Won't be recommending this place or returning."}
{"text":"Tied for best thai around with cravings thai. Love this little place. So many legit options. My favorite place to get take out from hands down. Pad Thai is on the sweeter side. If you even remotely like spicy give the larb a try.  Love it! Why do people get Chinese take out when places like this exist. Cons - they are closed half the time want to eat, aka sundays and their phone line is busy 90% of the time because people know this places rules."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time today. Very disappointing. Food did not taste authentic and did not look like the photos they posted. Very misleading. If you're looking for authentic Thai cuisine, this is not the place, sorry. Will not go back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We have had the pad see eww, pad Kee Mao, panang and something else. Everything was fresh and super tasty! I am addicted to the pad see eww!! Been going every week (figured out Thursday they have it on special don't think there's price difference tho)... it is a must try!"}
{"text":"They open at 430 on Sundays I was a little puzzled by this but they let me order a little early anyway as it was 5 mins till. The staff is friendly and the place has a hole in the wall vibe but keeps up on the tech side of things which is neat cause 5%off is totally cool for a check in offer. 

They have scales for spicy 1 to 5 with 5 being spicy. I chickened out and got a 1 on my teriyaki chicken. 

I did order for pickup and the order took about 15 minutes to be done.

The food was good"}
{"text":"First of all, I love Thai food and have eaten at many real good Thai Restaurants and this in NOT one of them ! Ordered Tum Yong kai Soup had TONS of mushrooms which I do not eat. We ordered Red Curry MILD..It was so hot we could not eat it. The Mee Krob was way off ! No table maintenance dirty dishes on the table the whole meal. Never saw my server till it was time to leave. Will Not Return ! There are plenty of better Thai Restaurants out there, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food and the service was amazing. My mother who is allergic to fish and seafood was completely safe. The chef came out and spoke to us and made her food special due to allergies. They had the best drunken noodles I have ever had and the yellow curry was delicious. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Some of the best Thai food I have had since I was in Thailand last summer. I highly recommend Thai Chili. Great service as well. I got the Pad Thai, it is very authentic and the chicken satay is really good too. They have the best peanut sauce I have ever had as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, literally half an hour after they opened. Small place but we didn't have to wait to be seated since we got there early, lol. The waiter was nice, sorry I can't remember your name. But my family and I got a bunch of food, combination platter for appetizer. Seafood curry, pad thai noodles, and I got the thai bbq chicken. Can never get away from chicken, but it was good for my first time trying thai food. Pad Thai and seafood curry were alright, in my opinion. My sisters loved the seafood curry. Only saying alright because it is my first time trying Thai food, and I don't really like trying out new places. But definitely check it out for yourself! There was a lot of people coming in after us."}
{"text":"My family loves coming here.  The service is always really good.  Friendly staff.  We always get the chicken satay app and chicken curry.  YUM!!!  My son is super picky and they are willing to take away and add if needed.  The sticky rice is a MUST for dessert."}
{"text":"I love this place,  service seemed to struggle for a little while but they seem to have figured it out.

I have loved all their food, I have eaten everything, my favorites are pad thai and panang, but there are many other good choices as well!  Thai Ice tea is legit,  

This is THE BEST Thai i have had in all of Arizona... and thai is my favorite, i always try new places, but since eating here, EVERY TIME I eat at another Thai place, i wish i was a Thai Chili."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here through Yelp. My drive to the restaurant took much longer than expected due to traffic so I was wondering if my order had been sitting for awhile. When I arrived I found, to my surprise, that my order had not gone through - totally my fault. 
They took my order and turned it around very quickly. Back at my hotel I enjoyed a very flavorful Massaman Curry. 
Friendly staff and good food. A great combination."}
{"text":"The food was really delicious! We had padthai, egg rolls,  green curry and calamari. The service was really good and very quick. Fun atmosphere. People were really really friendly. Mai was fantastic and a very attentive server. Highly recommend and will return."}
{"text":"It was some great food. Personally I haven't tried much Thai food, nor am I fond of terribly spicy food but the dish I had was delicious and reasonably priced. Also the staff was very helpful and speedy too"}
{"text":"Small place, not the greatest decor but great food and fast service. They were pretty busy when we came for dinner around 9 PM. We ordered Papaya salad, came with about 4 jumbo shrimp, no extra cost! Satay chicken came with 4 pieces and cucumber salad, chicken was very moist and perfectly marinated. Pad See ew was great as well. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Love the food here 
Enjoying Pad Thai and iced Thai tea 
Fresh 
Great staff 
Generous portions"}
{"text":"I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  We frequently get orders to go but have dined in a few times too.   A very unassuming place from the outside opens to a friendly place inside with some of the freshest made to order Thai food in the area.    We especially like the Red Curry, Tom-Ka soup and my wife always get's bubble tea.  You can control the level of spicy in your food. Bland, medium, awesome( hot) and super awesome ( Thai hot).  Yum"}
{"text":"Oh my God don't eat here it smells like sewer the minute you walk in the food is average at best for Thai it's in a shady location And I'm really shocked it's got is many stars as it does"}
{"text":"I love the Beef Panang is the best I have had it else where and it just isn't the same it is soooooo much better here. The spring rolls are great big and the filling you can actually taste. My husband orders the pad thai noodles and he says they are great and some of the best he has had. Even better they always have coupon and deals you can get. Can't use the restaurant.com certificates any more though but still lots of coupons. I am going there tonight and can't wait."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant, for the first time last night for dinner.  Good Thai cuisine, great service."}
{"text":"Amazing! Only wish we would have found it sooner! Had the Panang and Drunken Noodles - both delicious."}
{"text":"Really good food and they deliver.  Manager is such a nice guy and the food is very good.  My favorite dishes are the curry and tum ka coconut milk soup with shrimp.  Be warned when they say spicy they mean it if you don't like hot make sure you say a 1 or 2."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pad Thai and it was as good as   Our favorite from another restaurant. Online ordering was easy. Will be going back"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is anything special or memorable. The service was extremely slow, but the server was friendly. Their lunch menu was not very extensive and we were never offered the dessert portion specified under the lunch menu. I had drunken noodles with chicken, and although the portion was adequate, the spiceness level was nowhere near what was requested. The chicken as I expect was pretty dry and the noodles were pretty oily. They would benefit from hiring another server and another  person in the back of the kitchen because the wait was a tad ridiculous. I don't see myself going back here, especially with so many other options for Thai food nearby."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this evening. It was busy with in and out customers but we were seated five minutes after we got in. The service was really good.

We ordered alot of food from fried rice, Tom Yum soup, thai chicken, coconut-curry chicken which we ordered like two because it was so good- that paired with a sweet sauce and a peanut sauce and duck, pad thai and fresh thai egg rolls.

There's one dish I loved and it was the coconut curry chicken on a stick. I forgot what it was called but it tasted like coconut-curry. And when you dip into that creamy peanut sauce and thai sweet sauce. Wow delish!

I was so hungry that when I ate the chicken from the stick, I didn't realized that when I took a bite off the chicken, I ate a piece of the stick that got stuck in the chicken. I then noticed when I was quietly choking on the stick. Whether I'd throw it up or just swallow it and hope for the best. It took awhile for that piece of stick to swallow. I finished my thai iced tea once I got it because it helped me swallow that piece of stick. As I calmly, tried not to panick and breathe normally and continued eating.

My expierence was ok. Despite that I was choking. Next time I'll take out the meat off the stick. Lol and I should have never order the thai iced tea. It was good and all but I hate reminding myself that I'm lactose.

For where I was seated, well the air fan was above me so I was freezing. Lol

It was a bit pricey but really was worth it. I'd want to come back and order that coconut-curry chicken.

Note: You know there's a chili on the side of an order to let you know that that dish is spicy. Well, on a scale of 1-5 you can choose how spicy you want your dish to be."}
{"text":"Went there 3 weeks ago for the first time, and have been there already twice since then.... FINALLY... A amazing good thai place in AZ... From a big city person who has been spoiled my whole life, this place is my new go to addiction....."}
{"text":"Service us slow and the food is inventive. I had chicken salad and it was boiled chicken with ice berg lettuce. For what I got I thought it was very over priced. Stay away, this place needs to close"}
{"text":"Great customer service and very yummy food! I will definitely come back when I'm in town. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Prices are affordable too. The staff are very welcoming and you feel right at home from the start :)"}
{"text":"Not giving 5 stars because this was my first time. So far, so good! Very flavorful. The staff/ owner..super nice. Not sure what level of spice some of you wimps are ordering but I ordered my green curry at a seven because of the comments about how spicy the food was and I will certainly go to a higher spice level on my next visit. The chicken satay was perfectly seasoned and juicy. The yellow curry was really delicious also. The orange chicken was tasty. I can't wait to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is our favorite thai restaurant in the Cleveland area. We have never had a bad experience with the food nor the service. Typically we stick to the rice dishes like the spicy basil. They season from a 1 to 5 for hotness however depending on the night this varies. I usually order the thai hot which is consistently hot. However even at a 1 (lowest heat) the flavor of the food has always been good. The restaurant isn't very large and in the winter is actually a bit chilly. Two walls are windows and though they make a good effort it does stay cool. Don't expect private conversations. There are only maybe ten tables and they are all within ear shot of each other. With that said, if you do eat in there generally is a lot of take out. Price isn't too bad here either. My wife and I can generally be in and out for under $20. If you are in doubt I would recommend trying it if you are in the area. I don't think we will be disappointed but if so the price point isn't bad to risk a try."}
{"text":"Clearly the best Thai food in the area. Super friendly staff. Their chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, and pad Thai are absolute must tries. I just moved to Las Vegas from New York City and fell in love with this place. Small mom-and-pop places  like this are authentic and real"}
{"text":"Really good Pad Thai.  Service is better at this location than the others I have been.  Small little place but the food is fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is our favorite Thai place in the East Valley. Their food is amazing and their prices are very reasonable. We've gone for both lunch and dinner and have been very happy. We've taken several friends and family members to share you amazing discovery. Sometimes there is a little wait but it is well worth it and the service is great."}
{"text":"Great food! Fresh ingredients and flavor! Maybe a little better selection on desserts..."}
{"text":"Very disappointment. Ordered delivery. Both chicken spring roll and vegetable fried spring roll aren't good. The chicken one smells bad. Thai fried rice looks plain. No veggies in it! Very dry and no spicy flavor at all!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Thai Chili. We ordered delivery, which came to the doorstep very quickly! The delivery person was very friendly when she dropped off the food. 

I ordered the drunken noodles and my husband ordered panang curry. My noodles were very flavorful and had a lot of tofu and veggies. Good ratio! There was a pretty good amount of food for the price. Although I will say, it was a little pricey compared to other places we've been to. 

I would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out online and it was excellent. We had the pineapple curry chicken, cashew chicken and vegetables and crispy chicken with plum sauce and veggies.  Everything was great just as good as when we ate at the restaurant.  I will try delivery next time."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is a great, reliable neighborhood spot for good Thai food. Their rewards card is exceptional-- a free lunch for every four lunches purchased! Any other place takes 10 purchases for a free meal.

Service is exceptional here too. The waitstaff is fast, nice and competent. The manager is ridiculously friendly. I'm kind of a b so I have hard time understanding how someone could be so pleasant all day long.

I've been here enough to know what to focus on and what to avoid. Thankfully, the pad thai is great here, and I would get it every week if it was calorie-free. You can't go wrong with the curries either. I got the green curry tofu on my last visit, and it was so delicious. The lunch portion is very generous, and I was able to get two meals out of it. The spicy eggplant dish is another winner. I wouldn't get the drunken noodles again though. They weren't that flavorful, and they all stuck together.The sticky rice with mango had a similar problem; it all just globbed together. I've had better versions at other Thai places.

All in all, this is one of your best options in the area if you want delicious food from a locally owned business. Avoid those chain restaurants at Dana Park!"}
{"text":"This place is life changing. I eat here at least once a week. I will never move from AZ because I can't live without Thai Chili. I want to move the chef into my house. The Panang is matchless. Have it. I dare you."}
{"text":"Thank you for being true to your spice identifiers!!! Many times you head to read restaurants and their spicy is barely a tingle. I decided to go hot in the Pad Thai and it was perfect!! I will definitely be back, once I can feel my lips again.  :)"}
{"text":"We love Thai Chili for some quick delicious take out! The owners are so nice and they make everything to order. We typically get the pad thai since it is one of my favorites in the Cleveland area. My husband gets his with either shrimp or chicken and loves it. I get mine with tofu but I ask for it to be \"steamed\" instead of fried since I'm not crazy about the texture of the fried stuff. We haven't eaten in, but that is on our list of things to do. 

They also serve bubble tea...bonus!!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! I found this place on yelp. It was a rainy Saturday and nothing sounded better than to curl up on the couch with some TV time. Not wanting pizza since that is pretty much the only delivery in Mesa. I mustered up the nerve and called Thai Chili and lucky me they deliver. I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken which was amazing. On the spicy level I got 3 but definitely could've went spicier. It sure did hit the spot and have been ordering there since."}
{"text":"First time at this place for our first dinner in 2017band for a small joint (hole in a wall) it was a great dining experience. The food is super delicious and flavorful. The staff are all friendly and gave us great recommendations. 
They delivered our food really fast and the each of our ordered  dish were all hot. 
O could go on and on about how great this place but to get the real experience, it mist be visited. Two thumbs up. 
The only dissatisfaction that I have is they kept trying to clean up our table or kept removing our plAtes while we're still eating our meal. We prefer that to be dine when we finish our meal."}
{"text":"When we first arrived, we almost didn't go in. There were no cars out front, and we are usually skeptical of restaurants in strip malls. We decided to trust the reviews on yelp, and we're glad we did. The service was very polite and courteous, and the food was great. I had  the red curry, she had the pineapple, both were excellent.  We both ordered eight on the spicy, which was hot but not too hot. I gave it five stars because I like to help a place out sometimes when I think it's a good deal."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back soon! Nice clean restaurant with many menu options (Indian owners and Thai cook makes for the best of both worlds). The server was friendly and attentive; he answered questions about the menu and kept the drinks full. The coconut ice cream is homemade in house daily! The owner even stopped by our table to ensure everything was up to par."}
{"text":"Under new management.  Fast, clean and delicious!  Love the Pad Thai, Tom Yam Soup, Spring Rolls and Drunken Noodle.  Large servings unless you order lunch portion.  Everything goes great with Bubble Tea!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  I love the curries, especially the green curry.  My wife raves about the Pad Siew and Pad Thai.  I recently discovered Thai Sizzling Beef and might have found a new favorite.  Everything I've tried is wonderful. The people there are very nice and helpful and remember my name since I've become a relatively regular visitor.  Warning - I like pretty hot food and ordering a heat of about 3 is enough for me.  At times a 3 is a little mild and at times it is a little bit of a challenge.  I think this is testament to the fresh ingredients (sometimes chilis are hotter and sometimes milder).  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I dont like spicy food but they can make food non spicy according to your taste. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best yellow curry ever!! I love this place! Great food,great service...always. They are consistently great! My bank account has them listed over and over and definitely more to come! 
 I was so tired of going to restaurants only to find it wasn't as good when returning...Thai Chile impresses over and over!"}
{"text":"Tasty food for a good price. I recommend this place for lunch. We ordered pad thai with chicken and green curry with chicken. The pad thai was ok, but I recommend the green curry. I also ordered thai iced tea. The service was really nice. Do try it out if you are near this area for food and are craving Thai!"}
{"text":"Love their Tom yum soup and yellow curry. I come here several times a month and always enjoy my meals! Service is always speedy and great !"}
{"text":"Somewhere between authentic Thai and cheap take-out Chinese exists the entity that is Thai Chili.  This is a very middle-of-the-road Asian food establishment that seems to suffer from an ongoing identity crisis.  While the food is edible and certainly Thai-influenced, it's no where near good enough to warrant a second visit!

Stopped in with a co-worker on the recommendation of several online reviewers...

Lunch time portions were perfect for the price and the quality of ingredients was certainly good.  Though reasonably busy, seating was prompt and the food came quickly.  However, the TASTE of the food left much to be desired!  

We tried both the \"Hot and Sour\" and the \"Egg Drop\" soups to start.  Anyone familiar with Thai food will note that these are soups more commonly found as counterparts to cheap \"take-out\" style Chinese food.  Well, the Hot and Sour soup consisted of a dark broth with red pepper flakes floating around for spice.  It tasted strongly of lemon juice and vinegar and, though I tried to sip down 3 spoonfulls, my coworker and I both decided it wasn't worth eating.  I've had some bad \"Hot and Sour\" soup, but this was among the worst!  Meanwhile, the Egg Drop soup, though easier to swallow, had an odd smokey flavor to the broth that really didn't taste good with the egg and other ingredients.  Still, we were able to work through it, unlike the Hot and Sour before it. 

Then, the entrees came...complete with egg rolls and sweet and sour sauce for dipping.  Once again, I had to glance at the sign on the wall to make sure I was still in a THAI establishment, as this also seemed eerily like fast-food Chinese in nature.  Luckily, the eggrolls were flaky, tasty and small enough that they didn't steal attention away from the entrees themselves.  

Digging into the main courses, we found the yellow curry to be completely overloaded with large slices of red and green bell peppers.  There were easily more bell peppers than there were a sum of all the other ingredients combined!  Unfortunately, the strong presence of the bell peppers, especially the red ones, took over the taste of the dish entirely and made it far less enjoyable than either of us had hoped for.  

The Pad Thai we ordered was also a mild disappointment.  Once again, while made of quality ingredients and looking appropriate on the plate with scallions, sprouts and crushed peanuts, it turned out to be very sweet...too much so.  The mid-level spice didn't help, either.  It was edible, but, coming from a guy who has eaten Pad Thai more than a thousand times in both the U.S. and South Asia, I can say that it was far from normally sweet.  

Still, we managed to finish and our wallets weren't complaining too badly when we left.  Will we or our wallets return?  Unlikely.  Thai House at Southern Ave. and Power Rd. is a 5-minute drive down the US-60 from Thai Chili and well worth the extra time and gas if good quality Thai is what you crave."}
{"text":"Delicious! Bear in mind that they are not joking around when you order something hot! I ordered the Masaman curry medium (it was just right) and my husband ordered the drunken noodles hot. Both dishes were excellent, but the heat on the drunken noodles made it slightly uncomfortable to eat. We aren't exactly connoisseurs of spicy food, but we aren't light weights either. That said it was still awesome and we'll definitely be back (but for medium on both dishes next time!) The bubble tea was also very good. I gave four stars because it's a little bit uncomfortable to dine in. It's in a very small restaurant in the Landings strip mall; the space is so small that I think it must have been a carry out place like Domino's or something in a previous incarnation. The chairs weren't too comfortable, either. It wouldn't prevent me from returning because the food is so good, but if it's a nice day out I would recommend getting it to go and having a picnic at the lake!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place.  My wife ordered the Shrimp pad Thai.  I ordered Beef Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle) and we shared a pork Larb, too go.  All dishes were ordered medium (5/10) spice.  

Food was cooked quickly and available at the promised time.  Only bad things was that it was a bit pricey and my wife pad thai was too spicy (for her, and way more spicy than the other two medium spice dishes).

Yes, we will go back.  My wife will just get a 3/10 next time on the spice."}
{"text":"My first impression of the restaurant was that it was small. It is basically a square dining room. The decor and lighting were nice and the place was adequately clean.  For a Saturday night at 8pm, business wasn't booming, but it was dead either. The menu is large with mostly Americanized Thai dishes. Entree prices are reasonable, appetizers maybe a little high. Beer was little expensive too. A bottle of Kilt Lifter was $5. The service started out just OK. Our waiter wasn't very warm and seemed to have only limited knowledge of the menu. However, he kept my water filled and our food was delivered in a reasonable time. Portions are generous and the vegetables were fresh. I ordered a \"5\" on my dish and was disappointed by the lack of spiciness. I got the eggplant with chicken. Overall, it was pretty good. One piece of the  eggplant was a little undercooked and the chicken tasted gamy, probably dark meat. I used a lot of soy sauce. I was very impressed with the brown rice - super fresh and sticky and some of the best I've had. My girlfriend got the shrimp salad, which she was very impressed with also. We didn't do any deserts or appetizers. We used a groupon and Its certainly not worth the drive from Scottsdale without one. Really, this is more a like a 3.5 star restaurant and if you live within a few miles - Thai Chili is a reasonable alternative for fresh food with a decent value."}
{"text":"We didn't have to ask for the lunch salad, and the service was really good despite it being crazy busy for a Monday at 1:30pm where they were clearly not expecting a late lunch rush. Pad thai was pretty decent, we've had worse and we've had better, though I wasn't crazy for the crispy chicken and plum sauce. It wasn't bad, though! I don't know that there was anything wrong with it, I was just trying something new and decided it wasn't my fave. I'll try a curry or the panang next time based on reviews, because our experience was good enough to come back for sure. Oh, the Thai Iced Coffee was the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Soup was good..I love soup.. wonton soup 4 hot.  Pad Thai was  a hit too..
Watch the spicy level is you want mild.
Ill be back.
Has Delivery"}
{"text":"Now, I hardly ever get down to the far southeast valley but found myself starving after a client visit.  It's a rainy day so some nice Thai would go down really nicely I thought.  I scoped the 'people love us on Yelp' sticker on the window and I was in!!
It was busy, nearly every table was occupied but I managed to work my way into a small table with a wave from the waiter that he'd provide a menu shortly.
While waiting I saw a man and woman who appeared to be the owners (??) more Indo than Chine, but studiously going over the operations of the restaurant.  And I waited.  And waited.  Major star deduction.
Their lunch specials are seven bucks so I chose my fave Pad C U with chicken and medium heat.  Heat was perfect, but other than that the dish fell short.  This was rather salty, and coming from me that's really saying something.  I felt it really lacked the complexity that I've experienced elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time trying Thai Chili.  Our favorite Thai restaurant was closed and we really wanted some Thai food.  We ordered satay, papaya salad with chicken, and panang curry with chicken (it was obviously chicken night). We asked for delivery as we didn't want to go out in this horrible heat. The food arrived earlier than promised, yay!!  Everything was very tasty.  The papaya salad was prepared a little differently than we have had previously, but it was very good, the ingredients were fresh.  The satay and panang curry were also excellent.  The curry was still quite hot when the delivery driver arrived, the satay portions were extremely generous and double the size of what you normally receive in a Thai restaurant.  Will definitely order again and add Thai Chili to our restaurant rotation.  Great find."}
{"text":"Small place with 7 tables (6 four-tops and 1 two-top).  I dined in with my partner and we were the only 2 customers in the place for the duration of our meal.  We had excellent service and very delicious food.  

I had the Prik Khing with pork and my partner chose the Rama.  Both were served with the correct spice levels requested, and the food was hot, fresh and tasty.  This is now my go to Thai restaurant on the Westside.

If you can make it for lunch, prices are about $3 cheaper than the dinner prices, and the lunch combos include Tom Yam mushroom soup and a crispy roll.  A great value in my opinion!

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have had the chicken pad Thai (spicy) and Thai fried rice chicken. Not the best pad Thai but the rice was good."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THAI FOOD EVER!!! Their homemade chili sauce with anything is my favorite I have it at least 2 times a week"}
{"text":"These guys know me by name at this point. They're awesome. Best Thai on the East Valley. Like the red curry... omg... or the perfect Pad Thai. Don't be scared to try it with tofu. Extra crispy if you don't like soft tofu. Spice level 3 is my sweet spot. I enjoy 4 every now and again. They deliver quickly too!"}
{"text":"Found ourselves at this little spot after taking in the Ethel M lights! We ordered several dishes off the menu and all were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant!  Their Spicy Eggplant and Green Curry Chicken are delicious.  Friendly service and a chill atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A little known secret, the lunch special includes a salad and eggroll. That's not the secret. Apparently, you have to Specifically Request the salad. Yes, it's listed as included in the lunch special. The fine print (that isn't *actually* printed anywhere)... you must request the salad. 
Look, that's what the restaurant told me. I'm not creative enough to make this stuff up.

Roy G.'s review makes more sense now. They \"forgot\" our salads as well. Unfortunately it was delivery and the driver was unavailable to bring those salads by.

I only had the vegetable fried rice lunch special. It wasn't greasy. That's the primary method used to destroy veggie fried rice and Thai Chili avoided it. I call that a success."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'd been told by my east office coworkers that Thai Chili had great food but it wasn't until the fabulous Monica O suggested that we try it a few weeks ago that I discovered how great it really is! Their Thai tea is perfectly sweet, the best I've had! Their customer service is quick and friendly, and the place is busy with one customer after another coming in for take out. I shared some SaTe chicken with the most amazing peanut sauce, and ordered the pumpkin curry with white rice at Thai hot. Holy heat, did they mean business! With every bite the temperature seem to increase, it was like getting a hot and spicy hug from the inside! It was so good but so filling that I took home leftovers, needless to say they didn't make it to the next day and were finished off a few hours later! I've been in a couple more times for tea and will definitely be back to eat! They offer a 5% off \"check in\" discount and have buy one get one half off coupons on their to go menu. Bring on the heat, I'm ready to Thai some more!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local Thai place. The ambiance, location and menu offerings are terrific! The staff is friendly and everything is clean.

Everything I've ordered, to date, has been delicious! The portion size is decent as is the pricing. I continue to recommend this establishment to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Went there with a half price groupon. Every thing was nummmmmy! The service was a bit off. They were very friendly just a bit akward. They got slammed with groupon guests all at the same time right after we were seated.  I had a specialty the chicken and steak in lemon garlic sauce heat rating of five.  It was good not hot enough for my taste but I was too afraid to order higher at a new place. Five is full of flavor and a little heat on the end.  

My chef boyfriend tryed my sauce and said it was from a jar. He said he has it in his kitchen. a little disapointed if that is true since it was called a speacality of the house. But it was very good and I was completly satisfied.

I would definatly go back without question."}
{"text":"OMG. Tried going here to eat. It smelled so bad we turned around and left. Like a nursing home. I've never walked out of. Restaurant without eating before. It might be good for takeout but even my kids were gagging."}
{"text":"The food is great I order all the time I gave them 3 stars because when I get my food delivered it take an hour plus to get my food and I live technically down the street...  Other than time management the food is good... I always get my food delivered so next time I'm going to go to the establishment myself and give another viewing"}
{"text":"I've only ever gotten take our gere. The chicken pad thai has all elements that make a good pad thai, sweet 
spicy sour salty they are generous with amount of protein. Level 3 is as hot as srriacha. Best thai in town. Second place is thai elephant"}
{"text":"Awesome Red curry ... I loved it and it was spicy too. Came with white rice. I tried their mushroom soup it was loaded with mushrooms and extremely spicy but good. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"I went for the first time and I was very surprised that they were burning very cheap huge candles in the middle of this small restaurant and the scent was very sweet.  It was so disturbing but I sat down and ordered a curry.  They don't have lunch menu so curry was $12 which wasn't cheap.  The service was good but curry was okay, but I just couldn't sit there and eat with the candles burning right by me.  I guess some people are ok with that.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and the prices are reasonable. Where this place becomes extremely overpriced is how much time this place has cost me. As an at home diner, for pick up orders, and as a delivery partner. Though I've never dined in, I've spent way too much of my life waiting for orders here and have witnessed that even dining in is a long, drawn out process. The way I see it is that this place brings in more than enough business to bring on some extra help. They have not, and it doesn't appear that will be changing. So, I'm done. There are other restaurants that can have me fed in a fraction of the time. I'll stick to them. Time is too precious to wait for this place to hire more help and depend on the amazing Amber to balance it all."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up something quick and more healthy than fast food. Ordered some shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce, and Green curry with tofu, spice level 3, with brown rice. The spring rolls were nice and fresh, filled with fresh veggies. Didn't love the peanut sauce...it could use a little zip. Now that green curry with tofu...wonderful little sponges soaking up spicy coconut sauce, crisp veggies. That sauce even made boring (but yes, healthier) brown rice more delish! I shall be back! Can't wait to try Panang beef next time!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best Thai food in Mesa and the quality is consistent.  I especially like the Panang Beef and Green Curry chicken.  You should also try the fried rice - it's excellent.  We've been going to this restaurant for at least two years now and crave it regularly.  The only disappointment we have, is that we are a little out of their delivery area, so we have to pick it up, but that hasn't stopped us from frequenting them!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this place. I ordered a roast duck to go via LevelUp. 

When I got home and opened up the order, it was five slices of duck on a bed of vegetables. For $14, it is pure rip off. This is the first time I've been disappointed with Thai food let alone an Asian restaurant. 

I complained to the manager and she said it is what it is.

I do not recommend this restaurant at all. I have spoiled having lived in Boston, NYC and Las Vegas with its generous portions of Asian restaurants. I have tried numerous Asian restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is the most disappointing let alone most disappointing Asian restaurant I've tried ever."}
{"text":"My sister and I have been looking for a good Thai place in the Henderson area for quite a while. We decided to order a few things first before ordering our main meal. Upon entering, it was clean but it smelled of bathroom and bathroom cleaner. Probably because it's small. BUT, it shouldn't!! I was looking to smell the pungent smells of Thai Food-- or any food for that matter. 
I ordered the yellow curry with chicken---DELISH
I think he mixed the order of spiciness, not to fear, I added from the dry spice on the table. WHOA!!
Ok 
Sister ordered Tom ka soup with shrimp. Shrimp was a wee over cooked but broth was excellent! But too many mushrooms for her. 
Cucumber salad excellent and only a dollar! Dressing is great as well. 
Thai iced tea was better than the Thai iced coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Very rare to find an authentic Thai restaurant with food so deliciously prepared in Vegas! Excellent!"}
{"text":"this place is lit !! best thai food ever, great price and awesome service the best! highly recommended! lit af"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here. Must have new cook. Our meal was not as flavorful. Service was slow. Heat is now measured 1-5 instead of 1-10."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the best Thai food that I've eaten.  Unfortunately, I don't live anywhere near it. Luckily, i work nearby and am excited that I'll be there soon.  

The red curry was fabulous, the Tom yum soup cured my head cold. I can't say enough. Get there early, they only have one wok. 

Everything is fresh. Can't wait to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Always delicious food and pleasant staff. Tucked away and hidden, but so worth the hunt!!  Use the Rewards program and earn points for each visit!!"}
{"text":"Generally I like Thai Chili. They have great curries,  but yesterdays experience left me with a sour note. 

I ordered the fresh spring rolls. My favorite thing to get in various restaurants. I decided to get the shrimp ones ($2 extra). When they arrived I was so disappointed. They were full of only a cabbage mixture. No fresh herbs, bean sprouts, or noodles like most spring rolls, and the worst thing... Each roll only had 2 small shrimp in them. I paid extra for shrimp to have most of my bites just the spring roll wrapper & cabbage. The 2 tiny shrimp took up maybe 20% of the roll. The peanut sauce lacked flavor and I had to use the dumpling sauce which was much tastier. So sadly ordering my favorite thing turned into a disappointing meal. 

On the bright side the panang curry was tasty. 

I really hope this is not a reoccurring or normal thing for the fresh roll."}
{"text":"My go to order is Pad Thai for lunch. Their food tastes pretty good and the prices are decent. It's small but the quality is there. I'd recommend giving this place a try. If you go, try one of their lunch specials. Also, their staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"The food is good but they didn't charge me or give me one of my orders. One of my family members was left without a meal even though I checked twice that I had put In the order. Although the food was great for the rest of us."}
{"text":"For such a small business, they are pretty busy when I come in. I love the green curry makes it feel like real Thai food. 
The down side is every time I order by phone. It's pretty hard to understand and they don't have a food ordering phone system."}
{"text":"Owner immediately responded to my last ranting post. He is very kind and took care of us right away. He definitely knows what Customer Service is all about! We enjoyed our meal and it's the closest Thai food I have had in a long time that's very close to what I am used to eating. It was hot and delivered fast! It was very  delicious. Will order again!"}
{"text":"We tried thai chili last week, and have been wanting to try something different.  We came on a Friday night and it was really busy, which I see as a good thing, except they were a bit slow with the service once we were seated.  I ordered the Thai sizzling beef, which states \"cooked to order\". I like mine medium rare, but it came completely dry and very well done. The vegetables that came with it were really good, however, and the sauce was delicious. My husband got the sweet and sour steak, and although they initially got his order wrong, they were quick to correct it and his beef was perfect. Super sweet and tangy, with crispy vegetables. You can also give a \"spicy preference\" of 1-5. I'm a wimp and got 2, but I think next time I'll go 3 or 4, as it wasn't really too bad. We didn't see our waitress or get drink refills until we were almost done eating, and she forgot a few times we asked for water, but overall, the food was good and the atmosphere pleasant. I'd definitely like to try this place again on a less busy weekday and expand my palate a bit more!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Thai food and wow was it awesome! Dennis our waiter suggested some great dishes, and his service was impeccable. Jude (my date) knew Thai food inside and out her and Dennis came up with the perfect choices.  The beer was good, the Thai tea was amazing....I could not have been more please.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After ordering Take Out on Friday, my fiance and I HAD to go back on Sunday. The food is delicious. After our meal our server recognized us and asked us about our experience and was delighted to hear that we couldn't stay away from this amazing Thai restaurant. The restaurant participates in a 'rewards' type of program (order X amount of food get y% off) and after asking us what we had ordered a few days before added that meal amount to our new rewards account.
Phenominal customer service.
Great food
Cute cute cute little restaurant, and clean!
Will 100% be making Thai Chili a regular in our rotation.
Oh, and they deliver too!"}
{"text":"We have found our new favorite thai place! We walked in and jordan, our server welcomed us and was very attentive to our needs.  Nice clean atmosphere with plenty of natural light.  We had the red chicken curry and chicken pad thai.  Both had excellent flavor and generous portions for a reasonable price.  The red chili had jalapenos in it so if u can't handle the spice then ask to have it prepared without.  The chicken fresh rolls were delicious with the warm peanut sauce.  They have been open about 2 months as of this posting, and with the quality and service we experienced, I hope they are able to stay around for a very long time.  Overall a 5 star experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai  restaurant by far!  My Husband and I eat there at least 2x a week.  The portions are HUGE and their mango shakes are amazing!!!   He likes Chicken Pad Thai #10, I like the same and drunk noodles #6.  We both have them locked in our cells."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here at least once every two weeks with co workers or my family. The yellow chicken curry is the best I've ever had. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai.Haven't had anything that I don't like at this place. The only change that I've noticed lately is that the spice level can be hit or miss it use to be at a 6 now were at a 4."}
{"text":"Open sign on... Hours says open... I walk in 15 min til 3 and I'm greeted with \"we're closed\". Rude! They just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Honestly the best Thai food we have ever had! The service is first class and the food is out of this world. I could use a million superlatives to describe Thai Chili but I'll sum it up by saying their food is FREAKIN AWESOME. The Masa Man yellow curry, Spicy Ginger Fish or any other choice will not disappoint. Don't wast your time with any other imposters. Thai Chili is the real deal. Oh make sure to keep it at level 3 or less if you can't stand the heat. 

My favorite Asian food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Spicy deliciousness. Fresh and tasty, every time. My favorite Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is to die for! However, you really need to change your hours on google/Apple maps. I drove 17 miles specifically to come eat there just to find out it closed at 2 and not 3.... :/"}
{"text":"For some time, we wanted to try Thai Chili. In January 2015 we were nearby and so glad that we finally got there. The food is really very good. Since this was out first time, we ordered everything on the mild side. Next time, there'll be more spice.

The lunch salad was a nice way to start. I ordered Hot & Spice soup with mushrooms--lot of mushrooms & shrimp. My wife ordered Tom Yum Goong which she enjoyed. Then we had to order the dumplings---so glad we did!

For my wife's main course she ordered Beef Panang while I had Shrimp Pad Thai---lots of shrimp as today was shrimp day for me!

The complete lunch was very good and we will dine here again!"}
{"text":"Totally NOT worth the money! Microwaved chicken teriyaki.. Rubbery chewy yucky. Noodles were old and stuck together like they were left out over night. Worst experience ever with thai food. They should be ashamed of their lazy cheap ways."}
{"text":"We just ate there and I'm looking at the other reviews and honestly, I think Jenny S rated the wrong restaurant.  We were going to eat at a Thai Restaurant near Target on Maryland Pkwy; however, we walked in and it smelled of a sewer.  My husband is from Thailand and his favorite restuarant is Thai Chili.  I don't go there very often but we went tonight instead of eating at the other place.  The establishment is small but they have tables and booths.  The booths have plenty of room for 4 people.  Everything was very very clean.  I even visited the ladie's room which was very clean as well.  I love eating in clean restaurants.  The staff was very hospitable and kept our drinks filled and the food coming from the kitchen.  My husband always has a traditional Thai dish (not sure it's even on the menu), and unfortunately this evening it was too salty; however, when he complained they immediately took it away (graciously) and prepared the dish again without any salt and gave him a side dish of salt so he could add some if he so desired.  It is true the staff doesn't speak very good English but we didn't have any problems with this the entire evening.  They also had two of their children working and they did a great job!  My son had the Pad Thai and he ate every last bite without any complaints.  He said it was delicious.  I had the green curry mild but it was a bit on the hot side for me.  I didn't complain, I ate it and drank a lot of water.  It was very tasty with fresh basil.  I could tell the ingredients were fresh.  After you order, it doesn't take very long for the food to come out which is nice when you're hungry.  We also had the fried tofu as an appetizer and it was served with a delicious cucumber salad.  I'm not a tofu eater, but my son loves it and he said it was great.  I enjoyed the cucumber salad.  The prices are moderate and appropriate for the establishment ranging from $7.99 to $12.99 most being about $8.99.  If you are looking for great Thai food and absolutely wonderful service, this is probably one of the best places in Las Vegas for the price.  They get 5 stars from me, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I placed an order through Eat24 for spicy fried rice. For reference, this is what the item states on the menu:
\"Spicy Fried Rice  Spicy
Fried rice with onions, basil, red bell pepper, chilli.\"
No eggs mentioned anywhere. Whereas, eggs were mentioned as ingredients in their other fried rice entree descriptions. After placing the order, thought to call to confirm. Most Thai places I've ordered from do NOT add eggs to their basil fried rice. This place clearly didn't mention eggs in the description, but still I thought to call and ask cos I'm allergic. Long story short, I was met with such rudeness and hostility when I called. I was asked why I was just calling to modify the order? Not sure if he was trying to make me feel stupid. I tried explaining that I'm allergic to eggs and just wanted to make sure there were no eggs. He said the food was already done with eggs and there's nothing he can do about it, and asked again why I didn't call earlier??? My bf took the phone cos he was appalled by the way I was being talked to. Needless to say it went downhill fast. He even went far as to say it's an American thing to not add eggs to basil fried rice and most places add eggs! Bunch of BS. I've ordered this dish plenty a time, and I've seldom seen eggs in come with this dish. Be that as it may, the fact that what I ordered clearly did not have eggs listed, and they couldn't even muster any form of courteousness, it's abhor-able. 
Their customer service is dead in the water. Never again!"}
{"text":"My very favorite Thai place in Gilbert! Food is wonderful and great service! Will definitely be recommending to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Try the vegetable soup - I think it's called something like \"exotic soup.\"  The broth is flavored with cilantro, and really just hits the spot. 

Also love the curry chicken and pad thai. Does not taste fake and oversweet like many other thai places. 

Sometimes the orders take awhile, they seem to be short staffed  whenever I go."}
{"text":"We had no idea what to expect. It wasn't very busy and it seemed under priced, but then we got the food and it was amazing! And the staff was so nice to us and helped us so much. It's not only our new favorite Thai restaurant, but our new favorite restaurant! Can't wait to be back again and again!"}
{"text":"At the time, I hemmed and hawed between 4 and 5 stars but realize now I was just being stingy. This place is as consistent, tasty and friendly as the day it opened. Support local, family-owned and operated businesses to keep them open, especially in Henderson where we badly need more of them."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is my now go to when I'm in the mood for some Thai! The food is delicious, the servings are generous, and the customer service is delightful.

My first time at Thai Chili was yelp review worthy right from the start. We were welcomed inside with a smile and the place was spotless. We were going to just order our food to go but decided to dine in, why not. Ordering when you're starving is never a good idea so we kind of went overboard but everything was tasty so I had no regrets.

Chicken pad see ew was perfect. The noodles were just right and the flavor was better than my old spot. They offer the usual meat choices: beef, chicken, shrimp, and pork. 

Panang curry was BOMB. I am a curry fan and this hit the spot. It was the right consistency, thick and rich. The curry came with a hefty portion of rice. 

Tom yum noodle soup was a \"I'm so hungry I need to order more food\" kind of a decision. I love the tom yum flavor, but never had it with noodles. It was probably the best hangry decision that I have made in awhile. 

We ordered the fried rice with chicken. Again, you can order this dish with your preference of meat. Nothing out of the ordinary, but sometimes you just want to get fancy and have some fried rice. 

I have a go to Thai spot but I would come back here again. I was an instant fan just because of the awesome service. After we were done eating I asked for to go containers to pack up the food. Our server noticed that all the white rice as gone and asked us if we wanted more rice to go free of charge. He was very friendly and packed us some rice just for our left over panang. How awesome is that? His hospitality really made it seem like we were dining with family. 

I can't wait for my next visit to Thai Chili!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town. I like pad Thai and green curry. Try it , yellow curry and fried rice. The best service also."}
{"text":"I ordered the Penang.  It was good so I would go back.  They forgot my salad with the lunch special.  No wifi though."}
{"text":"Great food, Thai fried rice with chicken was delicious. Definitely returning soon. Food was great taste and temperature wise."}
{"text":"We love this place. There are many thai places around, but this is one of the best. Have had a couple different curries, the pad thai and the pad see ew and all are really delicious. Super friendly staff too."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and everything is always made fresh to order at Thai chili. I have celiac disease and my boyfriend is lactose intolerant, but that doesn't matter here, everything is custom made to fit our needs and we never have to worry about allergens in our food.  Their precautionary procedures are highly developed because they care immensely that what you eat does not make you sick. The staff is friendly and the owner/manager is outstanding! He remembered us after just one visit, but now he knows us for a different reason-we come back every week!"}
{"text":"Great little place by Galaxy Theatre. Makes for a low key date night.  Yummy pad Thai and pad se-ew."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go order from grub hub, and it came quick and the food was delicious! Pad see ew is always a food choice with thai food and dang they made it good!! Topped off the meal with a thai tea and beef jerky started! Very good!!"}
{"text":"I came here a little bit after lunch hour and made it just in time for the lunch special ($8.95 for an entree, salad and eggroll?!). The service was fast and excellent. Our waitress was super friendly and welcoming. She made sure our glasses of water were always full.

I ordered the yellow curry and asked for it to be as spicy as possible. The waitress put the order in for a spice level of 5/5.

While the dish itself was beautiful presented, flavorful, generous, and delicious, the spice was practically non-existent. I didn't break a sweat, my tongue didn't tingle, and there was not a single trace of a runny nose. By the time I finished a majority of the dish, I hadn't even finished a fourth of my glass of water.

I'd definitely recommend this location if you're looking for a reasonably priced Thai restaurant with lots to choose from, but if you're looking for spice.... this probably isn't the best place to visit.

The adventure for spice continues."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I have had in AZ.  I have ordered most things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.   If you know your Thai food, this is the place.  We eat in or order it out at least once a week."}
{"text":"Bought 1 chicken and  2 combination pad thai.  Food looked great and you are  able to customize spiciness level so that was great.   I did like that meal  had bean sprouts, lemons and peanuts as not all places offer it.  Shrimp, chicken and meat portions were decent. I did not feel cheated at all.  I did find that these meats and fish were bland on both the chicken only and combination plates.  I did not find any hint of flavor on them so not sure if this is a one time thing or their usual.  I will try to come by during lunch instead of dinner and try other items on their menu as food did not completely disappoint."}
{"text":"Why have the option of not spicy, mild, medium, spicy or very spicy when it's ALL spicy? 2nd time I have ordered from here and encountered the exact same problem . This time it was a delivery order and while the delivery man was at my door returning with change from ($100 dollar bill on a $60 order) my 9 year old son was throwing up. He heard him and until then stopped arguing about the spice in the food and agreed to refund the money and take the food back! I have been a fan of Thai food for many years now and I know for a fact that this food can come without the spice. As I'm writing this review I am also beginning to feel nauseous.......I do not recommend Thai Chili restaurant to my fellow Yelper's"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled on this place by accident. It was awesome. Everyone was friendly and the food was quite good. We will come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great value and has good service. My wife and I came here for lunch and we both got full for $15 and some change before leaving a tip. We both got lunch specials that started off with egg drop soup. The egg drop soup had peas and carrots and corn in it, which is different but still did nothing for me.  For our entrees I got a red curry chicken dish and my wife got an eggplant dish with tofu that she read good things about. When you order they have you rate how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1 to 10. We both requested a level 6 out of 10 spiciness. The dishes came in a short amount of time with one small egg roll each, some sweet and sour sauce on the side, and some white rice. The egg rolls were ok. So far I wasn't impressed but then I tasted the entree and was pleased. My red curry had great curry and coconut flavor to it with just the right amount of spice. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The chicken was just a little dry but it was all white meat so that is probably why. My wife's eggplant and tofu dish was great too. The tofu was not deep fried (which I like) and it had just the right texture and firmness to it. Normally i don't like tofu but this was good. The sauce was very tasty and different.  The eggplant was very well done. It is easy to screw up eggplant but this was just right. It wasn't bitter like eggplant can be sometimes and it wasn't too soft or mushy. The vegetables in this dish were equally as good as the ones in my dish. My wife's dish seemed hotter than mine but that is probably because of the coconut milk in my dish masking the heat. I would probably back off to a number 5 or even 4 spiciness on dishes without coconut milk in the future. When we paid our tiny bill we learned about their rewards program where your fifth entree is free! This is great. This is the first sit down restaurant with waiter service that I have heard of that has a reward card. It is a great value and we are already half way to a free entree! Sign me up for that!"}
{"text":"I ordered food to be picked up after seeing reviews on yelp i picked This place was yummy. They didn't have Massuman Curry which I love so Danny the waiter (he was so nice) told me to get the yellow curry and it was good. Will come back to try other things off the menu."}
{"text":"This place is small, but has plenty of good options available. For starters, the pot stickers and egg rolls are both tasty choices. The egg rolls are fried perfectly and are served with a delicious dipping sauce. 

 The basil chicken was really good  and was prepared with onions, peppers, and chile .However, the dish that stood out the most to me was their version of cashew chicken (the sauce is so good). 

We had a chance to talk with the owner (Ooy) during lunch. She was really nice, and explained that her restaurant does not use MSG. The restaurant also serves smoothies, but we were too full to try them. The food is authentic and is prepared quickly. Go there for lunch and support this local business........"}
{"text":"My wife and I found Thai Chili doing a Yelp review a while back. We LOVE this place! The food is well prepared. The Red Curry Chicken is one of our favorites! Their lunch portions are very filling and we also love the Dumpling Appetizers!

Try the Pad Pring Pao for a different twist. I'm telling you this food is awesome!

You ca also ask for no rice and extra vegetables so you can keep that Atkins thing goin'!

Go in and Ask for Mai the waitress, we love Mai!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service was very prompt and friendly.  The salad rolls were too big for my preference, causing the ingredient proportions to be off. The Tom Kha Gai soup had very good flavor but the chicken was rubbery. The cashew chicken was good but a bit too fishy. We would order different items if we came back."}
{"text":"Not too shabby

The food and service are pretty good and prices are decent. I feel like the portion size is small though. Overall, not a bad place for some consistently good Thai food. I've been here several times and it's always busy, lots of to-go pick ups for Uber and Postmates drivers."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful.  Curry was good but a little too watery for my liking. But still good. Definitely a hole in the wall that I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"I think they named this place after how cold it gets in the restaurant. It was a cool 60 degrees to make you shiver while you eat your thai food.

Here's the thing, the location of Thai Chili isn't the best. It's next to a karate class, subway, and a taco bell...so definitely not a place for a first date or a nice night out. It's a place for thai food and that's pretty much it. With that being said, the location and quality of food did not dictate the high prices on the menu. Two entrees + 1 appetizer (two spring rolls) = $30+ dollars is a little excessive for Thai Food. Maybe if this place was in Scottsdale, I could understand, but for a shacky place in Gilbert, not so much.

Spring rolls were decent, they lacked the wow factor...and there was only 2 given. I had to double check to make sure I didn't order off the kids menu.

Pad thai with beef was good, but seriously, it's really not that hard to mess up pad thai. All pad thai makes me go to the bathroom, this pad thai was no different. When I try pad thai that doesn't do that, I'll give that place 5 stars and a trophy. 

All in all, I won't be going back. The service was good, the restaurant was clean, but I didn't like the location or the high cost for average food. Thank you groupon for saving me 50% on a mediocre restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is great here don't get me wrong . I don't want to come off as racy ... but I'm Asian myself and felt like while I was eating everyone around me was being helped over me. The Asian gal there seemed like she would not help me nor come to my table asking how everything was tasting like everyone else. 

Love the food but was pretty disappointed in the customer service area ...."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often. It never disappoints! Great staff and food. Tonight, we brought out of town guests and sampled a arrange of appetizers before dinner. Had Thai spring rolls, wontons, and dumplings. All delicious and good flavor. 

Also, had chicken fried rice, combo platter, garlic and peppers. All different spice levels, all very good. Service has always been phenomenal and tonight was great! 

We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Always fresh,  tasty food.  Nice service whether take out or dine in. Great little hidden gem in the east valley"}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner here (May 17th, 2015) and I was impressed. Went with 2 very picky people who both cleared their plates. I had the Panang Curry (spicy level 3/10) and it was delicious. I didn't finish mine for the sole purpose of getting to take some home to eat later. The Thai iced tea was tasty. For the quality I would have understood expensive prices, but it was inexpensive too! I'll definitely be back, probably with new people too, and suggest it to friends as well."}
{"text":"Their coconut ice cream or mango with warm sticky rice. Perfect combos! I love the chicken with plum sauce and the drunken noodles! If I ask for drunken noodles spicy level 3, the powder isn't spread out through the noodles enough and I'll get some bites that are really spicy and some that aren't. No big deal though, I just ask for the powder on the side. And I love that they deliver! It's nice to have a great option other than pizza when you want to cozy up and stay in all night."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. Personal service, great fresh food. I love the red curry beef, the pad Thai, pad seeyu, all the soups, and the best orange chicken in the world. They are very family friendly. My kids are treated with respect and care."}
{"text":"I had their Pad Thai with level 6/10 spiciness, I can handle spicy food but I didn't realize 6/10 is already very spicy! I was crying after the 2nd bite and the server saw me, he asked me \"Would you like for us to fix it for you?\" Not only they fixed it but they prepared a whole new dish for me! Their food is really good! If you're craving for an authentic thai cuisine, highly recommended place plus very good service! :) I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and delicious! So glad I found this place! Highly recommend!! I'm updating this because I placed an order through Door Dash tonight and for the second time in a two week period they forgot an item. Whoever is doing to go orders needs to slow down and pay attention! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. This is the only place I've had Thai food so I can't really compare to others. But it's so good, I don't feel the need to find another. Everything is made-to-order and fresh. The wait times can a be little long but they're a small restaurant that make things right, so worth the wait! I get my food to go every time. I don't know what kind of Thai magic she does back there but the food is always on point and piping hot! The chicken pineapple rice, pan-fried noodles and masaman curry are go-to orders and never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Our family has ordered from Thai Chili through Grub Hub for a significant length of time and I would rate this restaurant, before tonight , as the best Thai food in Gilbert.  Tonight was a completely different experience.  Not only was my order incomplete, but the spice level was incorrect. When I called Thai Chili to report their inconsistency a woman ( teenaged girl) answered the phone, snickered at my request to dispute my order, and then proceeded to hang up on me.  This is not the Thai Chili I am familiar with.  The manager did call me back, but my plight went unanswered.  It is disappointing when a good restaurant turns bad.  Grub hub was amazing with their response and I would recommend them to anyone.

The next day the manager called again to resolve the issues which was an example of great management.  I am revising my star rating"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant multiple times and each time I am always impressed by their food and friendly staff members. My normal go to is always a toss between the green curry and the pad thai while my partner enjoys the spicy fried rice. Each dish is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Still great homemade Thai food after the years I have been coming here. Best pad si ew with chicken and pad ki mao with fried tofu. Well worth a visit if you have never been. Enjoy drooling over the pics :-)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in town. I've been to so many other spots but the flavor, quantity and quality can't be beat!! I frequent this place with coworkers and friends about 3-4 times a week and have never had a bad experience...
Come check it out for yourself!!
It can be a little tricky to find but it's located in the Albertsons shopping center on the NW corner of Sunset and Green Valley.."}
{"text":"Still craving this restaurant 4 days later!  Great customer service - very friendly and efficient.

The mushroom soup at $4 a bowl was a bargain and absolutely delicious!!

I tried the Rad Nar and loved every bite.

My friend had the drunken noodles and really enjoyed them.

Can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food we have ever had in Arizona! The portions are very large, there is a wide variety of dishes, and everything we've ever had we have left. Service is wonderful, it was kid friendly, and very clean and fast service. Our 10-year-old and six-year-old loved it and they want to go back. My favorite dish there is the pumpkin curry, you have to try it!"}
{"text":"I visited Thai Chili and had the option of picking my own table, which is always awesome in my opinion. The menu is full of traditional Thai dishes and some other Asian fusion dishes. There are some great options for vegetarians as well. I was pleased with my customer service experience and I will be back again. And the plum wine is delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best thai around.  The food is delicious, made fresh when you order and if you ask for something hot, they actually make it hot. It is a tiny place with a tiny kitchen, so wait times can be crazy, but if you have the time to wait it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Terrible Thai food. Super Americanized. Not fresh.

Got larb salad with tofu- dressing was gross and there was a only a sliver of cabbage. Lettuce and spring onions were old. 

Pad Thai with tofu - not fresh dressing, tasted like BBQ sauce. No veggies at all. 

I'm super disappointed cuz the rating was 4.."}
{"text":"cannot tell you how many times i have went to this place and they closed early - they make their own hours... and who doesn't stay open later than 7:30 besides banks?

expand your hours of business - grow your customer base - show some appreciation for the townsfolk in avon lake who support your business and pay your bills - give back to the community and also turning the phone line off early and displaying a message saying we are no longer taking orders tonight 


won't come back and i live down the street - will just drive to mark pi"}
{"text":"Great food! I've been here a few times now and every time it doesn't disappoint. The Pad Thai was awesome and I really like how fast the service is (since I come during my lunch break). They also deliver to where I live. I'd definitely check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The food is FRESH, HOT and DELICIOUS!!  The service is wonderful.  It looks like it is run by a family.  My mom and I got Drunken noodles and shrimp fried rice.  Soo spicy and tasty.  The food was so good we came back the next night to order more food.  
Too bad we live in Washington DC or this would be our local favorite!"}
{"text":"Had our first experience tonight- just ordered some chicken pad thai. We were asked on a scale of 1 to 5 our spicy preference. We went with a 3 and weren't disappointed- my husband likes more spicy and i like less, but this was perfect for both of us. The man on the phone and in person was more than friendly and he had our order promptly ready in 20 minutes. We will visit again soon! Than you!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fast service. Cute little gem in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"I placed an order on GrubHub for some Pineapple Curry and Pad Thai this evening. Our order came 30 minutes early ~ and was delivered within 20 minutes of me ordering piping hot! Now that is fast! 

The Pineapple Curry was for my husband and very good! He devoured most of it.

I got the Pad Thai level 3 hot. The Pad Thai was good, but I couldn't taste any spice at all. I ordered level 3 (normally I'd order Thai Hot or level 5 at most Thai restaurants), so that my husband could enjoy it, too! I was sad that it wasn't even slightly spicy at level 3. Other than that, it was delicious. 

We will totally order again, and next time, I'll try level 5 spice because I think even my husband could handle it."}
{"text":"Just ordered lunch for my department and we were all really impressed with the food we got.  We ordered pineapple fried rice with chicken, papaya salad, pad thai, chili mint chicken, and yellow curry.   Everything was absolutely delicious.  I will be ordering again for sure!"}
{"text":"Only bothered to give it more than 1 star because the food was pretty good. 

Cliffs: food is good, not amazing, and certainly not worth the trouble of dealing with the \"customer service\" (if you can even call it that)
-------

Friend and I walked in around 2:45 and was immediately met with hostility and a tone of utter annoyance. 

\"Is this for to-go??\"

\"Um we were gonna eat here...\"

\"We don't serve 15 minutes before closing. Do you want to do to go?\"

\"Sure that's fine.\"

**waitress walks away to the register without a word and we stand there assuming she's bringing menus to us**

In a snarky tone, \"well are you gonna order to go or not?\"

**we walk over and look at the menus** 

\"Do you know what you guys want?\"

My friend and I, feeling pressured, just gave our rushed orders.

While we sat and waited, a family of 4/5 started walking in.

\"Is this for to go?\"

\"We were gonna dine in\"

\"We don't serve 15 minutes between shifts\"

\"Oh okay\"

**family leaves**

I can understand wanting to close up and having your break but there's no need to be rude about it. Besides, you may have 15 minutes before closing but open is open. If you want that extra time, extend the period that you're closed. 

Server's name on the receipt was \"Lunch S\""}
{"text":"I love Thai Chili. We eat there every few week. I would eat there more often if I could. The food is always fresh and made to order. The manager and servers are always friendly and they have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Family loves this place.  Something for everyone.  41 with chicken was great ,  39 with chicken also great and the beef curry was sublime! 

Update - still good food - bad slow service"}
{"text":"The hubs and I go out for Thai food quite often and I've been wanting to try this place for a while now, and tonight was the night.  We were not disappointed!   The service was great, and I was very impressed on how fast the food came out.  Other Thai restaurants we've eaten at the food seems to takes for ever, but not here.  The food was so delicious we ordered BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, and Shrimp Pad Se-Ew.  Definitely recommend Thai Chili!"}
{"text":"FOOD:  is solid across the board.  I particularly like the combo drunken noodles and the Thai iced tea is also good.  I wish the menu were a little bit more extensive, but what they do, they generally do well.

SERVICE:  is generally good and personable.  They are friendly and responsive.

AMBIANCE:  it's a pretty intimate place with basic decor.  The strip mall has plenty of parking.

VALUE:  most dishes are $10, so value is decent."}
{"text":"Well, I got here about 10 mins. before closing, unbeknownst to me, and I didn't even get dirty I'm-gonna-spit-in-your-food looks. Big smiles and kindness all around. I feel bad now, but I didn't know they were closing until they started turning off lights when I left. Anyhow, the next thing I noticed when I got in my car was there was no smell. One of the best things about Thai is the wonderful aromas. How could this be? I checked and found my order packaged in plastic instead of styrofoam-phew! Nice touch. Unfortunately, when I got home I found the meat to be chewy @ best w/ a sticky, sweet sauce. At least, the cilantro stood out. Very fresh. This was served w/shredded cabbage-also kind of chewy and sticky rice. I've never had sticky rice w/a savory dish, but who doesn't love sticky rice, right? Overall, not to-die-for, but I'd probably go back. It's close to home and it was closing time after all. My bad."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, phenomenal service, and large portions. The food is very flavorful, comparable to lotus of Siam with 1/2 the price. Try their pad kee Mao, chicken salad, tom kha soup, and pad thai. Tom yum noodle soup is also packed with flavor. This is a family own shop; the family is extremely kind and sweet. The amazing food and incredible service makes this place, in my opinion, the best place for thai food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Two years ago I would have given a five star.  The last several months the service has gone downhill.  Called to place to go order; was on hold 11 minutes, a total of 15 minutes to order.  Food delivered (two entries) an hour and eleven minutes later.  I wrote this review as I tried to call to find out where my order is.  THe phone rang and rang and rang finally disconnecting (assuming by phone company) after 3 minutes of ringing.  Sad when good food is overshadowed by mediocre service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I've been to many Thai places in the valley and this is by far the best. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Good food!  Portion size was good.  I highly recommend the Thai coffee!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken pnang and tom yum soup"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints I love everything on the menu except the calamari lol...otherwise the soups, curry, desserts,appetizers are all to die for. I love spicy and I usually get 3 star and I'm not dripping with a runny nose afterward. Great service, live getting takeout from here"}
{"text":"Great cheep and very quick Thai food. Wasn't to impressed with the Thai beef salad I always order at Thai restaurants, but I did enjoy the chicken larb and beef jerky. I tried the green curry and I will order it again it had a nice flavor. All in all I definitely am returning for to go because you just can't beat the price for decent Thai food. Next time I will be trying a couple of noodle and rice dishes. We definitely finished nearly all of it between my husband and I after our workouts!"}
{"text":"We order delivery often from this restaurant and the food is consistently delicious, fresh and on time! We highly recommend Thai Chili!"}
{"text":"Amazing food every time! My wife and I order take-out via Grub Hub on a regular basis. I get the Pad Thai with Tofu and she gets the Yellow Curry with chicken and a side of rice. Hands down, great food! Great delivery time and well"}
{"text":"I came here on my friend's recommendation. I'm not a big curry fan, but 
perhaps the curry is amazing like she said. 

First off, when we walked in, the owner and waiter were talking to each other. My boyfriend and I weren't sure if we should wait to be seated or just walk to any table. After standing for a few minutes, the waiter told us to have a seat anywhere without leaving behind the counter. We sat down, and the two continued their conversation. I had to look back 4 - 5 times before the waiter came and brought us menus. When we decided what to order, he didn't come back until I looked back another 4 - 5 times. By the way, there was only one other table occupied that was deciding what they wanted for dessert. I can't say anything bad about the waiter because he was overall nice, but not attentive at all. We never got water refills.

I always order Pad Thai, and wasn't wowed by it here. First, they charge for adding tofu. I got a chicken and tofu mix - and although I paid for tofu, there wasn't much tofu added. I always get mild flavored Pad Thai, and I feel that really allows you to taste the food. If there's still a lot of flavor without the spiciness, then you know the natural dish is well made and not masked by the spices. The portion was alright - but not enough peanuts nor bean sprouts. The dish itself was way too sweet for my taste.

My boyfriend ordered the sizzling beef dish. I was able to finish my entire dish before his entree came out. The waiter didn't tell us that it was going to take that long. It came on a clay dish and sizzled a lot, but for the price, it wasn't worth it at all. The beef was pretty typical. It tasted kind of like black pepper chicken at Panda Express - but beef instead of chicken. FYI: my Pad Thai came out after a very long time as well. 

From walking in to walking out, I think it took us an entire hour for this meal. Don't go here if you're in a rush, and don't order the Pad Thai nor Sizzling Beef Dish."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Avon Lake. Drunken noodles are my go to as soon as I get home. The owners are kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"Went in to order my food and patently waited, after about a half an hour I went and waited by the front desk, and the two dudes who ordered way more food after me had already received there orders, the  buser seemed to notice I was still waiting for my food when he approached the  two ladies behind the counter and i noticed they started scrambling  and whisper that they must have droppped the ticket, they kinda giggled like they realized they weren't paying attention and left my food waiting in the window! normally I'd understand but the restaurant was empty and when she handed me my food she had no sense of care that she just wasted my time and my food that  I paid good money for just say there for a good ten minutes!"}
{"text":"Super casual little hole in the walk but good food at fair prices. Great Thai tea! Biggest issue for us was language barrier when ordering but we managed..."}
{"text":"Food quality: Out of 4 dishes that we ordered only one was par. The green curry was white, pad see ew is not supposed to be dipped in sweet n sour sauce and the Tofu lovers had no taste. The rice is supposed to be jasmine rice but it was a cheap quality, tasteless rice. This is not Thai food. This is a shame to Thai food.

Cost : $12 for every dish, why? No where in the valley Thai food cost that much."}
{"text":"Awesome!  However, check your ego at the door if you think you are a spice head.  It is hot!  I took the advise of the server and dialed it down a bit. Perfect."}
{"text":"I'm from Denver and looking for good food in LV. This is the place!  Excellent food  service!  I will come back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when craving Thai food.  And they deliver!! Everything my husband and I have tried has been delicious - and has just the right amount of spice. Fast food prices, delicious, quality proteins and veggies. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I  eat at this establishment several times a month and never at a bad experience either for dining in or take out.  Highly recommend if you like great Thai food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food And very friendly staff. I come here every chance I get I  highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Good tom yum soup. Mom pop shop with flavourful food. Service is quick and the decor is okayish. Great for a quick lunch, since it's generally not crowded around then."}
{"text":"A few weeks back my husband and I tried this place out. It was a Wednesday around 6:30 PM. We live in a part of town that doesn't have a lot of dining options, so we are always traveling. When we got there, we saw a huge line out the door. We entered the tiny room and was told by an employee that the mormon conference just got out, and so they were holding tables for them- but we could wait 30 minutes to dine -in. No thanks!

We decided to try carry out. For each of us to get a dish it came out to around $22 +$5 tip. A little steep for asian carry out. We were a fan of the taste and returned back. 

We decided to call in and order something for pick up. I ordered rice noodles- vegan style. My husband got black pepper chicken. When you pick up your to -go order they have the plastic bag double knotted with the receipt taped around it. My husband grabbed the bag and drove 20 minutes to our house... to find we got the wrong order. 

We called and explained and they said we could come back and get the correct order. They switched ours with someone elses. They fixed it for us, but it was a hassle to be driving all over. We will be back, but probably not going out of our way to go again."}
{"text":"Ok let me say that I'm not an expert on Thai food. Really I've only ever had it once before, but I liked it so I decided to give Thai Chili a try. I really liked it! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is I've only sampled one thing (the Beef Panang at a level 3) and it'd have to be drop dead awesome for something to get that (I'll be honest I've never given anything a 5). They gave me just the right level of spicy. I did take out and it was ready and hot when I got there but I think I will take my husband there in the future. It looks like a really intimate dining experience. I'm excited I found this place it will now be my go to Thai food place in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Without a shadow of a doubt the best Thai food in Ohio. I've tried well over 20 different in this state. I'll drive from 30 minutes away just to come get some.  Stop out for lunch and you'll get Tom Yam soup (WOW) and a spring roll with your entree. My favorite is the Pad Thai (Thai hot) such great flavor to go along with the heat. 

One wok one chef kitchen means that quality is top notch but you may have to wait for it. But ohh is it worth it. If you even slightly like Thai food do yourself a huge favor and swing on by you'll be blown away!!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny looking back at my old review. I even posted a photo of the food which I loved so much. Unfortunately, that has all changed. It has been slowly going downhill the last three times I've eaten at Thai Chili. This last time was so disappointing that I had to update my review. I love eggplant in Thai food, so I usually order the Spicy Eggplant at Thai Chili. Tonight I ordered it as a 3 on the spicy scale of 1-5 and it was not spicy at all. It even says spicy in the title. 
If you like salt, this is your dish. There were no flavors recognizable in the sauce. The only thing it tasted like was salt and every vegetable, piece of tofu and rice all tasted like salt. The eggplant pieces were unrecognizable from the mushrooms as they were so saturated in the salty sauce. I used to love their eggplant and make sure to savor the eggplant slices. I should have taken a picture of my dish tonight so you could compare to my old one. They don't even look the same. 
I am giving Thai Chili 2 stars because the service is good and they do give you large portions. That is what is keeping me from giving them 1 star."}
{"text":"The wait can be long I have spoken to other customers, waiting in queue on a Friday night, and we decided we were at fault for spreading the word and increasing their customer-base. Oh well, at least they are making profit. 
This place is bomb. I usually go on Friday nights with my friend or my family but I have also enjoyed their cheap, high quality, lunch specials. Their lunches are the best buy in the neighborhood!
The service is friendly, the ambiance is surprisingly lush and exotic (especially for a strip-center restaurant) and their sauces. OMG! What separates this Thai from others is their seasonings. My meals vary, Panang Curry is my old faithful but I have also had their peanut sauce dishes. Finally, they have a pretty cool loyalty card so frequent customers get the occasional free meal (Excellent!) After reviewing this place I suddenly have a craving so I know I will be there tonight :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at so far! Food is delicious! And not to mention the customer service is A1! Finally found a food place that I like and it's literally right across from our place. Totally recommend this place if you're looking for a good Thai food place! I'll be coming here again for sure."}
{"text":"My first time here customer service were great but the papaya salad , pad Thai , tom yum soup were too sweet for my taste bud I'm going back to Siri Thai"}
{"text":"Love the Panang chicken and red curry here.  Best overall place for Thai I have found in mesa."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant per living social app and was surprisingly pleased by the food that they serve. The taste was splendid, original Thai food that really rare to find in the valley. Their Thai ice tea was perfect! Crispy tofu with peanut Thai sauce as appetizer was melting in my mouth! And my favorite Pad See Ew with beef was taste so good that I'm craving for more. They also were very generous in their portion. Overall I'm pretty sure I'll be back in this place for more Pad See Ew!"}
{"text":"Usually go to our usual Thai place, but decided to try something different and I'm glad we did! The food is excellent and everything was very flavorful! Well definitely be coming here again. And they have complimentary dessert!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Eat24 while on a business trip.  Spicy eggplant with shrimp, and lard with pork, both Thai hot. They were. The portions were good and the food was fresh."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, and ordered pineapple curry with vegetables, pad key mao (drunken noodles) with beef, and the chicken satay. Everything was delicious! Service was very attentive, and the sweet sticky rice I got to go is perfect. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is probably my favorite because of the Roasted Duck! Very flavorful and wonderful skin texture. Their staff was polite and very respectful! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I ordered soup for pick up and they said it will be ready in 6-7 minutes. Got there in 10 minutes and still had to wait another 10 minutes? Makes no sense! -.- what's worse is the overpriced food! It's not good at all!"}
{"text":"We typically walk to Nunthaporn's on main (close to work) but it was randomly closed today so we loaded up in the car and hightailed it to Val vista-- since I have recently heard great reviews! 
We were greeted and seated promptly. We got three different lunch items after asking our server a few questions -- she was great! We all got salads, or plates of lettuce with a sweet dressing, I passed since I try not to eat sugar. The meals all came out at different times, kinda strange. I had chicken and the jalapeño and some other veggies with no rice add extra veggies. I'm not a big person, but give me enough to fill me up! Seriously small, but delicious portions. The spice was awesome but I left hungry..."}
{"text":"We've been going for years -- I'm obsessed with Thai curries -- of the dozens of places we've tried, this is always our favorite!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST Chicken Curry and Thai Iced Tea. This is one of our favorite restaurants. We always dine in, pick up and delivery (through grub hub and Uber Eats). Unfortunately, we had a lot of bad experience on deliveries. Everytime we ordered they always forgot to put items they are very inconsistent and we are always dissapointed. Just today, we ordered 2 curry chicken and 2 thai Iced teas through grubhub, paid $45 and they forgot to include the iced tea and all you will hear from them is \"we apologized\". Well I guess, we are not using the service anymore."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, i ordered a lot of food for a to-go order and the customer service was fantastic. I love spicy thai and this was definitely some of the best thai food in Vegas. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome tom kha chicken - they make it perfectly spicy to your desire on the 1-10 Asian scale. Really like their Pad Thai too. And the owner seems really genuine and always offers you water while you wait for your to go order. Only downside: if you're out of cash they clip you a vig on the CC merchant processing fee. Sorry I hate paying $1.50 for a MC/V processing fee, just jack up your prices a tad, or give people who pay cash a 5% discount. Who knows though, our worthless govts. probably don't allow a cash discount as they want to push using plastic to enrich their greedy banker friends and be able to increase tax revenue by having a MC/V record of the transaction.

I digress, try their tom kha kai - it's awesome."}
{"text":"The pictures look amazing. The food is not amazing. Seriously the worst Asian food I've ever had. My husband and I both had upset stomachs and diarrhea after just a few bites. 

Do not recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant. I've never been disappointed. Always delusions with friendly service. I recommend number 7 \"Drunken Noodles\"."}
{"text":"We had cashew chicken  ($12), sweet & sour chicken ($12) one brown rice and one white rice and a cup of Tom kha gai soup costing a total of $35 before tip.  Service was reasonable, food was OK but lacked intricate Thai flavors and pricing was expensive.  Last weeks trip to Nonthaporns in Mesa on Main is a superior choice"}
{"text":"We love Thai Chili, and we've been fond of thai food for quite some time but rarely do we find a place we could eat at several times a week. We've been here for both dinner and lunch and are never disappointed. Delivery is also always excellent. 

Lunch specials are great and come with salad in the summer time and soup in the winter, both are excellent. The salad dressing is a homemade pineapple dressing that is so good we actually buy it by the bottle and use it at home. 

The staff is amazing and most of them know us by name and are never shy to stop and chat with us. Service is always excellent and we never want for anything. The atmosphere is great for dinner, low lighting and very romantic. 

The food here is unbelievable and unbelievably spicy! I read some other reviews for here that talk about the spice levels and they aren't kidding. I love that the chef makes all her own sauces and will never share the recipe making them wholly her own. This is  family owned restaurant and its obvious by the quality. We've tried several dishes from here, some of our favorites are the Sa-te chicken, thai spring roll and combo appetizers are all awesome. Main dishes we love the green, yellow, and penang curries, all full flavored and the ingredients always fresh. Other favorites include the spicy eggplant, drunken noodles and the crispy chicken with spicy plum sauce are fantastic. Gotta get the homemade coconut ice cream with crushed peanuts for dessert too. 

Overall, service and food- amazing. Price- well worth what you get, we always take food home for seconds. If you aren't in the mood to dine in try their take out or delivery, you won't be disappointed- they never skimp on portions."}
{"text":"I love the food. The best tom yum soup I've enjoyed in a long time. Others pale by comparison in flavor and depth. I have to say the same for the bubble teas. 

One thing that I fully appreciate as a lover of spicy food is the complete use of the spice scale...all the way up to Thai spicy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  After ordering the $8.50 Pork Thai Basil lunch received a small cup of spicy Tom Yam mushroom soup, a very small crispy roll with a spicy sweet and sour dip, and a pretty small medium spicy serving of Thai Basil that was about 50% bell peppers.  Everything was served piping hot.  No problems with wait times but one person ahead of me left and a couple behind me was told that there might be a 45 minute wait.  Only one visible employee who was taking orders in person and on the phone, waiting all of the tables, and managing the takeout orders.  That's a lot to handle, but given that there are only six tables in this restaurant clearing them really should have a higher priority."}
{"text":"YUM!!! Best Thai place in Gilbert hands down. Service is good an the currys are amazing."}
{"text":"So we've made it in for dinner twice since our long dry spell of bad luck. Food is still wonderful. Owner is still friendly as heck and very helpful. We really missed their food!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland. The Tom yum soup is the best. The owners are super nice and friendly.  I usually come in for the lunch special which is a great deal. You get a spring roll and cup of Tom yum soup for starters before the meal. 
I'd like to come back and try the dinner menu, it looks good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, one of the best pad thais we've ever had, and a very enjoyable pad se ew. Best Thai we've had in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I moved here from a place that had several delicious Thai restaurants. This place reminded me of the Thai food I grew up with. The red curry was to die for! I ordered for delivery so I've never been to the restaurant but the delivery was fast! Thanks for some great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. I split the mushroom soup and the tofu in plum sauce with my girlfriend. It was enough food for two, and left room for sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. Great service with a personal touch. Food is consistently awesome! We love it all from pineapple curry to prig pao, to pad thai, to kam kha gai. Best thai food around."}
{"text":"This was a quick lunch as we were heading home. We didn't expect it to be as good as it was!! Both my husband and I had the curries, green and red at a level of hotness of 7 and 8, both meals were exceptional! We WILL be coming back next time we are in town!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were starting to loose faith in the quality of food here at Thai Chili.  We received an invitation to revisit the restaurant with a complementary entree.  I must say, the food was on point!  Spice level was perfect.  We definitely will be back.  Thank You Ray"}
{"text":"This is a small little place, but the food is so good. I went with a few friends and I did not expect it to taste so good. The food was served hot, it tasted fresh and I was full when we were done. They had a nice sized menu to choose from as  well.  They actually wait on you here as well.  I had the Orange chicken and it was  lunch special  around $7.99. I recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I had my food delivered and this is seriously the best Thai food I've had since I moved to the mainland. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ok, totally not going to lie here! This is the BEST Thai food I have had in about 3 years! I had the Crab Pad Thai with a spicy level 9 and a fresh cucumber salad and a glass of tea. The restaurant was very very clean, the service was super prompt, and the food was so fresh! I had so much crab in my pad thais, that was lumpy and delicious, I was almost feeling bad for how awesome the pricing was on it. It WAS AMAZING! I tried so so hard to eat it all, but it was a lot of food for my usual quantity of food that I eat in a sitting. I HIGHLY recommend that crab pad thai dish. I also recommend the cucumber salad. Nice and light, a little sweet, a little tangy. Not overpowering. What a great find! I plan to head back to Vegas in February and I am stopping here again for more of that Crab Pad Thai! I can't stop thinking about how awesome it was."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The pineapple fried shrimp was really good! Its in a bad area and inside smells like their plumbing is bad!!"}
{"text":"I heard that Thai Chili was good but I never got around to trying it until this week. And I gotta say they were right! I love the fact that you can order it as spicy as you want (or as mild as you want for you whimps)  and that they had a few vegetarian options, not just 1. I will be back.... I may even become a regular!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing people!

My husband and I have been going to Thai Chili for nearly 2 years. We discovered it by a livings social voucher and have been going back ever since. Although we order the same things over and and over again, it is because they are so good that we don't try other things. It's located in a strip mall, but don't be fooled. You don't want to miss this place! See you soon for some chicken pad thai and drunken noodles."}
{"text":"Had two decent dishes here. The first carryout order I placed was the eggplant dish for lunch and I got it carryout.  It was quite tasty, although a bit heavy on the salt, and when I got back to my office I found my container was missing the rice... Ooops!  The manager is nice and wants to make sure you are satisfied with the meal, so he offered to buy my next meal for the inconvenience as I was not able to make the 12 minute drive back again for rice. So a few weeks later I tried the yellow curry with shrimp as carryout at lunch.  I got this a level 2 on the spice which was perfect for my heat preferences, but I found the dish to be lacking in the way of veggies and overall substance.  Overall, this is an okay spot and I may consider stopping here again if I was with a group and wanted lunch in a quick fashion.  Prices are indicative of slightly higher quality restaurant experience, and not the casual atmosphere of the dining room and food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and outstanding customer service. I highly recommend! All of the currys are my favorite. Even a great pumpkin curry offered now too."}
{"text":"I didn't want to rate this place because I didn't want anyone else to know about it! The food here is FANTASTIC. The wait staff are INCREDIBLE, extremely helpful, and funny, too! This is the best Thai food I've had in 20 years. 

The place is tucked back into a shopping center - I've passed by this place a hundred times and never knew it was there. It's absolutely worth looking for. We can't wait to eat there again!

Be careful, however - they have some dishes that are HOT. Make sure you tell them how you want it."}
{"text":"I will preface this with saying I worked for a woman from Thailand in her restaurant where she served made to order (right down to chopping the veggies) thai food. 


I love Thai Chilli and we order from there a couple times a month.  I've never ate inside as we get carry out or order delivery.  Our favorites are sweet and sour and pad Thai.  You can order different levels of spiciness for the dishes and different meat choices.

It's not on the same level as the lady I used to work for but it's the best I've found since."}
{"text":"Tom Yum Seafood Soup is something you will crave and cause you to return here. The spicy scale is accurate here: I ordered an 8 out of 10, and it was legit. I believe a 1 should be a little spicier than air, and a 10 should have you break into a sweat, alter your blood flow and make you seek out ice or bland foods to counteract what is happening in your mouth. 

I really, really like this place."}
{"text":"Love Thai Chili, it's our go to spot in the Gilbert area for yummy Thai. Our favorite is the panang beef or chicken."}
{"text":"Food is really great. We ordered delivery and they piled everything in on top of itself, so all three of our dishes were a soggy mess. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"We went out of our way to try this place because it looked good in the reviews. The staff is great and the service was fast. We loved the food but several of us wished we hadn't gone 6 or 7 on the spice level--it was pretty spicy!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time eating here. It was so delicious. I had the Thai Fresh Rolls with peanut sauce for an appetizer, then I had Pad Thai with heat level 3. There was just enough heat, but it let the flavors come through. I also had the Thai iced tea. I will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I really LOVE this place! Not only is the food good but the service is outstanding! The owner goes out of his way to make sure that the food is fresh, hot and tasty. 
He also goes out of his way to make you comfortable and has really tasty suggestions."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! The best Thai food I've had! I only order from here! Delivery is awesome, the food is always hot!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Staff is terribly rude. You work at a restaurant..it's called customer service."}
{"text":"Wow, they are fast! Most people seem to dine in, but their take-out orders come super quickly. The prices seem pretty fair for what you're getting, and I'd definitely recommend the mango with sticky rice dessert"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. We had the coconut shrimp as an appetizer and the dumplings both we were excellent! The salt and pepper prawns were pretty good and the salmon special was just ok. The flavor of the seasoning was excellent my fish was a tad overcooked. Regardless is was a good meal & experience."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening around 5:30 pm. The host had us seat ourselves and told us up front that the wait time would be 45 minutes to an hour for food because they were busy. The restaurant is a husband-wife team where the wife cooks and the husband does everything else. So we decided to stay and I'm glad we did. The food and service is spectacular. We got Tom Kha soup, jasmine soup, and chicken pad Thai. Mine was medium, hers was no spice. The food is authentic and fresh. Definitely worth the wait.  Not the place to go if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"You must try this place.Great food and really nice people working there. This is a must!!! Try the yellow curry and the pad thai. Good price and amazing food."}
{"text":"Great food, great  service . Try  the pot stickers, and the won ton soup. They will ask you how hot do you want it, don't go above a seven!"}
{"text":"Driving around looking for a place for lunch, found this by accident.

It was packed! Only two tables left open.

Quick warm welcome by staff, immediately had my drink and a delicious fresh, crisp salad with light dressing. 

I ordered chicken green curry and it was great!

Very attentive wait staff! Fantastic lunch values!

I'm glad this is so close to where I now work!

I shall return"}
{"text":"I love this place.... but I haven't actually ever been inside. Found this place on Yelp and have ordered delivery about 6 times already (even though it says there's no delivery on Yelp- there really is and this place gets an extra star from me for delivering). I've never been disappointed with the food, delivery time, or service over the phone. Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles are excellent staples as well as the Spring Rolls. I also really like the Tofu Lovers (Fried tofu, lots of veggies, and Thai 'gravy') and the Thai Toast. Will definitely have to try the curry next time!"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review; I'll admit that I usually just read. 

After viewing the menu online, I decided on the Masaman curry with tofu and veggie spring rolls. After getting the food home, I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions, especiallyfor the price!

After the first bite I couldn't stop. Amazing! The curry was perfect, and they did not skimp on the tofu! The rice had the perfect stickiness, and the spring rolls were great! Even though I LOVE very spicy food, I opted for medium spice level just to be safe. Next time I'll definitely opt for the Thai Hot level!"}
{"text":"I always scrolled past this place on Yelp when looking for delivery. I made that mistake too many times!! I ordered pretty close to closing time and they were still so great about handling my order. I got the shrimp pad thai and the orange chicken. Both were excellent and even with the last minute delivery order the food was really fresh and still hot! Will definitely keep them at the top of my list from now on!"}
{"text":"Looked on Yelp for the good Thai that delivered the first night we moved into our new house and found Thai Chili. The food is good, menu has a lot to choose from and they're fairly quick with their delivery...can't ask for a lot more!

My bf gets the beef pad thai every time we've ordered (which has been about 5 times in the past few months), I've tried the dumplings, chicken satay, egg rolls, chicken with peanut sauce over spinach, their green chicken curry and their mushroom soup. Everything I've tried has been pretty good, with the exception of my last order. I got the curry and the soup (second time for the curry and first time for the soup), I thought I ordered them the same spicyness - 1 star- because the 1 star I had from their before had just enough heat. Well my last order was SO spicy I couldn't even eat it. I mixed an entire can of chicken broth in with my soup and my mouth was still on fire! It had great taste though! I'll order again, just very mild next time."}
{"text":"Thai fried rice is good, but uploaded pic by user \"Fiona\" is of combo fried rice. I know this because I ordered it based on her pics and received a basic chicken fried rice w NO veggies. If you want veggies you have to order combo fried rice. It was still delicious though."}
{"text":"Their pumpkin curry is fabulous! The service is perfect, thank you for making me feel at home."}
{"text":"Often I find that some of the best eating places can be found in small strip centers as long as one is willing to take the risk of being disappointed. 
I took a chance to grab a quick lunch at this place and was I generously rewarded. 
Very clean and well laid out interior. Prompt and friendly service. 
My drunken noodles were just superb. Generous serving and mouth watering. The amount of veggies was just right so that the protein and the noodles stood out in all their glory. 
But for the distance from my home I would be a regular here. 
Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"This review is solely for Thai Chili's delivery.

We placed an order for delivery over the phone tonight.  The person who answered was very polite and specific, she double checked our order and quoted 30 minutes.  The order arrived, correctly, in 27 minutes.

I had the Larb salad with chicken with a spice of 7 - it was perfect!  The pungent flavor combo of cilantro, lemongrass, and red chili with moist chicken packed just enough spice to make my nose hot - exactly what I wanted.  It came with rice and cabbage leaves.  I wish it had come with lettuce leaves actually because it would've been even more fantastic as a lettuce-wrap style dish.  The raw cabbage was stiff and harder to use for a wrap.

My mom had the Nuah-yang which she said she really enjoyed (spice of 3).  I thought it should have come sliced instead of one big piece of beef but the flavor was good.  It came with sticky rice which I thought was so-so but I'm not a fan of sticky rice in general.

We also ordered the Thai dumplings which I thought were fine, but the sauce was too thick and sweet for my taste.

Overall, I would definitely order from Thai Chili again and my dish was so good I could see myself having it for lunch once or twice a week, every week."}
{"text":"Being a thai girl growing up on thai food this place is amazing. You know how it is... Nothing beats home cooked meals but this place is close! Love the waiter there. He has his special sauce and entres you should all try. Very nice staff and very great service. We tried eating there at lunch and dinner times and was always busy. Definitely a great place to get some thai food! Take advantage of their coupons! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you're hungry! Try the Thai tea :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food hands down in the East valley. I just wish they followed the special instructions when I order delivery.  Tonight I ordered Pad Thai with lots of spice and I got none.  Insert sad face.  Don't get me wrong... the food was still amazing."}
{"text":"Ok, my coveted 4 stars for being a fresh restaraunt. I life Thai food. If you have a passion for real, fresh food and have never tried Thai, you're missing out. If you've had Thai, you'll love this place. Small, but always full. They actually use a grandma's secret family recipes.  Really."}
{"text":"Update - Feb 2018

So... I've been back. I decided to give it another go because I found that I love the Beef Panang too much. The service has been better than in the night that I posted my original review, but only just so. It is my understanding that Thai Chili is under new management and they clearly have some learning curve pains. The quality of the food is still what I have been used to but the wait times are really hot and miss regardless of time of day. I will keep updating as time progresses.

Original Review


I have come here many times and absolutely love the Panang Beef Curry. Over the past several visits however, the wait times have gotten longer and longer. Tonight I ordered online and then arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes after I placed the order. The restaurant was not busy and the server recognized my order and said that it was coming. After waiting 25 minutes at the counter and watching three other people pick up their orders, I had enough. Keep in mind that I had a simple order of Panang Curry and Soup. I went up to the counter and stated that I wanted to cancel my order. No apologies. A simple \"we will call Eat24\" to cancel your payment for online services. If I didn't like your food so much I would give you one star. What in the world has happened to you guys?"}
{"text":"Love the food here!  I think they have the best fried rice ever, and love that the vegetables and meat are large pieces and not chopped into teeny pieces.  I almost always get the Mussaman Curry and it's some of the best I've ever had.  My second favorite is the sizzling beef, although last time I had carry out the meat was tough and way overcooked.

They handle special orders with no problem, although every addition costs $$.  They used to run a spice scale of 1-10 with 5 being comparable to jalapenos, but have since changed it to a 1-5 scale with 3 being the old 5.  My biggest complaint here is that twice now they've reversed the spiciness of the dishes ordered.  Once when I ate in my curry had no spice and my friends had so much spice she couldn't eat it.  Of course they fixed the problem for us right away.  The second time it happened was a carry-out order and it was too much of a hassle to return for the correct items.  Can't see why this should be so difficult to get right.

They have a discount card of sorts, accumulate points based on dollars spent and then earn $10 off a purchase.  I also recently received a 20% email for being in their \"loyalty program for a year\".  

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Okay, Thai Chili owners.  Thanks for responding to my yelp complaint.
I really hope that the management atmosphere keeps improving.

UPDATE:
The owners contacted me and offered to make it right, and I did take them up on it (I mean, I was having spicy eggplant withdrawal!!!), but my friend is still just not ready to take that chance.

I am pretty regular over there when I'm working in Phoenix (less than a block from my office), so I'm glad to know that the management is listening and doesn't just let mistakes (multiple mistakes) go unchecked.

Thanks again, Thai Chili owners for extending your care!
It is most appreciated!"}
{"text":"Best chicken yellow curry I have ever had! Also came with some awesome customer service from the two boys upfront!"}
{"text":"Yum.  This is the only place I've liked curry with coconut milk.   Service is friendly,  will be back again ."}
{"text":"It was good and bad.  The prices are higher than other Thai restaurants.  The shrimp are bite size, which I thought was strange compared to other Thai restaurants.  The chicken coconut soup was awesome, but, it's $4.95 for a pint and at other Thai places it runs around $3.95.  We ordered 2 dishes - one was with chicken/shrimp off the specialty list, came with glass noodles.  Gross.  The noodles were mushy, the shrimp were tiny and the chicken was dry.  And, it was expensive.  Same with the seafood rice noodle dish.  the sauce was gross and the rice noodles were so overcooked that they were disintegrating (which is what happens when you overcook rice noodles).  The guy that took our order was trying to be diplomatic when I asked about this dish, if he would recommend it.  He kept trying to steer us to order something else.  I really wanted to order one of their curry dishes BUT, and this is crazy, they charge an extra $3 to substitute rice with rice noodles.  Seriously?  No other restaurant does that.  Not only that, the rice noodles that came with our dish were disintegrating due to over cooking.  We're not going back.  Too bad because the area needs a good thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food but it generally runs hot. If you normally like medium you should order mild. The beef curry was excellent - super tender."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best authentic Tom yum outside of Thailand! The last time I had tom yum this good was in Bangkok. Most restaurants don't even know how to make authentic Tom yum soup. It's usually too bland for me. The soup was so good, I just couldn't stop eating. And they use the jumbo shrimp all three dishes that we ordered, payaya salad and pad see ew were also great.

It's a very casual Mom and Pop restaurant with about 10 tables. But the food amazing! The serving is large for Thai restaurants in this area. The food came out very fast, so if you're hungry and in a hurry then this is the place for you.

I live in California, too bad I can't come here too often."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed their Panang Curry with Tofu and the Thai Tea! They also deliver so that's a bonus!"}
{"text":"What's you number?  On the heat scale!  This place tailors the dish to your preference so wether you like to breath fire (level 9, like me) or you think water is pushing the edge on the spicy scale you'll find what you like.

The yellow curry is my regular dish, the lunch special comes with a nice little side salad, egg-drop soup and a delicious little egg-roll.  For dessert give the coconut ice cream or mangoes with sweet sticky rice a try."}
{"text":"Love the food, hot very tasty and there's no lack of flavor. Definitely would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, the kind of place that knows you by name ( certainly me, I eat their food every week, usually more than once!), and they aren't afraid to bring the heat. I go between Thai hot and a 4/5 ( I notice that it's hotter when I'm in person), and can't go wrong with the pad siew, pad thai, or any of the curries ( the panang is stellar). Oh, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in my meal here last night.  I'm staying at my sisters and we decided to order some take out. I like to judge Thai places by the Pad Thai so I ordered chicken Pad Thai spicy 3, my sister got pork pad Thai spicy 2. Hers looked a lot better than mine but still not great. 
My noodles almost had no sauce. A chunk of the noodles were stuck together with no sauce/flavor at all.  Even her pad Thai tasted bland like some major ingredients were missing.  
Also had a chicken spring roll. The chicken was so dry it was mealy. Fell apart. 
I don't know why the reviews are so good. This is not Thai food :(."}
{"text":"Came in to see what it was.  It is a very small and clean restaurant.  The cashier/ owner was very nice.  The food is super solid, and very well priced.  I enjoyed the iced coffee.  If i want a fast lunch I would go back.  There are a lot of Thai places in Henderson and THai Chili is one of the better faster quick serve places."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch. Get there early as it fills up. Servers go above and beyond to be attentive even when busy. Lunch special includes a salad and an egg roll! Spicy level 1-5, ask for 2 on your first visit...Decor is pleasant and appropriate."}
{"text":"Service was dissappointing,   Food was just OK, papaya salad was made different from any Thai Restaurant, it was with pad Thai sweet sauce which it is not suppose to be also No peanuts on papaya salad like there is suppose to be.  Then the glass noodle salad was missing the shrimp suppose to be with chicken AND shrimp. Then to talk about the service we were going to pay the bill and noticed the prices were wrong, there menu said Glass Noodle salad was $9.99 for salad including chicken AND shrimp but the bill said $10.99 also Papaya Salad said Chicken OR Shrimp $9.99 they also charged us $10.99 They said we added shrimp when we did not , the menu says with it. They lied straight to my face. They tried to turn over the menu to dinners where it says add $1 if adding but that was for Meals on other side. I can not believe they didn't honor their own menu prices. And rather I walk out upset. Definitely won't be back. I strongly suggest find another Thai Restaurant. It was more like Fast food joint that didn't know much about running a business. I eat Thai all over the city it was dissappointing. I've also been to Thailand for a month. And have authentic Thai made all the time. Almost forgot Sticky Rice was Microwaved and Hard."}
{"text":"Their Tom Kha Gai with tofu is very good and the yellow curry w/ tofu (spice level 2) is  super tasty. Plus, I loved the Thai ice tea. And despite being busy, the staff was able to provide prompt service w/ a smile."}
{"text":"Delicious, silver noodles  are my favorite with egg. There Thai coffee is really good also."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up, food was okay. The one thing that peeved me was that the Pad Thai noodles had no sauce and they stuck together and molded to the container they came in. Not appetizing at all and not to mention hard to eat and SUPER dry. Yellow curry was decent. Got the \"sa-te\" combo skewers were dry and the \"peanut\" sauce had a weird jelly texture.  Wasn't impressed. I do take in consideration that I order to-go and  that something's are better served in the restaurant. So maybe it I'm in the mood for Thai food I might give it another try."}
{"text":"Shamelessly i enjoy spicy chicken pad thai from Thai Chile at least 2x a week! It is always perfectly spiced, fresh & pipping hot!  Love that they deliver although i havent tried it yet & the staff are very attentive. If u like Thai you HAVE to try Thai chile- beef pad se ew is also a fav!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has delicious food at reasonable prices.  It is my go-to Thai restaurant in Green Valley.  They have many vegetarian options and they do take out and delivery, which is convenient because I work up the street.  My favorite dish is probably the Pad See Ew, but I also enjoy the curries.  Some of my friends rave about the Cashew Chicken dish."}
{"text":"I have searched Thai restaurants for the best Pad Se Ew with tofu in the area. That is how I judge. Well, ladies and gents, this is it. It can, at times, be a wait. Don't be a butthead and come give them a bad review. They are a small operation that cooks to order. This is why it is fresh. This is why it is good. That's not rocket science. If you want crappy, Asian fast food...go to Panda Express...then be depressed because you made a horrible decision. 

Expect to wait or be surprised when you don't. It's hit or miss, but so delish and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cool little place! Good food, good service, very nice people! The spicy fried rice was delicious. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Really great pad Thai and the coconut citrus are exactly what I was looking for. I'll get hotter next time though!"}
{"text":"Stopped by 5 minutes before their closing time to order take out and they told me they were closed. Funny because their open sign was still on and there were people still eating inside. I used to run a restaurant so I know it sucks when people come in right before close but you always serve until closing time. You can start to close things down but can't refuse service just cause your want to go home early. Guess I'll take my service and money elsewhere. Tried their pad thai once before and wasn't happy with it but was going to give them a second chance and try something different. Never going back now."}
{"text":"Done with this place!  The hours suck.  Finally took work off early to get there before 7 (closing, yes at 7)  Walk in and we are the only ones there, it was 5pm sharp.  The owner says it's a 45 min wait.  This guy only cares about his carry out customers.  It's randomly closed.  They are so proud of it being a one wok kitchen.  Well it needs several more and MORE employees and chefs!  When we did eat there (a year or more ago and have tried several times since to find doors closed) the food was ok.  He should take out his tables and say take out only"}
{"text":"It was a raining Saturday night and I was cold to the bone and wanted a warm bowl of curry to fill my tummy, I have driven by Thai Chili a few times and that night it was beckoning me to come on in, so I went!

What a cute little place, love the feel of it. It's very clear that they do a lot of to go business, the call in orders & people coming and going were nonstop.
 
Right off the bat I ordered some Thai tea, I love that stuff and it was perfectly sweet just the way I like it! Also ordered Sa-Te Chicken, it's really the peanut sauce I am after, that stuff is amazing, the chicken has always been a afterthought to me when I ordered that in the past at other places, but this time, the chicken was the main star, it was perfectly cooked and the seasoning, omg the flavor was amazing, almost shameful to put the peanut sauce on it. I was torn, I would bath in the peanut sauce if I could, but I didn't want anything to deter the flavor of the chicken, but in the end the peanut sauce happened.

For the main dish I went with the Mussamun curry, I have to say out of all the curries, Mussamun is my favorite and it was what I craving on this cold night. It had great flavors, the chicken potatoes, carrots all perfectly cooked it was creamy orange and just heaven in the belly!! I also ordered it Thai Hot, whenever I got to a new place I just jump right to Thai Hot, the hotter the better for me, the waitress told me that's like habanero hot, and I told her to bring it!! When my dish arrived, you could visually see it was spicy, and after a few bites in my eyes were watering, SO SO GOOD!!! Then the waitress comes back to our table and tells me that their heat table goes to ten and that Thai Hot is around a 6,,,ooohhhhh oooommmmgggggg I need to try and 8 next time! 

Great little find, everyone was so very friendly, I enjoyed this place and look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"I've never had a better plate of phad thai.

Placed an order on the way home from work yesterday, and the phone issues seem to be completely gone.  The spice options are back, and my food was fantastic!  If I could add a 6th star I would"}
{"text":"As usual the food at Thai Chili has no equal!!! The pineapple fried rice is worth the trip alone. The tom kha gai soup is the best in ten states. Simply the best Thai food in Arizona with outstanding service and atmosphere. We will always be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for a decent Thai spot in the Henderson area. Saw this place and read some reviews, decided to give this place a try. 

I seated myself to a clean and stocked (condiments) booth. Was greeted in a timely manner and handed a paper menu. Options were pretty limited to most common Thai dishes. 

Ordered the Panang Curry w/ Chicken with medium heat. It came with a plate of steam white rice. And a Thai ice tea. The curry, to my astonishment was pretty good. You can taste the hints of basil and bamboo, as you should with this kind of curry. Definitely made fresh to order since it took some time (about 15-20 min) to get my order. Their tea was as to be expected from a Thai iced tea. 

Service was adequate and on parr. The waitress was very kind and non aggressive (which is always preferred esp during the holidays, it's understandable, no one wants to be at work). The place was clean. No restroom visit."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have always had great service. I love their yellow curry, and haven't heard anything bad about their menu. They do accommodate  both mild and Thai hot so anyone can enjoy. This is an example of a small restaurant that has stepped up and  offers great food for a fair price with good service!"}
{"text":"A small, somewhat hidden location, Thai Chili can be easily passed by, so be on the look-out. 

Stopped in just once here for pickup. Took home 2 Pad See ew and One Chili Noodle. The food was ready pretty quick, and tasted good. I would come here for a quick meal no problems. They also have Boba Tea available. I tried the Thai Tea Boba, and though nothing like a stand alone Boba Joint in regards to amazingness, it was a nice compliment to my meal. If I worked close to Thai Chili, I can see myself coming here quite often for a quick lunch fix."}
{"text":"Their food is very authentic and tasty. I enjoyed a number of various entrees and appetizers. I liked the drunken noodles and the spring rolls. I will return."}
{"text":"Had a little party at a friends house.  He ordered Thai Chili, for delivery (out of the delivery window).  Not only did they deliver farther than usual, it was the owner who brought it.  GREAT FOOD!  EVERYTHING was awesome.  Not as spicy (5) as may have expected, but was really really good!"}
{"text":"We recently discovered Thai Chili having patronized another Thai restaurant for several years. We have now visited Thai Chili a second time today. Their food is excellent as is their service."}
{"text":"Ordered the papaya salad and it was far from good. They said it was \"American\" style as opposed to \"Thai\" style. They should stick the the original."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a quiet and casual sit down area, though I cannot comment on the dining service as I have never eaten in. This is our go-to Thai take out restaurant; they make the tastiest pad Thai, with a perfect balance of scallions, sauce, lime, and peanuts with portions to satisfy. I also love the pad see ew - the fish sauce is not overpowering, and chicken is thinly sliced and tender, and it's not sweet like I've had at other restaurants. My fiancée's favorite dish is the drunken noodles, and we have also ordered the yellow curry there -- SO tasty. They have a spice rating from 1-5, and they do not disappoint (never spicier than you ask, never bland). The staff is always efficient and friendly, and they have never made a mistake with our orders. In the three years we have been ordering from here, the prices have increased at least twice, but we still think that's it's worth it. We hope they're around for a long time! Thai Chili is my comfort Thai food after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Great food that will leave you stuffed, great prices, very friendly staff, & if you live in the neighborhood they deliver!"}
{"text":"I'm mad it took me this long to finally try this place. Once again I was at home craving papaya salad, so I started searching for Thai delivery, and Thai Chili popped up. Since I've had it bookmarked for a while, I decided to order in.  

Delivery was quick, maybe 20 minutes. I ordered 
papaya salad Laos style 
Chicken larb
Fried calamari 
Chicken pad woon Sen

EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS AND AS SPICY AS I ORDERED IT!!!"}
{"text":"Great salads. Love to get takeout from there and the pineapple friend rice is perfect. Great for four people too. Try it out."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  The owner can not make us more welcome with their Thai hospitality.  We love everything there.  Practically ordered the whole menu. Both pork and beef jerky were nice and crispy outside and soft inside.  The larb gai was delicious like how I remembered it in Thailand.  The chicken yellow curry was rich and creamy. We'll be back again soon.  Thank you ka"}
{"text":"Out of all places I've eaten curry, this is the BEST yet! Thai Chili has a clean, welcoming, and simple but warm atmosphere and their service is great. Friendly, patience, quick and caring. 

I had the green curry with chicken, lightly spiced (#3, which gently cleared up my stuffy passage ways. I'm still working up the spice ladder). This was one of a handful of tasty-sounding items on their lunch special menu (I look forward to trying all their items .. in time, of course ^_^*). My meal only cost $7 and came with one spring roll, sauce, and your choice of egg drop soup or hot sour soup. For the amount and the quality of the meal, I feel like I ate for free! 

It's your turn, now go!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had! Love papaya salad and drunken noodle port and pineapple rice. Too bad we finished the food before we take pictures. We will come back with friends."}
{"text":"Last night I was craving Thai food.  So I was found Thai Chili through yelp and it was great!  It happen to be 5 minutes before they closed and they still delivered to us!  I got the #47 Pineapple Curry spicy scale 8.  Went down great and their sticky rice was great.  My girlfriend got the #24 Pad Thai spicy scale 1(she can't stand hot food) and she loved it as I did which I ate the left overs!  Definately will be ordering them again and often!  #1 Fresh rolls were nice, too much mint/basil in it though."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! We adore Thai food and try a new Thai restaurant any chance we get. After reading Yelp reviews we decided to try Thai Chili tonight. There was a good sized crowd, but not a wait at 7pm on a Friday, that was a plus. Our waiter, Ray, took great care of us without being over bearing. I got the vegetarian curry and my fiance' ordered the Shrimp Chu Chi, both were fabulous. I ordered mine at a hot level 3 and it was HOT, his was a 4 a FIRE HOT...luckily we like hot foods. But, I beware of the 1 to 10 hot scale, those low numbers are still very hot! 

Note that if you order brown rice instead of the white jasmine rice there is an additional $2 charge. They are upfront about the fee, but seriously? $2 for RICE? That didn't dampen my spirits but did make me wonder where else they might try to gouge me, but they didn't.

Entrees are reasonably priced at about $10 to $15 each. We were fortunate to get a Yelp $15 for $10 deal. We also joined their 'club' so the next time we get 20% off. 

We will return!"}
{"text":"Authentic and flavorful Thai food!  Everything from their teas, soups, and entrees are all wonderful and can be served spicy with a 1-5 system.  Both the kitchen and seating area is small, so there can be some decent waits when they are busy, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times so far.   Each time the food was very fresh, not oily or greasy, and tasty.   I also like that the spicy hot scale is accurate - regular hot is hot.    

Don't miss the spring rolls which are light and tasty.

It is a husband and wife operation so check the hours - they close for a bit in the mid-afternoon."}
{"text":"Happy to find a Thai place that delivered while I was visiting my brother in Henderson.   I got the Pad see ew, cucumber salad, steamed veggies and a Thai coffee.  The portions were enough for 2-3 meals, depending on your appetite.  Everything was very good; would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no other Thai restaurant  like this one. The 51 sauce (homemade chili) is amazing!! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Requires further investigation. I'm willing to give the place the benefit of the doubt that I walked in at the same time as about 5 other tables and it seems to be a two person operation. The place was slammed so that we didn't get the ice cream of the $7.99 lunch special and my smoothie arrived midway through the meal.

It was good enough, but I expect a 5/10 to be at least somewhat spicy, and this was not at all heated. 

Not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"Ordered red curry and the fried shrimp for delivery. 10/10 would recommend. It got here on time, it was DELICIOUS. Such good curry. Will be taking people here and will be ordering again"}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to eat at Thai Chili, I've been wanting to try it out because of the great ratings. When I entered the restaurant for dinner there was no one else in the dining area. I asked the man behind the counter if I could sit and he said yes but that the wait would be over an hour long. He said that they had to fulfill their carry out orders first. I have never ever heard of a restaurant that functions like that! I immediately left, It was quite unfortunate."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken panang curry.  I stopped to eat here before an event, and after I ordered received notice the event was starting earlier than I expected.  The server packed my order to go.  I was able to shovel in one bite before I had to go in for event, but fortunately the food stayed hot in my insulated bag.  The sauce was creamy, and the medium spice was definitely hot enough.
Unfortunately my son ate my leftovers before I could!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Chili! I have been going here for over 4 years. Pretty much all the same people still work there.  They know me by name when I come in. Very friendly environment and the food is excellent.  
The prices are very reasonable.
The curry dishes are my favorite but everything I have tried was great. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"We order for delivery regularly. Last night we ordered and the person answering the phone could not have been more personable or polite. It was a pleasure making the order. The delivery time was spot on, and as always the food was delish. We especially love the panang curry and pineapple rice."}
{"text":"Pad sei ew is one of the best in the valley! Plus they deliver, so that helps me tremendously. Love you guys!"}
{"text":"What comes to mind when you think Thai food? If you think spicy you're in for disappointment from the Thai food Bland-o-rama. 

Perhaps there is some adjustment factor when ordering through Door Dash. But when you order the 5 on the 1-5 spicy scale, you expect something beyond mild. Not certain why it's such a struggle to comply with a request for spicy. But my Green Curry Beef was Barry-Manilow type mild.

My order also included Kenny-G style Thai Fried Rice. Awful. No one in my family had more than a fork full. It's occupying space in my fridge disproportionate to its $14 price tag. I'm thining it's going to the dogs.. and soon.

To round things out Door Dash also delivered the Air-Supply of chicken satays. bland... note the lower case.

I've had better from here, but that's the exception, definitely not the norm. Expectations managed and locked in. Rear-view mirror. Not going to endure those accusing eyes from my family again due to this place. That preceding sentence was horrible, the food made me do it."}
{"text":"I am giving them back two stars. While I still am very upset about their inconsistent delivery policies. The food is just really good. We've tried replacing our Thai nights with a restaurant closer, but simpy not as good."}
{"text":"Great spot for fellow vegetarians! I had the vegetable rolls app and the vegetable curry and both were very fresh and full of flavor!  I LOVE that they have online ordering for take-out too. (Use promo code NEWGRUBR for $5 your first online order over $10.)"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and love Thai food. However, everything we ordered tasted like fish (there were no fish in the dishes we ordered. It might have been a bad night, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The customer service was very good. The ladies was nice and very glad to have you as a customer, friendly, smiling faces. I will definitely eat there again. The dish I had was good and plenty for the money. I like the soup it was different from other soups I have had at other Thai restaurant, some don't even offer soup with your lunch specials. 3 stars for now, this was my first day."}
{"text":"This is an average mom and pops restaurant, and personally I didn't think all the flavors and prices were the best.

Food: They have a big menu with various noodle dishes, curries, etc. My friends and I ordered the pineapple fried rice, Singapore noodles, red curry & rice, and Thai tea (all the items are approximately $10 and up). The pineapple fried rice was too salty and although there were chunks of pineapple on top, the flavors didn't blended well. The Singapore noodles were too wet and soggy compared to the ones I get from other Thai and Chinese restaurants. The red curry was the best of the three, and they were generous with the veggies including bamboo and chicken. However, my biggest complaint is that they don't serve sticky rice. I am obsessed with eating my curry with sticky rice so it was a bummer. 

Service: It was fine, nothing to rave about. We sat ourselves and the server got our drinks, order, and food quickly; but then again we were the only ones in the restaurant. 

Overall: As a big supporter of authentic food and mom & pop restaurants, I didn't think it held up to its 4 stars rating on Yelp. The flavors were average, the food came out kinda warm, they don't serve sticky rice, and the portions were not worth the price. I'll consider giving them a try next time but as of right now I'll stick with Arawan or Archi's."}
{"text":"Went here because it got voted the best in Cleveland and we wanted to see if that holds true.  It beats out all other places in Cleveland but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had.  Good flavor in everything we had for lunch,  We had the combo's and went with the pad thai,  My wife had the beef and my sister had the chicken, and I had the mixed Seafood.  The Tom-Ka soup was the best I've ever had.  Crispy roll was decent.  Also had Yum-Ka which is the lettuce wrap with pork which was ok.  The presentation of everything could be better but the taste is what will bring me back here.  I'll have to get a bubble tea next time according to the other reviews on here."}
{"text":"I like their food a such delicious. I like the fried rice and veggies and the calamari was crispy and tender. the service was so fast and the server smiling and happy"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I love their Pad See Ew and the smoothies are awesome. My wife enjoys their Pad Thai and my daughter loves their fried rice with pork. The fact that they are five minutes from my house is an added bonus."}
{"text":"i LOVED thai chili. it's a tiny lil gem packed in a little 'strip' mall, if that's what we are calling it.....although the decor could definitely use a little updating,   i was impressed by the food. huge portions full of flavor! i am by no means a thai conniseaur, however, i do know good pad thai when i taste it. i have never dined in, i have always ordered carry out which is always a quick in /out process. 
the only thing i do not like is that their winter hours have them closed on sunday. which in the whole scheme of life, i am quite sure really is not THAT big of a deal, but when mama is craving some good thai food, it certainly can put a dent in the plan if its a sunday night in the middle of winter. 
the other menu item i tried were these little rolls that were deep fried, almost like a mini egg roll, like really mini and came with a delicious reddish colored sauce. definitely some yum in the tum tum. 
go ahead and give thai chili a try. i dont think you will be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST ORANGE CHICKEN IVE EVER HAD! Definitely now one of my go to spots for dinner. I highly recommend them to anyone who has a taste for Asian cuisine. The service excellent as well. Everyone is always so helpful and always makes sure you accommodated."}
{"text":"Tried the Pad Thai here (Which i have had many places, including the Thai Budda Temple, and it is one of the BEST)! Living in Las Vegas Service is usually decent but this place has probably has the BEST! 

I highly recommend the Thai Chili to everyone.

:-)"}
{"text":"Went here an hour before closing, was somewhat skeptical about it since it seemed slow. It's a small place but their food is tasty and delicious. After being there for about 15 minuets several people walked in plus we saw the delivery guy walk in and out several times. I had seafood soup and the spicy fish level 3-5 please be warned it'll make your nose drip if you order anything higher. My boyfriend was feeling a little daring and ordered Mongolian beef 6 and steam was coming out his ears. However food was delicious. I love it that you can order and they have a delivery service too."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is a small restaurant in a Gilbert retail complex. We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The business was empty, but was very clean and comfortable. Several folks came in for take-out orders. I won't even going into letting their kids run wild in the restaurant. That was fun. The menu is standard, with Thai and Chinese selections.

We were initially seated by a bubbly young man, who reminded me of Brian, the waiter at Chotchkie's. Kidding aside, he was nice. We ordered with a young Thai woman, who was also nice, but very much to the point. However, when my food came out, it was incorrect. It was quickly remedied, and she was super apologetic the reminder of the time. No biggie.

J had the chicken pad Thai. He said that it was hot and fresh, but that it was nothing to write home about. Standard fare. I opted for the tofu panang. The only rice option was white. The lunch meal included a spring roll, which was good. The curry was a little hot, even though I ordered mild. That being said, the flavor was good, and the tofu was plentiful. Again though, pretty standard, and not the end all of Thai meals.

Overall, we enjoyed our meal, and would return if in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day with a few friends. I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu, and my friend ordered the Tom Yum noodle soup. Both were filling and we barely finished it all. I tend to order pad Thai at most Thai restaurants, so I can compare them.
This one was excellent, but the only problem was the overload of sauce as I got to the end of my dish. It was so saucy to the point where I couldn't finish it all. Other than that, the place is clean and friendly, with nice hosts and prompt service."}
{"text":"If you want to get take out this is your place but not for dine in. The food was good but we waited over 30 mins for our order while we watched other people come and go. They had to have forgotten about us. We finally asked for our food to go because we had to get going. They just said \"sorry about the wait\" but didn't really care. Plus our waiter kept bringing my husband refills on his soda but not for me. Agh!  Like I said, take out only. Unless you have lots of time to wait."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  The new manager on the other hand is very aggressive.  The atmosphere is very tense since he's been there.  There was even a confrontation with a customer while we were there today."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so bad but the past few times I've arrived the wait is a bit lengthy (and I even order pickup almost a half hour prior). Dumplings are amazing, Pad Thai is ok. I noticed the Yelp Online Ordering prices are different from walk in prices. The gal in front of me got food for her & her son + drinks for about $20 total. My order was just pad thai & dumplings and cost the same... :( Should've looked into the lunch specials in person I guess. The employees are great but the organization seems off around lunch time during the week."}
{"text":"We had friends over so we thai chili delivered - it's literally .4 miles from my house and it took an hour and 15 minutes to be delivered, ha. If I would have known that, I would have just gone and picked it up! When it arrived, it was ok. We had a couple orders of pad thai and red curry. Main meals were good. Our pot stickers were a little soggy and seemed like they had been sitting for a while. Spring rolls were crisp and delicious. All in all, it's okay. Nothing I would rave about."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant I've found so far in AZ. Lunch special is awesome- good variety of options, with a salad and spring roll for only $8. Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup) was the best I've found, panang curry was rich and light at the same time with so much flavor. Food came out in minutes and service was extremely friendly. Will definitely be a regular spot."}
{"text":"pad thai
duck curry
bbq chicken
pad prig khing
sweet sticky rice with thai custard
all were okay. the portions could be a bit bigger and service a lil nicer."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor, nice sleepy atmosphere, I will definitely return for their spicy beef and chicken with garlic lemon sauce"}
{"text":"I spotted this Thai restaurant on the road and decided to stop by to grab dinner. It was during peak hour so the small venue was packed with people waiting to be seated by the door. The dim lit atmosphere was warm and inviting. Quite the contrast when I asked for a table for one. Their male servers seemed more concerned with the bigger parties, but the lone female server was friendly and made me feel welcomed.  

I started off with the Papaya Salad ($10) served with shredded papaya, cabbage, carrots, green beans, scallions, grilled shrimps, tomato, chili, lime, and fish sauce. The dish was crisp, feisty spicy, with hints of peanut flavors here and there. The fish sauce flavor was noticeable, but weighted down given the amount of explosive spiciness. I thought adding a handful of basil could provide that welcoming lift, but I did enjoy the differential textures and the grilled jumbo shrimps immensely. 

Next, I tried the Spicy Mussels ($15). The plate full of mussels were sautéed in a roasted chili sauce, jalapeno, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, bell peppers, and zucchini. The mussels were fresh, spicy, and the sweet zucchini gave it a nice contrast. 

It was a pleasant surprise to find Sticky Rice ($2) to go with the meal. Overall, the prices were very steep for Thai food. Even though the ingredients were freshly prepared, the spicy flavors still lacked the striking complex aroma that made me fell in love with Thai cuisine in the first place. The experience was very Westernized so this might still be a welcoming experience for a large segment of the population. The server was very nice to provide me a frequent user card, but I don't think I will return anytime soon. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Don't let this hole in the wall fool you!!! This is the best Thai food place in Vegas!!! They consistently make delicious authentic tasting Thai food and all their dishes are always prepared the right way. 

Pad Thai-on point,  larb- on point,  catfish-on point,  stir fry-on point!! Okay,  I think you get the \"point\" haha I've had several of their other dishes,  but these are my top favorites!

I will warn you though, if they ask you what level spice you want,  \"1-10\" well..  If you don't eat any spice,  just tell them 0! Haha :p, I have friends who have gotten a little sweaty with a #1. :D check this place out! There's a reason why it's one of the few surviving businesses in the plaza."}
{"text":"I must be missing something. Maybe I'm not a Thai food person? We ordered via GrubHub, delivery was earlier than promised. Food was, just okay? I didn't care much for mine - Pad Thai. Husbands was slightly better - Drunken Noodles. Spring rolls were excellent and huge! I probably wouldn't order again. I didn't care to finish mine at all."}
{"text":"This place was great! I see it becoming my new weekday lunch time visit! I went with a friend and I had beef panang and my friend had their pad thai. Mine was delicious and my friend really enjoyed theirs too. Seemed like the business was there to please - they decorated nicely - white table cloths and all and the service was amazing! I was very impressed with this place. Could be a cute, simple date night place too. Now, to work on that date.... :)"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants period.  But also is definitely my favorite Thai restaurant and I LOVE Thai and have tried many different places.  I crave their Red Curry or Pineapple Curry - TO DIE FOR!  I usually get a level 4 or 5 spice and it's quite heated.  Also the Thai fresh rolls and Pad Thai are great picks.  You've gotta try this if you love Thai, spicy food and unique flavors.  Prices are very reasonable also."}
{"text":"This place is great! We love the ambience, the customer service, and most importantly the food! The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is because I feel it's a bit on the pricey side. But other than that it is authentic Thai food that brings back memories of eating at the wild Ginger in Seattle Washington when I was a kid. When I want to go and get the Panang curry with beef this is the place that makes it the best!! Love it!!"}
{"text":"Little sweet for my taste, but if you like sweet and spicy Thai style this is a place for u :)

I did love their chicken basil, but careful their spicy is spicy . I was crying haha.   

They have very good fried rice too, I had my kids a lil and I was impressed ! 

Love the service , fast , friendly but not over friendly . Efficient and perfect !      

I just like my Thai food lil bit less sweet but that's just my preference . Food is very good here :)"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is located in a dying shopping center, and is frequently the only reason I will enter it. Their lunch deals are the best. $6.95 for every item and it includes salad and a small egg roll. The dinner menu has a huge seleciton and prices include choice of chicken, pork or beef. You can add shrip for $3.00.

Nearly every time I go in I have a coupon. They sometimes have a deal on Living social or I go to another coupon site when I can buy them for 80% off. Thai Chili offers delivery and take out services. Please note that coupons are not allowed for either of these. You have to eat in restaurant to be able to utilize a coupon.

The servers are nice, and I would rate all of their servers as either fair or good. Only once or twice have I thought service was excellent, hence the 4 of 5 stars. There is an Asian female server who speaks with a very understandable accent. She takes care of you, but can be a little abbrasive, so if you get her you were warned.

You have a choice as to how spicey you would like your dish. 1-10, with 5 apparently being a jalapeno. I always order a 1, my boyfriend likes a 3. 

They usually don't take too long to cook your food. Also, don't bother asking to talk to a manager because they won't let you, unless you know the managers name."}
{"text":"Met my match. When asked \"how hot\" and gave me numerical option 1-5, I asked \"how hot can you go?\". \"Fifty\" was the response. You learn from your mistakes. Be a hero and ask for fifty. I cried... In font of my children.... That's how hot that is."}
{"text":"Great authentic food and awesome service. The owners are friendly and willing to share their story. I had the Panang curry and Tom kha Gai. Perfect."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten in here, I've gotten take out twice now since its right next to the gym I go to.  The first time I got Tom Yum soup with chicken, papaya salad and chili mint noodles.  I ordered all three with max spice level and I have to say, its definitely not spicy enough for me.  But, the soup had great flavor and plenty of chicken and veggies.  The chili mint noodles were also very tasty but the noodles were a little overcooked so were a little broken.  The papaya salad, there was really no seasoning so it's a SKIP...
Second trip, I ordered the tofu soup with no meat so they gave me extra tofu.  I also ordered bbq pork fried rice and chicken pad see ew.  This time it was MUCH better.  The tofu soup was SO good, nice flavor and plenty of veggies, tofu and bean thread noodle, not too salty either like the tom yum was.  The pad see ew was perfectly cooked, fresh broccoli and a faint sweetness to it.  The fried rice was not to my liking only cause I know I can make better fried rice...there was hardly any bbq pork or egg and was a tad oily.
 
Overall, I would return, cause its convenient AND the prices can't be beat. Most prices are under $10 and some a bargain like my tofu soup for about $6."}
{"text":"Everything that I have had on the lunch menu was fantastic. The Pad Thai is the best in the valley by far."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I get the Chicken Panang and it is sooooo yummy.  Their spice scale is 1-10.  I order as a 5 for spice.  I could probably go a little higher on that, but it is delicious.  I love the pineapple dressing on the starter salad.  

This little restaurant is CLEAN, friendly, GREAT VALUE, and EXCELLENT food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sucks. There were only two people in restaurant when we walked in and server said that it will 45-50 mins to serve us .."}
{"text":"This had been our favorite Thai restaurant for the past 5 years we've lived here but tonight  we thought we were in the wrong place.

The restaurant has changed how you can order the spiciness of  their dishes.  So now you order no spice at all, medium or hot.  Med. is the old 3 so if you want just a little spice they bring you a bowl of chili flakes!  This didn't work and I don't eat out to fix my own food....this was awkward.

Julua our server didn't like us much....we had horrid service.  When my food arrived I asked for chop sticks and then she took another table's order, got some drinks and we finally went to the counter after asking her again and we got a smart comment from her, and no chop sticks!  This happened again over the bill.  

We ordered the curry veggies with extra water chestnuts and paid an extra $2 for 4 little slices of wc!  The entire dish was about one cup full for a total of $14.  Pour value for the cost and with no meat.  It was delicious, just too small a portion.

Guess we'll look for a new Thai hangout since Thai Chili let us down on food, service and their change in how they spice their food."}
{"text":"Love this place! There Pad Thai is SOO good. I love that they have a lot of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We're from LA, and felt a little brave visiting our sister in Arizona. We were craving Thai food and found this place on yelp. The food delicious and the service was great. Julia was our server and was very polite and quick. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is super tasty. A good find. Their spicy level is a little hotter than I am used to. I went with a 4 and almost burned my lips off. Super delicious pad thai with shrimp and the green curry is awesome. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"So we were trying to decide between a variety of possible lunch spots. A lot of our normal ones had been visited too recently or often, but somebody suggested to go for the non-usual Thai and specifically directed us here.

Not a bad choice.

We sat down at first, then we decided to order to-go in the interest of saving time. I had my eye on the $7.95 lunch special and settled on a beef pad thai. It came with a side salad (fresh), soup with rice and veggies (decent, not salty or bland), ice cream (well... no, it didn't for to-go, wtf?) and two potstickers (good). While I haven't ordered the regular option for comparison purposes, the portion that I got looked like a full meal, not reduced for lunch.

Besides the lack of ice cream, my only real issue was that the fork tines were a little too small to make good work of the noodles, so it was a little difficult to eat. The beef was a little chewy, but not too bad, and there was actually more meat that I anticipated, so I wound up eating a lot of beef and rationing noodles toward the end. Regardless, I'd definitely consider this place again for a quick local Thai fix."}
{"text":"Where do I begin!! I really enjoy Thai cuisine and I'm always looking to try new locations. That being said , I heard about Thai Chili on Green Valley Parkway and decided to check it out. It's located in a strip mall that use to be pretty busy. Don't let the open lot fool you. The chef here has some real talent! All I can say is flavor flavor flavor! I had to come twice to confirm my delight. Authentic with a twist, you have to come try it for yourself to understand.  On a side note, the wait staff is very attentive and very polite. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Tom Yum soup and Orange Chicken. The lady who served us was so friendly and cute. Food came out quick and tasted really good. Especially the Orange Chicken! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just stop here to eat lunch and order the cashew chicken and it was the best day ever try even after being in Thailand 3 times this is the best so far so I'm very happy that I found this place and for sure I will come back here with my wife.
Very clean and quiet place and the owner is very friendly. highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yummy. Everything is always on point. Try the pineapple curry. Free thai iced tea with check in. Super sweet staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by this place for lunch today and will definitely be common customers. We live nearby and we're happily surprised to see they do delivery as well. 

I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, #4 in heat. My wife ordered the Chicken Prig Pao, #2 in heat. We both LOVED our dishes! I tried hers and the flavors were awesome. I still love Pad Thai the best, but would give other options on their menu a try given how well they made both of these."}
{"text":"Wow, when the Cat's away, it's time to grab all the girls and go here: Thai Chili!
The appetizers are all delish: we loved the fresh roll dipped in hoisin ($6 the chicken was tender ... next time we are trying shrimp!) the crisp spring roll $2 each ...was perfectly moist and crunchy in the sweet dipping sauce.  The Larb salad $10...was perfectly savory with fresh greens and ground pork.  My all time fave was our Pra Rahm with chicken $14... 100% FRESH! You MUST try this.  Served in a lightly spicy sauce atop cabbage, broccoli, zucchini, carrots and ladled with peanut sauce.  A winner!  End the meal with sticky rice, thai custard, coconut cream dessert.  Heavenly!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went out to this with the living social deal and we are so glad we found it.  A new favorite.  The Satay was really really good but it was chicken tenderloin, which isn't traditional.  Kind of funny, but the sauces were so so yummy.   I had the drunken noodles,  awesome. My hubby had a yellow curry.  Can't remember the name.  He just loved it.  Can't wait to go back.  Give it a try.  The prices were right too."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand and had Thai food all over the U.S. and this place is absolutely amazing! Everything on the menu..(I've had like 4 different things ) but every single one is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.

We were really craving Thai food, and we are so happy to have found this place. You can tell that they really take pride in their restaurant, as it is very inviting inside (there is even a small water feature inside) and is VERY clean. Everything was super clean. Floors, walls, underneath the soda machine. We were greeted by the most pleasant person as we came in.

We decided to try a Thai Iced Tea, as I had never had one. We also split a Chicken Pad Thai and a Beef Pad See Ew. The food came out quickly. Each time our waiter came to the table, he was so happy and polite. The food was outstanding. Seriously. The portions are generous, and we ended up taking a lot of it home with us...although we kept stuffing our faces because we could not get enough. 

The Pad Thai was some of the best we have ever had. I loved that the minced nuts were on the side of the dish, so we could add as much or little of it as we wanted. My husband was enjoying the side dishes of hot peppers, hot sauce and spicy mustard at the table. He piled them all onto everything, as he is known to do. 

The iced tea was dark orange, and was very flavorful. It had flavors that I had never tried before, and I am glad that I tried it. It was thick and sweet, but not overly sweet at all. It was a bit heavier than I prefer, but I am happy that I tried it after all of these years. They even have Thai coffee, if you wish to try that as well."}
{"text":"The service and food were great.  The price were reasonable and with Restaurant.com gift certificate, you can't go wrong.  When we were there on a Friday night, the place was packed and with people awaiting for table.  We will definately be back"}
{"text":"so-so ambience, food was so-so, not sure what all the excitement is for...I'll be going back to Thai Basil"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I was craving Thai food yesterday and found this place near my destination. I ordered through Yelp (Eat 24) to pick up around 5:35. I arrived early and saw a few people waiting already so I took a seat and waited. When I inquired about my order, it was already ready and the gal said it had been, even though I only ordered it at 4:55. 

My pad thai dish was tasty, packed well and leftovers today fared well. Place was busy and popular for takeout orders especially. Not close to me but they did a good job here."}
{"text":"Ordered the food online using Eat24 and was quoted a time of 45 minutes. It got here at about an hour. Food was still warm but not hot. Food was tasty tho and we would order from them again. Everything came exactly as ordered and nothing was missing. 

We ordered the orange chicken, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, and chili mint pork. I'd say the chili mint pork was the dish we enjoyed the most. The pineapple fried rice had good flavor but was really oily."}
{"text":"Great food. Delivered fast everything perfect Such a better choice than pizza 
Hope to visit their restaurant in person"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but they must have new owners last time I ordered it SUCKED. Too bad all good things come to an end , oh well going to search for a new place , no biggie"}
{"text":"I love Thai Chili!! They are wonderful and the food is spot on spicy! They deliver quickly and pick up is ready fast as well. They are sure to please!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The food is great, we came here trying to have some decent thai food after eating at Sea on the strip (2 star-for food).
Service
They were great they seem to be family run or treat each other like family... They are efficient and super nice.  When they have time they genuinely want to know if you enjoyed the food and they have pride in what they do!
The young man was very attentive, even though they were experiencing very high volume!! 
Food
I love thai food... Plain is good but when it has just the right heat to make you sniffle and not die indoors... Thats good to me!! But if you like traditional sweat!!! Dont be afraid to ask!!!! This place is great, every flavor was spot on, not too much and the amount of food they give is more than im used to!!!
Facility
The bathrooms were clean along with the tables.  We went to seat ourselves and the young man that was helping another table said wait let me clean it first.  We waited and he cleaned it right away.  There are approx 28 seats... 3 booths and 7 tables"}
{"text":"Great food. One of the best place in ohio. Good ambience, great people and quite. Definitely com8ng again here."}
{"text":"I have been loyal.....no more. One more glass of bad wine, over spiced and cooked food. I feel bad for the overworked servers."}
{"text":"I really like the food and the services! Their food is just so awesome!! I will definitely refer this place to my friends and family! And i will also go there again many times!  just awesome!"}
{"text":"GOING DOWNHILL - we have dined off and on at Thai chili for almost a year now. At first it was really good but as of late we've seen it spiraling downwards. Tonight was more proof of that. Food was bland at best with little flavor and poorly prepared. I tried something again that was rather good last time I was there, which was the battered chicken over vegetables. Problem is one of the pieces was barely cooked and the batter was uncooked. We brought all of our concerns to the waiter's attention and he seemed absolutely clueless as to what we were telling him, plus clueless to do anything about it.   And this was before he brought us the check.  As expected, the check was presented without any consideration. I would have at a minimum expected him to say well let me take something off for the inconvenience or let me get the manager. He did none of that. My recommendation to him would be to go look for some other job that matches your skill-set. The only saving grace to all of this disaster was that the overall meal cost was not that high. And we still tipped the waiter $4.00, when he really deserved less than that.   The owner is friendly and a good guy, but he will suffer a broken business if service and low quality like this continues."}
{"text":"Thai style beef salad is the best in vegas,one of the few good places to stop by whenever you want real Thai food ."}
{"text":"My wife and I both lived in Thailand for many years and so we enjoy trying out Thai places in the Valley. We were not disappointed with Thai Chili. Pleasant atmosphere (just about the only Thai restaurant I've been to with tablecloths. This could be a mistake since the usual way to eat Thai food -- passing around and sharing several dishes -- can get messy). We shared larb gai (spicy minced chicken with mint and other things) and green curry. We can recommend both, and there was enough so we could bring some home. We had both dishes at \"spice 10,\" and it was quite hot, the way we like it. If you prefer it milder just get a lower number."}
{"text":"I gave this place another try because I was feeling particularly lazy and they deliver. I'm so happy I did!

I ordered green curry chicken, drunken chicken, shrimp fried rice (no spice) for my son, and chicken fried rice (no spice) for my daughter.

The green curry was really good and the portions large. The drunken chicke was excellent. Not greasy at all, the perfect amount of spice, just yum. I had enough for for 4 or 5 meals, but I had two entrees basically to myself because no one else really ate much of them. 

One problem I had with them in the past was I couldn't ever get them to make a dish entirely not spicy. They've changed that and you can literally choose \"no spice\" instead of a 1. The fried rices were exactly as ordered, which made me really happy.

Overall, while not perfect, this place is my new go to Thai restaurant for quick take out/delivery."}
{"text":"They have changed the menu around a bit, removed a few items and renamed others.
They also stopped the lunch specials. 

We had the Pad See Ew and Pad Key Moo.
Both were real good. 

The service was great, super friendly & patient while we decided what we wanted.

The prices seem higher on this new menu, most dinners are around $10. 
(I see no lunch prices, and they did say they stopped the lunch special)"}
{"text":"I only venture out here for two reasons: to see my best friend and to go to my allergist.  Otherwise, hell no. However I am now motivated by some killer Thai!  I met a friend here for lunch and when I see little tiny places like this, I usually think positively. I was right.  The lunch menu offers meals for $6.95 where you get a salad, eggroll and a large entrée. I opted for the Chicken Panang and my friend got the Red Curry. Both were outstanding.  They ask you what level of heat you want from a scale of 1-5. Friend got a 4, I chickened out and got a 3. My heat level was perfect.  Spicy but not kill ya spicy.

Fast prompt service, authentic meals, and absolutely delicious. this makes schlepping out to Gilbert less painful!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here through Bite Squad and was really impressed with my meal. The food arrived well packaged and hot. The portion was generous. Generous enough to make two meals out of one dinner portion. 

The Pineapple Curry was even better than I expected. I kept taking tastes at first in amazement at how good it was. The coconut flavor was heavenly. I ordered mine with chicken and it was plentiful. The veggies like tomatoes were also plentiful. The sweetness of the pineapple worked well with the other flavors. Even the rice was notably prepared well.

The price was good for the portion size. I can't wait to come back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday. Service needs to improve . We sat and got a salad and waited waited for order to be taken. Finally a female blonde came and took the order. We both said no green bell pepper. when the dish came out.. guess what.. both meals came with peppers and not worth $10 lunch. Blonde girl went to mop the floor and touch everything and not even wash her hands after she touched the mop and wiped the floor. Service really sucks. No smile or friendliness. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I agree with the SERVICE issues, we were enamored with Thai Chili going back several times until we experience service from the tall dark haired waiter.  He acted like he was doing us a favor by being there; speaking in a condescending tone and being a total know it all.  He didn't LISTEN to our questions, didn't let us finish our special order and then GOT OUR ORDER WRONG! Forgot anything extra we asked for.  Usually I wouldn't take the time to complain about such things but this guy is making you lose business. Either he needs an attitude adjustment and better service skills or you will continue to lose customers. SERIOUSLY we will only get take out if he is going to be our server.  Like the below comment, I felt like calling the owner and applying for a job because I could just see their money flying out the door with the customers that were leaving because he didn't acknowledge them when they walked in.  Seriously, the restaurant is the size of a postage stamp, it takes a second to make eye contact with guests walking in and saying \"i will be right with you\" instead of acting SO PUT OUT because he had people walk in."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place the first time I went there. I ended up getting the Gang ka ree and was impressed that I got to choose the spiciness of the dish (since I can be kind of a wuss with spicy food). I have had fresh Thai food made by some Thai friends when I lived in Australia, and this was very comparable. 

We took a seat in the restaurant and were barely able to find an open seat. The place was packed. The restaurant's atmosphere wasn't spectacular, however, it's better than some places that also do delivery/takeout.  It was worth the wait though. 

In the future, I plan on ordering take out & I hope they deliver to my house."}
{"text":"Yum! Visited this place for the first time last week with a friend for an informal date. I had the green curry, spice level 2 with shrimp. My date had the fried rice with chicken, beef and shrimp. Both were tasty. We also ordered the fresh spring rolls, not my favorite, but my date seemed to enjoy.

Cute, hole in the wall sort of restaurant with straight to the point food. The server was also very informative and willing to answer questions on the menu. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I love thai food and the bar is set really high for me, as I've had great thai in the past in California. That said, I stopped in for lunch take-out and was thrilled with the quality and taste of the food. I had the thai basil fried rice (request light oil, and they definitely listened) lunch combo. I didn't want the crispy roll or tom yam mushroom soup that came with the meal, but he let me sub those for the vegetable soup (mushroom, carrot, green beans and tofu). Everything was VERY TASTY and I'll definitely go back again. I got the spice level medium for my dish, and that was a little too hot for me. I can be a bit of a light-weight spicy wise though. Next time I'm definitely going mild :)  The portion is what I would call HUGE -- and the price was perfect for lunch: $8.50. I highly recommend you try Thai Chili!"}
{"text":"I think I may have gone on a bad service day, but the food was ok. We ordered phad Thai, snow peas w broccoli and spring rolls. The spring rolls were probably the worst I've ever had. The skin was so soft and sticky, it was packed so full of noodles, that it just fell apart at the first bite. I wouldn't recommend these at all. The phad Thai was ok, but a little overly sweet, which seems to be the norm around AZ. So maybe people like it like that? Maybe they've never had it the right way? We also had snow peas w broccoli, in a garlic sauce. The sauce was completely flavorless. AgAin, besides the spring rolls, everything was ok...just wouldn't go out of the wAy to come here again."}
{"text":"Good food at good prices.

My wife went in and had Pad Thai and Crispy Chicken with Spicy Plum Sauce and each were about $10 for a decent portion. They were both good, but not great. The service was okay, but not great. The atmosphere in the room was a little cold. Someone needs to make the place a little more comfortable.

All in all, everything was good, but I've had better food for a better price. You will enjoy your meal, but I don't think you'll be overly impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent red curry. Flavorful and full of chicken and veges. Spiced just right from the kitchen with extra spices on the table if needed. Drunken noodles a little dry but very flavorful as well. Large portions, very filling. Service was fast and friendly. Great find here in Vegas"}
{"text":"This food was very very good. It's a small family run operation so definitely have to check the hours online or by calling them. We asked for medium and it was very spicy but still very enjoyable. I ate this with people who have ate Thai food many times and they really enjoyed this one too. It was very authentic. I would highly recommend this Thai restaurant in Avon Lake."}
{"text":"You know those nights you can't be bothered to cook? 

Or put on makeup? Or blow out your hair? Or put on a bra? Or take off those Yoga pants that are comfortably plastered to your behind? 

This was me on a Saturday night after competing in a Track and Field meet in Coolidge earlier that day. And it seemed Andrew C. was on the same page after an extended day at work.

\"Why not Thai food?\" I remember Monica O. and Cheryl B. had raved about Thai Chili, so I pulled up the menu. 

Turns out they do take-out! YES, LOW MAINTENANCE EVENING!

We called and ordered the Mussamun Curry with chicken at Thai Hot level 8, and the Drunken Noodles with chicken at Thai Hot level 6.

Made the trek out to Gilbert. Friendly cashier, and she gladly accepted the 5% off your order with a Yelp check-in. Seems like they do a lot of carry out here, but there was a nice dining area. 

This stuff smelled heavenly. Was practically drooling on the drive home. 

Got home, popped open a bottle of wine and our to-go containers.

Holy smokes, this stuff was HOT. Like, open the containers and your eyes start running hot. 

The Mussaman Curry was my favorite of the two. Beautiful, rich, creamy orange color. Savory coconut milk, tender chicken, carrots and potatoes. The only weird thing was the potatoes seemed to have this funky taste, like they were freeze dried.

While the Drunken Noodles were delish and a good balance of chicken and vegetables, the dish didn't seem to be very saucy. Dry, almost. 

Also, ironically, the Drunken Noodles which we ordered at a lower heat level than the Mussaman Curry were unbearably hot (at least for me)! Maybe they mixed them up? 

Either way, it was reasonably priced and a great discovery. I anticipate we'll be back again and again . . . Lazy night in or nice night out!"}
{"text":"This is hands down mine and my husband's favorite place to get Thai food! The quality and flavor of their food far surpasses any other place we've tried in the metro Phoenix area. Strongly recommend the beef panang! Their pad thai is pretty great as well. The management is also A+. Super friendly, willing to help, and always remember us when we come in. Service is pretty quick as well, so we're usually in and out fairly quickly even when they're slammed. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Had some drunken noodles for take out and even at a 3 spice level it had a good kick! Good stuff."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. Portions are big. The owners care for their customers like family. I always order the shrimp fried rice and it's perfect every time!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili is great. I was bummed to see they raised their prices yet again. But the food is delish!"}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've ever eaten at, the chicken panang curry and the beef jerky is amazing also there pad Thai is awesome. Great whole in the wall spot, me and my girlfriend try an eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The food at Thai Chili is delicious!!! We had Yellow Curry, Pineapple Fried Rice and Pad Se-Ew.  All very full of flavor! We'll definitely be back! Great service too!"}
{"text":"I had only tried Thai food one other time and hated it, so avoided the cuisine for several years until recently. After reading the Yelp reviews, I decided I better give Thai food another chance. Boy am I glad I did!!!  I love this place!!  Nice atmosphere, great service, delicious food, fair prices. We had the drunken noodles with chicken (spice level 5) the #28 with chicken (noodles, carrots, bell peppers, baby corn, zucchini) (spice level 5), and the teriyaki chicken (spice level 4). For dessert we had homemade green tea ice cream, homemade coconut ice cream and sticky rice with custard. All were incredible!!!  I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. I had Tom Yam soup. Really nice flavor with a hint of hot. My entree was Prik Khing with rice and it is/was delicious.

Don't go if you are in a big hurry. There is one Wok, one chef, and each meal is individually prepared. This all takes time. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic Thai Restaurant! I always eat here and I don't have to wait that long to pick up my order like only 5 mins and the food was ready!. They also gave me free Thai tea  and server was awesome his really nice and they have \"A\" for the grade! Love this place! I would recommend this place and for that I will rate this restaurant a 5 Star! Thank you also for the free thai tea!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place because they had options for delivery! It's also great cause I can order on Yelp and pick up especially when busy with school. I'm mostly drawn to pineapple fried rice which is the only thing I've ordered. Really good all the time. Thai tea is good as well as pad Thai! Everything I've ordered has been good for me"}
{"text":"The food here is fabulous!  I've ordered on GrubHub 2x and then decided to check out their location.  Small hole in wall, but treated so well!  Try it, you'll like it!  Personally, i love the yellow curry."}
{"text":"Love the phai thai noodles. I found the flavor to be pretty good.  The noodles seemed just right and not too mushy. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how much good Thai food is to be found in Arizona, but this place definitely hit the spot.

Appetizers were good, but the Massaman Curry (my benchmark of Thai cuisine) was fantastic! Potatoes and veggies done just right, rice cooked perfectly, and the curry itself creamy and luscious, bursting with flavor. The fact that you can designate on a scale of 1 to 10 how hot you want your dish to be was a nice touch, and addressed my grandmother's reservations (this was her first time trying Thai cuisine).

They were really busy, so I think it's perfectly acceptable that the service was just a tad slow, but the waiter was extremely pleasant and helpful. The decor was ok, but I'd love to see the walls as vibrant as the flavors... don't be shy guys, your food is great- go for it! Make it real!

Bonus points for carrying my fave Thai beer, Chang!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place, hands down. The green curry is one of my favorites and the beef panang is delicious. I can't get enough of this place! The service here is what makes it special. The waiters are knowledgeable and kind. Even picky eaters can eat here with a little bit of help! I keep going back here year after year! Definitely the best Thai food experience I've ever had!"}
{"text":"They close during lunch for some odd reason. Great business plan if you ask me. I'm always looking for a new Thai place but in order for me to do so you sort of need to be open during the day. Lost a potential loyal customer before you even had the chance to feed me that's a shame."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with low prices for lunch or dinner!  The menu has 47ish food items plus they have smoothies with boba and Thai tea.  I ordered the Tom yum goong, chicken pad see ew, and beef pad prik king.  4 levels of spice: mild, medium, spicy, and very spicy.

I got spicy soup for me and for Eric R. and I, mild dishes.  The soup was not \"filtered\" so I got stuck with big hunks of ginger, cilantro, garlic, lemongrass, etc that I normally strain when making Thai soup.  The mushrooms were plentiful and so was the shrimp - broth tasted good.  The pad see euw and pad prik king were good, and I got an EXTRA side of white rice without asking.  The Thai tea was a big size and very delicious.
Next time, I am thinking one of the salads and one of the curries.  The staff recommended the beef and meatball noodle soup too.
Mmm!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Cleveland.  I have not had one bad dish from this place.  The only downside is that there are extremely long wait times for carry out orders and sometimes they don't even answer the phone when you call."}
{"text":"What a gem find! Really friendly service off the bat! Teh food was great...I mean REALLY great. What I liked most was that all of the dishes can be made without sugar (I'm diabetic) and also with a heat scale of 1-10...for EVERYTHING on the menu. 

We had a Thai Fresh Roll to start with that was really good...and fresh as stated. 

I had Thai Sizzling Beef that was a HUGE portion and tasted fantastic. I really loved it. 

Thsi wil be added to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"I had an incomplete to-go order. I'm not going to eat curry without noodles. I call and get a \"let's see what we can do\" response. Not sure what that was about. No, I'll come get it. When I get there, the manager says \"get his noodles\" from the back and never comes out to say ... \"we're sorry\" maybe."}
{"text":"Went in this time and was beyond pleased with my experience! This time the owner was there and took my order. When I couldn't decide which soup to have with my lunch special, she brought them both out! I LOVE this place! Love the management, love the food, love the prices! The only thing (and sooo not important) is I wish they had booths! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I am not able to cook myself.  Always fresh and hot! Number 2 is enough... their spiciness level goes up to 5, but I am sure my stomach could not take it.  I always get the green chicken curry, just enough chicken and veggies.  I started going from the time they first opened and I found out the cook is Thai and her recipes are truly authentic.  Definitely recommend this place if you want Thai food.  Also, they don't use MSG!"}
{"text":"We turned to yelp for lunch while trying to decide upon a place for lunch during our stay in Henderson. We're glad we came here! The food was great but the service was AMAZING! Our waiter was the sweetest man ever, and answered all of our questions and made sure our drinks were filled and that we were enjoying our food =) My husband & cousins were all very pleased with this place and it was about a 10 min drive from where we stayed. Would definitely come back here if we happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Placed an order to go. Got the silver noodle rainbow salad and some Thai fresh rolls (Spring rolls). The rolls come with the option of peanut sauce or hoisin sauce to dip them with. I chose the peanut sauce. The rolls themselves were big and filled with a lot of vegetables and noodles but very little chicken. Unfortunately they tasted bland and I needed to dip them in the sauce to get any flavor. The sauce was served hot though, which eliminated the refreshing component of spring rolls that I typically enjoy about them.

The silver noodle salad was a gigantic portion, with nicely cooked shrimp, vegetables, and a hearty portion of noodles. It was served with a whole wedge of cabbage, kind of strange if you ask me. People don't normally gnaw on whole wedges of cabbage as a side to go with their meal. The noodle salad had a good spicy kick to it from chiles and definitely had a lot of flavor.

Service was friendly and I had no problem redeeming a Yelp check in offer. 

Although I wasn't too impressed with what I ordered, I'll definitely give them another try to see if I like other dishes!"}
{"text":"Best green curry in Gilbert!!!!!!! By far my favorite thai food place.. Great customer service! Never a long wait."}
{"text":"Every dish we had was wonderful. It's a little pricy (10-12 bucks per plate average) we spent 85 bucks for 2 with a couple imported beers. We had plenty leftovers too and 4 hrs later just as good'"}
{"text":"I've been here before over a year ago and I remembered it being good so I ordered take-out today. 

The lady on the phone was super nice! The food took about 15 minutes and when I arrived, it was already ready. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai lunch special and the portions are huge! You get a whole to-go plate of your entree plus a side salad and an small little veggie egg-roll with plum / apricot sauce (correct me if I'm wrong). I ordered a spice level of 2 as \"medium\" and it indeed is about a medium, pretty low on the spice scale but if you wanted just a little kick, 2 is great. I felt the need to add sriracha from home to make it tastier. 4.7/5 for the food because the Pad Thai sauce would be even better with some lime or something but that's easily fixable and I would recommend asking for a lime. This place is great. :)"}
{"text":"Did not even get to place an order for delivery which they so proudly boast about. Due to them not having a driver up til later in the evening. How do you offer delivery but not have enough drivers???"}
{"text":"Gave Thai Chili a try after seeing a Yelp survey rating it in the top 5 and we are glad we did. Food was delicious and the service was really friendly. Had the Duck Curry, and it was very flavorful. Don't forget to order a Thai Tea."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Thai chili. I love the green curry with tofu, while my wife loves the Massaman curry. Tonight I tried something different, the sizzling Thai beef, and it was delicious. My kids love the crispy chicken with plum sauce. Good portions, reasonable prices. Everything is as expected."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Chicken fried rice is the best as well as their eggplant dish, I personally like the eggplant with no veggies and it tastes even better."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Henderson. My roommate and I always get Thai food from Thai chili. We no longer live in Henderson but we always go back to Thai Chili whenever we visit Vegas. They are very welcoming, nice, and providing a great customer service all the times! Their pineapple fried rice with BROWN RICE is a must try item! So delicious.!!"}
{"text":"We just ate here and the food is excellent.  I had the beef panang curry and asked for it to be extra spicy and they delivered!  It was yummy. The chicken satay was delicious. My husband had the orange chicken and said that it's the best he's ever had."}
{"text":"This has seriously got to be the best place around for Thai food! 

We have seriously ventured to so many Thai restaurants to only be let down or disappointed, slightly or unforgettably. This one is so far, to date, THE BEST. I can say we stick to curries and such but their papaya salad is a force to be reckoned with. Their massaman curry is so flavorful, so rich, so full of flavor, meats and everything a curry should be, their yellow curry (which was a mistake they made us and let us keep, was superb. Their Tom tum soup is great and I really appreciate that you can request having specific veggies/ingredients omitted and they actually comprehend and do not those specific requested ingredients...excellent food! Not been disappointed yet...don't think we ever will be :)"}
{"text":"You know what? I love this place. I love this place because I've been getting delivery from them for about a year now almost every week. Their good has it all- a good amount of variety, a great amount of taste, speedy service and reliable consistency with getting my orders right. They've got all of your Thai favourites, but they also break the mould by offering some specialities that you probably won't find elsewhere. Today I tried their catfish for the first time and it is AMAZING! A new favorite of mine.

Everything that I've gotten from them has been great. Even the salads. I mean, who orders salad for delivery from a Thai restaurant!?! This guy does. And he's very happy with the salad that he received."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the Fresh Spring Rolls, Chicken Pad Thai and Duck Curry. The Fresh Spring Rolls took a little longer than I would have liked, but the portions were generous, and the accompanying peanut sauce was delicious!!! Our main dishes were spicy, and also very tasty.

I took off a couple stars because the hostess was inattentive, and didn't acknowledge us when we arrived. We stood around aimlessly, until she finally pointed at a table and told us to sit down. One of the chairs was covered in water, so they clearly hadn't cleaned it after the last customer. Our server was polite, but I was disappointed that they didn't have limes, which are a staple in Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Their food is sooooo good! The customer service was even better. I would recommend people to come in and try their food. I live on the opposite side of town and would not mind taking the time to drive back"}
{"text":"The modest restaurant was Plan B after a nearby BBQ restaurant informed us they were old of babyback ribs.  This looks to be family run and operated serving the local community with several orders for takeout filled while we dined in.  My wife and I shared orders of pad Thai and chili mint with ground chicken that were decent though you, we and they could do better."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the area.
The Singapore noodles are really good. Beef or Chicken Satay....amazing. Tom Ka soup, also very good. Not fancy, just a small diner. Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"The food here is really fresh and delicious! They definitely put more thought and care into their food than other small places. The service is also prompt and the employees are very nice. Whenever I come to pick up my order they show me to a table and get a water for me, which I think is very nice. They really go the extra mile! 

My only complaint is regarding the lack of a side of rice for their dishes. Every other Thai restaurant that I've ever been to gives a side of rice except this one and I feel that it is a necessary side. Just make sure you specifically order rice if you want it! 

Overall this is a great little place with amazing food and very hospitable service!"}
{"text":"I love eating here. The servers are very considerate and customize all the dishes according to your taste! When i went with my friends, the server worked and tailored food for a company of six picky eaters! The food is simply delicious and in generous portions. Don't be decieved by the small sitting area, just walk in and have an amazing time. My only problem is that i get so full with the entree, there is no place for desserts!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best Thai food and excellent service. Been coming here for a few years now and I can't say I've ever been disappointed."}
{"text":"Family of 13 came to try this authentic Thai food restaurant. 

The employees were running around and helping serve tables along with the back to back TO GO orders. We had the best server that worked well under pressure and kept smiling despite the hectic day and all the demand with orders, I finally asked \"What is your name\" and he smiled so bright and said Sunshine. My family and I loved that as we all have unique names as well, Sunshine lives to his name with his speedy service and smile even when under pressure. 

The food was good, my sister ordered the pineapple curry... Yummm... 

If you go in meet sunshine. I would hire him in a heartbeat but he mentioned it is a family compmay and really enjoys working there. 

We will be back.

Ps.) A little hidden, its behind the chevron gas station."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous along with the service. Please please open up a store in Maricopa,AZ. We need some Thai food in the city. :) I'll be a regular."}
{"text":"The summer rolls were bland good and came with hoisin sauce. The red curry was way to full of bamboo shoots. The food was really bland for Thai and not spicy though I ordered it at a 6. Overall, eh."}
{"text":"Ordered tom yum shrimp, eggs rolls and pot stickers, delicious. 
I eat here often and have always liked the delivery service and food is always good."}
{"text":"The mushroom soup is great.  The other dishes are also very good.  They are less hot than many places, but still have all the great Thai flavors."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and got the chicken satay and bbq pork fried rice. The delivery was on time and the price was fair. The fried rice was good, can't say the same for the chicken. It was like chewing on plastic."}
{"text":"Food was made fresh and fast. I tried the pad thai and the The beef panang curry two of my favorite dishes. They do like to use their spice level though so be warned if you can't handle heat. I am glad I ordered a 3 out of 5 in the heat level which the server recommended to me I like heat, but not to overwhelm all of the other balanced flavors of a good Thai dish.  At some Thai places I order a medium heat and you get no heat at all where as with this place it is more of a building heat which I enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love Thai Chili. Everything I have had here is delicious and spiced to perfection. The pad Thai, duck curry, and Thai tea are awesome. Service is always really good too."}
{"text":"Incredible! We came for lunch and we're happy to leave with a new \"go to\" spot for thai food. 

The food is amazing. Careful with the spice levels though...we asked for level three and it was perfect. The guy later told us he made it a 2;) I can't imagine what a 3 would be!

Lunch special was very affordable. $8 for a meal which also included a salad and egg roll. Very prompt and courteous service. Ambiance is just right. 

Will DEFINITELY be back. Thanks thai chili!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! And the staff is Amazing! Tried the Crab Pad Thai and coconut soup and literally ate it all! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hubby got cashew chicken and wanted to take a bath in the sauce it was so good. The potstickers are to die for and so are the eggrolls. YUM!"}
{"text":"Thai Chili certainly has to be one of the best Thai restaurants in the east Valley. The curry is rich and flavorful and they also have a wide variety of vegetarian dishes. The place does an abundant amount of take-out service as well. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. The driver had trouble finding my apt. but when the food got here it was still piping hot. The yellow curry was perfect. The Tom Kha soup has great flavor and the vegetables are perfectly cooked. Will be ordering again and the driver assured me next time they'll find my apartment on the first try."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome and the staff is friendly and welcoming. I love the fresh spring rolls and especially the Thai Iced Tea. So yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have ordered delivery from here multiple times. The order is always correct, it's always delivered in the estimated time period, and the delivery person is always nice and friendly! I have tried multiple dishes from here, but my favorite would have to be the pineapple fried rice. That's a must try. Very flavorful! The other great thing about delivery here is how they package everything with care. How many times have you ordered delivery to receive leaky packages? A lot! This place is so smart about their packaging. Anything that might leak is wrapped in a clear  plastic bag very neatly. I never have a mess after opening up my order from here!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever received!

First off, I would like to say that my family and I have loved Thai Chili ever since they first opened. Their food has always been excellent and their customer service has always been fantastic. Whenever we have had the opportunity, we have recommended them to tons of friends in the area and we have always chosen Thai Chili as the place we celebrate birthdays or other important occasions. With that said, my most recent experience with Thai Chili was nothing short of a nightmare. My daughter had just had a baby a few days back and I decided to pick up dinner for her and her husband. I placed an $85 order over the phone for pickup. The terrible customer service started immediately with this phone call. The woman taking my order kept interrupting me mid order and yelling at someone else in the background. She would then come back on the line and rudely say \"can you repeat what you said\" This happened 3 different times. She said I could come pick my order up in 20 minutes. I sent my son to pick up the order and he ended up having to wait an additional 30 minutes once he got there. After receiving our food my son realized that the two Thai iced coffees we had ordered had been accidentally made as Thai iced teas. He went back in to the restaurant to get the correct drinks and the woman behind the counter ( the same woman I placed the order with) acted extremely annoyed and was hesitant to even give him the right drinks. My son said she was very rude and made him feel as if he were lying about what drinks we had originally ordered.  Once he brought our food home, I realized that two of the five dishes we had ordered were missing. I called the restaurant and the same woman answered. When I told her that a part of our order was missing she sighed with annoyance and proceeded to tell me that it was impossible and that my son or I must have misplaced the food! I was in complete shock. I told her I had no idea why she would say something like that and we did not misplace anything. She then continued to argue with me that she packed the order herself and my son must have lost our food. I told her once again that what she was accusing us of was impossible and that I would like to pick up the rest of my order. The woman then said, \" You know what?! I will make the food and deliver it to your house myself just to make sure you don't call and complain again\" I was in complete shock at how rude and unprofessional she was at handling something that was their own mistake. I took what food we had initially gotten to my daughters house and my son waited at home for the rest of the order to be delivered. 30 minutes later I received a phone call from my son saying that THE SAME WOMAN was at our front door refusing to give him the order because \"he would lose it again\" and insisted on talking to me. He gave her the phone and she said \"where are you?? Why aren't you at your house??\" I told her it was none her business where I was and to give my son the rest of the order. I told her how rude and unprofessional she had made our entire experience and I was so disappointed that I would not be returning to Thai Chili again. She responded with \"that's too bad\" I asked for her name and she said her name was Sharon and she was the manager. It is so unfortunate that such a great local establishment is being ran into the ground by such a terrible person. It has been so great having this restaurant in our area and I am so sad that this woman has ruined that. All the workers at Thai Chili have been so so so great with customer service in the past and this experience was totally the opposite. After talking with friends that live in the area, I found out that they too have had terrible run ins with this woman and are also no longer going to Thai Chili. I am so disappointed and I hope that the right people see this review and realize what kind of person is running their business."}
{"text":"Thai Chili was a bit of a disappointment for us... It seems like we might have had an isolated incident given the positive reviews others have given it.  The drunken noodles seemed tasteless, and the spiciness was all over the place, (mine was supposed to be the spiciest, but wasn't spicy at all).  The BBQ Chicken was great, just hard to eat. 

The service lacked a little bit, one waiter for all the tables doesn't seem sufficient... but at least there was a cute hostess ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Clean, fast and at a great price. Both me and my friend were very pleased. I had the Pra Rham and my friend had one of the many curry dishes. The veggies were fresh and plentiful with my dish.  I only got mine mild spicy because in the past other places were too hot to handle. But I think next time I will have step it up to medium. The mild had almost no spiciness but I think for some people is a good thing."}
{"text":"I found this location approximately a year ago when I was looking for something new and interesting to eat, and I have visited at least once a month ever since. The food has been consistently good; however, I feel the portions have gotten slightly smaller, which is the only reason for my 4 star review.

My favorite dishes to order here are Shrimp Pad Thai and Thai Style BBQ Pork Fried Rice. Those are definitely my go-to because they have the right ratio of meat to carbs. The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever had- it's actually crispy with just the perfect amount of citrus. I have also tried the Pineapple Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef, and Beef Broccoli and have not been disappointed. 

I like the fact that for all the dishes, they ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your meal. While a 5 one day can be different from a 5 another day, I've never had an issue where the food has been too spicy to eat. 

I have bought mostly to go, but have dined in a couple of times. The staff are very attentive and friendly and the restaurant, while very tiny, has been tastefully decorated and is very clean and pleasant to dine in."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been to a few Thai places this is number two favorite behind a tiny joint in Silverton, Oregon. The curry, not runny, just a little thick like it should be! 4 of us for 4 different dishes and ranted and raved about all 4! Thumbs down to the wonton soup, but two thumbs up to everything else, including the prices. Good portions, you can request the level of heat of your spicy foods. What more could you want? We did have to wait longer than I would've liked for our food, but it was custom made to the heat and SO worth the wait. Five stars. Definitely try it. We are so glad we did. In fact my husband and I decided this is our new date spot every week until further notice. We want to try everything on the menu.

Don't forget to try the coconut ice cream made in house!"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy fish and yellow curry. We had a 5 and it was plenty spicy. Small place run by a family. Server i think was the owner's son, polite. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall place but the food was great! The service was excellent as well! I am in Vegas often so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Im asian and im really picky with foods, once im coming out to eat I really expect the food to be great worth the money im going to spend and well present... So far this place just blew my mind and im super impress for the quality and the taste of the food. Bamee Giew and pla rad prick are just simply perfect for my taste and well present. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Stop by if u wanna try out real thai food"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. The food is great, the lunch specials are a steal, and they really treat you right. Each time I've been I've been so impressed with the staff. Even had the chef come to our table once because the person I was with made up her own custom dish and the chef wanted to see how it turned out- it was perfect. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience. The staff was friendly. Even though my two friends shared a lunch entree, they each received an individual salad, egg roll, and ice cream that comes with the lunch entree. The food was delicious. I had the pad kemao."}
{"text":"Good Thai food! I've tried a couple places around the area, and this is my favorite! We got shrimp pad Thai which was delicious. We also got vegetable fried rice & they even compensated the lack of meat with extra veggies  We also got tofu red curry & Pad see ew which was good! Overall, great flavors! I'll be going back"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot, we ordered the coconut soup and noodles. We didn't know it included a side of white rice which was nice. Our servers were two nice gentlemen and were really attentive. I didn't notice any lunch specials on the menu so I would definitely call ahead if that's something you are looking for."}
{"text":"During our monthly mani-pedis at Nail EnV (the best, by the way), my aunt and I were discussing where we should go for dinner.  As we frequent this nail shop quite often, the manicurists tend to chime in on our conversations, something we don't mind because we've gotten to know them quite well over time.  We were discussing Thai food and searching Yelp for a place that seemed worth trying when one of the guys says, \"Why don't you go where Karen's husband works?\"  Apparently, Karen, one of our manicurists' husband works as a cook at Thai Chili.  Sounds good to us, so we finished up with lovely nails and headed out.
All the reviews said beware of the spice factor, so we were careful when we ordered our soup.  Turns out, we needn't be cautious.  I like spicy and a 5 was spicy, but still tolerable.  I probably could have gone higher, but I wanted to make sure I'd still taste my food.  
Not being all that familiar with Thai food, outside of Pad Thai, I wasn't sure what to order.  Lucky for me, my aunt knows her way around the menu.  She got something in a green curry that had coconut milk and I don't know what else, but it was really good.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I tasted hers, but I was in.  I ordered something that I can't remember the name of, but it was pork in peanut sauce with vegetables.  It was wonderful and I can't wait to try this place again!  
I wish we had room to try some of the desserts, but we were well on our way to stuffed when we left.  I can't wait to take my boyfriend in for a taste of this place!"}
{"text":"I have Thai Chili saved in my phone. I usually place pick up orders but I've dined in also. Always great service. I love the pad won sen."}
{"text":"The food is great but we all end up getting sick a few hours later. The first time we thought it was a fluke. Coincidence. But this second time, having the same ill effects a few hours later, I'm afraid of what this means. It's a shame because their curry is really delicious."}
{"text":"What a great find! Everything I get here is great! It's spicier than other Thai places...so get the spicy level a few notches down. I can handle spicy...but a 5 was insane. Get a 3 to be safe. There is a waitress here that is wonderful and I wish I had her name. Helpful and very funny! This is in a strip mall and looks like nothing from the outside...but please check it out! They play great 80's music and do serve wine and beer. It's worth checkin out!"}
{"text":"Numnumnum! Went here for lunch and for $7.95 you get a side salad, eggroll, and main dish. I had the chicken panang and it was fantastic. My husband had drunken noodles with chicken and it was only good, but it tasted a little too much like stir fry oil."}
{"text":"Awesome Place! Went last night for the first time with some friends who are regulars. We will definitely go back again very soon. Had the Drunken Noodles with Medium Spice (HEAT). Great food & generous portions along with a really great price. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location over 20+ times in the year. It's one of the only locations with genuinely good Thai soups. 

However my last order went horrendously wrong. 
In my first bite of my food, I felt a hair in my mouth. Praying it was mine, I spat my mouthful out and went in search of this  Rogue invader. And there is was... short curly, and NOT mine! 

I was mortified! Instantly wondering what happened, how that arrived in my food, and what diseases transmit themselves via hair. 

Three words, UNACCEPTABLE AND GROSS! 

I threw everything I ordered into the trash, and bought a salad from Walmart."}
{"text":"The food here was very good and family style portions. We had pad-se-ew, calamari, & papaya salad. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to get authentic and good tasting Thai food local to the Lorain county area. The owner and his wife are also vary nice people. I only hope their good cooking turns more people on to this delicious food."}
{"text":"I have dined in as well as ordered delivery many times. The employees are always SO nice and the food is probably the best Thai food I've found in the Las Vegas/Henderson area. The red curry, pad see ew, Thai iced tea, sticky rice, and orange chicken are delicious! I love that they have the chili trio when dining in. That is a huge deal to me, which most \"Thai\" restaurants in Henderson don't usually have on the table. Keep up the good work Thai Chili!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times they usually know what I order. The staff is friendly and super nice. The pad Thai became the catalyst for me to start trying everything. Their pad se-ew delivered my expectations. To all Thai lovers out there, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots. The food is always amazing. The service is a little slow at times, but I don't even care. The Panang and Massuman are killer."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The owner is super personable and friendly. Food was authentic with great flavors. The owner took time to talk to us after we finished eating. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Nice little mom and pops hole in the wall Thai joint. Everything I've ever ordered are delish: pad Thai, panang curry, pineapple fried rice, Tom kha soup & cant forget the Thai tea"}
{"text":"Gilbert doesn't have a lot of Thai to choose from but Thai Chili will satisfy your Thai craving. I'm a big fan of the yellow curry there. At lunch, they get pretty busy but they are very quick! They give you the usual strange salad as a part of your lunch special. My favorite is still Thai Elephant or Mint Thai Cafe on Gilbert road. But the are quick and classic Thai."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big Thai food fans. This was our first time here. The green curry with chicken was in the top running for any we have tasted! I literally drank the last of the sauce from the bowl!! The drunken noodles were very good and filled with fresh veggies. We will definitely be back. We also liked that they were open in the 3:00-5:00 window when most Thai restaurants seem to be closed during these hours."}
{"text":"For the relatively small size of the restaurant, Thai Chili really goes above and beyond what you'd expect in terms of decor, cleanliness, customer service, and obviously food.

After coming here probably a dozen times for both carry out and dine in, I can confidently say that they deliver consistent quality, and make you leave wanting more. It's always been busy on my visits, no matter the day, but the employees still take the time to make sure you understand the food, let you customize your meal if you wish, and even thank you for your business.

Despite their volume of customers, I've even been called by my name when I've visited; really showcasing their dedication to their customers.

I love that they offer online ordering and that the system even offers the ability to add and remove ingredients from any dish; woohoo! For most dishes you specify the spiciness from 1 to 5, and you usually choose whether you want chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp, etc. The possibilities for vegetables and proteins really make the dish your own, and combined with some of their scratch made sauces, this Thai food stands out among the dozens of Thai options in the Valley.

If you're a fan of Thai noodles, I'd really recommend their signature Pad Thai. Not only is the portion enough to make two meals, but the piping hot dish is packed with the perfect amount of spice, letting the bite from the onions and the crunch and nuttiness from the cashews shine through. The meat has always been tender and juicy. Their homemade Thai sauce is killer, and when you get to the bottom of your plate, it's not soaking in grease like some other Thai restaurants.

Don't stop there, all of their stir-fried entrees are worthy and their curries (try the massaman) are amazingly rich, creamy, spicy hot, and comforting.

If you're in the area, go here, no question. Even if you're not in the area and are looking for Thai food, make the journey here. It's conveniently located and offers a huge selection at really reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for Thai food in the valley. The staff is courteous and prompt with orders, drink refills, and have a witty sense of humor! My favorite entrees to order are yellow curry and Pra Ram! The peanut sauce is to die for. Lastly, the sticky rice with mango dessert is a must try! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The service here absolutely sucks!! My friend and I came here because of the high ratings for her birthday but it was quickly a negative experience. We sat for at least 10 mins before anyone acknowledged that we were here. We asked for someone to at least get drinks and were told I'll get your server. The female (she didn't smile and give a server greeting, that would've included a name) and asked us- need some drinks, are you thirsty?? WTH! We asked if she was our server. She said \"me or her\" and pointed to another female and said either one! We got here at 6:46 and it's now 7:15! Five tables since have walked in and ordered immediately or within 5 min. We just ordered. Would not recommend or visit this establishment again! 3 of the 5 are already eating! This place is complete BS. What a way to ruin my friend's birthday!"}
{"text":"this thai place was the BOMB, not only because of how delicious the food is but also because of how accommodating they are.

we are pretty strict vegetarians, and most thai restaurants put fish sauce in many dishes. however at thai chili, they understood what being a strict vegetarian was and made separate sauces if it contained fish oil. which i was so so happy about. usually its what you see is what you get.

i have been on a hunt for good thai food in phx for so long, and i finally found one! 

they have a wide variety of dishes. i loved  vegetable curry and the pad thai dishes the rice paper spring rolls for appetizer...YUM.

whenever i crave thai food, this will be the place i go to...as should you.

SUMMARY!! (in case you dont feel like reading full sentences)

FOOD: tasty, wide-variety, vegetarian friendly **will make sauces from scratch to suit your allergies

ATMOSPHERE: small homely place, with dim lighting

SERVICE: very friendly and willing to make your experience a good one.


caution!!!! :

SPICY MEANS SPICY:

their spicy is realllyyy spicy...i'm indian and 3 is the spiciest i could go. (10 is the spiciest..i dont even want to imagine what that's like)

DIM lighting means DIM: so if you're someone who likes a lit up restaurant, i suggest going there for lunch because at present, they don't have candles."}
{"text":"Words can't express how much I love this place. Servers are the absolute most humble and SUPER attentive. Love each and every person who's involved in this restaurant. I'm wasn't the biggest fan of Thai food my whole life so I was kind of disappointed when my in laws took us here, but boy has my experience changed. Now I want curry every day of the week. You think their service is good? Wait till you try the food . Oh lawd. And my Thai tea is just how I like it. Diabetes sweet with the comforting taste of creamer I usually just tip 20% but every time I come here the environment is just too good. Between the food and customer service, I will give every cent I have to keep this business alive so I can continue to come here with my fiancé. Wonderful way to spend our 2 year anniversary"}
{"text":"Great place and the food is always excellent and true to its authentic Thai culture! Must stop here!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance. The ac is definitely getting a workout. I wasn't left to parch as my glass was filled with water often. Service was attentive. There is a lot of choices on the menu. 

Our orders. 
Thai spring rolls- ok. sauce was pretty sweet. 
Pad thai with beef- good 
Basil with tofu- good 

Overall, I wont be going back. The prices are high for Thai food. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"A solid four.  No need to worry it's anything less.  I'm impressed we have a place like this in the Val Vista Lakes area.  Clean, modern, clean, good service, clean, good pad thai and clean.  You always worry about that in a mom and pop.  Very good lunch special.  Spice scale is 1-10.  I got a 3 and it was just enough for me.  My sister got an 8 and was blown away and she likes spicey.  Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Do not go here if u have gluten allergies! The server was nice and tried to make up something for me without fish sauce  or soy sauce (gluten). All of a sudden  my gf gets up and starts yelling at the chef. Turns out the chef was talking trash about us in the kitchen in Thai \"why did they come here if they are so picky? I cant cook like that, tell them to go somwhere else\" she did not know my wonderful  angel speaks Thai lol... so we stormed out! 
I woukd give them 1 star but as a small business owner i know how hard it is to recover from a one star rating. I am giving them 3 stars for good karma only. If u are Vegan or have celiac do not go here. Food may be fine otherwise but we will never know. Lesson to all... u never know who speaks your language lol"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are amazing $7.95 and the food was delicious! I had the chicken pad thai and my girlfriend had yellow curry! Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their Panang Curry. I could drink it like a soup. Wait, I do that already. =P

What I got:
Panang Curry. Rating: 4.5/5
Pad Siew. 3.5/5
Green Tea Ice Cream. Rating: 3/5
Thai Iced Tea. Rating: 4/5

Spiciness: asked for 7/10.

Hostess even gave a free dessert. 

For Arizona standards, the curry is some of the best I've had here. Decently Priced too. 

The atmosphere is sit down and awesome one of my top picks if you want to take a date here, but need a college priced / affordable place. It's clean and a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. The awesome lunch specials come with a small tom yum soup and one crispy roll. The husband and wife who own this place take really good care of you, and she is from Thailand and does all the cooking. If they aren't super busy she will make my favorite dish, which is not on the regular menu: Pad Kra Prow, which is ground meat done Thai Basil style, spicy with a runny egg on top. Her version is one of the best in the area and a really good value for the money."}
{"text":"Thai Chili is pretty good. Think of a #10 spicy. I actually tried a 7/10 and started dying because I couldn't tolerate it. I underestimated the heat. This place is also very accommodating for big parties. It's well renovated and the prices are fair. Probably better than all the other Thai places in Mesa"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've had since I've lived in vegas,(over ten years)Flavors are fresh & real,service was great,our waiter kept checking in on us to make sure we had refills & condiments,small,cozy,place to eat spicy thai."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the service was great. It looks likes is a family business. Will come back to try other plates. I had the shrimp Tom yum"}
{"text":"As far as Thai food goes this place is pretty good and authentic. My favorite dishes are the Panang Curry and the Pad-see-ew. They are almost always super busy on the weekends and they don't have that large of dining room or waiting area so plan accordingly if you're a big group or eating right around dinner time. However, they do offer carry out and delivery options as well should you not feel like waiting to be seated. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Of all the Thai places in the Valley, my wife and I continue to go back here the most.  We love Thai Chili!  The food is always fresh and great. Service is spectacular."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Hidden in an old shoppers square off sunset, but so glad we found it. If you're there around dinner time it's pretty packed, but comforting for a new customer to see a busy restaurant. Great staff (family run I believe, I was served by a very young gentleman with glasses, but both young ones were very attentive) and great food. Always get the pad thai and red curry here."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed Thai food snob, I have to say this place rocks and Gilbert has needed a great Thai place for a long time.  Thai Chili has a nice low-key atmosphere, great service and excellent, tasty food.  We started with the Tom Kai Gai soup which was flavorful, slightly sweet and rich.  It was the perfect blend of flavors and everything Tom Kai Gai should be.  My husband and I shared the drunken noodles with chicken (be warned, it's pretty darn spicy) and the Massaman Curry - a rich blend of curry with coconut, potato, chicken and the right amount of heat.  The cocount ice cream with sticky rice topped off our evening.  Everything was delicious and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  I'm in town for business and this was the closest Thai restaurant to my hotel. I called in a to-go order and told 25 mins. When I arrived the restaurant was empty, which is never a good sign. I ordered the Spicy Basil Pork(medium) and  a small Tom yum soup with chicken. The soup was good and loaded with chicken. however, the entree was bland.  It barely qualified as medium spicy and was missing almost all the flavor. It was half the size of any entree I've ever had from other Thai restaurants. I think the soup had more meat than the entree. If I'm back in the area again, I'll be skipping this one next time."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We had chicken pad Thai and yellow curry chicken with Thai beef jerky as an appy. I love it hot n spicy and they don't disappoint. The portions are large and the flavors are right on. My nose is running as I am writing this and loving every minute of it. Can't wait to come back and try some new stuff. The Thai iced tea with lemon was off the chart awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!

Their food is just incredible and the portions are generous.   I'm absolutely addicted to their pad thai, and they have a homemade pineapple dressing that is unbelievably good.  (Take it from someone that doesn't even like salad, this stuff rocks!)  

The place is small but clean, and the staff is very friendly.  The only con is that the servers can be a little slow on the refills and check, which may be a turnoff for some.  Personally, I think the quality food here is well worth the wait.  

I always thought their spice was a little weak, but I recently tried a ten and found out how very wrong I was.  They can definitely appeal to spice lovers and haters alike.  I'd definitely recommend Thai Chili for almost any occasion"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is average but the food is fantastic. I have brought many people and have recommended this place. I love their sizzling beef and red seafood curry. I actually crave this place and make it here at least twice a month. Clean environment, casual dining, nice decor. If you are new, go for their lunch special it is the best value. All portions are great and can have some left overs, I tend to eat everything in one sitting. Enjoy as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here to get our Fix when we are craving Thai Food. The customer service is excellent and the food is always ready for us within 15 minutes if we are ordering it to go. We just had some take out tonight and we were not disappointed. Delicious Shrimp Pad Thai, Papaya Salad, and Chicken Larb. The Thai Tea is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Rice was mush... green curry was not good at all chicken and shrimp overcooked till dry. Won tons super bland yuck not even in a correct fold... far from authentic.... over all really disappointing. Beef in the cashew dish was so chewy and cut with the grain... just pure amateur... peanut sauce was terrible and the spring rolls where rolled by children... if you call it a roll... so mad I paid for this... never  again and will  make sure to spread the word."}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch at Thai Chili 5 or 6 times now and really enjoy it.  The ambiance is nothing special; typical strip mall thai, however, the food is very good.  I normally get the drunken noodles with chicken and it is fantastic.  Several of the people I have had lunch with have tried the noodles and said they wanted to get them next time.  I haven't had much off the menu, but what I have had was very good and reasonably priced.  Lunch is less than $10 if you don't get a drink."}
{"text":"Thai fried rice with chicken is my favorite thing to order. Prefect amount of spice and flavor. And the dinner portion is huge. Enough for dinner and lunch!!! We also had the spring rolls (no picture we are them quickly) which looked like regular egg rolls. So delicious that my husband will go there instead of pei wei next time."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome-food is amazing and some of the most authentic Thai food I have had in CLE. If you want some amazing Tom Yum and Tom Kha soup- look no further! 
Pad Thai is very good and the spice level can be customized (on most every dish as well)- add a little kick to make it even better. 
The chicken basil stir fry was also delicious.
They use fresh ingredients here and make everything to order- which is so evident in the food. 
Hands down, the best Thai food in Cleveland. 
You will, however, have to wait a bit for carry out orders etc., which is a bummer. 
The only problem besides waiting is that they have random hours so you have to get lucky to get an order in. If you are lucky enough- definitely do it!"}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Chili several times. It has normally been very good. I especially like the drunken noodles and the pineapple curry, butt he last time that I ate there was just okay. The portions seemed smaller and the food less flavorful. My wife's red curry was more runny and the portion appeared more like a lunch than a dinner meal. I'll probably be back at some point, since I have previously been very pleased with the food. I'm not in a hurry though -- there are other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"We ordered the Pad Thai and Thai tea. The food is delicious and our server was very friendly and patient with us trying to decide what we wanted. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Well
I'm sad to write this but they have delivered to my house before and this time they tried to come out here which is a mile away from the restaurant and instead of calling me when they couldn't find it they just went back and ignored it.  Totally unprofessional and fucked up.  Wow. Way to run a business.  Maybe if the person answering the phone for delivery could understand English then they could get an address correct.  Fuck this place.  I'm still hungry. Assholes"}
{"text":"Our EX favorite restaurant.  We have been getting food delivered from this place for years now and all of a sudden they don't deliver to our area?  We spend on average $50 on each order we place with them and ordered as recently as last month, but now the 'manager on duty' decides that they arent going to take our order this time?

Don't get me wrong...great food, but SH*TTY customer service.

You just lost yourself a long time customer and one of your biggest fans."}
{"text":"My go to Thai food place. It's gone through different management and cook teams but always satisfying."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice within an week and the food is delicious abd authentic..... I love the Thai Fried rice, the spring rolls are a must, and everything's spiced go perfection."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a Thai place close to home and Thai Chili has been wonderful. They even deliver! The Yellow Curry is amazing and their Pad Thai is wonderful but normally that's hard to screw up. Every time we call and order Ray answers and is very kind and helpful!"}
{"text":"Tofu in the pad Thai was rubbery and it had hardly any sprouts.  No fresh lime either.

Husband liked the sizzling beef which he liked a lot.  Although a 3 is not spicy at all for him.

Service was very good and for me that was they only good thing about our meal tonight."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with really flavorful food and good service. Everyone in my dinner party thought it was great. And everyone needed a box, so you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"We just love this place!!  Delivery Thai food...does it get better?"}
{"text":"First timer...I was impressed with the food. I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. The portion was nice and big, 4 decent sized shrimp, one of the better tasting versions of Pad Thai I've had in a while, I ordered it spice level 4 to play it safe and it was perfect for me. If you don't like spice, better order a 1! I'll definitely go back and try the food again. I preordered by phone for pick up, it was ready when I got there. The guy at the counter had a very thick accent and was difficult to understand and seemed a bit frazzled, otherwise my experience was smooth."}
{"text":"Thai Chili's Curry is delicious.

You can order a \"2\" as far as heat and then add in some chili on the side for a \"Just Right\" Curry experience.

Friendly staff and cold beer

We love it!"}
{"text":"What a great little place for an authentic Thai lunch. I will be back for this yumminess."}
{"text":"Decent Thai place in a sort of weird location off Sunset and Green Valley Parkway. Not much for atmosphere inside. More like a quick lunch or take-away place. Service was good enough and portions were big. Flavors and quality were OK, not amazing. Overall a solid Thai option, but I wouldnt go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this great little spot in Avon Lake and the woman that runs the show with her terrific small staff. This is some of the best Thai food I have ever had. Truly everything on the menu is superb. Be prepared to wait for your food! Fans of this joint know the deal and realize it's so worth the wait. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with my chicken pad Thai and Thai iced tea. The restaurant was small and clean and the food came really quick. I loved the flavors in my pad Thai and the spice was perfect! I am going to become a regular here for sure !! Also they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and decor.  All tables and no booths, in case you were wondering, and in case you are a \"booth\" person.  We sat right in front of the cash register, and the downside to that was people picking up take out orders kept bumping my chair, but it wasn't a make it or break it event.  

The staff was very pleasant and my drink didn't sit empty for more than 2 minutes, TOPS.  (That is a BIG deal for me, especially with spicy Thai food)

I ordered green curry at a 10 (level of spice) and it was just right!!!  The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and it had a smooth texture.  The portions were very large as well.  Enough for lunch the next day for sure.  We also ordered spring rolls, and they were delicious.  Had a sweet taste to them, but were fresh and crisp.  

I would come here again for sure.  They're green curry (on a scale of 1-10) is about an 8.5 or a 9."}
{"text":"We haven't returned to this place in so long.  it's small and have enough options of Thai food.  We had my favorite dish Yen Ta For.  It's all good. We have to give it more tries for different dishes to see if I should give it five star.  It is a very convenient location after a visit to Ethel's M chocolate factory!"}
{"text":"We mostly order take-out pad thai from here. Ik...not original, but we love it. Definately worth trying. To the 1-star people...would you give them a better review if the place was packed with a 45 minute wait, and they didn't do take-out? If the time quote they gave you is accurate and you chose to stay, why complain on yelp?"}
{"text":"Great experience dining here.  Fast service on a Wednesday afternoon. Server was very attentive and food was great will definitely go back when in the mood for thai food. I even ordered food to go for my son who also liked the food here. The place is very clean"}
{"text":"The food is still really good, but the service is getting worse.  

Ordering by telephone is impossible unless you have a menu with the numbers of the dishes listed.  They have yet to get a takeout order right the first time.  Half the time they do not have your order ready in anywhere near the time specified.  AND they double charged us for a take out order. 

Sigh.  I want to love you Thai Chili, so please get your act together."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found around.  I love the shrimp pad Thai and the chili mint beef. Oh yeah get an order of the pork jerky......"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area for sure!!!! And they are very very friendly staff. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been eye balling this place for a year but avoided it because it looked like no one ever went there. Today I decided to give it a try and I was very satisfied. The lunch menu is pretty short but had a good verity. I had the yellow curry with chicken. Delicious! Loved the large and fresh veggies! I will definitely be back to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"Very good food, delivery that is quick as hell. Faster than any place that I have ordered delivery from yet since being here in Vegas. Im really happy they have a location in Henderson!! Try it, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"I was tired my child was tired, I ordered on the phone to expedite the meal to bring home, My child ate at Wendy's right around the corner, I ordered my 40 dollars worth of food, gave my name and phone number. I said can you have it ready at 8pm.  ¨no problem¨ they said.  ha ha ha I waited like a dope til 8pm because my kid ate and we were done by 7:35. I walked in at 8pm and they said ¨my name¨ I was thinking wow !  they said okay ¨We make order now\" OMG  I would give them zero stars but I can't. I still want to try one thing on the menu i never tried anywhere else sounds good, but I refuse.  I never see anyone in the place I pass it daily. laundering money? hm"}
{"text":"The most over the top Thai restaurant I've been to. That is both good and bad. The lunch salad was huge! The dressing was a tad too sweet for me. Not bad though. Next my thai tea came out in a huge glass. Score! When my Panang curry came out, I was excited, but tasted it and it was too salty. This coming from a salt-a-holic, that's not good. The chicken was a tad overcooked. Not the best experience. I might just go for the pad woon sen next round, if I come back. One more thing, the staff is really nice. That's always a plus and is why I'm considering coming back. :)"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love ordering lunch from here to treat ourselves to some delicious Pad Thai or Sweet and Sour chicken! Great staff and Thai tea!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and the place has some good deals. I've tried the eggplant and the pad thai. 

I really enjoyed the eggplant dish. I like my food pretty spicy and Thai Chili really knows how to turn up the heat! I got a 10/10 and it really hit the spot. A lot of places don't seem to cook the eggplant quite long enough, but thai chili did a really good job. That is probably my favorite thing to eat there!

The pad thai isn't one of my favorites. It's a decent meal for lunch. I got a 9/10 which is just spicy enough for me without burning a hole in my stomach. I would say the flavor just isn't really \"authentic\" or what I might be used to. The noodles have a bit too much sauce on them for me. 

The service is usually great. Water is always filled, friendly people, fast service. 

Overall, I'd say this place is decent to eat but not the best thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is the easiest review I've ever had to write!

The food was amazing. And I can say that after having attempted to eat some of every option at one sitting!

The staff is considerate, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.

Over 50% of the people in the restaurant were regulars, greeted by name by the staff.  I love when I see that level of return business at a local spot!

And best of all, I reached the waddling state of fullness for much less money than I expected!

The final feather in Thai Chili's cap? My husband, who had never had Thai food (and didn't think he'd like it) has requested to eat there again! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday for lunch.   Was excited that they had caffeine-free tea!  I ordered the yellow curry.   They bright me a salad first, which was decent, and around the time I finished that the curry was ready.   It was delicious and a 4/5 was spicy enough for me... I could never get it spicy enough at Thai House on Power...  anyway customer service was great, bathroom was clean, I'd definitely go back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill tremendously. I have been coming here for years however they seem to have become money hungry and have forgotten about customer service. Sure the food taste good but the service and attitude of the employees working there is just down right awful. I would rather take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wish I had pics but I was super hungry and the food was delicious. First time ordering from this place and we're hooked. Ordered the orange chicken (spicy #7) drunken noodle and crab friend rice. Everything was amazing, probably the best orange chicken & drunken noodle I've had. I also don't care for fried rice but this was very good. 

Thanks for the great food guys! Keep it up! 

p.s. Sorry for making you drive in this wind storm."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this place. My hubby and I ordered the chicken Pad Thai and mushroom soup for delivery. When it arrived at our doorstep the food was nice and hot. Every bite we had was full of flavor and it is now one of our favorite Thai places in Mesa.
We will be ordering from here a lot more in the future!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food restaurant I've had the yellow curry, red curry, pineapple curry, and it is all delicious! Ordered vegan style which is just with mixed veggies. Portion size is great fills me up 

We have YouTube channel (TBVEGAN) we review vegan restaurants/ and restaurants that serve vegan options check us out for more reviews!"}
{"text":"I guess this is the best thai place in town, took dinner yesterday there and it was yumyumDelceioiusness i ordered the daily special curry seafood and some chicken coconut soup and both was amazing."}
{"text":"Yummyyy!!! I usually go to Pin Kaows but due to them being so far from my home  I decided to give this place a try and man was I amazed!!!! Little hole in the wall but taste is there! I got a To-Go Order. Must try Chicken pad Thai and Tofu red curry spicy #5!!! Bomb!!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a cheap Thai place in Vegas and this is the first we've seen and it's really good! Every other Thai place we've tried are pretty fancy-casual hence a higher price point. Thai iced tea tastes great. Eggrolls, not so much, you can pass on that. Hubby got green beef curry with spice level four and it was perfect. It wasnt green at all though but the soup was on point. I got pad thai with shrimp. Awesome as well. We'll definitely drive all the way here again."}
{"text":"The Duck Soup...Oh my god...the duck soup...is SO GOOD!

The Duck in the duck soup is squishy AND crunchy at the same time- and sweet tasting. The veggies are the perfect match to the other elements in this soup.
I had the broth spiced at '2' out of 10.

The owner and workers are very social, so if you're looking for a nice atmosphere with nice hosts, this is the restaurant to come to!"}
{"text":"Average food. Overly sweet curry and almost flavorless spring rolls fried in oil that tasted stale. Not a good experience for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered take out couple days ago.  We were very pleased with everything we ordered, when you order spicy hot you get spicy hot, I hate when I ask for hot and spicy and get mild and tasteless.  The food is full of flavor and I look forward to testing the whole menu."}
{"text":"Friendly, quiet & clean little place. Food is cooked fresh and is very tasty. Try the Thai Tea it is awesome."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday and it was fairly good. The ambiance is non existent in this restaurant, so don't expect anything fancy. I went with a couple of friends and we each got something different, I got drunken noodles, one friend got pad see u, and another got pad thai. I got mine at a level 5 spicy and it was spicy! That part was good. I just thought it was a little dry... could have used a bit more sauce. The flavor was good. It also came with a fairly good salad and an alright spring roll. I gave this place 3 stars because, although it was fine, it was nothing special and there are many thai restaurants in phoenix that are better."}
{"text":"This is a family owned small restaurant.  There seems to be a lot of take-out and delivery activities.  We ordered the papaya salad which is OK.  Pad Thai is average.  Barbecue pork fried rice is a little wet.  I'm not sure why people gave this restaurant 4 stars because every thing we ordered was just average."}
{"text":"The food is great!! Spicy is really spicy and the service is also outstanding. We had to wait a while for a table, but it was worth the wait. The staff were all very cordial and welcoming. Definitely recommend this place, and we will be back."}
{"text":"meh.
service was good, but the food was just ok.

 'thai food to go' is a lot better, but it was sunday and they were closed.

the chix satay were very tasty.  potstickers, yellow curry, fried rice were all mediocre at best.

 garlic chicken dish was good, but cold when we got it.

maybe we came on an 'off' day or something."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Green Valley! You will not be disappointed. The prices cannot be beat and the food is delicious (about $5.95 per item). On many occasions I have ordered: Chicken Pad Thai, Chicken Panang, Thai Chili mint w/Beef, Papaya salad, Tom Yum soup. They are all delicious. My friend from Thailand approves herself. Just keep in mind that they're closed on Sundays. They are located right next to the CitiBank."}
{"text":"I got the Drunken Noodles and they were dynamite! Excellent service, top notch food and very well priced. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review Thai Chili, but I always go there when I'm at work so I just forget when I get back to work. I have posted a picture though.

So I work near Thai Chili but I don't live that close to it, and one Saturday I was craving Thai food so I went to a local Thai place and after eating I thought, \"damn Thai Chili is way better than this place.\" Well it turns out Thai Chili is the best Thai place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place inside of a strip mall that I had never known existed. My in-laws actually suggested it, and we met there for dinner. They raved about it, and the place was tiny but packed. I had the yellow curry, and wife had something with peanut sauce on it.

Everything was delicious, and arrived quickly. They have the typical 1-5 scale of hotness, and I ventured a 3 while everyone else stayed at 2. 3 was perfect for me, but they were all complaining about their \"2+\" dishes. I concluded that they were all wimps, but if you are also a wimp know that 2 is \"wimp hot\"."}
{"text":"We love this place! Our  favorites are the fried wontons, the Thai chili beef, and all the curries! We just moved into an area where they can deliver to us, so we order at least once a week. I've been making my way through the entire menu and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. We are definitely officially regulars. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the service here.  The waiter came to the table, asked me a few questions (food allergies, preferred meat type, degree of spicy, noodles/rice/etc), he then told me not to worry about ordering, but that he would make me something.  He then made 2 deliciously awesome dishes and they were perfect!!!  Not sure exactly what we got but it was amazing!  Very good food, top-notch service, will go back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great reputation among my friends. I kept hearing about how people loved the food at Thai Chili but kept resisting because it wasn't a \"name brand\" or (believe it or not) the location wasn't great on Baseline Rd.  What a mistake!

Finally, some neighbors convinced me to go to Thai Chili for dinner. The first thing I noticed was how friendly the staff was. My friends are big Thai Chili fans and it was obvious as they were welcomed using their first names (yes, definitely regulars). We ordered 4 dishes and shared so my wife and I could taste a few things.

I loved the yellow curry. My wife's favorite was the Chicken Cashew Nuts and Vegetables. The Thai Fried Rice was also good.

Since then I've been back, oh, 3-4 times for lunch. I have yet to order something that didn't taste great. Thumbs up for these entree's:

Pad Prig Pao (with beef)
Cashew Nuts with Vegetables
Yellow Curry
Pad Siew"}
{"text":"I ate the panang curry for lunch today and 8 hours later I'm experiencing terrible vomiting,  diarrhea,  and nausea. It's the only thing I ate today.  Pretty sure I'm dying right now :( I've never had food poisoning before but I'm guessing this is it and it's not fun."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had! No other Thai restaurant compares. The owner is super nice and friendly. I've since moved quite a bit away from the restaurant but we always go back when we're in the area!"}
{"text":"I would have given a 5 star rating but had to paid full price since I used the restaurant.com certificate that took the seafood out so I felt slightly cheated.  The service was nice the the food is great.  If you used any type of discount, you will not get the best items while the price is being charged at the full rate.  No other restaurant ever do this.  I think it is something to consider before you walk in."}
{"text":"Always good consistent Thai food. Great friendly staff and management. I typically get yellow curry and it is always what I expect. They just opened a quick serve store in Queen Creek."}
{"text":"I order take out from all of the time and they are really friendly here and food is yummy. 

my favorites are the chicken yellow curry and pad key mao spicy level 5! ;)

All dishes are about $10 as far as curries, rices, and noodles"}
{"text":"Food: Excellent 
Ambience: Good 
Value: Good avg price per person 15$
Service: Good

We choose this restaurant based on reviews and felt happy with the choice. When we reached there was waiting for 15min at the end we felt happy about the wait. Orders veg spring roll, veg delight & veg fried rice service was quick and we enjoyed spicy hot food. I would definitely recommend this place and would visit again. So far I would rate this very good Thai restaurant in the market, try it by yourself and let us known your comments."}
{"text":"My wife and I were struggling with what to make for dinner and caved into the idea of ordering out. We didn't want to go to the usual places (Chipotle, Pei Wei, etc) so I started browsing through Yelp for some non-fast food options and I came across this highly rated Thai place. I ordered the beef pad Thai, Thai spring rolls, pineapple fried rice and the Thai sizzling beef all through the Yelp app (also a first). It took about 50 minutes to arrive (annoying) and I have to admit the food was AMAZING. We ordered the pad Thai, spring rolls, thai beef, and pineapple fried rice. Definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time and decided to all split the dishes, including green chicken curry, beef panang, spicy eggplant chicken, tom kha soup, and mushroom soup. Every single item was delicious! They provided more than enough rice, as well as small containers of red pepper flakes and sauce for extra added \"heat.\" We normally like moderately hot thai and noted that the reviews here recommended 2 or 3 at the most. We settled on the 2 which was a wise decision. We really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome customer service! 

Its always a plus when the owner is on site and prepares the complete meal for you.

Betttttttttter!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, probably some of the best I've had on the west coast. They even stayed open late for me and my party. Amazing service. Just do it"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy food with a decent price and atmosphere. My favorite is green curry and steamed rice :)"}
{"text":"Okay another first Tom Yum noodle soup. I love soup so I gave the Tom Yum soup four stars"}
{"text":"Pretty for a neighborhood spot not horrible but not the best, however I  highly recommend the pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Food was pretty good, my Thai friend liked her Papaya salad and I liked the pork Pad See Euw more than I did the Bangkok Orchid version. This place is more about delivery orders than dine in as the restaurant only has a few tables and is sparsely decorated. Menu is a bit limited as well. 

It's a nice Mom and Pop place, with hours from 11am to 10pm 7 days a week. That's a lot of work!! I like supporting these types of businesses. 

Its nice to know there are two decent Thai places in my new neighborhood....I'd do take out from Thai Chili, and dine in at Bangkok Orchid."}
{"text":"I ordered tonight thru my yelp app because I was able to get $5 off my first order. 

I mostly order taste of China but decided I would try something new since they have more yelp stars than my usual. 

Ordering was easy online, and I decided to get the pad Thai with pork($10) fresh vegetable rolls with chicken ($6) dumplings ($6), and combo fried rice ($14). 

Let's just say everything was very very fresh, but the only thing I really was happy with was the pad thai. I will definitely order again but probably only that and nothing else. 

The rolls fresh with vegetables but just no chicken really and just fell apart. The dumplings weren't my usual soft dumplings but had a more fried taste to them which would work for some but not my thing. 

The fried rice was way more vegetables than meat and I will say again FRESH but for $14 just not worth it at that price. 

Delivery took about an hour and I was quoted about that long so I was expecting to wait especially since the finals are on. 

Yes to order pad Thai again, no to everything else."}
{"text":"Wow- I'm pretty selective with a 5 star, so you know I mean it. This place was amazing. Pad Thai, Curry Salmon, a couple of tofu dishes that I can't remember now- but all SO GOOD. So much flavor in these dishes I even enjoyed the tofu, and I'm a carnivore who tends to avoid spongy substances. The flavor was that good!  I'm even giving this 5 stars with the slow service- it was THAT GOOD. We literally took the last two tables, and we were split up. However, they do take reservations, so live and learn. Call first. I can't wait to go here again, or even get take out. 

So. Good."}
{"text":"Small place had some trouble finding it at first. I got a medium spicy order of green curry with chicken. They definitely live up to the name. I'm not sure I want to go higher than a medium and I have a pretty good spice tolerance. Look forward to trying other things. Their hours are limited."}
{"text":"This place would be your good, dependable neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I feel like it's not quite as authentic as Siam Orchid or Tum Nak Thai (both family run by husband/wife cook/wait teams) but they serve up some solid tasty food.

They have a good range of vegetarian options -- I seem to always gravitate towards the Mushroom Soup, which is as close to my beloved tom kha gai as I've been able to get since I stopped eating meat.  The Golden Tofu is also pretty good but I sub peanut sauce for the sweet sauce it comes with.  I like their Silver Noodles -- mmm broccoli!  And they actually make a Larb Tofu, which is just alright in my opinion; even though it's been years since I've eaten beef, I think the dish tastes better with it than tofu.  My husband really likes their Beef Panang Curry and Pad Thai with pork.

They have good lunch specials, a great rewards program, and very nice staff -- they always remember my name when I come in!  I don't think you'd be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever! My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week. It always hits the spot. My faves are the Pad Siew, Shrimp and Scallops in Peanut Sauce and Beef Panang (I get it with Chicken). The boyfriend loves Pad Prig Pow, Ginger Delight and Spicy Eggplant. They are right on. I'm a wimp, so I don't add spice a spice level. Every once in awhile I try new dishes and they are always good. He gets a 2 or 3 and with that I can't drink enough water to handle it. Great staff, amazing chef, nice decor, great food to eat in or carry out. It's always hard to find a great place with all the options, when we started going to Thai Chili, we do not get Thai food anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas. The red curry is unreal! I'm also a huge fan of their beef pad see ew. Not only is the food amazing, but the customer service is impressive. Super friendly staff. I'm so happy I found this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I finally got my husband to agree to takeout from here.  It's after 6pm and they aren't answering the phone.  On a Friday night!  They apparently close in an hour and don't want our business.  The last time we went there was when they first opened, and the portions were tiny and prices were high.  It's taken years, and now we can't place a to go order an hour before close?  That's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had in Ohio--hands down. I am pretty familiar with Thai ingredients and trust me when I tell you that this place uses them. In fact, they'll prove it to you! I was talking about the soup base for their Tom Kha and one of the owners actually came out with the product and talked about it with me. Pretty cool!

I've had quite a few things on the menu, including their Tom Kha soup (the best ever), 3 of their curries, several of the appetizers, and a few of their main dishes. I've found all of the sauces and flavors to be spot on. The only thing I would say is that the Prik King needs more green beans! I'm used to that being mostly green beans and a bit of everything else--rather then a stir fry type dish. But even though I have that comment, I'd still order it again because the sauce is so tasty and it's cooked really well.

The fact that this exists where it does is a huge boon to me! Lorain County does not have a lot of good food choices, so it's good to know that this place is here."}
{"text":"Great service and good portions! 

We've been here a few times, even ordered doordash. 

It's a great little hole in a wall place! The service has always been great and the food comes out fast. It's hard to try something different because I always like to get yellow curry and my husband loves the Thai chili mint noodles. Glad we took the mother in law here because she really loved it! she ordered pineapple fried rice and tried Thai tea for the first time and I think she's hooked. 
We also love the Singapore noodles but last time we ordered it, it seems like it was a lot smaller."}
{"text":"This seems to be a family owned Thai restaurant.  Food is very good and service is excellent.   Wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in but will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So far everything I've had has been D to the lish! Favs are yellow curry and sizzling beef. Drinker noodles are bomb too. Lunch special is pretty legit. I've been to a handful of Thai restaurants in east valley and this one is my favorite right now."}
{"text":"Very good - family run.  Never had anything bad from here.  A little place - not too fancy.  I get it delivered though so that's fine.  Don't hesitate to try it though- it's legit.  5 stars reserved for fancier, fine dining Thai."}
{"text":"If I could give a review of zero stars I would because that's how mad I am... Your hours on both Google as well as listed here say 430, at 4:30 I tried calling to place a To Go order. The phone answered and put me on hold and kept saying that I was the number one caller and had one more minute wait time. I waited ON HOLD for 30 minutes while driving to the restaurant, only to find a new sign taped to the door with the hours changed. If your going to change the hours, fine...BUT ALSO CHANGE THE PHONE SYSTEM and YELP/GOOGLE hours as well. That is so incredibly rude. 

The only saving grace of this to go order, was your employees who were there and handled the situation awesomely.  There great attitudes definitely helped diffuse the situation because I was pissed. Now hopefully my food is good as well! 

UPDATE: the food, as usual, was excellent! The Pumpkin Curry was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic Thai Restaurant! I always eat here and I don't have to wait that long to pick up my order like only 5 mins and the food was ready!. They also gave me free Thai tea  and server was awesome his really nice and they have \"A\" for the grade! Love this place! I would recommend this place and for that I will rate this restaurant a 5 Star! Thank you also for the fre"}
{"text":"Thai Chili has just opened. Ping pong Thai restaurant is great too and there is another where Home Depot is located.  Thai Chili I would say is almost as good as Ping pong but I have no regrets going to Thai Chili."}
{"text":"Great little place. I wasn't not expecting anything this good given its location. The dumplings were amazing. They almost had this slightly smoky overtone to them - just delicious. The spring rolls were large and very fresh.

My husband had the Pad Thai and felt it was one of the best he's ever had. I had the Drunken Noodle which was excellent.

The service was great. In fact, when we told our server (maybe the manager?) how happy we were, he took the appetizers off our bill. 

Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"2 minutes ago

I have eaten Thai food all over the US - not every place but hundreds due to work and pleasure travels and if pure flavor is what you see there is no better than That Chili in Avon Lake. 
Price is decent, portions quite big and excellent service. 
Where this husband and wife team get poor marks for is their often times slow service or they run out of food in fact on some nights. BUT I'm here to tell you it is ALL worth the wait. It is actually part of thier charm. Just be patient, plan ahead and be calm. It is worth it !!
Best in town!"}
{"text":"Wow, we were seriously impressed with this place.  The red curry was perfect and not too runny like at a lot of places... maybe just a little bit of cilantro on the top to set it off :)  Clean and you can tell they are taking pride in this restaurant and I really liked that.  We are going back there today for some take out... can't wait.  Finally a good thai place in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Fresh rolls, papaya salad & beef curry all amazing. Very affordable. Service was great - they were a bit in the weeds but acknowledged it rather than not make eye contact. This will be a tough spot for a restaurant like this to survive but we are hopeful. Great minimal menu, busy and locally owned."}
{"text":"Really like this place. I have a hard time passing by without stopping for Chicken Pad Thai. The lunch special is the real deal. Just found out they have free delivery now I am in real trouble. Just have to be careful as the 1-10 hot scale is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Terrific Thai food and a huge hit in our office. While they are always busy, the food is always on time and made just right. Never had a bad experience here. My only disappointment is they no longer delivery during lunch hours, only dinner hours. This place really has been booming over the last couple of years!"}
{"text":"As always, food and service were 5 star, only complaint is that when the big party of drunk trash in swimsuits tore into their waitress, the manager didn't kick them out. Apparently not their first time doing this, and they always end up with free food (uh, hello? They know what they're doing) and ruin our meal with their rude drunk foul language and trashiness. Management should stand up for their servers and refuse them service."}
{"text":"Good Thai teas here.....I wish they were free refills!  Love the Panang Curry too.  

Wish the wait wasn't so long though."}
{"text":"Decided to try it based on the great reviews. Not disappointed. The food came out hot and fast. It was really tasty.
The service was good. I guess it was the owners young son. He was really polite and was working really hard.
I recommend you give this place a try. Not a great \"date place\" but if you're out and find yourself hungry....give it a try."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Henderson. I've tried so many Thai places and this little always makes it the best. Going on 3 years that I keep coming back. I recommend not getting delivery. Pick it up."}
{"text":"My first time here and I will definitely be back! This place is very clean and efficient. The food was delicious, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Plus, you can't beat the lunch deal. Portions are big! I had the drunken noodles at a level 3 out of 5 for spiciness. It had just a hint of spice, I probably could have gone with a 4 or 5 and been fine. The manager Mike was very involved in running the front and back of the house, he seemed to be great with his staff as well."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They have some great lunch specials from 11-3.  They immediately serve a simple lettuce salad with AMAZING dressing.  My favorite is the Pad Thai with Shrimp."}
{"text":"They totally changed there menu and it sucks plus each location has different menus no thank you I won't be dining here no longer."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food! I love a good yellow curry and this place cures my craving for it. Thai iced coffee is also yummy as well as the pad Thai. Can't go wrong here!"}
