{"text":"I have already visited twice in 1 week and It's fast becoming a fave. They have a nice variety of Arepas on menu, tried 2 (Mexicana & Paisa) and both were so flavorful. Apps are great too, such as the tostones w/ beans and the empanadas which are on the small side but delish and reasonably priced. Sweet plantains are Cooked to perfection. Their chicken w/ mushroom sauce is packed w/ flavor and a lighter option to the heavy Arepas. They have traditional Columbian drinks that are so refreshing on a sweltering pgh day. Best part, everything I mentioned is Gluten Free, as well as 90 percent of their menu."}
{"text":"I am from Colombia and was tremendously and pleasurably surprised to experience this spot in Pittsburgh. The menu does include some dishes from other Latin American countries, but the Colombian specialties are right on target. You could just fill yourself up with empanadas and call it a meal. My only observation is that I wish they could provide real \"ají\" dressing with them, as opposed to some tabasco based concoction. Another suggestion is that if they were to add the famous \"ajiaco\" soup to the menu, this restaurant would be significantly adding to the quality of life in Pittsburgh especially in the winter! Cinco estrellas (five stars)!"}
{"text":"Rob (our waiter) made our 1st visit so much fun! Now, for the food...chicken and beef empanadas - both good, but beef was our favorite. Enjoyed the coconut lemonade and mint lemonade (tastes like a mojito). We all had arepas. Our favorite was the ropa vieja. Tostones  (fried green plantains) were great with their cilantro aioli. Definitely returning...and they are BYOB!"}
{"text":"The server was very helpful in describing the dishes and directing us to meals that were great for us. My wife, Janette misread the menu and asked for a coconut mint lemonade which was not on the menu. But the server created one and delivered it to her and it was fantastic. Ask for it. ;)"}
{"text":"Food was truly amazing!! Outstanding service. Very effective kitchen crew. We are certainly coming back for sure. Authentic Colombian food! Empanadas and Picada two of  the best picks from the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Colombian food freshly prepared by warm and friendly staff! We really enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"Love the food here - empenadas are awesome!  We've eaten here a couple times for lunch and it doesn't disappoint!  Great service too."}
{"text":"Overall: 4 stars  Food: 5 stars The flavors and preparation are very close to the real thing. The quantities also feel just right - neither too much or too little and good for the pricing.  The place: 4 stars Very nice size, warmly lit, simple attractive decor.  The people: 5 stars Super nice and attentive  Overall service: 2 stars We have been here several times and the overall service has been inconsistent. We haven't had a properly orchestrated experience here yet, and our latest was really off. We received our entrees first, after we were completely done eating, our drinks came out, and then some of our appetizers after that. It feels like they were understaffed and were struggling to keep up, even though the crowd was modest in size. Please fix this before it's too late."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an excellent place to eat, this spot is great. Loved it!!!!  I like empanadas and Bandeja Paisa! You have to try them!"}
{"text":"¡Wow! Never had Columbian food, but I really liked it here. I had the coconut lemonade. It was really good. Tasted fresh and reminded me of vacations at the beach. We chicken had the empanadas; the sauces that came with them were amazing. For an entree I had the Ropa Vieja Arepas. It was huge and it was really good. I like this place and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great food and experience. Columbians this is it, the mother ship. Come here if your missing home-cooking  Really authentic Colombian food. Americans should come here for a delicious and authentic south of the border food and when I say south, I mean really south. I had the flank steak served with calentado (rice and beans dish) which is served with a fried egg, which was perfect. You get two sides and I ordered the fried plantains and salad. Both fantastic. The wait staff was on their game, responsive, quick and friendly. I'm coming back! Btw, all that for $11.95. Too stuffed to try dessert."}
{"text":"Great spot during a bike ride. We ordered the Mango smoothie which was made with all natural fruit and the Paisa salad, both were delicious!  We plan on coming back again for dinner."}
{"text":"The best because they're the only place I know of to get a good empanada in Pittsburgh. A little disappointed that I ordered side of maduros for $3 and literally got 3 plantain slices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is everything! Being from Colombia,, my wife as well, we can guarantee that this food is very authentic. The menu recently expanded from a soft menu to a full wide selection of foods! It's incredible! The service started out kinda rough as they were Sooo busy and understaffed. It's has improved night and day! My favorite is the reina pepiada arepa, arepa burger, and la bandeja paisa! OMG! Sooo good! It's the only colombina restaurant within hundreds of miles! Try it! Embrace the music, the authentic people. Working there, and the decor. For us, it brings us back to our beloved country of colombia . We've been 6 times in less than 2 months! Let's keep this place open for many years!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened up right around the school where I teach. I am so happy that this amazing food is just a block away. We were looking for a place to cater our food and blindly went in to try their food! Within seconds of tasting the food we wanted them to cater our event without even checking the prices, seriously that good. They were able to work with us on the price and it was definitely affordable. We tried both the sweet plantains and fried plantains and all of the empanadas. Everything was delicious! Thank you The Colombian Spot for our delicious catered food! Can't wait to go back in!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Happy that they have a fantastic selection of foods for both omnivorous and vegan diets. My friends and I enjoyed the empanadas, plantains, and delicious rice and bean dishes. Our waiter was very helpful/attentive and even shook my boyfriend's hand on our way out. Will definitely be back! Also love that it's byob! Can't beat the $5 corking fee for wine."}
{"text":"We tried Arepas, Empanadas, Bandeja Paisa, and fruit juices, and we LOVED IT!  They are very gentle and fun to talk to, the spot is clean and the service is fast and at a  fair price.. Recommended!  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place by accident while in the South Side, and so glad I did! Went in on a weekend evening and we were able to seat ourselves immediately. Our waiter, Ramon, was so sweet and helpful in making recommendations for us! Started with a beef empanada which was phenomenal!! For my meal I ordered the ropa vieja which is a shredded beef dish with black beans and white rice. It was delicious! I would have liked a little more seasoning in the beef but I was able to overcome that with the sauces the provided for us. He prices were reasonable and the food didn't take too long to come out. Overall, a truly authentic feel to this place which I loved. There are a few more things I would like to try so I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"What a great place! I love the laid back vibe (windows often open, seat yourself, BYOB, and sometimes live music) and of course the food! They've got classic Columbian dishes, plus meal combos where you can choose a protein and any sides of your choice. This would be very handy for the less adventurous!   The large selection of arepas is fantastic, as are the empanadas which can be ordered one by one. Also, do yourself a favor and get a side of tostones!!"}
{"text":"Being a native of Colombia, I can tell the food is authentic, tastes like home. This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great fresh made options. Empanadas are a must try and the plantains too. Really enjoyed everything we got and plan to go back to try more. Food was super fast too. The empanadas seem to be made daily since we were warned only a few of one kind were left. Ambiance inside is nice, BYOB. Get some fresh juice too."}
{"text":"Delicious Colombian food and fruit juices and excellent service!!! We ate empanadas, tostones and arepas they were very tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the ropa vieja arepa with black bean soup, and it was tasty. The meat filling in the arepa was nicely spiced and very generous, and the arepa shell held together and had a good texture. The service is seems intentionally slow to give you space, not out of neglect. The prices are fair, but this place has table service, so my lunch with a soft drink was $16, after tip."}
{"text":"What a cute place! Very warm environment...literally and figuratively. It was borderline uncomfortably warm, but nothing I couldn't handle. I ordered the Ensalada Tropical, described as Greens, Avocado, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Seasonal Fruit, Queso, etc... The good news is, the ingredients were fresh. The bad news is, the seasonal fruit was a few sliced green apples - not what I had in mind for a tropical salad. Granted, this isn't a traditional Columbian dish, but my other two guests were slightly underwhelmed with their very traditional dishes. This does NOT mean I won't go back. The staff is friendly and the menu is unique. But next time I'll try dinner instead of brunch."}
{"text":"Sometimes, a great restaurant can seem like world travel. If you enjoy adventurous eating, I recommend you head to the new Columbian Spot.  Many of you may remember their booth in the former Public Market, these are the same owners.  Because I visited on the day of the St Patrick's Day Parade, they had a limited menu, but I still got to sample many of their trademark dishes.  First, the empanadas and fantastic. Slightly different that Argentine empanadas, but remarkably delicious.  Then I tried the soup special, which is served with rice, special sauce, and a wedge of avocado.  It reminded me of a traditional Brazilian soup, again very tasty and unusual.   I ended with the Columbian Loaded Hamburger, which is much more exotic and flavorful than or traditional hamburgers.  If you are vegetarian, I highly recommend the Vegan empanadas.  I didn't have space to try the Tres Leches, but I'll be back soon because it's my all time favorite dessert.  To drink I had the Mango con leche, which was whipped light and flavorful.  My server was helpful in guiding me through the menu and was attentive. The music and ambience was authentic Columbian and rather casual and comfortable.  BYOB with a $5 corkage per table."}
{"text":"I had dinner at The Colombian Spot with my son and his girlfriend..... it was our first time there and the food was fantastic!  We shared some chicken and beef empanadas as appetizers.... delicious!  I had the Arepa Paisa with sweet plantains.  My son had the Colombian Burger and his girlfriend had the Ropa Vieja.  My son and I also had the signature beverage, Sirope.  Everything was delicious and the service was excellent.  I plan to go back soon with my wife to try other items on the menu.  I highly recommend this place for very good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really recommend the fried dumplings (tapas), and their homemade juice! In my opinion it is the best juice in Pittsburgh!! Server was very attentive and professional.  I was wondering why I didn't find this place before."}
{"text":"Finally made it down here and everything was amazing. There was so much flavor for how simple everything was. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"This place is SO reasonably priced, and the food is of incredible quality! Everything we tried was so fresh, and you can try a variety of things without breaking the bank.  The Sirope WAS good, but my friend's Mint Lemonade was just Divine! Sirope is definitely a must-try though, because it is different than what most places have to offer. It is not sickeningly sweet, but a fantastic balance of sweet and cinnamony. I love cinnamon, and this drink was a big hit as far as I'm concerned. I'll probably alternate between ordering that and the Mint Lemonade in the future.  We tried Chicken, Vegetarian, and Beef Empanadas. I love a good veggie empanada, but theirs is not filled with veggies... instead, it contains rice and beans. Still good, but I'd prefer some vegetables. The chicken was my favorite, the spices were on point, and the filling was so gooey and satisfying.  My favorite dish was an appetizer: Maduros con Tocienta y Queso. It is sweet plantains, covered in bacon and cheese. They are NOT JOKING about the cheese, which I respect deeply (cheese is serious business), and the bacon was decent size pieces, not meager little bacon bits. This is the PERFECT Sunday morning appetizer, seriously!  I have already been back, and will return many times in the future, I'm sure! Empanadas are something I can go for pretty much anytime, and trust me; The Columbian Spot's empanadas are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Did you know this is the only Colombian restaurant in OH, PA and WV? Neither did I, but it is! I'm a big fan of central/South American food and wow - did this place deliver! The fresh juices (might I recommended Pineapple/mint - so fresh) and the flavorful dishes are carefully selected and all made fresh in house. The menu isn't huge, which helps narrow down your choices for those who can't make decisions (like myself). My husband and I split an order of empanadas and then a dinner entree, which was a little light - so you may want to make sure you order enough to satiate yourself. The good news is you can always order more. The sweet plantains that come with the entrees are my favorite! Think a mix between a sweet potato and a banana. The rice and beans are delicious - and great big red beans are used. The empanadas are accompanied by your choice of three house made sauces. The house hot sauce isn't too hot but is very fresh and flavorful! The beef empanadas is what I will recommend to go along with this. The only disappointment? The arepas. My past experience with arepas were sweet corn cakes with cheese. These are hominy white corn and very dry. Maybe that's how they are supposed to taste, but they weren't very good according to this westernized palate. :(  I plan on going back soon, so I'll add more next time!"}
{"text":"A small cute stall in the Pittsburgh Public market selling tasty and authentic Colombian food at very reasonable places. I only sampled chicken and beef empanadas here, but I wish I could have tasted some of their other dishes too. I was only exploring the public market and did not have an appetite for a full course meal, but the dishes people were digging into looked really impressive.  The empanadas were $1.50 each and mid-sized but really tasty - the fingerlicking good variety. They also came in a cute little basket. Wait, it gets better...there were 4 wonderful sauces you could help  yourself to. I particularly liked the one called 'pink sauce'.  The only problem I see here is the limited amount of seating. I understand it's part of a public market, but with the great food this place serves, I'd imagine seating could soon become an issue."}
{"text":"We finally made it down here and it did not disappoint! The arepas were fantastic and not greasy in the slightest."}
{"text":"Such a great place on Carson Street! This BYOB Colombian restaurant has a good variety and tasty food. The guacamole has great flavor and is served with thin sliced fried plantains, we also ordered an arepa and had a tough decision as to which one to get. The pulled pork was delicious and was plenty enough for a full meal!  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is great! I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and authentic with plenty of vegan options. The service was good and the staff was very accommodating. The vegetarian arepas are vegan and so is the black bean soup. If you are looking for a refreshing beverage try the fresh fruit drinks! Reasonably priced and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"We decided to try The Columbian Spot based on the many positive reviews.  Being from South Florida, we've been craving some good traditional Latin food.  We went there for dinner on a Thursday evening.  Upon entering, we noticed it was fairly small.  The sign asked us to seat ourselves, so we chose a table in the center of the restaurant.  After a few minutes, the server came over with menus and took our drink order.  After viewing the menu, I noticed the dishes were sort of a combination of traditional Columbian dishes with some other \"Latin\" dishes mixed in.  The arepas and empanada dishes were all traditional, however, there were other items like Ropa Vieja (Cuban), Pernil (Puerto Rican), and black beans (red beans are traditional Colombian fare).   We decided to try the Tostones con Guacamole as an appetizer.  The flavor was good and the guac was very tasty.  I'm used to getting traditional garlic butter sauce as an accompaniment to the Tostones, so for me, they were a tad on the dry side.  However, the amount of guac was good for the price.  For our entrees, the hubby decided on the Calentado con Carne Asada.  I opted to try their \"Build Your Own Special\" and chose the top sirloin with black beans and rice.  The hubby got a decent sized steak, the fried egg on top was cooked correctly and the rice and beans had good flavor.  My steak, however, was paper thin.  It was literally thinner than a slice of roast beef at the deli counter.  Therefore, the steak was terribly over cooked and tough.  The black beans were good and I enjoyed them with the rice.  They were flavorful and were, for me, by far the best part of my meal.  In the end, the service was prompt and friendly.  The convenient location in the South Side will most likely be a draw for the local South Side crowd.  However, paying over $45 for a meal consisting of underwhelming food does not bode well for us.  We don't feel like this place is worth a second visit, so I'll just continue making my Latin favorites at home."}
{"text":"The Colombian Spot is tucked away in South Side, but a must-try restaurant in Pittsburgh. We started off with the beef empanadas. We each had one...we could have had 10 more. They were absolutely delicious - the best we've ever tasted by far. The sauces they were served with were excellent.  My husband tried one of the native dishes and loved it, while I went for a chicken arepa with avocado and mayo. It was great. So were the green plantains that came on the side.  The one note about the food was that everything needed a little bit of seasoning, but we would rather add more than have too much!   The reason for four stars? The service was slow. Like...really REALLY slow. It was after lunchtime on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't full. We didn't mind much, but other customers in the restaurant made a point to vocalize their opinions to the staff. It took us about ten minutes just to get menus once we sat down. The waiter was really nice and helpful, just clearly needed some more people working.  That being said, this girl will be back to the Colombian Spot if not just for a few more of those empanadas!"}
{"text":"Finding this ethnic vendor inside the Public Market was a delight, especially since there aren't really any other Colombian places in the city. Both the menu and seating area are quite small, which is fine since it's not a full restaurant. Their signature dish, the bandeja paisa, is a great one since it has so many different components, allowing you to try different types of food. The sausage was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor, while the egg and shredded meat complemented the rice well. The pork belly and plantains were a bit overdone, but overall still very tasty. We did not get a side arepa, but we did enjoy the soup of red beans on the side. While the dish could have been a bigger portion or a few dollars cheaper, it was good overall.  They also offer juices and drinks, both bottled and freshly made. We ordered a lulo juice, made from a citrus type of fruit. It tasted a bit different from oranges, and was very delicious."}
{"text":"I order the chicken empanadas, the guava juice and the Steelers arepa. I did not like the guava juice bc it was flavorless and it was super small for 3.50. The food overall was good but we waited 55 minutes for it to come out ! The place was not overly packed and people were even clapping when they got their food just because of how long they waited also. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great place for a Columbian meal.  We came here for lunch over Christmas week.  They were playing Star Wars which was great.  The waiter even let us choose which of the Star Wars movies we wanted to watch.  Pretty great.  The Arepa vegeteriana was awesome.  The rice and beans were flavorful and zesty.  This was the top pick.  We also had the Arepa de queso con maduros which was also good. The black bean soup was nicely flavored.    We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to say it started out on the wrong foot for me but continued to get better and better. I was very suspicious towards the end that the waiter was on to me being a yelper but I could have just been paranoid. I only took some pictures!   Anyway, we walked in and got ignored (the restaurant was decently empty). We walked towards the back to talk to the waiters who said we could sit wherever we wanted. The service was slow and I continued to be mostly ignored. The waiter was foreign and confused our order a bit but it turned out okay.   I ordered a mint lemonade which was seriously so delicious. I love mint! Very sweet but not deadly sweet. We ordered veggie empanadas to share. Very hard and crispy exterior. When I stuck my knife in, it flew off the table and onto the floor. The filling was good, but mediocre.  Then, suddenly when we wanted to order our main dishes, our waiter treated us like queens!! He gave suggestions and talked to us for a bit. We ordered Arepa de queso con maduros. It was a very bizarre dish but also quite good! The inside was cheesy and sweet. Surprisingly filling as well. It was served with huuuge plantains on the side which were salted, and that balanced the sweetness of the arepa.   Then our waiter suggested we order the Tres Leches (I will never refuse cake) and it was INCREDIBLE. Best thing I had. It was soft and when you stuck your fork in, the bottom part of the cake would literally melt into the bottom of the plate. Our waiter also gave us two small coffees to go with it; for free! I left the restaurant feeling great. I will come back and try some other things. Or at the very least just to eat that cake!!!"}
{"text":"My family of four had dinner here recently and we were all happy. This is a big deal because we have two kids who are gluten free, and one of them is picky. It helped that the fryer hadn't been contaminated so we were able to order fries (it sounds like the fryer may not always be safe, so make sure to ask). We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I'd actually learned where it was because I was doing a delivery for one of my many jobs and this food smelled SO GOOD-I had to go back and try it out.  My friend and I went down for an early dinner on a Friday night-I try to avoid being in the South Side much later on the weekends! But I didn't need to worry so much. 5 blocks down was insanity. This part of East Carson is relatively quiet in comparison. Our server was very attentive and friendly and explained the parts of each dish that we weren't familiar with very thoroughly. He was happy to sub out a different kind of meat in my friend's dish.  It's BYOB with a corkage fee of $5, so definitely reasonable. We got the Tostones con guacamole and the guac was nice and chunky-just how I like it. At our server's recommendation, we each got variations on the Ropa Vieja- shredded beef stewed in a tomato sauce with beans, rice, and plantains on the side. Delicious! It was so tender and perfectly seasoned, and--this may be my favorite part about the experience--plenty of sauces at varying levels of spice were provided to alter the dish just to your own tastes.   I can't wait to go back and try more authentic Colombian dishes. Very tasty food, good prices, and good service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I can't wait to go back. Everything is super fresh. You have to appreciate good avocados. I loved all the arepa options. Portion size is awesome for the price. Our waitress was the nicest. Overall great experience. I highly recommend the green plantain side dish with your arepa of choice. Also try all the sauces, yum!"}
{"text":"Best place for Colombian food in Pittsburgh. Im Colombian and happened to be there for work and I can tell flavors are absolutely authentic. You will be greatly surprised of how much variety and complex flavors this place can develop. It is one of the best dive-ins for colombian flavors. Ask for their specials - bandeja paisas and sancochos are the best. Arepas and Empanadas are made from scratch!!!! This places really takes colombian flavors to a different level. I met the owner-chef while i was there, really really friendly guy and will take care of you for sure!!! I can see this place really taking off in a few years!!!! If you are colombian, you will understand what im talking about, if you are not, then be prepared for one of the best creolle-culinary experiences of the northeast! Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"The arepas and maduros were fantastic! I ordered delivery from here for the first time was pleasantly surprised! The food was good and decently priced. The black bean soup was okay, but other than that, I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried empanadas, chicken with mushroom sauce, shredded beef cooked with tomatoes and peppers, black beans, salad (dressing was great!). Fried plantains were delicious.  Everything was wonderful. Cute atmosphere too. I highly recommend this place and will return soon."}
{"text":"We've been going to The Colombian Spot regularly since they opened.  We love it so much, we had our wedding reception there a couple of weeks ago.  The owner and her staff were so kind to us and worked so hard to make the party exactly what we wanted.  The food was fantastic and our guests raved about how good it was!  My husband is Cuban, so we enjoy the authentic cuisine The Colombian Spot serves. A must try!!! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Super authentic. I had an arepa rips viaja and it was amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"A cute Southside spot for Colombian food. I haven't had Colombian food before so I have nothing to compare it to. The fried green plantains are moreish! The meat is well done too."}
{"text":"I love this place! Been visiting from out of town and this is my second day in a row that I've been here! Ssshhhh.... lol   Empanadas are a MUST! Love the chicken one best so far and service is excellent. A MUST try! ;)"}
{"text":"Glad to see they reopened after the public market closed. Love the soup and empanadas."}
{"text":"I love this place - the food is good and the people are nice. Definitely try the sirape!"}
{"text":"WOWZA!!!!  We tried this place for lunch. I ordered a mango juice with water as the base. (You can also get milk as the base). It was delicious!!!!  Even if you don't get mango, you should still get some type of fruit juice.  After hearing the daily special, I ordered it. It was a Colombian version of chicken soup. It came with big hunks of tender white meat chicken, potatoes, and corn. Then they brought you a small plate that had rice, fresh avocado slices, a white sauce, and capers. I dumped it all in. Holy Cow!  This is chicken soup on crack!!  The avocado and white sauce made the broth like velvet. The capers brought some brightness. I would have never thought to put avocados or capers in chicken soup but now I will! I ate every drop of that soup. I was too full for dessert.  I will be heading back soon to try their empanadas!!"}
{"text":"Empanadas and Arepas. Fresh coffee and fresh juices. A clean restaurant and great service.  The Columbian Spot is a spot you'll find me for any of those reasons.   Their juices with a milk base or water base are delicious and their lemonades are not overly sweet and very refreshing. Their empanadas are crispy on the outside and deliciously seasoned on the inside. Really a perfect appetizer or lunch if your heart desires.  Their arepas and plantains are just as good and delicious and worth every bite. I recommend getting a side salad or guac to get some greens in, just because Columbian food is pretty focused on meat and starches- Other than that, worth the time and money for certain."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more than 3 stars. I read great reviews and the authenticity of the menu was intriguing. When I arrived, the ambiance seemed cliche and It was not what I was expecting. I ordered a salad with chicken and it was really average but still tasty. We ate dinner around 8pm which is an average time for southside restaurants and it was very empty. There were a lot of screaming children present during my stay so my experience may have been skewed. Our waitress was wonderful and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the much anticipated Colombian restaurant in Pittsburg. Authentic, well made, awesome flavor, Colombian food. Kids friendly, veggie and gluten free options available."}
{"text":"Cute little authentic Colombian spot in the South Side. Service was quick and staff was very friendly. Ordered the vegetarian Arepas Rellenas and wasn't too impressed with the actual arepas--the dough seemed a little dry, but maybe that's the way it should be. It was very simple, just stuffed with rice and beans. However my side of the sweet plantains was the highlight of my meal, cooked to perfection, so sweet and a very generous portion as my side. My boyfriend ordered a meat stuffed arepas and thought the same thing about his, however his side of fries were pretty delicious. We started with the guacamole which was great, served with fried green plantains--they were so big, but were just a bit too salty. Would definitely go back and like to try something other than the Arepas Rellenas."}
{"text":"Great empanadas and arepas. They have gluten free and vegan options. The kids loved it so much we go to- go bags with more empanadas."}
{"text":"I tend to gravitate towards latin restaurants in any town that I am in and was very surprised to see a solely Colombian restaurant in Pittsburgh. I ordered the mora juice (andean blackberry) and it was true mora juice. I knew that this was a good start. The bandeja paisa was perfection as well, just the way it should be. I am very pleased with the authenticity of the food items I tried, will definitely find my way back."}
{"text":"Great place for some amazing Colombian Food!   I ordered one beef empanada as an appetizer, followed by the Steel City Arepa as my meal, with a side of sweet plantains. Everything was delicious!   Great portion, for a great price.  Nice addition to South Side eateries."}
{"text":"We took a bike ride to the Colombian Spot in the south side after seeing the reviews on yelp. I was very satisfied with all aspects of the meal. The service was prompt, friendly, and attentive. We ordered the milk based mango drink, which was creamy and sweet. I definitely recommend trying one of their five flavored milk drinks. I ordered the Ropa Vieja arepa with shredded beef in a stewed tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It was tender, juicy, and flavorful. It didn't even need the vinegar based hot sauce and cilantro aioli that he brought out to us, but the they were too good not to use. The plantains were a good sweet addition to the arepa.   I ordered the side salad to go with my arepa. The dressing was lacking flavor so I slyly squirted some of the free dressing I got from the regatta on it, which made it better. I think the dressing would be fine with some more vinegar. The fries were good though.   I am excited to go back and try some of the other menu items! I recommend picking up a six pack at the Carson st deli since it's a BYOB."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. i pretty much eat here at least twice a week. Their empanadas are so good."}
{"text":"Great to have some Colombian cuisine in Pittsburgh, just for diversity's sake. Had two meals and an appetizer, all very good! Love the BYOB places too! All of the waitresses seemed to be very pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"Excellent empanadas and fruit juices.  La bandeja paisa was awesome.  Definitely going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Colombian food. It's like home to me. Anyway, when I head that a Colombian stand was opening at Pittsburgh Market, I knew I had to try it out.  First off, their menu is slightly limited due to the size of their small kitchen. They mainly offer empanadas (beef, pork, chicken and vegetarian), juices made Colombian style with a variety of tropical fruits (you can mix it up with either water or milk), and stuffed arepas with a variety of protein or a vegetarian option.  Anyway, we came in on the weekend due to their special which was beef sancocho, which is a typically a beef or chicken based soup with plantains, yuca, and potatoes, in addition to some other yummy stuff. My husband opted for the bandeja paisa, which has ground beef, sweet plantains, home made porkrinds, rice, avocado, and an egg on top all accompanied with a side of bean.    After making our order, the soup came right away. We were both ravenous so we ate it not knowing that a side of rice, plantains and avocado came with it (they didn't tell us) and it was brought in about 5 min after the soup.   Then the bandeja paisa came in so we shared that as well. We did notice the beans were missing, but hoped they would bring them as they had premade a lot of the food and were heating it up in the microwave.  We actually had to go up to them to remind them of our beans, and an empanada that we had also ordered.   I will say I loved the food, but the timing was a little off. I wish there was more communication on their part in terms of what goes with the special, before we gobble everything up. I do get the fact that this place had opened 2 weeks ago and they are probably getting used to working out the kinks. Which is why I didn't take off more stars. Timing can be a big deal.   If you haven't checked this place out, do yourself a favor and try it out. It's really tasty!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful! We tried several items, including the arepas, guacamole and plantains, tres leches and coffee, paisa. Everything was seasoned well, the food was awesome, they have amazing fresh mint drinks, and it's reasonably priced. Also has a lot of gluten free options! We will be back often!!"}
{"text":"This was so delicious!! The frozen lemonade was a real treat, I loved that they had a mint lemonade. I had an are papa stuffed with cheese, sweet plantains, and I tried an areppa covered in chorizo and beef; both were fantastic! The restaurant had a great atmosphere, too, with cool decorations and good customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch since I never ate here at the Pittsburgh Public market. Their specialties are arepas with different fillings and a Columbian beverage called Sirope. I wasn't sure I was going to like the Sirope since it is made from sugar cane pulp but it wasn't overbearingly sweet. I really liked it.  My waitress helped explain the various items on the menu and was attentive to my needs.  In addition to their specialty juices they  serve soft drinks and Columbian coffee or hot tea. I ordered the chicken arepas with avocado and a side of sweet plantains. The meal was very good and very filling. Prices are reasonable so unless you have a big appetite one arepa would be sufficient. You get a choice of side with it anyway.   Everything is made fresh to order and my waitress brought me condiments to go with it but I thought my arepa was just right without having to add more to it.   The place is very small with a bar in the back. Restrooms are down a flight of stairs. The Columbian decor is very nice and this place is definitely a must return for me. It is located in the 21st block in Southside."}
{"text":"I have been looking for Colombian empanadas for months now and I have finally found them! This restaurant is great! The atmosphere inside is very authentic. The empanadas are delicious! Our waiter was very attentive and gave us suggestions on ordering. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that they surprisingly did not have a side of rice and beans. While they did have Arepas, empanadas and their traditional Bandeja Paisa, I wish they had the option of just chicken, rice and beans, and maybe guacamole? I ordered the Arepa as well and it was delicious! Just wish there was more of selection of simple dishes with a Hispanic twist. The place is also BYOB. While I personally didn't bring anything to drink, there is a beer store across the street and saw other customers with their own drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You know when you have a meal that you think about for days after? The meal that was so tasty that you can't stop thinking about every single delicious bite? That meal can be found here!  I am kicking myself for not coming in sooner. So many incredible meals I missed. But now I know better and will be stopping in on a regular basis. It's a cute set-up with a casual atmosphere.   I honestly am not too familiar with Columbian food, but you know you can trust this place because the couple who own the spot are both from there. I ordered the Colentado con Carna Asada. It's grilled sirloin with rice, beans and a fried egg on top. The owner told me it's actually a traditional breakfast meal. I'd have this meal any time of the day though!  Everything had so much flavor, I was floored. The extra bonus is the four sauces that are served to compliment the meal. I couldn't tell you what each was, but seriously, each one was incredibly flavorful. The great thing too is 95% of the menu is gluten free!  You need to get here ASAP, no more waiting! Plus, bring your fave bottle of vino because it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced food with very hospital and polite staff! While they didn't get all the orders right the first time, I am not taking off a star because we were a large group (20+), and they were quick to correct everything. Will definitely be coming back next time I am in PGH!"}
{"text":"I was just in Medellín Colombia a couple weeks ago and can honestly say the food here is amazing and authentic tasting. I fell in love with Colombian food while visiting there and when I was in Pittsburgh for business and found this place, I was excited and ordered via Uber Eats. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"It's great that Pittsburgh has authentic arepas and other Colombian fare to nosh. The cornmeal based arepas can be eaten as-is or stuffed with a variety of savory fillings. And their tostones are larger than life and dangerously delicious -- don't leave without trying these. I opted for the mainstream ropa vieja; while not that appealing to the eye, it's bursting with flavor. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of black bean side dishes, but their version I found surprisingly good. The space is airy and welcoming; the decor while traditional, brightened up the space. Service was relatively fast and efficient, but could use some more polish. All in all, I hope The Colombian Spot makes a good run in the \"Sahside\" as you can never have enough international options when it comes to food in this town!"}
{"text":"Great first time experience! Had a beef empanada and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked perfectly. It's a must try, next time I'll try all the other types they offer. Tried the arepa mixta which had chicken, chorizo and pork and let me say it was superb, very tasty although a little dry but hey have some very nice hot sauce and garlic sauce that I put on it and it made it even better. The arepa was a nice size and not at all expensive. Also tried the salad they had there with fresh avacado, queso fresco, tomatoes, cucumber with a super tasty avocado dressing. Great juice drinks there as welll. Staff was very cordial and helped explain all the foods I'd never tried before. Definitely give this place a shot"}
{"text":"CAN'T WAIT for the south side location to open. The Colombian Spot makes amazing dishes and it feels so nice to eat food from home without having to hop on a plane."}
