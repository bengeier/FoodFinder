{"text":"The ????? & ????? are to die for. Definitely a true taste of Taiwan."}
{"text":"Food was ok.   Winter melon tea - Good..  Pop corn chicken combo - Fruit (Orange) was v sour and inedible. Side veggies was average. The Taiwanese take out / 3 tables beside Asian legend over at century plaza was way better.  Beef noodle soup Bland. PaPa chang is better. I've lived in Taiwan for many years and know how good beef noodle should taste like.  Hot Grass jelly with yam balls okay - kinda expensive for 5.50.  Service was ok.  Table arrangement at the center of the restaurant was weird on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this restaurant with my family a month ago but the wait was over an hour.  Is this restaurant really THAT good!?  I finally got a chance to eat at this place yesterday for lunch.  No wait and ample seating (hype is over?)  Like many mentioned, it's a snack/noodle bar.  We ordered two apps, the popcorn chicken, beef tendon, fries in plum powder, minced pork on rice, and the meat wrapped in a pancake.  The only dishes that were tasty and hot were the chicken and the fries, everything else was so-so (nothing to really go back for).  I guessed I missed why this place is so popular.  If I wanted stinky tofu, there's an excellent noodle shop at FMP, and if i wanted fried chicken, there's always Korean.F.C."}
{"text":"Another first time for me. I was intending to head to Saigon Star for lunch but by chance my parking spot lands me right in front of Mama Bear. My friends and I take a peak in and it was pretty busy and since we have never been here, why not.  We get an assortment of appetizers. Pickled cabbage, stinky tofu, sticky rice, tripe, and tea eggs. All well seasoned and well prepared. I end up getting the beef and tendon noodle soup. Excellent broth, great flavour not over seasoned or too oily. The beef was tender and the tendon was melt in your mouth goodness.   The service was a tad slow for an Asian restaurant but it was quite busy so I guess I can't fault them for that. There were quite a few things on the menu. So I will be back to try some more.  Excellent find, who knew a parking spot would be so important?  Lol."}
{"text":"I always order their crispy chicken combo. It comes with three side orders, soup, rice and orange as dessert. I also like their Taiwanese taro and yam balls sweet dessert. Their customer service is fast too"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch with a friend on the weekend. I arrived just before noon so didn't need to wait for a seat. I do suggest arriving early as the place gets filled up very quickly.   Looked like they were short staffed that day as it took a long while to place our order and for our food to arrive. The food was average but price is pretty decent, we ordered the pan fried dumplings ~$7 and the popcorn chicken lunch special ~$9.   There are many places nearby on hwy 7 that serves several food choices and would recommend trying those out instead."}
{"text":"Food- it was good.  Nothing that I would remember to order again though. \"The stinky tofu is OK. Better than downtown, by not as good as taiwan\". --- as per a Taiwanese immigrant.  I'm still here eating and trying to find something to criticise.... I don't have much.  Overall, good, but nothing I will crave."}
{"text":"I don't think that popcorn chicken is good, it is just so so. In fact other dishes I tried just so so 2"}
{"text":"This place really need to consider opening for lunch and not just for 5 hours a day (5pm to 10pm), this kind of restaurant just can't do 5pm - 10pm, so restricted!  Had the beef noodle soup, not as good as Papa Chang's as this one needs more flavor in the soup, maybe it was just that day, will try again to reconfirm it was just an isolated failure. Well not really a failure, everything else was good except the soup base.  Popcorn chicken passed but also not as good as Papa Chang's.  Basil chicken (3-cup chicken) was awesome and this one trumps Papa Chang's."}
{"text":"First of all, I really like this cozy place.  :)   Word of advice to diners who hate line ups, go on a weekday.  I was there on Thursday with two other friends and we were quickly shown a table by our waitress.  No crazy line ups involved then.  (Although if there were line ups, wouldn't that show something about the place must be worth it?)   Food 4.5/5  I have an issue with MSG, and was gracefully informed by the waitress that the restaurant doesn't use MSG.  Two thumbs up, because you certainly can't say that about \"the Taiwanese take out / 3 tables beside Asian legend over at century plaza\" / Tai Ping Hsiang ???.  I also told the waitress that I didn't want green onions, cilantro, garlic, onions, spice, and if the dish were spicy to tone down the spice, and they've got my order right!  That also shows the food is actually made when ordered, and haven't been sitting in the kitchen for hours.  Overall, the food's authentic Taiwanese, BUT not as intensely flavored as the one's you'd find in a traditional night market stall.  The place's still worth visiting though.  :)   Service 5/5  Most Chinese servers rush you or kind of stare at you with exasperation when you're being overwhelmed by choices and need to ask them a lot of questions.  Our waitress was super smiley and patient, and the kitchen very accommodating to my special, no-spice requests.  :)    One thing very worth mentioning.  A friend was mumbling to me that her pork with bamboo shoots was too fatty and that the portion was smaller than she expected.  When we told our waitress, she gracefully asked the kitchen to change it for my friend, no questions asked.  And when we ordered just one bowl of dessert after our delicious meal, seeing that we had a party of three, our waitress actually said she made the singer portion bigger, because a lot of diners were surprised by the size.  She said the staff get to eat the unsold portions of the dessert, so it's okaaayyy to give us more under the circumstances.  That's super sweet, and considerate don't you think!?     So yeah, I hope this new Taiwanese restaurant continues be as good as it is the next time I visit, and that it'll grow with more positive reviews."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and is the best Taiwanese food joint in toronto in my opinion. The minced pork rice, popcorn chicken, stinky tofu are all pretty good. Although not exactly up to par with the nightmarket food in Taiwan, mama bear is a very good option for Taiwanese food in Toronto. I've been to papa changs numerous times as well but the closer proximity, ample seating gives mama bear the edge."}
{"text":"This place have done its job representing Taiwanese food and snacks! There plenty options to keep you coming back for more, the portion size is generous, they priced their food fairly. Definitely will go back for more."}
{"text":"The first time I visited was back in Jan. 2015 on a weekend for dinner and there was a huge line up and the dishes were a hit or a miss, and the restaurant really smelled like stinky tofu.  I visited again in Feb. 2016 on a Fri. Night and was happy to see that the restaurant is still busy but no line ups. The restaurant still had a faint stinky tofu but it wasn't as strong.   The decor is pretty with flower accents on their lamps and booths.   We ordered similar dishes to our first visit and thought the food tasted better. I ordered the large beef/beef tendon noodle soup. Their noodle texture has a good bounce to it and the beef is tender.   The pan fried dumplings were only $6.99 for 12 and  had a good sear on them.  The beef pancake was food but pretty standard to other similar restaurants.   ...and of course, ordering the stinky tofu is a must!!  It comes with pickled cabbage.   Overall, It's a comfortable sit-down restaurant for great Taiwanese food. Do expect coming out of the restaurant smelling a bit like stinky tofu.  I'll definitely be back!  There were only 2 servers at the time but they were pretty attentive."}
{"text":"We had to wait 30 minutes but they were quick to clean tables and call out numbers. It's a small place and a lot of people were waiting outside and inside. I was quite glad we waited though! This was the first time I came here and I must admit, I lost a bit of self control. We ordered so much. Everything tasted good and I ate myself to the point where I felt sick afterwards because I just couldn't stop. Plus, the portion were generous for their price and free wifi!  The stinky tofu is almost at the standard you'd find at Night It Up. Not as bad perhaps but kind of weak, in my opinion. I think it might be to not deter the non-lovers away from the restaurant but the majority of everyone ordered it so the place had a faint smell throughout.  We ordered a popcorn chicken meal for my brother and it came almost 50 minutes into our meal. Luckily, my brother wasn't too hungry and we had a lot of other dishes to take care of. I think they forgot about it.   Wintermelon tea is one of my absolute favourite drinks in the world and needless to say, I ordered it ($1.50). It tasted a bit more herbal and tea-like than the usual sugar overload you might find in other places. Unfortunately, I found a tiny dead fly halfway through my drink... My mom went cray, but the manager handled it very graciously. I know it wasn't their fault, but they gave the drink to us on the house and 10% off. She even offered to make me a new one but my mom flat out refused. I felt bad, but at least you know they're kind people! (Don't take advantage of this, please!)  The entire staff was coming out to eat by the time we were done. Everyone smiled and nodded to us when we got up to leave, which was a nice depart from the lack of attention once you've paid that you sometimes get in Asian restaurants. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We just discovered this place not long ago. Didn't realize how packed it gets. It opens at 5 and the house is full by 6pm. Wait time is about 20-30 mins.   If you're missing Taiwanese food like myself, this place gives you a great variety off of bento boxes. The flavour is one of the most authentic in  Toronto.   We ordered:  beef noodles - pretty good,  mild flavour  fried pork chop noodles - soup has no flavour, pork chop was good  salt pepper chicken - not the best we had in Toronto but pretty good   braised pork.with bamboo  bento - our favourite, the bamboo shoots go really well with the pork. The pork is not too fatty. Flavour is good. Side dishes on the bento was good too.   Overall, will go back but not sure if it's worth the wait after 6. We'd rather just go to tai ping hsiang for bento. Portions are small here which lets you order more."}
{"text":"I ordered fried pig rib combo and my husband  ordered chicken combo, they are delicious. Many Taiwanese restaurants here have adjusted their flavour, I think this one is very authentic, although we never been to Taiwan before, dishes are a bit sweet."}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm giving it 5 stars because I haven't had Taiwanese food in so long, but I was really happy with this place. As soon as we walked in the restaurant I noticed it's really clean and staff was friendly and attentive. There weren't that many people inside but maybe it was the weird timing.  Service was close to excellent, not fake or pretentious , but genuinely nice.   There were so many food options on the menu. Wanted to try everything! Anyways, we were 4 people, ordered a whole bunch of side dishes to try. Food timing was perfect! Impressions: Sweet fries with plum sauce: 3/5 Can't say much but they didn't even look like sweet potatoes Popcorn chicken 5/5 That was soooo good! I'd go again just to order it again Pancake with egg and pork: 4/5  Fried dumplings 4.5/5 my friend loved them. Can't say I know much about dumplings but there's not much where you can go wrong with them(oh but I've tried pretty crappy ones before). Beef noodle soup 4/5 Beef was really good. Noodles a bit thick. Broth was tasty!   Price was quite good for everything we've got. I'd definitely consider going again!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taiwanese restaurant!    The staff is quite friendly and the variety in the menu far exceeds what I expected for a small restaurant tucked away on the side of an otherwise busy plaza.    They have meals (dish/rice/soup/veggie combo), noodles, tons of appetizer options, and some soupy noodles which they serve on a little hotpot.  There are a few variety of stinky tofu - the regular fried ones and another kind in numbing spicy broth.  Overall, there's usually a bit of wait time here (usually about 10-15 mins) but the atmosphere is warm and homey.  I'd say it's maybe slightly more pricey than Papa Chang (though not by much) but the variety of dishes definitely makes me a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Had the beef soup #101 on menu.  Cucumber salad was really good.  The pork special combo dinner was really good.  The pork was melt in your mouth soft!  Service very good and made us feel welcome as it was our first time at this restaurant.  I would recommend and would go again.  The only negative is if you are highly sensitive to the smell of stinky tofu!  You get used to it after a minute or two!"}
{"text":"Went at 11:30 am on a Saturday to avoid the busy wait advised by former reviews. No wait line at all, was greet as soon as we arrived. Ordered the Popcorn Chicken combo, Minced Pork Rice, Dumplings, Tofu, and Pork Belly Bao. $44 fed four people, pretty decent for the level of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Taiwanese food and this place was definitely a must try for it. The wait was for about 30 mins but it was worth it.  If you have never tried deep Fred S smelly tofu before then you should give it a try if you think your nose can take it. It truly is stinky.  If you can get past the smell then you get to taste the fried tofu.  It's really nothing more than fried tofu.  I experienced it and don't think I would order it again.  The salt and pepper cuttlefish balls was excellent.  Then we had the Taiwanese style stir fried rice noodles which was really good.  To top it off we also ordered the Honey Lemon Wild Spikenard drink.  It was definitely a very refreshing drink.  The seeds were a little slimy but it didn't bother me too much.  I really liked it.  I would definitely come back here to try their other items on their menu."}
{"text":"STINKY TOFU!!...this place has the best stingy tofu that i had tried in Markham/Toronto..in comparison to Mei Nung noodle...Wei kitchen...it is crispy..stingy but not too crazy...i love the Taiwanese pickled cabbage that go with it  Beef noodle soup..i would say beef noodle from Mei Hung is better...but it is not bad..it has its herbal taste in the soup base..  the lunch box..we ordered fried pork chop lunch combo...the fried pork chop is good but the amount of meat we got was relatively small..  we also ordered Taiwanese popcorn chicken..it is GOOD!!!...the chicken is juicy..and flavorful..  I would definitely come back again for its stinky tofu and popcorn chicken!.."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork hand with braised in coke and man was that thing good. I also had the beef brisket noodle soup and it wasn't the same as I'm use to but I'm sure that this is more authentic. This place does sell Stinky tofu if you are up for it. Great place but next time I need to bring a Taiwanese friend to help me some authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the store did not smell a lot like smelly tofu! I came for the smelly tofu. I'll review that a bit after but starting with atmosphere. Its almost always packed in the evening. The place wasn't too loud. Sometimes it was hard to get a servers attention as it was packed. The hostess/server looked a bit lost at times but I guess that was due to the heavy crowd.  The set combos are definitely worth it. Three side dishes, main dish, soup, rice and fruit for about 10$. My companion and I shared that along with smelly tofu and I believe its called a green onion pancake roll with beef inside. I love eating this dish (in general) and just know what its called in Chinese haha. The beef onion pancake was a bit more salty than I expected. Usually I eat it from other places with more of a sweet sauce. So it was just OKAY. A bit too salty for my liking.  We ordered the popcorn chicken combo and that was delicious. The smelly tofu was alright. It wasn't as savoury as I expected. I was expecting more of a \"smelly tofu\" aroma when biting into it. So it was kind of lacking the aroma.  Overall, it was a good experience, will definitely go back still :) prices were pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a new go to fav of mine. Grew up with authentic Taiwanese cuisine and always found it hard to find it in the GTA.   Dishes are less than $10 and portions are just right. Recommend the bitter melon pork rib soup and fried pork intestines.   Quite a few of their dishes literally reminded me of my moms home cooking (very big compliment as my mother is an amazing chef!)  Service is great I went once weekday lunch and another time weekend lunch. Service was consistent and attentive."}
{"text":"If you are craving for a Taiwanese style meal then this place is definitely a place to check out. Compared to many Taiwanese restaurants in Toronto, this one is closest to actual meals found in Taiwan (I am not Taiwanese however I do come here with my Taiwanese friends who grew up there). The food taste great however I must warn those, who are sensitive to stinky tofu, that this place does strongly smell of stinky tofu. I personally have a sensitive nose so it was, at first, very difficult to enjoy my meal with stinky tofu at the table next to mine.  Other than that, the service was great. I believe the manager herself came out to thoroughly explain to me and my non Taiwanese friends about their menu and which are more popular.  As for the interior, it was kept decently clean and very casual."}
{"text":"Service Somethings needs to be said for small restaurants; the staff are usually friendlier and service is probably faster. This is what one would experience at Mama Bear. The restaurant can house maybe 15 tables but food comes out relatively quick and you can feel the warmth of each waiter/waitress. We were seated in the middle section (which did not give us much space) and were offered the booth area once a family left. That to me is superior service - they could have offered it to the next group (which could be a family of 3) instead of us (party of 2). Anyhow the staff also refilled our tea without being asked and even left us the tea pot afterwards. That is one thing about Asian restaurants that I like - just give us the damn bottle/jug and we will do it ourselves.  Location Parking is a bitch, no doubt. You better come early.  Food This place is catered towards young adults to teenagers but they offer some unique Taiwanese food. I saw the oyster pancake which is apparently quite popular in Taiwanese Food Festivals. Prices for entrees hover around$8-11 which is fair, appetizers are like $4-9. Frankly speaking, an appetizer is not required for a party of 2 because I felt quite full afterwards. Food is quite average but the noodles are a must try. Let me go through the details.  Deep fried pork chop with noodle The meat is good (crunchy outside) because it's not too salty. Now the soup base is rather weak but the two complements each other.  Beef with thin noodle You actually get to choose between different noodle types but I like it thin baby. The soup base is strong and tasty (good in my standards). The noodles are slurpy delicious but the meat is a big fat fail. I've never had beef fail so bad that I stopped eating it halfway. You almost got it MAMA bear..no not really actually lol.  Scallion pancake (pictured at half the quantity - we ate the rest) Though this appetizer isn't bad, it is nowhere amazing (taste is forgettable and those sesame seeds are not necessary lol). I've had better in places like the dumpling house.  To put this restaurant into perspective, it is perfect for those who are on a budget and want \"okay\" food. It really is nice to eat here because the staff are friendly. They are accommodating and will take the time to go over the menu (girl tried to describe the different noodle types). I see that the restaurant puts a lot of effort and heart into their job and it is something rare in today's generation. I wish to see more improvement in this restaurant (specifically the food aspect) because they have the energy to drive it high."}
{"text":"This spot is two blocks from my friend's place and is likely going to be our new hangout. I loved EVERYTHING here.   The ambiance is comfortable and clean, the service is super friendly (Mandarin and English only) and the food blew me away.   He picked two dishes and I picked two.   Taiwanese cold noodles: peanutty, refreshing and savoury. I generally don't like cold noodles, but I might have to figure out this recipe for my next picnic  Century year old egg with tofu: sooo tasty. The tofu was silky, the sauce was savoury and I just love these eggs. The bonito flakes were a fantastic touch  Spicy beef noodles with beef tendon: the subject of my obsession, I could eat this every day. We got the thick noodles, which had the perfect bite. Beef was good, soup was good, tendon was soft. Perfect.   Fried dumplings: so good!! Perfectly cooked, juicy filling and the pastry was just right.   The damage was about $30, not bad considering we had enough for two lunches the next day.   I am going back soon, and I'm taking my incredibly picky family with me!"}
{"text":"You've come to the right place if you are looking to try some delicious taiwanese cuisine! They have a wide selection of traditional taiwanese dishes and street snacks. You can get a set meal that includes an entree, rice, 3 side dishes, sliced oranges, and a drink, for $11. The service here is also better than average. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my parents recently.  I love Taiwanese popcorn chicken and it was great here!  However, other stuff wasn't so great.  I had the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken box lunch ($11.99).  My parents shared the Beef Shank and Pork Intestines appetizer ($8.99) and a Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken box lunch.  The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken box lunch came with a wintermelon tea and the tea was so tasty.  It was cold and refreshing.  It was slightly sweet but not overly so.  The box lunch came with 3 side dishes that change daily, rice, miso soup and orange wedges, as well as popcorn chicken.  That day the side dishes were stir-fried broccoli and cauliflower, stir-fried eggplant, and cold vermicelli noodles with bean sprouts, carrots and cilantro.  The popcorn chicken was excellent.  The outside was dry and crispy yet the inside was moist and juicy.  It wasn't too salty or too peppery.  One of the best popcorn chickens I've had.  The broccoli and cauliflower was in an interesting translucent white sauce.  It was a little bit sweet.  I wasn't thrilled about it, but it was edible.  I didn't like that the vermicelli was cold.  The taste was also a bit off.  A bit too sour for my liking.  The rice was great.  It was slightly sticky, but still fluffy, if that makes any sense.  Orange wedges were juicy and sweet.  I gave my dad my miso soup and eggplant, since I'm not a huge fan of either.    My parents enjoyed everything except for the pork intestines.  They said that it smelled weird.  I didn't try any because I don't like organ meats.  I tried some of the beef shank and it was cold and bland.  Now we were seated at the front of the restaurant in a booth, which was great and everything was fine.  However, after our meal I went to the back of the restaurant to use the washroom.  As I approached the back, which is also where the kitchen is, I was overwhelmed by this odour that I found very offensive and it made me literally nauseous.  I quickly realized that it was the smell of that special kind of fermented tofu called \"stinky tofu\" which is one of their specialties.  If I was seated towards the back the restaurant near the kitchen, I would have had to leave.  I mean no offense to those who love \"stinky tofu\", but it is not for me at all.  So just be warned if you do not like the smell of  \"stinky tofu\" make sure you don't sit near the kitchen.    Service was very friendly and nice.  I like how they do a print out receipt of what you ordered and put it at your table as soon as you've placed your order (it's just the items, no prices, so you won't mistaken it for the bill).  So if you've stated any allergies or dietary restrictions they are printed right there, and you can also verify that the kitchen has your order correct.      This restaurant is in a very busy strip mall.  While there is free parking, the parking lot is rather crowded and it may be difficult to find a spot."}
{"text":"Being from Taiwan, I love going to Taiwanese restaurants. I haven't been able to find an amazing restaurant like Taiwan, but this place comes really close.   Looking at the decor, there really isn't anything special to write about. small, nice and clean, this place looks like any other typical restaurant.   The service isn't something special to write home about. I couldn't give it a good review, but it wasn't that bad either. I can say that the feeling was blah....  Finally, there was the food. Now this place has some of the best (authentic) Taiwanese foods that I have had in Canada. Keep in mind that you can never compare to Taiwan, but as far as taste is concerned, it is pretty good. We got the smelly hot pot. Not a fan in Taiwan, so wasn't going to be a fan here, but it tasted really authentic. The Taiwanese Oden was amazing. I loved the sauce and the actual fish cakes.   Overall, it was a good experience and highly recommended for everyone. Just hold your nose if you get the smelly hot pot and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Decent Taiwanese restaurant! I really love their popcorn chicken - probably one of the best I've had! I also got the beef noodles which was okay for me. I think their broth flavours had some Chinese herbs in it (which was stated in the menu) that just wasn't for my personal preference. My boyfriend got a fried noodles dish that I really liked! I feel like the menu items are more authentic and have more variety than other Taiwanese restaurants that I have been to. I am definitely excited to try out their combos (seem like pretty good deal with dessert and drink) next time around! I also really liked their music choices as well :) happened to be playing the songs of my favourite Cantonese singer, Eason! Good service and cozy atmosphere. Definitely recommend Mama Bear if you're in the area and craving for Taiwanese food!"}
{"text":"I really like this place even though the smell when you first walk in is a bit of a surprise (not a good one), the food was delicious. Was able to order and try food that are normally not found in other restaurants. I love their pork hock and deep fried intestines. The pork hock is great with the sticky rice.   Will definitely come here again to try other good stuff."}
{"text":"Bland. Everything was bland. Had the TW popcorn chicken combo and everything including the side dishes were bland. Would maybe return to try some of the noodle dishes but based on previous reviews, a similar result would likely occur."}
{"text":"Excellent service ! Awesome popcorn chicken , great batter  Disappointed in smelly tofu, no chilly sauce but otherwise it was good ! My boyfriend loved the deep fried pork belly."}
{"text":"Good good stuff! The service is friendly and attentive. The food came out quickly. I can't remember the names of the items now but I'll do my best to describe them.   The rolled pork floss egg thing in the green onion type paratha/pancake thing was very tasty. Not too salty, simple.   The pork belly bao was good. I like the peanuts on top. But the other people I were with were not a fan, expensive compared to other places with similar items.   Popcorn chicken with basil was fantastic. Good seasoning, fried to perfection. What else is there to say?   Cold Taiwanese noodles were great, would prefer a little more spice but I would get it again.   Braised Beef noodles were disappointing. Maybe because I've been to a beef noodle house that specializes only in that dish. The broth was bland, but the beef was fine.   I cannot remember the vegetables I ordered but I remember it tasted really good.   The strawberry shaved ice dessert was essentially a strawberry sundae with shaved ice and sweetened condensed milk. I liked it!"}
{"text":"Mamabear offers a fairly extensive selection of Taiwanese dishes and because my exposure to this kind of cuisine has been pretty limited, I can't comment much on the authenticity (it seems pretty legit though). It's a small restaurant with modest decor and yes, a very strong stinky tofu smell that will hit you immediately. So brace yourselves!  I've talked about visiting this restaurant for awhile now so I was pretty excited to finally give it a try. The restaurant wasn't too busy when we popped in on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm with only a few tables occupied. We ordered:  Pork Hamburger - One of the better items. Pork belly was tender and soft. Together with the peanuts, pickled cucumbers and the sweet bun, you have a solid bao. 4/5  Honeycomb Tripe & Beef Tendon w/ Thin Noodle - I really liked the honeycomb tripe which was a bit chewy but good. The noodles didn't seem very fresh but passable. And they were pretty damn thick for thin noodles....not sure how thick the actual thick noodles are like then. The biggest quibble I had was the broth which tasted like a ton of mixed herbs. It seemed out of place and didn't complement the rest of the dish very well in my opinion. 2.5/5   Popcorn Chicken Rice Combo - This comes with 3 side dishes (tomatoes and tofu, glass noodles and broccoli), soup, fruits (oranges) and a Wintermelon tea served bento box style. Portions are very decent as a substantial amount of popcorn chicken was given. The popcorn chicken had a light batter and was very fluffy but way too bland. It definitely needs some salt. However, I did enjoy my Wintermelon drink which tasted pure and refreshing at first but eventually got too sweet. 3/5      It didn't quite live up to my expectations and I didn't think $32 after tax was worth it. Overall, just OK. Perhaps it's a personal preference and maybe Taiwanese food just isn't my thing but nothing really wow'd me or made me want to come back and try again."}
{"text":"When I walk in to this restaurant I didn't feel well because of the smell. After 10 minute later I was fine. I order the stinky tofu and it really stink. The rest of the dish was actually pretty good. The service was good. If you like stinky tofu you will like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner today, had intestine vermicelli and stinky tofu, both were just OK, for a place that many claim to offer authentic Taiwanese food. It's not bad but not amazing either."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to a restaurant that has accurate ratings on Yelp. The food here brings me back to when I worked in Taiwan a few years ago.   First of all, let me warn you that the smell of stinky tofu is very overpowering. When I first walked in there, it smelt like a breeze of bad breath was taking over my senses. Gross. But you will get use to it.   We ordered... - Taiwanese cold noodle. Very authentic and tasty. My favourite. 4/5 - Beef thin noodle. I usually have this at Asian legend but this was wayyyy better! 4/5 - Taiwanese Pork Hamburger. Loved the fillings and the bun was nice and soft. 4/5 - pork floss and egg pancake. It was good, but the pancake was a little too thick for my liking. It is still worth a try, though. 3.5/5  Overall, I am pretty impressed with how authentic the food was here. It was comparable to Taiwan and I will defiantly be coming back."}
{"text":"LOVE Mama Bear! Their numbingly spicy smelly tofu is the best stinky tofu I ever had, and their customer service is really good. Definitely going there again!! :D"}
{"text":"Mama bear is a super cute name for a restaurant. Came here today and avoided the lineups, we were seated within 2 minutes. The server's were super friendly and asked us to write what we wanted (numbers) on a sheet of paper.   Parking is usually harder to find here, but they have free three hour parking that is underground, so it's easy to get to. The space to get underground is a little tight and there's no walkway for pedestrians so you need to be careful.  We decided to order two combos, one was the popcorn chicken combo ($12) and the other was their chopped pork bits on rice ($10.50). It came with three small side dishes, a wintermelon tea and orange slices. Both these dishes were large, but there was more rice in each dish, no sauce for the popcorn chicken, the chopped pork compared to other places was okay, not anything extremely special.   One of the dishes came significantly earlier than the other. The waitress kept coming by to make sure we were okay because we finished one dish before the other one came.   I'd like to try out their side dishes next time though, maybe those will impress me a little more than these large combos."}
{"text":"The food here exceeded my expectation. I had the beef noodle soup with thick noodle and thought it was delicious! My boyfriend had the Pork Belly with Bamboo and rice set, it was good but not outstanding! I would go back and try something else. p.s. They are known for their stinky tofu, the smell was only apparent when someone ordered it, it didn't linger on afterwards."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to have Taiwanese food! Beef noodles is always good so as the stinky tofu! Must order every time!"}
{"text":"Finally a Taiwanese joint that has decent operating times and location!  I usually like to go to Wei's but seating and operating times are scarce.  The stinky tofu comes out crisp and hot. I've been told the pork blood on a stick is pretty awesome. Noodle soups are quite good as well. I really like scallion cakes but there's was tasteless so I won't be ordering that again.  Parking is quite plentiful if you go to the underground lot close by, most spots in front of the restaurant get taken up."}
{"text":"Decent food with and poor value is how I would describe Mama Bear Restaurant.  Overall the food wasn't bad, I didn't expect too much although I wouldn't agree with the overall rating of this place. We tried many items and the subtotal was $75 for the four of us for lunch. A bit pricey considering some of us weren't even full.   Notes: -  Scallion pancake wraps were good. I liked the egg/pork floss one better than the beef. You can never go wrong with these crisp pancakes.  - I would describe the overall food as dark not only in color but in flavour. It was on the salty side, with a lot of soy sauce, and oyster sauce.  - The cucumber side was LOADED with garlic and coriander in a good way. A bit soggy and wet, there could have been more crunch. Pig ear and beef tripe was good but 'darker' than I am used to.  - Popcorn chicken meal was nothing special. The chicken was crispy but that was it. Side dishes included: cauliflower/broccoli, beancurd, and cellophane noodle based stir-fry with a miso based soup and a drink.   - I am much higher on the beef noodles than most. The soup wasn't too sour but I felt like the noodles themselves could have been better - fresher. - 'Taiwanese Hamburger' - pork belly bao was great. There were peanuts and preserved greens in there, all providing a nice contrast of flavours with the sweet bun.  Major kudos to the one waitress who on her own by servicing the entire place for lunch. It was understaffed yes, but she did fine."}
{"text":"Get there early to avoid lineups. Recommend the stinky tofu as it actually taste similar to the ones in Taiwan which has the real fermented soy taste unlike most other places which only smells stinky but tastes like regular fried tofu. Also really liked the savory sticky rice - well flavored, moist and chewy. The Taiwanese pickled cabbage was sweet and refreshing. Snack dishes are well portioned for 2 people to share and can order a variety of things to try. This place is pretty authentic and I would definitely be back to try more things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Mama Bear is the latest addition to the Taiwanese restaurants in Markham/Richmond Hill area, located on Highway 7 near Leslie where all the new condos are!  Before I begin my review, I must warn the readers that this place serves Smelly (Stinky) Tofu and you can smell it as you walk into the restaurant.  So if you cannot stand the smell of the Smelly (Stinky) Tofu, I would recommend you ask someone to just buy you takeout instead of dining in.  I came here with a friend after work on a weekday at around 630 and it was pretty packed already.  The wait wasn't too long, but if you don't like the Stinky Tofu smell, the wait seems a lot more painful.  Anyways, after adjusting my nose to ignore the Stinky Tofu smell, I sat down and ordered the below must try items in any Taiwanese restaurants.  1) Beef with thick noodle (substituted the thin noodle) - the noodle was chewy and the overall of the noodle soup was decent, but it is not as good as Papa Chang (another Taiwanese restaurant in Markham)  2) Popcorn Chicken - Chicken was nicely breaded, seasoned and fried, however, the portion was less than Papa Chang.  Taste wise, the two restaurants are pretty even.  3) Braised Pork Rice Combo - for only $8.99, i think this was the best deal on the menu, the rice was big and it came with 3 side dishes!! However, the Pork Rice was again not as good as Papa Chang.  In conclusion, if you can stand Smelly (Stinky) Tofu or even want to eat some Smelly Tofu with other Taiwanese dishes, then you must come to Mama Bear because Papa Chang does not serve smelly tofu.  However, if you are not a big fan of smelly tofu and just want some good Taiwanese food, then I would highly recommend going to Papa Chang instead."}
{"text":"Clean, modern, friendly service, reasonable price, accept credit, SOLID FOOD = YAY!  I have tried many beef noodles from Chinese and Taiwanese places in GTA. And I would have to say this place serves the best noodles by far (better than Mei Nung noodle which is more popular for some reason). You can choose the type of noodles: thin, thick, and mung bean vermicelli without extra charge. I was thrilled to see mung bean vermicelli because I love  that noodle and don't see it as one of the options at other places. I ordered beef and tendon soup noodles (small: ~$8.5 and large: ~$10.5). The broth was packed with flavour. I could definitely taste Chinese herbs in it. Generous amount of meats and veggies.   Apart from food, it was my first time seeing the kitchen staff wearing hair nets. I was impressed. The floor and tables were sparkling clean. I am not going to venture for the best beef soup noodles anymore. If I can eat good food at a clean place where the staff treat you nicely AND pay with credit, why would I go anywhere else? I will be back soon to try their stinky tofu and popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"While I can't comment on the authenticity of their food (which I think it should be?) I can however tell you that it's...okay. I and maybe a few out there share this stigma that Taiwanese food is delicious. Going in to this place I was a bit overwhelmed with excitement.  As it turns out, it wasn't quite what I had expected. Throw out the expectations of delicious deep fried chicken, aromatic 3-cup chicken or the savoury goodness of braised pork with rice and replace it with lifeless and limp veggies, bland meats and uninspiring noodles and you've got Mama Bear.  Quite frankly, I am not sure why they even deserve 2 stars but I figure I am feeling generous today cuz it's Friday.  Do I regret this? no. Will I visit again? no. Should you go? no. 3 NOs so I guess that's pretty much a NO."}
{"text":"Parking was not easy on a Friday night even at after 8pm. You can smell the stinky tofu upon entering the restaurant.  Seating was ok at the booth. Food was soso. We ordered Taiwanese sausage, pan fried dumpling, a pop corn chicken combo and scallion pancake.  The price for appetizer was quite high given the small portion.  There were so few pieces of sausage unlike what's shown on the picture and they weren't even cut and present properly.  Pop corn chicken was the best out of all these dishes although one of the side dishes that came with the combo tasted quite weird (tofu and tomato).  There's very little and tiny pieces in the scallion pancake and it's oily and bland.  For the sausage, dumpling and scallion pancake you can so tell that they just reheat food that you can get from the supermarket. Most probably won't visit again."}
{"text":"Called in for take out on a Friday night, they said 15 minutes and so we arrived 15 mins later. The place was busy. We paid and left quickly, the food was great. Looks like this could be a good take out place for us. Didn't grab a menu, and probably should have because the person answering the phone may not speak English fluently and it would be easier to order by giving her the item numbers instead of the name of the dish in English."}
{"text":"Not sure about all of the 4-5 star reviews, the popcorn chicken was really bland. The Taiwanese sausage appetizer looked nothing like the picture and was really dry and skinny.   The brisket noodles were okay, but had to add a lot of hot chili oil to bring the flavour out. The noodle consistency was good though. Food here was overall a meh.   It did get pretty busy after 7pm though. Service was a bit shotty too. our table of 6 all ordered a bowl of brisket noodles and they came out one by one, every 2-3 minutes.   Papa Chang's is the better choice!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and this place is also a relatively new place. How did I found out about this place? Well an old friend of mine told me he works here and I told him I would visit him. alright that's enough of the gibber jabber, time for the review.   This place is a bit pricey. 3 items costed me 23 bucks. I had some leftovers I brought back with me but I thought that it was still pricey. Some of the portions are fair, some are not, some of the flavours make up for the price, some definitely do not.  Let's start with the hamburger. This was awesome. Perfect lighter-than-air bun that's perfectly steamed, pork belly cooked to perfection, some pickles veggies that cuts down the richness of the dish, some peanut-based sauce they smear on the inside (which is awesome but be careful if you have allergies!). This burger was good, would choose this over a Big Mac any day. Also I think it might even be cheaper than a Big Mac now too.  Alright time for the fried popcorn chicken. This was good too. It has an interesting flavour that you wouldn't expect. It's sweet and savoury, mostly savoury with a touch of sweetness at the end. The breading, frying, and cook was really amazing. They deep fried some basil leaves or herbs along with it that added a nice green touch to it. That's right, my daily vegetable intake right there. The chicken was moist, there was no dipping sauce or mayo on the side. Although that would've  been nice to see!   Lastly, the beef pancake roll thing. This was not good unfortunately. It was very dry, the pancake was not very well made and seasoned. I think they also put the wrong sauce inside. The cucumber didn't add anything to the wrap except for some crunchy water taste. I also think that it's way too expensive. This meal could've been a 5 for me but that last one really messed it up for me. I was also really looking forward to that pancake wrap too since it's one of my favourites.   The waiting staff here is also pretty nice. Very attentive and can speak English and chinese. It's a nice place to come and relax. I would definitely come back here with family and friends and so should you!"}
{"text":"This is surely a hidden gem not hidden.......... why??.......... coz there are always a bunch of people waiting for their numbers to be called!  How could a place be hidden with a whole bunch of people always around?  \"23!\" ....... oh....... we would be next!!  One of the staff was cleaning up the table and another staff called out \"24\" already.  Our server gave us the tea and told us that the dessert of the day was Herb Pudding.  She left us a piece of paper and a tiny pencil, and on it we wrote: 1.  Fried smelly tofu S 2.  Century year old egg with tofu 3.  Braised pig intestine and beef shank 4.  Numbing spicy cold noodle 5.  Danzai noodle 6.  Savoury sticky rice  Smelly tofu is like durian; you'll either love it or hate it, and they both SMELL!  We got the small order which came in eight pieces.  It came in small cubes with sauce and some pickled cabbage.  It was hot, crispy and soft within.  Great to eat with spicy sauce.  The tofu together with the century year old egg was silky soft, the sauce was tasty, and it brought the taste of tofu to the next level when eating with the green onions and parsley which had been topped as garnish.  Braised pig intestine and beef shank were tender.  The sauce in numbing spicy cold noodle was made with sesame sauce, and the noodle was chewy.  It wasn't spicy!  Both the Danzai noodle and sticky rice were good.  Danzai noodle came in soup with ground pork, been spout, and egg and a shrimp.  The dessert was sold out at the time we wanted to order.  They only serve one kind of pudding each day and is of limited quantity.  **Got to order fast** ***Great food and excellent service!! Worth the wait!!***"}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food but no bubble tea :( food is average but the set menu for $8.99 is a good deal!  I will come back for stinky tofu!"}
{"text":"Excitement level: 5 stars Food level: 3.5 stars Average: 4 stars  We visited due to curiosity.  We ordered a stinky tofu ($5), a 2-meat braised appetizer ($8) and a braised pork belly combo ($9).  The 2-meat braised appetizer and the pork belly combo tasted rich and authentic Taiwanese, as verified by a dining mate who was born and raised in Taiwan.  The portion and the variety of the combo impressed.  The stinky tofu smelled stinky, and the \"fragrance\" lingered in my mouth for long.  However, the on-table Taiwanese said the outside was too hard.  The tofu was supposed to be light and fluffy and the outside crunchy, and this was not.  Nevertheless, we were intrigued by the many Taiwanese local options in the menu.  I really felt like trying out many of them."}
{"text":"Apparently this place serves up legit Taiwanese food. I don't really know what that entails to be honest, but I believe it when my Taiwanese friends tell me so upon reviewing the menu.  Personally, I think the food is OK, but nowhere near justifying the wait times and popularity of the restaurant. Scallion pancakes are quite good, and I do enjoy their cold noodle dishes and braised items. My companions however found the beef noodle soup to be largely lacking in flavour and were overall unimpressed. Overall I didn't find the food to be of good value compared to other Asian restaurants in the area (portions are quite small and trying to get a variety of items to fill you up often entails ordering a lot of small apps or side dishes which really racks up the bill more quickly than I'd like).  Coupled with the large lineups and difficulty parking, I don't think this is an establishment that I will really frequent, but I don't mind dropping by on occasion just for something different."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of taiwanese food, and have to admit I don't have a huge baseline. But having said that, I found the food here extremely tasty.  The regular tea was flavorful, wintermelon tea also very tasty. Stinky tofu was tasty, but definitely taiwanese style and not HK style (no hoi sin sauce) but that was just fine, also came with some pickled vegetables. Rice combos were quite filling. Nice side dishes of small veggies, reminds me a bit if ban chan (Korean side dishes). Very filling and tasty. Was very surprised they also accept credit card! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Came on a whim after a Christmas concert, thanks to Google maps showing us what was in the area!  The name sounded cozy, soup sounded warming and I'm always game for something new.  I had the fermented cabbage, slightly sweet, tangy and refreshing. Then the Tainan Danzai Noodles... Some say that these noodles are as synonymous to Tainan food as Bruce Lee is to Chinese Kung fu!  Typically served more as a street snack, Mama Bear dishes out a healthy portion of the shrimp broth based noodles, topped with crumbled pork, a single shrimp and seasoned with garlic and coriander.  Everyone says to try the chicken and I was eyeing the stinky tofu... guess I'll have to come back. Satisfied with the soup!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Taiwanese food.   No stinky tofu smell when I went.   I had the minced pork rice combo.   Good menu selection. Reasonable prices and great location, although may be hard to find parking during busy hours.  Very friendly staff.  New hours open till 10 pm (closed on Wednesdays).  Can't wait to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I always crave Taiwanese food and now I can finally satisfy that craving! The interior is surprisingly clean albeit not very comfortable as it is quite small and squishy.   The service, which I was pleasantly surprised about, was super friendly (and they speak both Mandarin and English). We kept having changes in our party number and they were extremely accommodating.   Like many of the other reviews say, there is an underlying smell of stinky tofu. I don't mind this one bit - in fact, I don't even find stinky tofu..stinky! However, my friends didn't enjoy the smell but were able to put up with it.   POPCORN CHICKEN - My ultimate favourite Taiwanese snack...I could eat this day and night and never get tired of it. Mama Bear definitely did it justice - it wasn't too salty and was perfectly crisp with moist and tender chicken on the inside. Would order again for sure!  STINKY TOFU ($8 for large size) - To be honest, this was a little weak for me. The ones they sell at night market are stronger in smell and taste but this could be because they are trying to entice new customers to try stinky tofu?   TAIWANESE COLD NOODLES ($7) - very refreshing although it really was just peanut sauce with noodles. I could have made this at home but I would still recommend others to try it !!  All in all, a great place to satisfy your Taiwanese food. The prices are affordable. I urge you to go ahead of time because the line ups can get craaaazy! (Just another testament to how they are becoming a fast local favourite!)"}
{"text":"I have had this place on my to go list for a while now and all because of the pork belly bun pictures that were posted. I finally got to try them and man was it amazing. The pork belly meat was so soft and tender. I know I shouldn't be eating the fatty part since its FAT but I couldn't help myself. The fat just melted when I bit into the bun. At $5.99 it may sound pricy for a small pork but but trust me its worth every penny.   Also tried the pancake pork floss with egg for $5.99 - this dish was a nice snack but I wouldn't go out of my way just to have this. The pork belly bun though, I definately would go outta my way to have it again. (Yes, I jumped right back into the pork belly bun topic again. I'm sorry, this will be the last time I mention it ;)  Also tried the hot grass jelly dessert for $5.50 - I've never had grass jelly hot before but I'm so glad I did today. It was really smooth and tasty and I would not hesitate to order it again.   I'm really happy with the items I tried. Service was also very good as it was not too busy."}
{"text":"Mama Bear is where you'd find yummy, authentic Taiwanese food. While everything tasted great, I found the portions to be inconsistent. My popcorn chicken filled a small plate, whereas the other plates with the server were so topped they almost fell over. Mind you, the chicken was delicious, but after seeing the other plates, I wished they were more evenly distributed. I also found their a/c to be really lacking... It was so hot in there! Other than those two points, I really did enjoy the meal. It was a fantastic taste of Taiwan, and Mama Bear had a bit of everything to keep everyone happy."}
{"text":"BEST STINKY TOFU!  Their lunch portions are more than enough. I love coming here! The staff are friendly and the food are delicious! Popcorn chicken, oyster omelette, pork belly, all so good!"}
{"text":"The good:  The most authentic Taiwanese food imo in Toronto. The fact that they have pork blood cake and oyster pancake - and both made authentically, blows my mind. Taste was good. And the best part, their Taiwanese chicken has dried basil leaves - that makes it taste right and authentic. Overall great experience with my taste buds.  The bad:  Service is so slow. Good came out fast but, if you want a table cleared or waiting for your menu to come or even waiting to pay the bill, it's a long wait. It's all worth the wait of course.  The neutral:  Great place to chat and dine. The place does get a bit loud."}
{"text":"What can I say? Finding authentic homey Taiwanese food in Toronto is rare and Mama Bear is a very welcome addition. Walking into this restaurant made me feel nostalgic and reminds me of scents of a snack bar in Taiwan.   There were some hits and some misses in terms of food.   The good: wintermelon tea, popcorn chicken, stinky tofu which were fried perfectly!! The set meal with pork belly and bamboo shoots was pretty good. I love fatty braised pork!   Needs improvement: meat ball was tough, oyster omelette was gooey and flavors not there and their new caramel pudding had really faint flavor or hardly any at all.  I heard the beef noodle soup and steamed stinky tofu are good so on my try list. Fast friendly and efficient customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the braised pork combo and the beef and tripe thick noodles  The combo came with 3 side veggies dishes, oranges, egg and soup....the braised pork was okay, nothing special and a bit too salty  The beef in the noodles weren't that tender and the tripe was chewy   Wouldn't come back to this place"}
{"text":"Mama bear is one of the newer Taiwanese restaurant that opened their store last year.  Used to be long line up outside as they only open from 5 to 10 for dinner.  This is deinitely Taiwanese food, and a lot of variety of it too.  Smelly tofu is not really smelly, the portions are a bit on the small side, the flavor is definitely there, but compare to what you get in Taiwan, there is still a big gap.  The one thing that's worth mentioning is the cold noodle, there aren't a lot of places in GTA that offers this, so it's somewhat decent if you have a craving for this.  Variety is the selling feature at this place.  I give it a 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Taiwanese food and I am happy to say I think this place is my go-to. There is a variety of options whether appetizers or mains. Of course, popcorn chicken is a must have and for the noodle lover I am, I have no complaints. I switch between beef noodle and  the noodle with pork and pickled veggies. The portions are always generous and overall, service is good. Important to note that it does get quite busy but since food comes pretty quickly so turnaround is fast!"}
{"text":"Like this place, always order the same foods, pop corn chk, taiwanese sausages, stinky tofu and intestine vermicelli."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever but it was always so busy when it first opened.  Finally got my chance, here are the results!  Pros: Authentic Taiwanese cuisine Lots of items to choose from Servers were very nice and polite  Cons: Place is generally busy  Being half Taiwanese it's always a good thing when a Taiwanese restaurant is around.  Toronto doesn't have enough Taiwanese restaurants around if you ask me.  They have beef noodle restaurants, but for other Taiwanese cuisines, the places are few and far between.  Mama Bear is famous for their night market stands so when this place opened up, I had to come here.  One look at the menu and I was impressed.  This place definitely has the most Taiwanese items that I have seen anywhere in the city.  There was so much to try but I had to limit myself.  I will need to come back to try other items I missed out on the first time around!!  We ordered the popcorn chicken, beef noodles, oyster omelette, minced pork on rice and some homemade buns.  It was way too much food but that's how excited I was to try all the food!!  Everything was done very well!!  The noodles were great (they make their own noodles) and the broth was very good.  The popcorn chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  My favourtie was the oyster omelette.  Oyster omelette was one of my favs growing up and Mama Bear makes a excellent one!!  The servers here were all very nice and polite.  Our little one now is going through her terrible two's so she can be quite a handful.  The servers were all very patient and nice throughout our visit even with her acting up at times.    I had high expectations going into this place and they were all met.  I need to come back ASAP to try other items!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for lunch today based on some reviews that I've read on Yelp.  My husband (more so him) and I have been keeping our eyes open for a place that serves a good pork belly dish.  This place is across the street from us, so we finally decided to try it.  I ordered the popcorn chicken combo (comes with popcorn chicken, rice, 3 side dishes, soup, cold winter melon tea and fruit for $11.99) and my husband ordered the pork belly combo.  We also decided to try the fried turnip patty and dumpling appetizers.  I really enjoyed my combo because the chicken was warm, crispy and well-seasoned.  My husband said that the pork belly was tasty and fatty.  The dumplings and the turnip patty were both fried to perfection, so crispy!  Not only was the food tasty and promptly made, but the service was very good.  The waiting staff are always attentive and polite. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  If you're looking for some Taiwanese food, you should try this place."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Mama Bear and I was excited to try it out. When I walked into the restaurant I was a tad bit worried about the big woof of smelly tofu. But after sitting down for a little bit the smell somewhat disappeared - until my SO ordered himself a Large portion of those little suckers. According to him, it was delicious! I ordered myself a set meal with the pork belly. It was moist, tasty and had great flavor. I wish the portion of the meat was bigger, I only had 3 pieces of pork.. SO ordered the noodles with two types of meat (I forgot what it was), he said it was alright but nothing to shout about.   The highlight for me was the wintermelon tea. I love how it was so refreshing and had a slightly nutty flavor to it. Also its only $1.50 and it comes in a generous sized cup! I would come back just for the tea alone."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice now and both times have gotten sick from the food.  The first time I came here when they first opened, I ordered the popcorn chicken with rice combo (comes with sides and orange slices).. the food itself was alright, but my meal did not come until after everyone else in my party was done with their food.. we had followed up several times.. apparently the kitchen likes to wait for multiple orders of popcorn chicken before it is fried up.  Timely issues aside, we had also ordered the Taiwanese style cold noodle which came with sesame/peanut butter sauce and cucumbers..it was incredibly delicious but made both my boyfriend and I very sick that evening.  Fast forward to my second (and more recent) trip to this restaurant; we ordered the pork belly with rice combo and Mama Bear hot & sour dry noodle.  The rice combo was a good portion, tons of delicious fatty pork belly; the combos now come with a beverage (wintermelon tea) which I found incredibly sweet..basically sugar water.  The Mama Bear hot & sour dry noodle was very delicious at first..but towards the middle got very salty and oily; the noodles were drenched in chili oil with some soy/meat paste. I felt sick later that evening.  The pricing is reasonable, but the food is quite mediocore; I know that this is the only Taiwanese place in the area but I am willing to drive a bit further for food that I know wont upset my stomach."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend for casual dinner before drinks on a week night right before their closing, places was pretty full but didn't have to wait for a table.  Looked around and looked at the menu.. Was expecting a 4 star experience.. The smells like stinky tofu!!! Yummy!!  The four of us ordered a feast to share among our table even though it's more of a order you own meal type place..  The Taiwanese minced pork rice was pretty good.. $6.99 for a medium bowl of rice loaded with tons of minced pork and 1 egg.. 4 stars, would totally go back for the same dish.. You can combo it for $11.99 which I might do next time.. Comes with 3 small veggie sides, a soup, and watermelon drink already in a to-go style drink container.. But I think the drink was too sweet..  The braised pork belly was not tender enough at all but looked amazing.. The meat quality and cut was awesome tho.. 2.5 stars  The braised pork feet also looked amazing but also wasn't tender enough.. 2.5 stars  Smelly tofu was ok... Some of it was good and some of it was not enough... The good ones had a fair amount of permutation going-on and tasted smelly.. The half of try portion was lacking flavour.. 2.5 stars  Can't remember which bowl of noodles was shared... But that was pretty good.. It had mushrooms, octopus.. The soup base was very flavourful.. But it was my first experience having that dish.. 3.5 stars..  The seaweed-cuttlefish ball soup was tasty!! Had lots of ginger in it.. The cuttlefish balls were 4 stars!!  Ending my review with 3 stars cuz the entire table agrees all the braised meat items weren't tender enough but would go back to try it again! I have faith!"}
{"text":"Mama Bear managed to impress us. I am starting to think this is the best plaza for food in the city. Hot Taste is great because they are open at all times and you can count on them even 2 am. Saigon Star is solid Vietnamese. Lucullus bakery has the second best egg tarts in GTA (After ABC of course) and you could even order medicinal hotpot in this plaza. WOW  Mama Bear is also another good Taiwanese restaurant. We are lucky in this city with Taiwanese food. Mei Nung Beef Noodle House has solid fare and good stinky tofu. Beef Noodle house in Scarborough has been there forever and has the best anchovy noodles and pot stickers, Wei's stinky tofu is a staple and Mama Bear impresses with everything except the staple of Taiwanese cuisine. What is the most important Taiwanese cuisine?? Of course, beef noodles and broth. Their tendon beef noodle broth was not bad, it was just OK however. There was a lack of flavours (but I am thankful for the lack of MSG) and too little noodle. The tendons were very tasty and had as little visible fat as you hope for.  Their sausage is great. Their beef wraps were different from everyone else's and absolutely tasty. Yum. Their stinky tofu gives Wei's serious competition and is even better than Mei Nung Beef Noodle House's in my opinion.  They also have Aiyu 'lemon' jelly but not as dessert or in edible form, but strictly as a drink. The jelly is tasteless, but the drink is a good complement to your food. It is hard to find these so we were glad they had it here. Everyone was having the chicken popcorn so it seems to be the thing to try next time. This is an easy restaurant to go back to especially because not only the food is delicious, they also actually wipe their restaurant down it seems.  The prices are moderate. The restaurant is clean (yes you read that right. A Chinese restaurant is clean) and they have tried to add a few design touches to make it more appealing. Service is OK. You have to write your own food number on their chit.  If you are curious about the owner she is on the small wooden boxes in which they bring your bills. Feel free to compliment her on her restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited the restaurant on a Saturday at 3pm for a late lunch. No one else in the restaurant save for one other table. Overall very good experience for food and service, mostly owing the the timing of my visit.   For food I ordered the popcorn chicken, hot and sour dry noodles, and pancake with beef dishes. I've had popcorn chicken at other places and can say this one was very good. It was hot out the fryer and the amount of batter and seasoning was perfect.  The noodles flavour didn't blow my expectations, but were enjoyable. They had a good chewiness and went well with the popcorn chicken.  Pancake with beef was well done, though a little dry because it didn't come with any sauce. I asked for some hoisin/seafood like sauce which I've had at other places and while they didn't have it, the staff accommodated and mixed up something similar for me.  I would definitely recommend this place to someone looking for authentic taiwanese like food!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit hard to find if you can't read Chinese. I recommend googling this place before hand because the english sign for the restaurant is actually really small compared to the Chinese parts of the sign.  This place feels very homey! The staff is very polite and respectful, they're always there when we need them. This place was packed when we got in around 7 on a Saturday! We were lucky to have gotten a table right away and it was the last table at the moment. It's also in a plaza that is always busy, so it is a bit tough to find parking, so I recommend going in the underground parking!  The food was pretty good, but not as good as Papa Chang's (if you haven't tried this Papa Chang's I highly recommend you trying it out)! We had two combos, the popcorn chicken with rice and the minced pork and rice, they both came with a few dishes of appetizers, like tomato and tofu, salad, miso soup, and other simple dishes with light seasoning. The food was still good compared to most of the other places I've been to, but it also might be because I don't eat a lot of Taiwanese food.   I'd say this place is 2nd only to Papa Chang's in terms of Taiwanese food.  I'd like to give this place another try because I heard a lot of good things about it but I feel the dishes we got were okay. Maybe it just wasn't their best day, but the dishes we got I'd say are fairly popular Taiwanese dishes and should at least be distinguishably better for a Taiwanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy, stinky tofu!  I'm not a big fan, nor can I stand the smell. Mama Bear ??? is known for this specialty stinky delicacy - I remember seeing them gain popularity at those Asian night markets years ago! It might not be as bothersome for many, (it usually taste better than it smells!) but I was kinda suffocating that night because of the stinkiness lol. (-1 star, sorry!) FYI, we did not order stinky tofu but we were surrounded by them zomg lol.  Most of the dishes are great for sharing. The service is very friendly and courteous. The wait was about 15 minutes (I come at 8:30pm). Always packed, even on weekdays!   I was especially impressed with Mama Bear's mini oysters pancake. I was very hesitant to order it because I had bad experiences but I'm very glad I did end up ordering it. Although the portion was small, it was very tasty with that sweet orange sauce that compliment so well with it. Taiwanese staple, must order!  Overall,  a great place to explore delicious Taiwanese food up in Richmond Hill. They even have bento box style set menus available with very affordable prices. Parking can be a bit crazy in that plaza. It is a tiny lot with so many restaurants. There is an underground parking, thank goodness.  I will definitely come again (with my nose plug lol) I warn ya... that stinky tofu smell is really strong lol. Maybe I'll give stinky tofu a try next time. Only maybe lol."}
{"text":"Such a great place for Taiwanese food! Most the combos are $10-12 and they come with a drink, three side dishes, and oranges for dessert. I tried the popcorn chicken and the sesame chicken. Both were great!   The popcorn chicken was crispy and tender on the inside. The sesame chicken was flavourful and not drier out. The side dishes included a bean sprout salad, bean curd with carrots and cauliflower/broccoli.   The wait staff is also very nice! Not pushy and very helpful. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Authentic taiwanese food. Happy to know it is also open for lunch now.  Mianxian, stinky Tofu and Yansuji(peper salted fried chicken)was good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my mom, and we were quickly seated by a very pleasant guy (I'm assuming the guy who owns the place). The place is quite clean, and the food are not super salty which is good. However, they do serve stinky tofu at this place, so the place does smell a bit like fermented tofu. We ordered:  Popcorn chicken set - really tender and juicy fried chicken bits, and lightly salted. The sides that comes with it was quite good, especially the eggplant. The wintermelon tea that comes with the set just tastes like sugar water (so meh to the drink). Overall, I'd definitely order their set again for you get a lot for your buck, and it tastes good!  Pork belly with bamboo shoots - really tender, melt in your mouth pork belly. It has a good balance of salty and sweet. The bamboo shoots is nice and crunchy.   Taiwanese beef noodles - really tender, juicy beef with a bit of star anise flavour but not too pungent.   Overall I'll definitely be back to try more dishes, and encore on their popcorn chicken!"}
{"text":"Frequent this plaza regularly but have never ate here until today. Surprisingly delicious. Got the beef and tripe noodle soup. My only complaint is that they ran out of the thin rice noodles and I was given glass noodles instead. Not the same experience. The broth was sweet and flavourful, not oily at all. The meats were so tender. Definitely a winner. I just wish I was hungrier so I could order some of the good looking appetizers! Hopefully next time they won't be out of the regular noodles!"}
{"text":"Working nearby so came across this place like finding a jewel. Its hard for me to say if the food is authentically Taiwanese as I was not born and raised there. But every bring in this restaurant from interior to food serving from service to price are all very suitable for casual meals or maybe just a place to snack up the afternoon and kill some time cuz they got free wifi. Two times I been here I ordered combos. The side dishes are delicious and generous. Coming with a free drink and some fruits and a soup. I like the ambience and the overall experience so definitely recommend to you all!"}
{"text":"Its been awhile but popcorn chicken and beef brisket noodles here has been so good. I love everything about this place and it tasted like home."}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic Taiwanese restaurant in the Toronto area. The restaurant is clean and there is so much to choose from the menu. Most items here are less than $10 per entrée or you can get a combo (soup, entrée, side dishes) for around $10.50. SO much to choose from. I didn't know if I wanted beef noodle soup, pork belly, minced pork, popcorn chicken... I wanted everrrrrything. I ended up getting the pork belly combo and it was fantastic. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward for Mama Bear to open as I can come here to get my fix of stinky tofu and other Taiwanese goodies regularly!   An upgrade from the previous HK Style Cafe to a nicely decorated space with more details.  Menu has such varieties and I want to try them all. This is just so me... But since I was here alone for a snack, I settled on my usual:  Taiwanese Braised Beef Noodle ($7.99) and Wintermelon Drink ($1.50). Choice of noodle (thick, thin or vermicelli) and the soup base was quite rich, noodle was not overcooked but the beef can be more tender.   Promising first impression and I will be back!"}
{"text":"stinky tofu was excellent 5.5 cad I ordered one bowl of MIAN XIAN, which was a little bit dry for me. Crispy pork intestine was a bonus, if you don't mind eat this part. 5.5 cad My friend Si ordered 3 cups chicken (pardon my bad translation) combo, which was pretty yummy, with many side dishes and fruits. Winter melon tea is a must-try, unusual taste. Highly recommend this restaurant. Service was amazing"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with three of my friends. Came here because we were in the area and decided to use yelp to find our next meal and mainly cause another reviewer said most of the entrees were under $10. Everything was indeed under $10 except the three side dishes sets which was $11.99 (pretty good value). The service was super friendly and helpful as they were prompt with requests.   First and foremost... The popcorn chicken here is DELICIOUS! My friends and I really loved it! One of the friends I dined with is a popcorn chicken connoisseur and even exclaimed that he would return to eat the popcorn chicken again.   The scallion wrap with pork floss and egg was also really yummy. The noodles were really good too but I preferred the thicker noodles than the thin ones. I also ordered the Tainan noodles but I preferred the soup base that my friends got.   We also ordered the stinky tofu to share. It's just as you expect, even maybe a tad lighter in flavour.   The portions are generous and we were all full after dinner.  They also have free wifi (password on the board in front of the cashier) and they take credit cards.   Would definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a large menu, lots of different selections (lots more options than Papa chang). One of their famous items is deep fried smelly tofu which was served with picked cabbage and sauce; we enjoyed it. Deep fried popcorn chicken combo which comes with 3 side dishes, soup, fruit, and winter melon tea for $11.99. popcorn chicken was delish; rice was too soggy for my liking; soup was cold & salty; side dishes are just OK; winter melon drink was surprisingly good.  It was a nice change from all the usual Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"this place is quite busy... theres not too many dedicated Taiwanese restaurants  that i know of.... so its exciting to see a place like this pop up.  as expected it does smell like stinky tofu periodically through your dining experience..  portions are fair i would say.... the food did not wow or blow me away.. everything seems to be just average..  i will be visiting again ..."}
