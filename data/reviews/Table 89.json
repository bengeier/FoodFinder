{"text":"The food is great.. But I feel like the service and quality has gone down since I came here a couple months ago. Food took a lot longer than the last time. They seem really short staffed for a Saturday night. Couldn't even get a Togo box for my pizza.. Got offered a piece of foil instead.. Love this place but I just feel if they tried a little harder to make the guests happy; they would get better business."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful but the food does not add up. I will not be eating there again! Hopefully the menu will be rethought."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least.  I went to eat at Sammys only to find that it has been changed to Table 89.   A fast food concept though the food is better.  if I'm going to go out to dinner and spend $70 I want to be greeted, seated, and waited on.  Going out to dinner is supposed to be a nice, relaxing experience where someone else takes care of your needs. I'm a mom, I do that for others every day so going out to dinner is supposed to be my turn.  I ordered a glass of wine with dinner, which I'm glad they still have, but didn't get a second as i usually would because I didn't want to have to get up, wait in line a second time, and pay a second time.   As for desert, we opted out for the same reason.  Sometimes you just don't know if you're going to want it till the end, you know what I mean.  So while I did enjoy the food, there is really no service to speak of and the restaurant lost out on another $30 from our table because we didn't want to have to keep standing in line to pay over again.  Though I am a big fan of Sammys, it is unlikely that I will return to Table 89."}
{"text":"They don't have fries anymore! Need I say more? We  had no idea they had changed the name of the restaurant. We were afraid walked in that the the whole menu was different as well. That was not completely the case. The food was somewhat the same. Sliders are now just sliders with chips instead of fries and lettuce,tomato, pickle. We didn't like the fact that we had to get up and get everything ourselves. Drinks,silverware, condiments, and napkins. As a busy mom that was expecting to get served in a restaurant, I was highly disappointed that I had to do all this myself. I could have just stayed home and saved the money! Sorry but I won't be returning here. This farm to table idea is bull. It's the same food just scaled down. I felt jipped!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my husband and two year old. While my husband likes pizza and burgers, I enjoy a great salad and we were both very satisfied with our meals and menu options. The employees are very friendly and attentive. The menu has a good variety of fresh salads, sandwiches, pizza, etc and wine and beer by the glass. There's also a good children's menu. The restaurant is decorated very relaxed and chic, there was a TV playing a sports game for my husband on one side or you could sit next or on the patio on the other. Great prices for what we ordered, and as previously mentioned, very fresh and delicious! Will definitely return. This establishment  has a variety of options and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Got the prosciutto and pear pizza and some fries.  I could not taste or find any prosciutto on the pizza as the gorgonzola was pretty strong.  If you got a bite of pear with the gorgonzola it was very good.    The fries were well seasoned and good."}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone is complaining about. They have all the same food they did as Sammy's, it's just a casual dining atmosphere now. No big deal. The Margherita pizza was very good. I think once people that came when it was Sammy's get used to it they will like this place. Again. The menu is almost exactly the same. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good food clean helpful staff. I enjoyed the barbecue chicken pizza and my wife enjoyed pork sliders.  Ask for Tina"}
{"text":"I've worked for Ladeki Corporation for 16 years. I know hospitality inside and out... I was super excited to try Table 89. I love that the wine is on tap, very eco-friendly. Also, they have 2 awesome T.V.'s. Beto, Tamra V. and Tamra L. are always welcoming and hospitality exerts from them! I live a block away and I'm constantly bringing new people around. I believe in the product and it never fails! Consistently is the key! If you want great pasta, salad, and small plates come check it out!! One thing, I wish there were bar stools!! I stood and drank my wine. It completely takes the personal connections you can make with your guest!"}
{"text":"The ordering process was rushed and uncomfortable.  The food (3 different pizzas and 3 different salads) was not very good.  The pizza crusts were dry and tasteless.  My wife's margarita pizza had some kind of dijon vinegrette on it which absolutely ruined the basil flavor.  The atmosphere was terrible.  We ate outside because the dining room was freezing cold.  This was a mistake due to the sitting area (where everyone stands and smokes) that is on the other side of the fence.  The strong smell of cigarette smoke was present the entire time as different people waited and smoked by the fence.  Sammy's at the same location always had great food and I never had a bad meal there.  I don't know what brought on the changes to Table 89 but the result was terrible.  Bring back Sammy's."}
{"text":"Good food.  Great service.  The beet salad was delicious.  A nice alternative to fast food.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I keep waffling between 3 and 4 stars.  As others have said, Table 89 has pretty much the same menu and food as Sammy's, but has now turned into a quick-service type set up.  Some people seem really bothered by that, but I don't mind, really.  It's all good food, good quality, and the prices are pretty good for that quality...  but I just can't make myself give that extra star to bump it up to 4.  There's just nothing that grabs me and makes me a big fan.  Table 89 is just A-OK."}
{"text":"OH NO, they've ruined a good place to eat!  My husband & I have been going to \"Sammy's\" at this location since it opened about 9 years ago.  They had a good waitstaff, many had been there for years. Unfortunately they are gone so... Now, before you can be seated, you have to order your food at the counter.  Then, you aren't given glasses for water or bottled drinks.  When we asked for glasses, the giggly girl at the counter looked perplexed.  Next our guests got their food 10 minutes before us and when the check was brought out, my husband handed the giggler our CC so our guests wouldn't know the price and she read the total!  VERY SAD...WE WON'T BE BACK!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We Were weekly customers to Sammy's and were surprised to see it had changed. We decided to give Table 89 a try but were extremely disappointed when we walked in. It felt like we were walking into a pediatric office. The one thing we looked forward to at Sammy's was the warm, friendly staff and the exceptional service. We prefer to sit at the bar when we dine out and that is no longer an option. Even if the food is good the atmosphere is terrible. Disappointed, loyal Sammy's customers who will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered the beet & arugula salad, and my fiancé ordered the fried chicken. The food was delicious, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food was served quickly. The result was a successful dinner date. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent & the staff was courteous & helpful.  The only thing I didn't understand is getting a plate (since depending on what you order you may not need one).  I thought the prices were very reasonable & I had plenty of food, I certainly didn't leave there hungry.  If you want to be waited on then this probably isn't the place for you.  I especially LOVE the pear pizza with the arugula.... delicious ~ definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came in to eat the other day and had an exceptional experience. Going to a almost self service restaurant was not off putting to me as I have worked in a restaurant of the same concept. We really enjoyed the food. My favorite was the tequila chicken fettuccini. Delicious and fresh food."}
{"text":"What a great place to have in the neighborhood that is reasonable and delicious. . They have small plates...pizzas...salads and more..."}
{"text":"So you walk in, grab a menu and order at the counter and pay,  then you seat your self and wait for your food to come.    I ordered the Thai Shrimp salad and ice tea my bill came to $14. Seemed pricy,  the salad is served in a large bowl with 5 grilled Shrimp, romaine lettuce, a tiny bit of baby Spinach, carrots, Peanuts,  Mung bean Sprouts, tiny chopped tomato,  green onions, fried wonton strips,  piece of Sliced butter toasted Bread, and a Thai Peanut dressing. It was just ok.  Needed flavor,  nothing impressive.   There used be a Sammy's wood fired grill here, it never really did good.  So I'm not surprised that they closed, and reopened under a different concept."}
{"text":"I went to Table 89 for the first time yesterday -- I just picked up some dinner for my son and I on my way home. And - what a treat. When I go to the gym after work I never have time to cook, and this is such a great way to feed us well without a wait or having to stay and dine-in. My son had the cheeseburger sliders and I had spinach quinoa salad. I was in and out in 10 minutes and we loved our food. This place is a godsend for healthy, busy families."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area from NYC and I wasn't expected to find such good food at a place that doesn't have proper table service.  Well, I will gladly admit that my snobby New Yorker food critic was extremely pleased with the food and the atmosphere of the place.  Although you have to wait in line to place your order, the staff is super friendly and attentive, and the seating, lighting and design looks like a nice place in NYC.    I haven't eaten a variety of things because I have fallen in love with the Chicken Tequilla Fettucini and the Greek Salad.  I order with 2 other friends that I'm staying with and they also love the Chicken Tequilla as well as the pizza's and other items.  Eventually I will order something other than the Fettucini, but for now that is my Jam!"}
{"text":"The food is basically the same as Sammy's Pizza which is great but they no longer have waitresses. You grab your own plates, silver ware and drinks. This was very disappointing. I go out to dinner and expect service. I can go to McDonalds and serve myself."}
{"text":"With a limited number of restaurants in the area and loving Sammy's, I decided to check out this new restaurant by the creator of Sammy's. The decor was slightly different, however the layout is exactly the same. I was comforted to see a couple familiar faces, but after standing at the usual hostess stand to wait to be seated I was a bit taken back when someone asked me from behind the Sammy's \"to go\" cashier stand if I was ready to order. My reaction was, \"Ready to Order?\" So confused, my friend and I said we've never been there so wasn't sure what to do (clearly since they just recently opened and I'm standing waiting to be seated). The \"busser\" went on to explain it was a casual dining and for us to go ahead and order, then they bring the food to us. Ok no problem. Not what we expected, but I think a better greeting and explanation of the new layout would have been nice. After we ordered, I went to find a seat outside while my friend unsure of what to do, went to go fill out drinks. After finally sitting we realized we were supposed to get our own utensils and napkin as well. Again, being a new restaurant and having a menu so close to what Sammy's offers, you would think the staff would be kind enough to explain this, especially after we said it was our first time there and we weren't sure what to do. In the end the food and price was actually pretty good. My friend and I both had the Thai Shrimp Salad ($11).  I hated seeing the dirty dishes piled up on other tables until there were at least 5 that needed to be busses before someone came and paid attention to them. Then to watch an old lady ask the busser if she had to get her own drink refill, then have to go back into the building and across the restaurant to fill up her glass was a little unsettling too. She and her husband were as confused as we were on the new concept. Definitely nothing like the experience when it was a Sammy's.   It did not, however, stop me from returning for dinner that very same day (tonight). Again, the food was good and the location is convenient to my home. Knowing what to do this time, my party and I walked straight up to the 20\" menu screen to look over the menu, but not even 5 minutes from arriving we were asked of we were ready to order. Really? We were a party of 3 and again, this is a new restaurant. I don't see how anyone can be ready that fast. Especially when the menu is so small. We went to the utensils to grab some forks, but all that was in the containers were oversized spoons, steak knives, regular knives and teaspoons. No forks and it was only 8p. They close at 9:30p and it was not busy. I had the Market Salad ($9) and added Grilled Chicken Breast ($3) which was ok. Nothing exciting, but fresh and healthy. I would order it again. My friend had the Grilled Steak with Lentils  ($12), but before ordering she asked what kind of steak it was. The busser told her NY Strip, which surprised us, but it was actually a Flank Steak. I think the Flank is actually better. We watched as people walked in only to be greeted with, \"Hi, are you ready to order?\" I really think this should change. Maybe a warm welcome and the staff inquiring if it was the persons first time there so they can explain the concept, layout and such. Just until everyone in the neighborhood doesn't expect the same  Sammy's hospitality that we're all used to."}
{"text":"Sibling restaurant to Sammy's Woodfired Grill & Pizzas, Table 89 offers pizza and assorted healthy-style fare like salads, soups, sandwiches, and a handful of entrees. Not familiar enough with Sammy's menu to be able to tell if the pizzas are the same or not, but style is similar. Came in for soft opening advertised via social media.  LOBSTER BISQUE; smooth and creamy with a good dose of lobster flavor GOAT CHEESE AND TOMATO FLATBREAD: menu descrbies this as coming \"with Mediterranean herbs\" but it's actually zatar. Odd combination of flavors, not sure this really works. Only dish we didn't finish. STEAK SALAD: ample portion of grilled marinated steak was a touch tough, vegetables were overdressed in a scallion-ranch dressing that didn't have much flavor  but the various textures of tomato and radish, plus the addition of feta worked nicely. Particularly enjoyed the watercress in the lettuce mix. HERB MARINATED SLICED STEAK: same type of steak as was served in the salad, seems to be round top and was cooked properly to medium rare but again- tough and chewy. The warm beluga lentils and greens had an earthy flavor that didn't quite work for my guy.  Setup is a walk-up counter to place your order at a light-up menu, take your glass to a drink station and pick up your cutlery at another station, then pick a table and your food is brought out. Not sure why drinks and cutlery are not positioned together. Service still seems to be getting settled in, some employees are friendly and polite but many were quiet- possibly nervous.   I like the freshness of the food but the concept seems a little muddled with Italian and modern and quazi-Mediterranean options. Appreciate the healthy and flavorful options available on the menu though."}
{"text":"In one word - disappointing.   My hubbie and I dined here regularly when it was Sammy's. I was taken aback when I went to grab lunch and saw the new signage on the building. The menu still had the beet salad I went out for, so I decided to give it a whirl.   I walked in to an empty restaurant, 1 guy in front of me. He was sampling beers trying to decide what kind of beer he wanted in his pitcher. I was fine with that because I knew I'd be next. And the cooks weren't too busy, so they'd be able to get my food out quickly. As I continued to wait patiently the room behind me filled up with others waiting to order. It appeared the bartender called for back up because 2 girls came to the front counter. The people behind me (who hadn't been waiting nearly as long as I had) proceeded to order at the register to the left of where I was standing. Still, I was waiting on pitcher of beer guy to pay... seriously?  Now my order was going to be behind the huge crowd of folks that came in after me (I think it was a softball team or something?). No thank you. My guess is that they eliminated wait staff to reduce overhead. In personal opinion, it is a big mistake.   I can't comment on the food because I left without ever having ordered. Or even being acknowledged for that matter. Service is a big thumbs down for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed that Sammy's Woodfired was replaced by this new place.  This location is very close to my house, and I used to stop by Sammy's for a delicious vegan pizza whenever I could afford to.  The most recent time I stopped by I was disappointed to end up at restaurant, instead of Sammy's.  Luckily they still offer vegan Daiya cheese... unluckily, they offer almost none of the toppings they used to.  There weren't even any vegan pizzas on the menu anymore, they all had to be altered to all hell to be vegan, much less appetizing.    The wait staff was incredibly helpful and helped me concoct a custom pizza that was pretty good, but it paled in comparison to what I used to be able to get.  The closest Sammy's location now is in Summerlin - nearly 2 hours away on the bus."}
{"text":"Disappointed. This is the exact opposite of  improvement. This place used to be so much better as sammy's. If I wanted to  set a table myself  I would eat at home. The whole experience felt like one big let down. I had breakups in high school  that felt better than when I found out that sammy's  was going away. It was unexpected, unannounced, and 100% uncalled  for. I was on my way to go eat at sammy's  as I regularly do (once/twice a week) and just walked into a locked door. And got a spiel about a change. Well, today I went to go see it for myself. While the people there are nice. They have been set up for failure. The whole dining  out experience there has been ruined. I do not want to wait in line like McDonald's or a military  chow hall (and I've  seen more than a few of them)  for smaller portions  and less selections than before. Whoever owns sammy's. To you sir/maim, shame on you."}
{"text":"I'm sad but not surprised this is now closed. I went there once as Table 89. It was a fogettable experience...I miss Sammy's! They shouldn't have tinkered with the Sammy's model. It seems the major change was their service model; no waitstaff, just foodrunners. Shameful to think about servers losing their jobs. I guess this is what happens when businesses cut important corners...they lose customers."}
{"text":"We were invited to come and try out their newly renovated restaurant during their soft opening. This used to be Sammy's Wood Fired Pizzas and is still owned by the same parent company, as well as carrying over a few of their signature Sammy's pizzas and other plates.  Thai shrimp salad $11 Five large shrimp grilled to just barely done--how I like it. The salad was a bit overly dressed, but the dressing was really good. If you're watching your calories, ask for the dressing on the side. There is also a big crunchy slice of garlic bread that I loved.  Steak and watercress sandwich $11 \"I love buttered grass!\" You get a choice of multigrain or white bread and I chose multigrain. Nice chew to the bread and held up against the steak. The steak was grilled to med rare (my preference) and sliced thin, and was tender, not chewy. Served with cole slaw (very creamy) or kettle style chips.  Steak salad $12 Same style of steak as the sandwich but on greens and with the same garlic bread slice. More steak on this than the sandwich.  Kobe beef sliders (three) $10 Good sized sliders that were thick. The patties were very tender. Just wished there was more sauce, but another person in my party got more sauce on theirs. If you want extra sauce, ask for it on the side. Kettle ships come with this and they are thick and crunchy.  Pear and Proscuitto pizza $11 My favorite dish. The crust is very thin and very crunchy. It held up to the salad on top and all the cheese and oil. The salad again was overly dressed with balsamic. It was a very potent vinaigrette, so a little goes a long way. But I loved the mix of cheese, salty proscuitto, and soft and slightly sweet pear.  No way we could finish all the food. The leftovers were still great reheated later that day.  The staff was very attentive, even though they are new and just opened. Several of them checked on us throughout the meal. They promptly removed dishes without even asking.  For the most part the portion sizes are good, except the fried chicken. One of our party got this dish and another asked if it was an appetizer or entree bc it was small. Everything else is about the size you would expect. I think this place is better than say Panera as far as taste and value. But if we are comparing pizzas to pizzas, Pieology and the like offer a similar sized pizza for around $8-9 vs Table 89's $11-12. However, Table 89 does have some topping not available at the custom pizza places.  They also share a beautiful patio with Chipotle with lots of umbrellas and trees; serve beer and wine; and have tv's to watch the game if it's on.  Anyone in the NW part of town should def give this place a try."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars in consideration that I came during their soft opening, however, I was less impressed than expected. It looks like they gutted the old Sammy's Woodfired Pizza at this location and replaced with a new fast casual concept. Everything is self service except for the delivery and removal of plates at your table.   The food was decent. I tried the fried chicken breast and steak salad. The chicken looked like chicken tenders and were served with kimchi and ranch. It was tasty overall and the kimchi was surprisingly good! The steak salad was ok and came as a pretty big portion. The steak looked medium rare which is how I ususlly like it although they don't ask your preference.  The only problem I ran into is that while eating my salad, I found a crumpled paper condiment cup mixed into my salad. WTF! A waitress walked by 2 minutes later to check on us and we showed her the crumpled paper cup amd told her that it was mixed into the salad. She apologized and said she would show her manager. A few minutes later, another employee comes by to apologize and tells us that she'll go notify her manager. I continuted my meal expecting to receive an apology or at least a visit from a manager but nobody ever came back. How disappointing, especially considering that this was their official soft opening event and there were plenty of representation from corporate present...  Will I be back? Probably not because of how disappointed and angry I was after leaving. What a shame because I used to really like Sammy's..."}
{"text":"Confused at first with the new concept, but now I enjoy not being bothered.  So I can have a conversation without interruption. (Much enjoyed!!!) The staff was very polite very informative on the new procedures, so the confusion was short. The food has always been very tasty, but for a while the chicken was lacking in quality. I'm glad to say that it has now back to what we expected. Good quality!"}
{"text":"Well that was upsetting as someone who loves Sammy's I was very excited to see I moved right down the street from it, then it was shut down and turned into an \"Italian Chipotle\" ... Maybe they were trying to compete with their neighbors next door whatever the reason I won't be back. I'll make the trek to a real Sammy's next time I want it."}
{"text":"Love that this new concept is in my neighborhood! Fast, FRESH and on-the-go is perfect for my family. Would absolutely recommend Table 89. Quick service, clean environment and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a DINING experience at a RESTAURANT. NOT: a stand in line, order your food, get your own drink, take your # to the table, wait to be served DELI SITUATION.  Now let me quickly state here that Beto, the waiter, greeter, order taker, should be manager because he is so AMAZING, was JUST as wonderful and gracious and quick to get the food to us, offer additional drinks, etc as he was when this was Sammy's! They are lucky to have him!  However, shouldn't a restaurant afford all the accommodations of being 'a restaurant'. Come in, sit down, order drinks, take your time, order appies, entrees etc, all at the diners convenience and time table? Not the restaurant's?  Table 89 has succeeded in taking the enjoyment out of  meal time.  Their little hook of \"We are committed to using the freshest local produce and organic ingredients from farmers we know and partners we trust.\" Is sure to entice some foodies.   But intelligent, aware foodies are going to look for the words: Organic or non-GMO on the menu. And you will not find them. Because by law, the only way you can state that on a menu is if it is true. Organic ingredients are one thing, organic menu items, meats and produce are entirely a different matter.  Maybe this is a case for the younger hipper crowd who don't mind standing in line to order food, read through an entire menu and order everything they may want to consume, all within 5 minutes of walking in the door."}
{"text":"It was very odd to see this change while picking up my phone order and seeing all those people standing in line. Ordered my usual Greek salad with chicken breast but my surprise, the salad was smaller. Cheaper but less salad and the chicken breast was not a breast but a combination of white and dark meat. Huh ?? What happened to the breast meat ? Fatty, and little white meat. Why the dark meat ? And this new concept of standing around to order is a bit too tacky. Me think not ! I don't think I'll drive to the nearest Sammy's on Sahara to sit down and order. No more family functions or date night for us at Sammy's. Yikes ! Me think not any more. So very sad."}
{"text":"I loved the Sammy's that was here, and was a frequent customer.  The great news is that the menu for Table 89 is an evolution of Sammy's, not a revolution.  The bad news, and hence the 2 stars, is the new self service concept.  It is so ill conceived, that I cannot imagine this location surviving, unless on the strength of its reduced staff, which may have been the necessity behind the change?  In any case, I hate it.  But I love the menu, so I'll just carry out.  Try it for yourself--you may feel differently.  But for me, the concept doesn't pay enough respect to the food."}
{"text":"Order food at the counter and they bring it to you. Great selection of salads, sandwiches and pizzas. Nice place if you want to go out to dinner for a nice meal but don't want to get all dressed up. Note: not all the pizzas come with sauce on them. They will either list sauce as a topping or you could get some sauce on the side to dip if you are a sauce lover like myself. Good food and nice relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the steak and watercress sandwich and the lobster bisque soup.  I must admit, they were awesome!!! The workers there are friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxing. Plus, they have a military discount so that's an A+++ in my books. Thank you for the outstanding service and good quality food!"}
{"text":"On our first visit, I'm very pleased. We had the meatballs (good), tomato and goat cheese flatbread (not a fan) and an incredible prosciutto and pear pizza (LOVE!!) Looking forward to trying everything! We finished up with the carrot cake. Don't do it. You'll be here everyday."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we were on the fence about eating here, I'm glad I ignored the reviews and went in.  First off I really don't understand what all the hubub is about it not being Sammy's or that the ordering is confusing. If you have never eaten at a Fast Casual (Chipotle, Panera, Chick-Fil-a just to name a few) restaurant that has the exact same ordering process there's a sign as you walk in that tells you how to order - you grab a menu, wait your turn and order, they give you a number and they bring you your food. How is that confusing? It's called fast casual, many companies have done this Panda Inn = Panda Express, PF Chang = Pei Wei to name a couple.  Regarding it not being Sammy's. I wonder if these people complain when they go to Ruth's Chris that it's not Morton's or that McDonald's isn't Burger King. I don't get that, if you wanted Sammy's why didn't you go to Sammy's? Makes no sense. A review should be written on the restaurants merits not that its not some other restaurant. Again, glad we ignored these reviews.  Arrived as they were opening for lunch. Got in line, reviewed menu, by the time we were at the front of the line we had made-up our minds.  Gal working register was very friendly and apologized for the wait . . . this surprised me as we really were not in line that long. Long enough to make-up our minds, maybe a minute or two more.  Ordered a four cheese pizza for my 13 yo son, wife got a chicken hummus wrap and I got the mushroom pizza and hummus small plate. Thought I'd mention I was stuck between two items so I thought I'd ask the gal running the register her opinion. Gave me a great reason to order one over the other and I'm VERY glad I took her advice. Grabbed our drinks, sat down and I'd say that in about 10 minutes we had our food. Didn't seem long at all, my son even commented on how fast it was.  Pizzas were awesome and quite filling. My son who typically only likes pizza hut cheese pizza (yuk) loved his. I was only able to eat 1/2 my pizza and my son ate 3/4 of his.  Wife's wrap was great! Peppers, olives, crisp lettuce and hummus (might have been more in there). I asked her what she ranked it and she said a 10. Came with coleslaw or chips and she upgraded to fries for a buck. Fries were very good, cooked to perfection and a nice seasoning.  The hummus, damn the hummus and pita was good, so good, probably one of the best I've had and a very healthy portion (see picture). So much in-fact that I after the pita slices were gone I used pizza crust to finish every last bit. LOVED THE HUMMUS!!!!  Food a 10!  Now the misc. items: Staff was friendly and helpful, restaurant was spotless (even bathroom), great decor, lots of natural light, they have a nice patio, prices are average and about what I would expect for the quality of the food. I didn't feel that anything we ordered was overpriced. Menu had a great selection of items for everyone.  Bottom-line we loved this place and will definitely be back. A great Fast Casual option on this side of town."}
{"text":"Recently did an order by phone for pick up... order was correct, staff was amazing and food DELICIOUS :) Very happy with this experience."}
{"text":"Used to come here 2 to 4 times a month when it was Sammy's Wood Fired Pizza. Always enjoyed the freshness and quality of the menu items, prices could get a bit high but always thought they were justified due to the quality.   Table 89, owned by Sammy's parent company, does not disappoint on it's menu. Familiar dishes and new favorites alike. The quality of the ingredients, preparation, and finished products are great. You definitely get the \"locally sourced\" and \"farm to table\" feel and quality here. And while Table 89 has gone to a more \"serve yourself\" style, they still have an attentive staff that caters to the customers needs and is happy to help. Adding / subtracting components from any dish is no problem. The biggest surprise----the menu prices are 30-40% lower than before!!!!! No loss of food quality and lower prices, count me in."}
{"text":"Having never really been a fan of Sammy's pizza, I wasn't really rushing to check out Table 89. But since Chipotle had its usual line nearly out the door, we figured we might as well check it out. It's under the same ownership as Sammy's but is a completely different \"concept\". Walking in, you'll see a large counter with an open kitchen right behind it, and seating to both your left and right. And while they might be taking the fast-casual approach, it feels a bit \"cheaper\" as it is basically an all self-service restaurant, besides placing your order and having the food brought to your table. All the silverware, napkins, etc. are in separate sections and nothing is at the table or brought with your food. Considering how many similar places will at least bring you silverware with your food, I found it a bit odd.  Moving on, Table 89 actually has a pretty extensive menu. With plenty of apps, salads, entrees, sides and a kids menu, there's bound to be something for everyone. There's also quite a pizza options as well, although I can't say how they compare to Sammy's offerings, since I only went a couple times. I decided on the Mini Duck Tacos to share with my son, and then the Herb Marinated Sliced Steak as dinner.  Mini Duck Tacos - 4 small crunchy tacos served basically smothered in an almost slaw like topping. The shells themselves were brittle, almost stale tasting and since there was very little actual meat on the tacos, it was hard to taste anything else. I did try of a piece of the duck by itself and it was definitely overcooked, with very little flavor. Sadly, the feta cheese and tomato mixture topped with a creamy sauce was the definite star of the dish. It might be the only time I'd say having something other than meat smother a taco was a good thing.   Herb Marinated Sliced Steak - After having read bad reviews about this, I was kind of kicking myself for ordering it afterwards. Much like what's already been expressed about it, the steak was very tough and overcooked. The menu claims its medium-rare, but mine was more like well done. It was barely seasoned and completely masked by the way too sweet lentils. I liked the crispness of the fresh greens on top, but overall it's just not a dish I'd recommend.  With the tacos being the exception, the portion sizes aren't too bad for the price. My steak entree was priced at $11 with a healthy portion of steak and plenty of lentils to go along with it. The wife had a salad, and it was also a pretty good size for $8. Our total bill was $37 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 kids meal and 2 drinks. Not the greatest pricing considering the style of restaurant, but stick to drinking water and you can get out of here for a decent amount.   Since you don't interact with staff too often, I can't say a whole lot about the service. When we first walked in, they explained the system and kind of just sent us on our way. We did have a nice girl check on us once while we were eating, but otherwise you're mostly on your own here.   Overall, everything was just okay. If you're in the area, it's worth a shot, but definitely not worth going out of your way for. It's nice that they're bringing something a little different to the Northwest area, but I certainly won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Close to my office. Convenient, quick and quality food. Meals are inexpensive and very fresh. It's a good place to grab a bite with someone else or yourself. I usually get the grilled chicken salad which is excellent! They have awesome soups as well. I'm not much of a sandwich person but I've heard great things about the steak sandwich. The pizza is excellent as well! I would highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great casual dining with great food and a decent beer selection.  Perfect for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I loved the food choices here, an eclectic menu that caters to carnivores, vegans, gluten free, and the pizza lover! I enjoyed my grilled steak on lentils, it was cooked more than medium rare but still good, with a topping of greens.  We also ordered the sirracha tofu which was a nice appetizer and healthier than ordering fries and I would definitely make this at home! I love that they had a selection of wines, I tried a ginger beer which was very nice, my bill came to $19.  Part Two, what makes this restaurant different is that you order up at the counter. When you walk in there is a stack of menus to order from and then you proceed to the counter. I was meeting a friend and the girl at the counter suggested I take a menu and I could sit down. My friend arrived and she also took a menu and sat down. Ten minutes later we realized by the card holder on the table we needed to order up at the front. To be fair there is signage but we both made the same error. The setup looks like a regular restaurant, so there is no line management to make you think otherwise.   Part Three. We discussed how one would classify this restaurant. I said fast food, she disagreed, and I have to agree it is not fast food either, but I cannot classify it as a full service diner. It is modeled after Sizzler, and we do not see those around anymore.  Part Four. Overall, I loved the food, however, for the $19 I spent, I would prefer to spend a little more for full service. I probably would not drive the 20 minutes to eat there, but if I was in the area and there were dietary restrictions in my group I would.  Just a note, two times this week, counter people were unable to answer simple questions about how the food is prepared. I was perplexed when I asked the girl if the ice tea was caffeinated and she was not sure. I tried a second way, is the tea herbal and she responded it is brewed. Which brings me to another point, it would be nice to have a complete list of beverages!  PS You have great gluten free choices, it would be nice to have a pizza too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 4 1/2 stars, however that wasn't an option. This was our first visit, and we loved it!  Very friendly, and helpful staff. Nice vibe and decor. We really enjoyed the music.  Alternative, and very soothing, We have looked high and low for a good mahgerita pizza, and FINALLY we have found it. Just the right amount of cheese, tomatoes, and basil. The crust was the best that I have ever had. Super yummy delicious! The chicken salad was also yummy. The spices on the chicken were very tasty.  My husband and I were very satisfied with the prices, and  portion sizes.  As we were leaving it felt as if we had just eaten at a gourmet  restaurant, and all for under 25 dollars.  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This used to be my FAVORITE place to eat. LOVED the food and the staff!!  Now, all I can say is the staff is polite and still a positive but the EVER changing menu and establishment is disappointing at best.   We come in and the menu has changed yet AGAIN.  My pine nut pizza is GONE and so is my steak salad????  Just gone...and the menu is becoming less and less. After being told the only two things I ever ordered were no longer on the menu, I grabbed my friend and we went down the street to Market Grille Cafe where thr food is great and consistent!!!  So sorry to see this place make so many poor decisions lately. What a shame."}
{"text":"Ate duck tacos, meat balls and New York pizza! With a pitcher of beer and a craft of wine. Really cool atmosphere, nice people and pretty good food! Will eat there again!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is super cute and I love the ambience here. The service is very good, though some might consider it slow--but it's a small restaurant and isn't too busy, so I think it's fine. The food selection is nice, they have salads, wood-fired pizza, wraps and other dishes. Definitely a cute restaurant closer to home :)"}
{"text":"The wait staff are helpful; on the other hand, the manager (possibly the owner) could not be bothered.  She had no eye contact, an unhappy facial expression, and the demeanor that says aloud, \"Do Not Come Back Here!!\"  Well, I'm not going back there.  I miss Sammy's."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for the incredible food.  Different concept where you order from the counter, but it still works basically the same.  Its a bit more self service than a restaurant but I would definately go again.  Now for the food...  Pork sliders - awesome, comes with bbq sauce and chips Thai salad - great taste, just the thing if you don't want to eat heavy margherita pizza - if you love sammy's pizza, you love this steak salad - nice salad with steak cooked medium fried chicken - more of an appetizer plate but very juicy chicken  The fav - meatballs!! Great appetizer dish, comes with 5 meatballs so everyone can share.  Wait time for food was only about 15 minutes and was a very good experience overall."}
{"text":"My husband got an order pulled pork sliders w/fries  (additional cost) I ordered a lame version of a Mediterranean salad w/salmon (additional cost) For 2 people $30 would have paid for the groceries to make these meals at home with leftovers to spare. 2 stars or cleanliness and air conditioning."}
{"text":"Yes, we all miss Sammie's, but it's basically the same menu, just a little smaller, & actually it is the same company, just a different concept. Food is still really good, just more casual. It's really ok. Give it a try again, really!"}
{"text":"Glad there is a restaurant of this caliber  in the Northwest where choices are few and far between.  Came here Friday evening for dinner. It was fairly busy but casual and enjoyable dining experience.   I liked the quick order at the counter, fill your own drinks, and seat yourself system. Reminds me of the \"upscale casual\" dining I'm used to at home.  It was quick, efficient, and you don't have to sit around waiting for service (which also leaves the door open for less obligation to tip-- but you would of course given the follow up wait service.. i.e. clearing plates, bringing boxes, refilling drinks, etc.).   The kobe sliders and fries were pretty good and simple. I enjoyed the sundried tomato artisan crust pizza and small plates meatballs with marinara. Both were delicious and fairly filling. The messy sundae was the BEST PART -- 1/3 whipped cream, 1/3 hot fudge, 1/3 vanilla ice cream. It was a great and decently priced ending to the meal.. especially for a sweet tooth like me. My fiancee split it with some left over to spare so it was a pretty hefty size.   Would definitely come here again for no frills/hassle, quick but not too fast, dining.  P.S. It just dawned on me that Sammys is a San Diego based restaurant which may explain my affinity for Table 89 and why the type of service is not a surprise to me.. vice what previous commenters are saying (which is a little aggravating). The \"style\" of this restaurant is not unusual in Southern California. Some days I want to enjoy my meal for 2 hours and other days I just want a quick in/out."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!  Honestly one of the best salads (Grilled Chicken Salad) I've had in a long time.  Produce was clearly farm fresh and tasted like \"real\" vegetables.  We also had the goat cheese and tomato flatbread.  Yummy!  Just the right amount of goat cheese.  I enjoyed ordering at the counter, the ability to fill our own drinks, and find our own seats.  Casual, but convenient.    Staff was friendly and helpful.    All in all, I'm impressed!  Already planning a return trip next week!  :)"}
{"text":"Went last night with my husband and daughter and we had a good time. Omg their duck tacos are to die for. Ordered their kobe beef mini-burgers and the meat was perfect. Their menu is casual and caters mostly to people who enjoy trying new flavors. They offer sandwiches, a couple of pastas and salads. Their service was good. We'll be back, the place is perfect for a casual nice meal. They also have an outdoor patio where you can eat."}
{"text":"What happened to you?  You used to be Sammy's and now you are a more casual, redesigned version of Sammy's.  The ordering process was confusing.  I think they may have been trying to make it like Rachel's Kitchen, but it is just kind of weird.  Are you supposed to get your own plates and silverware or do they bring those to you?  Do people take your drink orders or do you do that up front?  The food was good, just like it was when it was Sammy's with most of the same menu items although at smaller portion sizes, and just a little less expensive than before for regular menu items, but our tab was more than before since they got rid of happy hour. We were excited to try it out, and my husband and I might come back for lunch, but we probably won't bring company or have a date night here."}
{"text":"I really love Sammy's. We used to live in San Diego and have been visiting Sammy's restaurants for over 15 years.  In fact, I would say we have been there hundreds of times.   One day I went to our local Sammy's for a birthday and it was suddenly a table 89.  Some familiar items but mostly not.  All of our favorites:  Gone except Chicken Tequila Fettuccine  and Hummus.   We ordered what we liked and were shocked when it was so.much.smaller.   Smaller portions at the same price.  I wasn't happy at all.  They changed the lobster bisque recipe too, so now it tastes canned.  :(    The atmosphere we had spent almost every birthday and special event at for years is GONE.  It's like a fast food restaurant now where you have to keep getting up and down to go get your own silverware and drinks.  Making it more confusing, no one tells you about this at first, so you wander around, confused,   I guess if it had Mac Donald's prices, that would be cool, but it doesn't.    Today we decided to give it another chance.  After glancing at the menu, we can clearly see that it is now even smaller.   No more Pasta, so goodbye Chicken Tequila fettuccine and Hello nothing but mostly lettuce salads.  After viewing the menu, we couldn't find one thing left that we liked on the menu besides hummus, so we left.    Sammy's you have left us out in the cold.  Table 89 is 86'd!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but it seems like 90% of the menu is just the old sammys wood fire pizza menu, and they got rid of all the wait staff and you order at a counter like your at McDonald's. No on the surface there is nothing wrong with that, but the fact the prices are just as high and portions still just as small makes me give 3 stars.   For me it's just seems for the price I really expect more, and if you are going to rebrand a restaraunt don't just axe all the servers and come up with a new generic name"}
{"text":"Table 89 has redeemed themselves! The food is great and the staff is very friendly. Although we miss our regular server, the management here is very attentive and professional.   By the way, they also fixed the ceiling tile! This place is always clean and a delight to dine for lunch."}
{"text":"Got a discount coupon from Sammy's Wood Fire Pizza and since I hadn't been there in a long time I grabbed my SO because she had never been.  Imagine my surprise when I parked and couldn't find it.  Instead it was this eatery with a number for a name.  \"What the heck.  Let's try it\" I said tossing my discount coupon in the trash.  Met by a peppy hostess who filled us in on the drill of ordering at the counter.  Ordered a pizza, salad glass of wine and a beer.  Was given a number to identify us to table runner and told to find a seat.  Thought the price was a bit harsh given the fast food methodology of this place.  Dining facility was comfy.  But I prefer the traditional server takes your order and brings it to you model when I dine out.  Please bring back the old Sammy's service and food.  I won't back to eat by number."}
{"text":"First, we understand that the folks from Sammy's still have ownership of this location. And it is always nice to have a new restaurant open in the neighborhood. We tried to get by here 5 or 6 times a year under the Sammy's name and always enjoyed the wine selection, although it seemed a touch pricey. At TABLE 89, it's basically an 'order at the counter' situation; sort of like ordering at.....say a Fuddruckers. It's billed as a globally inspired and locally produced restaurant. The menu is certainly modern with lobster bisque, mini duck tacos, watercress sandwich, arugula n beet salad, and tofu in a few places. The $18 Merlot carafe netted 2 glasses, but the by the glass price was $6. As an appetizer, we tried a 'small plate' meatballs n marinara for $6 . They were well presented and tasty. For the dinner entrée, we ordered a 4 cheese pizza that the wife and kiddo described as cheese on dough. I ordered an $11 chicken Caesar. The salad was good and I really liked the grilled garlic bread; but as a lo-carb guy, I only get is a small taste. I wouldn't say there was great or even good value here.  And as a restaurant with no servers to bring anything (not even flatware), I struggled a bit to understand the giant spot on the charge receipt for a typical restaurant tip. They even had the typical 15, 18, and 20 percent tip calcs. I do appreciate great service (see my other reviews) and regularly tip 20 to 30 points; but this would be like tipping at the counter at Rubios and then before even seeing the food. In the end, I can't say that we'll be back anytime soon.  Overall, (for $59.18;  2 glasses of wine, a side of meatballs, a salad, and a low to medium quality pizza),  I'd say we should all let this concept have a chance, but I wouldn't bet it'll make it past the 1st year."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer...parking is horrible!  My son and I went there for a \"fundraiser.\"  Never been here since Sammy's closed down but figured why not.  As we walked in, we were greeted by the order station.  The woman at this station was very friendly, and helpful with the ordering (1 star.)  The place was pretty busy, but did not seem overly crowded.  You can see the chefs cooking behind the counter (not the food), but can see people cooking.  We both ordered the Kobe Beef Burgers.  They did not ask us how we wanted them cooked, and I guess it's my fault for not telling them.  There was a special request on our order, and the accommodated with a smile (1 more star.)  We waited 15 minutes and our order arrived.  Both of our orders were cooked medium with a lot of pink (we prefer well done), however, we ate it anyway.  The burgers were very tasty and other than the pink, prepared and presented ok (1 star.)  We would go back and try it again, and recommend at least one try to everyone.  Total $22.70."}
{"text":"This place has changed since it was Sammys. The food portions were smaller and the food was mediocre.  The shrimp Thai salad had a refrigerator taste. It was cold,  the shrimp had some char from the grill but they were cold also. The hummus was thin and pasty. The Kobe sliders were lukewarm. Apparently  ,the restaurant doesn't stock mustard , no never we were told.  The beer was flat. Coconut shrimp was the bright spot. We all shared food and all had digestive issues 5-6 hours later. Never again !"}
{"text":"Used to come before when it was Sammy's.   The menu is good and the food was good.   I had the steak and watercress sandwich and my daughter had the grilled chicken salad and we shared hummus.   Great flavor and very fresh.. Just don't like the new system.. I'm not a fan of staring at the hostess while picking out something to eat.   Overall not bad.. Will come again."}
{"text":"1000x better than Rachels Kitchen.  They actually season their food.  Also way better than Sammys.  Glad to have a new dining option over here."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy & fresh. Kale Cesar Salad was the best. ordering is a bit confusing at first ( not knowing if you refill your drink or not ) but its one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! My lobster bisque actually had pieces of lobster in it. Expected to just have a hint of lobster. My grilled chicken salad was extremely filling. Great place to go for quick lunch"}
{"text":"We went here the other night and were not disappointed. I ordered the a Mediterranean wrap which was really good and my boyfriend ordered the bolognese which was the best thing ever! I normally do not like meat sauce and I ended up eating everything he didn't. We also ordered the Cesar salad which I wouldn't order again just because it had way too much dressing. It was good though so if ordered maybe just ask for dressing on the side. The only negative is that it's only open until 8pm. I wish it was open until 9 at least. We will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Used to come here when it was Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. Now it is a strange mash up of fast food type service with average food. The concept here is strange and appears more like a way for ownership to cut costs by not having waiters and servers than something that benefits the customer. Want a second beer? Go back to the counter and order one. Also take out your credit card and pay again.  The food isn't very good and certainly not worth the hassle they force you through to get it. Go somewhere else because this place sucks."}
{"text":"We loved this place when it was Sammy's. It felt weird using the new system. However, order and pay first is actually kinda nice. Especially for large parties going Dutch. No need to split a bill at the end of the meal. Food was great. Service was awesome as always. Menu prices are lower. Now we can go back more often. Boys love that their pizzas and messy sundae stayed on the menu. I had the kale and romaine Caesar salad, yummy. My hubby had beef over lentils, very tasty!  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Ive been twice. The first time i tried the hummus chicken wrap. Not bad but over doing it with flavors. Trying to mix too many things into one. Also got the wagyu sliders. Not bad but not much to them. The second time we go the tequila fettuccine and the \"fried chicken\" i quote it because it was more like chicken jerky rolled in salt. It was disgusting. Again with the flavors. Why would you serve kimchi with fried chicken? The alfredo was good but the portions both times are very very small. I feel ripped off. I want my money back and i will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"The food is great I ordered a Tofu Curry Bowl which was delicious, except I wish I was served more shrimp (had 3 pieces in a bowl) or at least noodles since it was $12 and it wasn't filling enough. As a result, I had to go and order a New York style pizza which was $14 for a 10 inch since I added chicken. In total, I paid about $26 + tax for ONE person since my first dish was not enough to satisfy my hunger. It's a new concept, and the food is healthy, they have gluten free options, vegan food, etc. However since the dining is self serving, I would assume that they be more generous in the quantity of food they serve per order."}
{"text":"Where to begin??? Location: Sucks Parking: Sucks The beginning does not bode well... As you enter, you'll be struck right away that this place is not your standard dining experience. That was a turn off for me. The food selection was confusing to me, it seemed to be all over the place. Some say, \"eclectic\" I say chaos. That was a turn off for me. My family ate and they selected choices that they could live with, nothing jumped out at them. I was too turned off to eat. It was a little pricey for what they got. That was a turn off to me. I won't be back.  Here's a suggestion for the manager: Shut it down for a day. Take your entire staff, including every person, to Nordstrom Cafe at Fashion show. If you model your business after them  and serve high quality meals like they do, you might make it, even with the parking situation."}
{"text":"Shrimp grilled really well. Curry shrimp and shrimp ad in to the salad both. Bisque is good, not to creamy, not a huge fan of the order at the counter and seat yourself as apposed to being served like the sammy's. Still have some of the pizzas that arent any different. They put dark meat in the chicken salad :( . Tuna sandwich is good. Worst thing is no wait staff, but they do drop at the table like Jason's deli."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a Thursday. I'm sad to see sammys wood fire pizza go, but I like this restaurant better so it's all good. The moment u walk in, the smoky aroma of a wood-fired oven reassures u that u picked the right place to eat. It's a more casual sit down restaurant. U order at a counter & a waiter brings your food and wine in 5-10 minutes. Staff was polite, decor was nature-friendly glass, stone, greens and Browns, and the best part....food was local, organic, lots of vegan options and totally delicious!!! I had marinated steak Caesar salad with glass of Sauvignon blanc....mouthwatering good! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Dull.  Uninviting.  Confusing.   We walked in tonight with good spirits.  We've seen this restaurant by going to other nearby restaurants (i.e. Chipotle) and noticed it was the old Sammy's Woodfire Grille.  At first glance, the restaurant seemed hidden.  As we walked in, we were puzzled with the ordering process.  There weren't any friendly workers to ask questions or any greetings from anyone, not even smiles from any workers.  The people in front of us were taking their sweet time looking at the two menu monitors, so we waited.  When it was our turn to order, I mentioned to the cashier that we have never dined in the restaurant, ever.  Hoping for a response, we instead got a blank stare.  We didn't want to take a long time, unlike the people before us, so we preceded to order quickly.    We decided to order the lobster bisque, meatball with marinara, cheese bread and steak sandwich.  The cashier finally spoke and asked \"...and for drinks??\" as if we were annoying her with our order.  The rest of the dinner continued on to be below average.  It was actually too quiet.  Everyone was whispering because the ceiling are too low and walls too close.  There were no background music to even enjoy.    The short end of the story, I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant by choice.  The food was decent, nothing to rave about.  I wish the service was friendlier and more inviting, after all there are other restaurants a lot friendlier just outside their doors.  I don't ask for a high quality presentation or a big welcome, just friendly faces and appreciation."}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly there. The food was good. Like the concept for carry out orders, not the self service. The prices were the same as Sammy's. Prices should be lower due to the new concept."}
