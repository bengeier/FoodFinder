{"text":"The first time I came here was 8 in the morning for Liverpool!
Then, I came back yesterday for my friend's birthday~ they don't have a drink menu, but they can make ANYTHING you want~ We had a good time~ a lot of beers and shots!"}
{"text":"I would give this bar a zero if i could, but unfortunately that's not possible. 
After a group of my friends and I arrived from a family christmas party to have a couple drinks before we ended the night, the door man refused to let us in because he claimed one of us had stumbled on the way in. This was probably due to the fact that we were in formal attire and heels and it was snowing and extremely slippy out. he was the extremely rude to us and plugged his ears as we tried to reason with him. overall i would classify the experience as extremely unpleasant. 
on our way out i mentioned that I was going to spend my days ruining the credibility of the restaurant, and this is me fulfilling that promise."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Aug 2012 at the roof patio. Food was ok for a pub I guess, standard menu with no surprises and fair dishes. Service was below average. Too many tv sets around for a patio. Small separate place in the back for smokers - not too friendly for a big open patio. Bit overpriced as well - would rather spend that amount of money to go a restaurant trying a new dish or better cooked. Overall average rating although it looks great from the street view."}
{"text":"We went to Scallywags for a team dinner in January after work. I choose a small Cesar salad - it was the worst Cesar salad I ever had. The dressing was awful, no big pieces of Parmesan, and small tasteless croutons (probably from a store bought package). The steak that I ordered to be medium rare came fully cooked and the fries did not taste and look as home cut. There was no steak offered with choice of veggies, baked potatoes, or sweet potatoes fries. My coworker also got a well done steak (instead of the ordered medium rare) and was not happy as well. 
No drinks or wine menu - even a printed page. 2 types of white wine, 21 types of beer (as per the waiter but she stopped after the fifth offering) but everything about my coworkers asked was not available. From imported beers, Stella Artois was available. 
I did not complain because I did not want to spoil the mood of the rest of the people but I will be not coming again in this restaurant. May be being on the patio will make difference but I am not willing to find out."}
{"text":"The reason that I'm giving Scallywags 3 stars isn't for the food, it's for the fact that this is what it is: A drinking hole that shows the games on the telly & not for a meal. 

We went to see England play in the Euro 2012 and it was fun! Everyone was totally into it. 

**this place is to have a beer & watch the game not for eating**"}
{"text":"Best place to watch soccer on the weekends. The servers are all awesome, and the management is great. New cocktail menu is really tasty. Make sure you order the CHICKEN CLUB with the fries!"}
{"text":"I was recently meeting someone who didn't know the neighbourhood too well around Yonge and St Clair, and I suggested Scallywags, simply because you can't miss it. It's a yellow, three-storey monster (rooftop patio included) with a dozen or so international flags hanging off its fa√ßade. I didn't get the full appreciation of Scallywags' capacity at the time, since it was early on a weekday evening, and the place was pretty dead.

They have a respectable, if not too exotic, selection of good beers on tap, and seem to strike the balance between sports bar and pub. Their website even lists upcoming international sports broadcasts (mostly soccer), so you can know when's best to go (or stay away, depending on your tastes)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Sunday morning to watch the F1 race (I don't have cable).  Although mainly a soccer bar, they kept F! on a TV for me with sound for the entire race.  Staff were friendly and accommodating, making me feel like a regular on my first visit.

The soccer breakfast was good and substantial, keeping me full right up to dinner time.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you don't go here you won't miss much and if you go here you won't gain much. The best thing was that they had a nice little corner for us to play our board games. Tries the curry fries - its actually some bastardized form of fries which are basically regular fries seasoned with curry powder that to Indian garam masala with jeera served with a mango based mayo.

The Garlic bread looks appetizing for sure. I think its a good place when you have friends and want to just grab something"}
{"text":"What a dump!

The famed patio looks like it never got finished, with the untreated floors and walls put together with mismatched pieces of plywood.

The place is chronically understaffed to the point that you have to get up and get your own beer and order food from the bar yourself.  No wonder the waitresses are grumpy.

The cheap tight ass owners of this bar should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I really wish this place was better. It's in a very convenient location, and the atmosphere is okay. But the food and service need to improve for me to frequent there more often. 
In its great defense in the Yonge and St. Clair area there aren't many great patios, (and with our city trying to end the restaurant industry - another story) it's got a great rooftop where one can have a pint in the summer and enjoy the sun. So go for that. 
But in the winter I tend to avoid downstairs, and go to the more cozy Fionn McCools next door, despite being a chain."}
{"text":"Chain-fake Irish pub feeling. Bad looking food. Drinks are...of average to slightly above average price. St. Clair at Yonge doesn't have a lot of options if you want a quick pop, though, so I'd go back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and they have good reputation. Foods are pretty good. Atmosphere was good, too. However, their services were not so good. I went there very often when I was online dating for the first date. I went there to meet different men every time, so they thought I was slut or someone and they were not nice to my date. Then I stop going there."}
{"text":"Booooooo!! This place is so overrated. 

  My girl and I decided to check this pub out because my boss recommended the rooftop patio. Yes the patio was nice and large. The food however was both overpriced and horrible, and the service quite subpar even for a dive. 

  We usually frequent the Fox and Fiddle right up the street. Although it isn't fantastic, it also has a large rooftop patio with friendly service, more reasonably priced pub grub and drinks.

  The Deer Park area has only a few choices for some pub atmosphere, yet I would suggest any other establishment in the area over Scallywags. We WILL NOT return."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)

I have been here a couple of times -- once for lunch and once for drinks. For lunch I had their fish and chips. I was actually pretty impressed. I find that pubs are a hit or miss for fish and chips. Either there is too much batter and not enough fish, too greasy, over cooked, etc. However the batter was nice and light and the fish tasted fresh. Their fries were nice and crispy too. It was a huge portion -- 2 pieces of fish. I had to take half of it to go because I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. 

They have a nice rooftop patio as well, which is nice in the summer time."}
{"text":"What a sad place with the worst \"management\". Called in to reserve a spot on the patio for my birthday and was told that no reservations necessary since they will have plenty of space once I arrive for 8:30pm. However, upon my arrival the bartender said - \"it is really dead today so we decided to shut down the patio\". I was very confused at that moment and she advised me to come back to speak to the manager. When I asked to speak to him/her now she made a call, laughed on the phone and 5 min later \"manager\" showed up. First of all, not sure why I had to come back but more importantly, without introduction he nodded his head and said \"Hey\". Made up a lie that someone was sick and didn't want to open the upstairs not realizing that the bartender already spilled the beans....HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Any football or rugby game you want,great breakfast,great staff.open as early as the first match"}
{"text":"By far the best nachos in the neighborhood. I was however sadly disappointed to bring a friend here after raving about how good they are to discover that they don't offer nachos on their lunch menu. Our waitress was great and tried to convince the kitchen staff to make them for us anyway but they wouldn't budge.  We had our drinks and moved onto another pub for our lunch nacho feast. So for that I'm only giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"It gets 2 stars from me.  It's an ok bar. I would suggest however going to the SCC 2 doors up it's a much nicer bar.  Scallywags is one of 3 bars on the corner of Yonge and St.Clair. The other two being Jester on Yonge and The Sports Center Cafe.  Scallywags is probably the second best option, the first being the SCC, and the worst choice being the Jester.  I'm not sure exactly how the Jester stays in business, because the wait staff are the worst I've ever encountered.  Scallywags is marginally better, but I wouldn't eat there.   All in all it takes like 2 minutes to get to the SCC and is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Yes, it's true. Service is very nonchalant (not with a smile) and the food is worrisome. 

I wanted to catch up with a coworker who was at Yonge and St. Clair and I was researching some \"pubby\" places to go to nearby. Scallywags ended up being the closest to us on a cold, blistery Thursday.

It was very busy at 6:30. We walked up three flight of stairs only to find out the patio area was closed for a private party. Signage would have been thoughtful but that's asking too much. The bar area was packed so my coworker and I managed to find a half booth/half table seating in the corner at the back of the restaurant. 

There was no service for about a good 20 minutes which was awful, but because my expectations of the place was so low, it just confirmed what other reviews had mentioned. I knew what I was walking into. Our waitress was, I think, the lady who also manned the bar  and you could tell she was just worked to the dickens. Even though they have 20 beers on tap, the three my co-worker wanted were not available so he opted for Ginger Ale and Rye. I opted for a glass of Cab Sauv, which to my horror, ended up being $9/glass (I ended up ordering 3 glasses). Exorbitant for something that tasted stale.

My coworker warned me not to have the steak. Done. We ordered the quesadilla's for an app and that hit the spot. Gooey, Cheesy and warm. That's where everything went downhill after. My tuna with mango and rice was half cooked. Now, the thing is, I know you can eat Tuna completely raw (which I am okay...it's got that dark, purple, almost translucent shade to it). On the other hand, completely cooked tuna, looks, well cooked (white) and flakey. My tuna was half flakey with red veins running up and down the piece. I was so grossed out by seeing the blood vessel that I just ate the rice. I was thinking let me order some more alcohol to sanitize what I am about to eat.

Dessert consisted of a heavy chocolate cake for my co-worker and apple crisp for me. 

Really, as other reviews indicate, great place to have drinks and beer, but please be wary of the food. I think to date, you cannot go wrong with the burger (which my co-worker said was okay) or the Quesadilla."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food, overpriced drinks, nothing special, just a standard pub fare"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of things going for it that make it a solid venue - plenty of space, easy to get to using public transit, & helpful yet not hovering staff who don't mind if you loiter all evening long just as long as you're buying.

Food and drinks are average price and quality, but do the trick. There's nothing groundbreaking or \"must-have\" about Scallywags, but it's a comfy and welcoming environment (doesn't seem as dank as other nearby pubs) and it's especially great for groups. 

I can't speak for the times when it might be bustling with sports fans (there's quite a few screens about to watch games of various persuasions), but on a general week-night it's a great option for getting together."}
{"text":"Came at 4:30 on a Saturday, headed right for the rooftop patio. Weather was perfect for it. The floor was surprisingly not busy; maybe about half capacity. I had a Leffe Brune and sweet potatoe fries (wasn't overly hungry), both delicious - especially the beer. Prompt service, a couple of games on TV. I'd like to come back and try an entree for a fuller impression but first impressions are good!"}
{"text":"I think my review deserves to be amended slightly.

I had the opportunity to eat at Scallywags for lunch this week with my coworkers and I can say with confidence that I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Even my coworker who shared in my unfavourable opinion of Scallywags as our team lunch destination enjoyed his meal.

Perhaps the occasion on which I ordered the fish and chips was a one off experience. This time around the fries were golden and crispy, either because they fried them just right this time or used a new type of fry.

Service was still a bit slow. That and accounting for my previous experiences I feel I cannot give Scallywags a full 5 stars but I can probably feel good about returning again."}
{"text":"This is one of my goto drinking spot with friends. I love the patio upstairs in summer or winter. Nice beer selection on tap. I must admit - the food is average but always had good service. Like watching sporting events here. In fairness, if this was strictly a food rating - it would be two or three stars. I love having pints on the roof patio."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Came here the other night with some friends who live close by  and we sat on rooftop patio and it's was fabulous. They have it all later out with wood and benches surrounding the entire area and heat lamps  when they open the roof completely. The staff was lovely and very attentive.  They had a nice section of beer on tap and great options to pair it with. I only had a little taster of my friends quesadilla but it had great  flavour and was a big portion size. This place hAs a lovely decor and intimate  setting on the patio perfect for intimate outing with friends or date or even just hanging out because they have two communal ping pong tables making it a nice social activity while having a drink or post dinner."}
{"text":"Decent service and drinks (Mill Street Stout) when I went today. I haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"A good place for a pint. Basic food. Love the patio upstairs. Great atmosphere. Great place to watch \"the game\". Service is awful though - you could sit there for 20-30 minutes without even being noticed. Don't be afraid to flag someone down! But at least dining and dashing here is a viable option...?"}
{"text":"Scallywags is nothing spectacular, nothing to write home about.  It truly is an \"A-OK\" establishment.

The service seems to be a bit hit or miss.  Sometimes it looks like their is only one waitress for the whole main floor.  My experience with the waitress demeanor has been one of necessity.  You will get served, but don't expect a smile, or for them to check on you often (especially if you are at the back of the room with a group playing games).  I will say that the staff is very hospitable in allowing patrons to bring their own games and play for as long as they wish.

For the food, the burger is pretty solid.  Get it with the spicy fries and some gravy, and it is a good cheat/pig out dinner.  I have tried the french onion soup - very bland with large (and far and few between) pieces of red onion.  I also found the quesadilla's to be boring as well.  If you do order the quesadilla's, and want salsa on the side, they will charge you extra for it.

The location is great for meeting with friends.  Right at the subway, bus and streetcar.

If you are looking for a place to play games, gather with a large group of friends, or watch a sports event (tons of tv's in this joint), this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I just have to write about the amazing lunch special I had at Scally's today.  Mahi Mahi with grilled vegetables and roasted potatoes for $13.99. It was soo delicious I asked the waiter to give my compliments to the chef.  I work at St. Clair and Yonge and there is a lot of restos and pubs to choose from.  I'm definitely going back to Scally's!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but they serve alcohol, so I've visited quite a few times.

I usually come here for late night Friday drinks with the husband. The service is quick and friendly, the drinks are decently priced, and the bar doesn't smell overwhelmingly like a dish machine. They serve Strongbow on tap, so they're automatically great in my books! Plus, they have a rooftop patio that's covered and heated in the winter!

I've also been here for a couple of games night UYEs and the service is a little slower on these nights, plus they don't do separate bills, which is kind of a drag. Luckily, yelp people are always packing smartphones."}
{"text":"Ten bucks for a small plate of romaine with a couple olive flecks (Greek salad). Nine dollars for a side of sweet potato fries. This place is a joke. The server was friendly in stealing my money on behalf of the owners, though."}
{"text":"Alright, so since I live in the area I thought I would give this place another go after a year since my internet was down and I didn't feel like going to Fionn Mac Cools. I like to hold grudges... but am open to giving things a second chance.

The people who work there now are very friendly and the place has a nice atmosphere. Good selection of drafts. Haven't really had their food so can't vouch for that.

Probably would have gone back to this place earlier if I was a soccer or rugby fan. Be warned, this place is packed when there's a big game!"}
{"text":"Appetizers are good. Nice beer selection and fairly good service. I just don't really enjoy the kind of crowd it draws. A lot of mid thirty people who get wasted and reminisce about how they used to get wasted when they were 20. I have had a lot of creepy men check me out and be very very loud. I would recommend coming here as long as you don't mind a very loud atmosphere and possible creeps. It's a nice grab a pint after work kind of place."}
{"text":"This is an absolute disaster of a restaurant that is nonetheless worth visiting occasionally if only for the gigantic rooftop patio and bar, which is loaded up with TVs. The entire menu appears to be cooked from frozen and more often than not burnt, and the service is a tragedy. But hey, the patio. I've learned to lower my expectations in the neighbourhood of Deer Park."}
{"text":"I came here twice on Fridays; the first time was in the evening and the second time was at noon. My first experience was not a problem since I was just there for an hour and I only ordered a glass of beer. However, my second experience was very disappointing. I came in a group of 15 people with a prior reservation. My group had been waiting for an hour and our food wasn't still arrived. We finally cancelled all of our order. I wasn't sure what happened in the kitchen, they only apologized and said they were very busy. I understood that, yet they still managed to serve other groups that obviously arrived after my group."}
{"text":"Food: Slightly average. My quesadillas were so so. I wouldn't order it again but I did finish most of it. Heard the fries are really good though.

Service: Great. The staff don't hound you and they pop up at the perfect time. I was surprised our server remembered everyone's name and orders as well as she did."}
{"text":"We held our rehearsal dinner here on the second floor.  The way it works there is that you can rent the floor for free and they just keep a tab of food and booze.  The room was clean and they recently updated the formerly run-down stairwell, which made my in-laws (who felt that the staircase was previously icky) happy campers.

The food is run-of-the-mill pub grub.  For our group we had a mix of stuff like wings, bourekas cut in smaller pieces, crudites, pizzas, and bruschetta.  Nothing was \"wow\" though I thought the bourekas were mighty tasty - but nothing was offensive either and it seemed appropriate for a low-key gathering.  They laid out craft paper on the tables so we could draw with crayons which was a nice touch.  We had one waitress dealing solely with our group and she was helpful.  

We had two hiccups - one was that the bar upstairs doesn't actually have kegs attached so all drink orders had to be shuttled from the bar downstairs back up.  The second thing was that we only wanted to offer wine & beer but somehow this got lost amongst the staff and essentially our event became open bar.  Shots = much more expensive tab at the end of the night.

Overall it was a great low-key place for a group of about 40.  It was nice having the place to ourselves, we still had roof access which was awesome, and everyone was easy to deal with in booking the space earlier.  If you're going for that sort of vibe, and not a \"foodie-ok\" dining experience for your group then I'd recommend the place."}
{"text":"Best nachos in the city. Best rooftop patio. Service is good on most days with an occasional 'wooopsies'.  Moroccan cigars also to die for."}
{"text":"Manchester United Fans rejoice! There is a pub in Toronto that officially calls themselves \" the Official Manchester United Bar\".
If your looking to catch a Champions League game, Premiership game or World Cup game Scallywag's is the place to be! 
The place does get pretty packed for the big games, so come early and don't wear the opposing team jersey - you will get harassed, unless that's your thing.
The wait staff is....well...there to serve a bunch of over intoxicated wankers. Well some of them are real wankers, the other like to be called wankers on game day!
The food is average, and the multilevel seating area's provide ample space for larger groups. When a game isn't on, the pub has a good atmosphere, and nice rooftop patio for those warm summer nights!"}
{"text":"I don't visit this end of town very often but I couldn't help but be impressed.
We're talking about a massive rooftop patio which even has ping pong tables, TVs showing various sports at the bar, decent beer selection with reasonably priced pints ($7.75), and while I didn't eat the food, everything seemed under $20 which is encouraging. 
The vibe was relaxed yet social, with a cross section of all ages making up the demographics.

4 stars for Scallywags, which will be my go-to patio option in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Since 2006, I've visited Scallywags around twice a year to watch Chelsea matches. For people who aren't that excited about football or rugby, I can see why this place would be a little lackluster. The thing is, the real draw here IS in fact the accessibility that the pub provides to English Premier League games and the cheeriness with which they host them. The Chelsea FC Supporters Club in Toronto meets here religiously to cheer on the blues, planting themselves on the rooftop patio and shouting shamelessly at the screen as they inhale eggs/toast/sausage and beer. What more do you want on a Saturday or Sunday morning? Scallywags provides me with that wonderful camaraderie and atmosphere that very few people in the States (at least where I live) have about football (soccer). The service can get hairy when there's a crowd, but generally it's not a major problem. There are three separate levels and the rooftop patio is fully enclosed and heated in the winter. If you want a place to watch a game with some new friends and ex pats, you've found it!"}
{"text":"Lacklustre service.  Waited almost 20 mins to be asked for a drink.  

However the food was good and they have a ping pong table lol"}
{"text":"Um. Sorry, but if you're going to charge me $10 for a burger, I'll expect it to be larger than the slice of tomato that came with it. Call me crazy.  Nice ambience and excellent on-tap beer selections won't make up for that, dude."}
{"text":"Amazing place to grab a beer and watch a nice, quiet game of soccer. Very romantic...juuust kidding! It was rowdy and loud and full of super good looking English/Scotting/Irish football (soccer) fans. My friend and I did enjoy the vast beer selection and had a great chat on the patio.

The patio is great, with a huge bar, a lot of TVs and different quieter/louder corners for your liking. Downstairs was kind of lame...no one was really there because there weather was nice and the patio was veeery enticing! 

Great bar for kick back at if you're around the area :D"}
{"text":"A google maps failure brought me and my traditionally pneumatic dining companion here. We were trying to find an Ethiopian restaurant and it was about -20c and, well, any port in the storm when you're cold, hungry, and tired after a week of work. 

As the other reviews hint at, I think this is probably a pub with an established crowd who use it to congregate and watch British/European/Antipodean sporting events like rugby, soccer, and Aussie rules ringette. 

In summer, I'm sure the upper deck is at a premium.

However, Friday night, 7 pm, in December when it's -20c and the Christchurch Lady Crushers are not taking on the Hobart Women's Holocaust in their storied thrice yearly ringette grudge match (made famous in Nick Hornby's 2003 novel Ringette Ragnarok in the Rink), well, I think this place best serves as a convenient local pub and place to kill a couple hours when the Yonge subway line breaks down, again.

The food, meh."}
{"text":"I have given this place 1 star because based on what it says before the star descriptions I wouldn't even specify this as an I've had worse. It is in one of the bottom 5 restaurant experiences I have ever had in my life.

I used to go by Scallywags for drinks all the time years ago when I lived in the area. I am not sure what has changed but after my last visit I don't plan to return.

I arrived with some friends as part of a large group (around 30+ with a reservation made well in advance) to watch the Toronto FC vs. Santos Laguna CCL semi-final game.

The waitress started off well and took our drink order on arrival. As a bar that used to be known for their Guinness, I learned that this had been switched for a Mill St. alternative which is \"very similar to Guinness\" (it was not). During this time I had a chance to look over the menu as I was quite hungry at the time. My girlfriend also arrived about 5 minutes after and didn't get her drink order in with the first order. This is where things started to go bad.

First problem. It took them about 15 minutes into the game to figure out how to get the sound to work! This is a bar that is known to be the home bar for Liverpool FC supporters in Toronto and they can't figure out how to work the sound!?!?

We both by now had time to look over the menus and were ready to place our order. About 10 minutes had gone by since my girlfriend arrived and the waitress finally came by and when she tried to order her drink she was told that she was still trying to take other people's first drink orders and walked off.

Finally she comes back, takes our orders and the waiting begins. The food was out in a reasonable time but by now over 20 minutes had passed and my girlfriend still hadn't received her drink. We flag down the waitress to see what is going on and she says they are busy and it will be out soon. 25 minutes now passes and I tell her it might be best to just go to the bar and order her drink as we notice that is what other people in the group have started to do. She tries this, but is told that they are making her drink in the next few minutes as she walks to the bar. Finally around 30 minutes the bartender comes by to tell her that they have run out of the item she ordered! No apology, just asks what she would like instead. This situation created a negative mood at the table as the game was almost halfway through the first half and no drink.

Next problem. The food. I ordered the chicken wrap w/ ceasar salad, and my gf ordered the chicken burger. I have never had a worse chicken wrap in my life. All ingredients inside were overcooked, there was no sauce whatsoever making it even more dry and it contained some of the most disgusting spinach I have ever tasted. Fortunately the waitress took both these items off our bill when we explained to her that my girlfriend couldn't even bite into her chicken without hurting her teeth (it was that hard!). We were offered something else but given both our dishes were this bad and another person at our table didn't like theirs either we figured the problem was not with our choices, but the person or people preparing the food.

In the end the waitress made up slightly for some of the service errors at the beginning but it was a little too late at that point. I understand places can be busy and understaffed but that is no excuse for just ignoring us when we ask things and saying she is too busy at the moment.

I remember I used to enjoy their rooftop patio in the summer for a drink or two and they are probably still good for this as long as it is not busy, but I would not reccomend this place to come watch a game or have food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great for sports - lots of Aussies hanging around watching the rugby match. Plenty of beers on tap, with some decent choices like Tankhouse. The food was very standard pub fare with a few interesting exceptions - one of them being sweet potato tater tots. They were good but the quesadillas were pretty mediocre."}
{"text":"Echoing Nicole H's review, Scallywag's is a good halfway point for a group of people who may live in all parts of the city. On the weeknights, it's pretty quiet (unless you are here with a group of Yelpers playing board games). What I like about this place is that it's only steps away from the subway. Not only that, but the seating is comfortable, the music is all 90s hits I listened to in high school and - you know you're getting old when you say this - the lighting is comfortable for your eyes.

This isn't a go-to place for grub though - stopping at the Pizzaiolo might be a better bet. I've only had two of the three variations of fries, but have heard enough complaints about the food here. Granted, I have seen people eat here, but they are often safe bets, types of food that you can't screw up (i.e. fish and chips, sausages, quesadillas, etc.)

And from personal experience, never, ever, EVER order the curry fries. The mango mayo that goes with it is interesting, but the fries tasted as if they were tossed through a stale 12-year-old curry powder spice box at the Bulk Barn. They were so bad I just asked the waitress to take it away."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Scallywags.  

I was craving a Chicken Club Sandwich so that's what I ordered (without lettuce).  It wasn't fancy and was good.  It was nice to have real bacon rather than microwaved instant bacon.  The fries were crispy and hot.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a Liverpool fan (unfortunately) and I come here a few times a year to watch a game.  I have never been over impressed with the food but it's fun to hang out with other football fans.

They have an inability to handle large crowds and my most recent visit was a good example.  The staff run around in circles, they bring the food out with no idea where it is going and they don't check on their customers.  Not one time did they come by and see me during the second half and getting to bar yourself is impossible.  

As mentioned, the food is ok at best and is not exactly cheap.  The beer is quite expensive..in most cases, you're paying nearly $10 for a pint. There are a lot of TV's but they are small and/or of poor quality. In many cases, they are hard to see because pillars or people are in the way.

My last experience was the nail the coffin and I just won't go back...or maybe I won't go back until the Reds make the Champion's league again.  Either way, I think I'm safe."}
{"text":"To summarize: their food is overpriced cardboard and their service is terrible.

I visited Scallywags for the first time this Wednesday with my sports team under the delusion that we would receive an advertised team discount. Turns out we didn't have the card they required to receive the discount so we couldn't get a discount--this is fair. However, then the waiter announced that some kind of discount would be made available to the team despite not having our discount card, took our orders, then returned only to rescind the aforementioned discount. Because I was led to believe some form of discount existed, I ordered a meal that was a lot pricer than what I would have normally gone for.

I was really excited when the food came relatively fast following the order, but was quickly let down by the quality of the food. Regardless, I gobbled down the food because I was starving. The waitress had forgotten the order of one of my team members, and so I notified another waitress about the situation. The food arrived AFTER everyone else was finished with their meals.

So, what I'd like to point out is there was terrible service, and addressing service flaws to remedy situations is entirely ordinary. People ask waiters about missing food orders all the time. That said, I was shocked to later learn that the management at Scallywags went out of there way to notify the organizers of my sports club about our \"rude and aggressive behavior\" toward the staff. I emphasize the fact that I was shocked, because in my mind there was absolutely nothing out of the ordinary with the way I handled the situation.

I believe it is entirely unacceptable that Scallywag's management would blame their inadequacies as a business to serve customers properly on the customers themselves."}
{"text":"The customer service I received tonight's from Andy the general manager (GM) was possible the worst I have years living in Toronto. It was so bad I was almost funny yet not very funny.

Here is the back story folks. On May 5th, 2015 I called Scallwags to make a reservation for a ping pong tournAment for 8 of my friends. The hostess passed me onto a female member of their management tea who informed me that the was an existing reservation for the ping pong table for a group on Saturday may 14th, but the Friday the 13th she could accommodate our party and would be willing to reserve the table for us fro 8-930. I thanked her as she took down my contact information, confirmed the reservation and then invited 7 of my friends for an evening of games and drinks. From this one would gather it is common practice to make reservation at this establishment esp. Since they confirmed another party has the table booked for the 14 th.

This is where is all goes south.

When I called tonight just to confirm the numbers I was informed in a rude and accusatory tone by the GM Andy that \"there is no way I would have a reservation and this never has happened nor would happen in future\" thus accusing me of basically lying. He then demanded to know the names of all of his staff members I spoke to and when I was unable to recall the names of individuals I spoke with over a week ago he refused to help correct this mistake of make any accommodations for our party. He also continually told me I was wrong and inaccurate

Warning - if you make a reservation anywhere ask for the names of the entire staff - whoever you speak with lol - this must be a new thing.

In this case I was made to feel like not only is the customer never right, they are also lying! Trust me as a busy professional I have better thing to do with my time them scheme to get special treatment as a casual local pub like Scallwags. The GM has placed the fact we do not have a reservation for this evening on me - the customers who called and received a confirmed reservation in May 5th, 2016

I also was spoken to in a tone that suggested that the GM felt \"I should no better then to expect a reservation on a evening the raptors are playing\" - um is that not the point having staff to confirm reservations either way - hence the reason I called in the first place!

Andy's behaviour at the management level is why our city continues to have one of the worst reputations for customer service in North America."}
{"text":"Wonderful patio space, mediocre food, lackluster service.

There are two ping pong tables in the patio space, but you might be chasing after balls in the dining area depending on how good your skills are.

Food was really just ok. We got a jambalaya and a pad thai (sigh yes, I know, my fault for ordering pad thai at a sports bar, probably should have gotten fish n chips or a burger), and suspect that the same tomato sauce was used in both our dishes as it was very similar.

The ambiance is really nice, especially if you get a table facing the street; however, the service was pretty bad. We had to spend a while waving for the waitress so we could pay while she was standing by the bar seemingly looking in every other direction than where we sat.

Meh, could've just have been a busy night service-wise, but I don't think we'll be coming by again."}
{"text":"So, I'm an Arsenal fan, and this is just the best spot in TO to come watch a match, hands down. This is the only way I've experienced Scally's and the atmosphere is awesome, the staff friendly, and the breakfast options are also great. And the Moroccan cigars...beautiful.

Sadly, I cannot give it more than 2 because the BEER sucks. When it comes down to it, this is a bar, and any time I come here, I'll have breakfast and tea, but won't touch the beer. If you're lucky, about the best beer you can find is something from Mill Street. I made the mistake once of ordering a draft macro lager and it was disgusting. I like good beer, so it was a mistake to order that in the first place, but damn this beer was skunky. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. And that's too bad, because when I come to watch a match, I'm there for 2-3 hours and I'd consume a generous amount of beer, if it tasted good. Could you not stock some bottles of some decent beer rather than the swill that you're serving. I'd imagine that some of your clientele would appreciate it. Those that don't have plenty of macro lagers to choose from."}
{"text":"Hubby & I went here yesterday to grab a snack before my sewing class. He had the Spicy Chicken Wrap with fries & I just had a side order of fries. The pub wasn't too busy since it was a Sunday & early in the afternoon. But there were a few people there having a drink & watching games on their big screen tv. The pub has an upper level with an outdoor patio but we stayed inside on the ground floor due to the humidity. It's small, but well kept & clean. The waitress on duty was prompt & friendly. The food was good. I would come back again to try a burger when I'm in the area. Great thing about Scallywag's is that it's so close to the St.Clair subway station."}
{"text":"First the disclaimer: I have probably been to Scallywags more times than all other bars in Toronto combined--yes I am a regular.  Basically, I hang out in the patio on the third floor with a bunch of people that I know.  The staff are very friendly and the food is okay.  The bottom line is that I imagine that I will be going to Scallywags for many years to come."}
{"text":"If i were more of a drinker, and less of an eater, and blessed with greater tolerance for rude, indifferent service, Scallywags would probably be my local. 

A three-floored yellow monstrosity of a pub, Scallywags anchors the southwestern corner of Yonge and St. Clair, an area with no shortage of pub options, but a definite dearth of fine pub grub. Fionn MacCools, a Fox and Fiddle, and a few indy pubs round out the immediate competition. I'd rather skip them all and have a tuna melt at the new Kivas a few doors down. 

Dinner feels at once rushed and ignored by a server who registers her disappointment when we prefer non-alcoholic drinks to the hard stuff. She spends the meal rushing back and forth between tables, and up and down stairs to the kitchen, sometimes while we're in the middle of ordering. It's an inconvenience to tell us about the specials, and a request for bread service (to go with someone's meds) is met with outright hostility. Plates arrive out of sync. We're left to our own devices until the cheque comes, and thanked for our patronage, in passing as we leave, server's behind planted firmly on a barstool. 

Food varies widely from visit to visit. A proper hangover cure of a breakfast may be the best thing on the menu. Properly scrambled eggs, crispy homefries with fluffy interior (they may be pre-made, but they're good, and nicely seasoned), fat pork sausages or crispy bacon and buttered toast ease the regret of lost brain cells from the night before. 

It's a shame about the coffee, which aspires to suck. 

In case you were wondering, French Onion Soup does not belong in an English pub. A few stray onions lurk beneath huge hunks of bread bathing in canned beef stock. The ichor  bubbles away under a blanket of mozzarella. It's a mixture of salt, MSG, and dread. Better to go with a caesar salad. It's also salty, but at least you can see the vegetables. 

A chicken quesadilla is off-puttingly sweet, and just tastes off all around. It passes across three plates, and comes to rest largely untouched. Our server is unfazed by the forlorn tortilla. 

This evening promises two chicken sandwiches, one crispy with cheddar cheese and promised (though unremarked) avocado mayo, sided with competent onion rings. The other version is simply grilled. They're both dry and stringy. 



Burgers are huge and juicy, sided with fries and all the fixins. Fish and chips is crispy and flavorful one visit; pale and limp the next; overcooked to sawdust on a third try. It's good enough to roll the dice. 


If you're up for a longer walk and still fancy a bite to eat, better to visit the Rebel House further south, or Cam's Place up near Sporting Life. Both options feature more homemade fare, and friendlier service. Further downtown, I'd take the Queen and Beaver any day."}
{"text":"First time here and I wish I've known about it from before. Watched Jays - Royals Game 6, so I ended up leaving sad. But the food was good, although the menu was very basic, we were thinking it was a temporary menu for the game. The venue was pretty well set up. Two floors, upstairs patio was heated and had a roof, and tv's everywhere. Hidden gem, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to go grab some food and drinks and watch a sports game."}
{"text":"Scallywags deserves a solid 4* at the very least for the unique atmosphere it offers. 
I find Scally to be by far the best place in TO for watching soccer (especially EPL). The fans are passionate, and the establishment understands knows exactly how to cater to them. Scally offers a no non-sense menu that has been just OK in my personal view. The farmer's breakie, and goat cheese omelete are the two items I have enjoyed more than others, though I often settle for only tea. 

The service is great if you happen to be served by the Scally old guard! Overall, I would suggest ordering only drinks when it's too busy as the kitchen can get backed up during busy fixtures. One fella who makes a huge difference at Scally is Pedro. Even during the busiest games he is always quick, courteous, and professional, and this is no small feat considering how crazy this place can get at 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be for live English football/rugby matches. Due to the time difference, the matches are typically early in the A.M., before they are able to serve alcohol. Despite the less than impressive food menu (considering it is located in an area undergoing a gastronomic renaissance), expats and passionate footie fans alike fill the bar to capacity on matchdays. They're known among patrons for their \"Soccer Breakfast\", which is somewhat of a ripoff to be quite honest. In fact, if I had to rate Scallywags solely based on food quality, it would do no better than a 2.5. However, I do think that the unique and lively atmosphere makes it a Mecca for Torontonians who appreciate the beautiful game. The three floor pub has plenty of seating room and televisions but do arrive early for the big games as the place will fill up fast!"}
{"text":"Once you get inside and upstairs you'll be amazed by the atmosphere. Great place, staff, draught beer even pingpong and games.
And I was happy for a change to be served by a happy Irish barman from Limerick.
Don't walk by! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband one Saturday afternoon and we had drinks on the top floor patio. (We were walking by on the way home and figured we should check it out!) Friendly service and a wonderful patio. Will definitely be back for drinks soon!"}
{"text":"Scallywags is AAAAIGHT. I've been here a few times now for the infamous Yelp Board Game Events and they've always accomodated us graciously as we while away the evening surrounded by Scrabble, or Scattergories or Zombie Fluxx. (You must play the latter if you haven't already.)

The food is more miss than hit. Their beef burger was so-so, and I would definitely avoid the curry fries. I've heard rumours about their pad thai, but that's yet untried by me. They do have quite an impressive list of pints though (including Guinness), so I'd prioritize grog over grub in this establishment.

The bar is fairly spacious and they apparently have a large second floor that can be booked for events. When I have been there, service has always been friendly and fast and the location couldn't be any more convenient transit-wise. It's located at the southwest corner of Yonge and St. Clair Ave, by the St. Clair TTC subway station. A solid \"compromise\" spot for friends that live uptown and downtown. In the 'twain ye shall meet! Why am I talking like this.

Obligatory Title Pun: Perfect for KNAVE-L gazers.

Menu Readability: You know, for a pub menu it's not bad. Kind of twisted typefaces; definitely not your standard \"Duke Of\" nonsense.

Need to mention: A reliable place to catch soccer and rugby games. I've watched many a World Cup and EUFA match here.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm prepared for a zombie attack. Are you?"}
{"text":"Had the chicken linguine dish and it was amazing!!!! Great pub type atmosphere, friendly wait staff, comfortable and casual dining and good beer selection."}
{"text":"Wow while reading all these reviews I have to say it's been a totally difference experience. It's Sunday the bar on the patio is half packed and I just ordered the most amazing nachos ever. (chicken and chili ..) . Give it a try , the indoor patio is available in any weather ."}
{"text":"As the name intimates, it is raucous and is geared for that experience.  It has a sprawling rooftop patio and is great place to watch sports or head out with a group of people for drinks.  Felt no temptation to try the food.  My experience with service here has been exceptional."}
{"text":"Does what it says on the tin. A dive that is good for watching sports because it has so many tvs, but not much else. Service is there, but not overtly friendly."}
