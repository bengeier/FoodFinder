{"text":"I've eaten here many times, and I've found that their breakfasts are great any time of the day. It's worth paying the extra dollar or two to get an omelette for dinner!"}
{"text":"Upon a recommendation from two different police officers, I went to Angelo's family-type restaurant. after seeing a movie at Cinemark.

The first time my mom went with me and the second time my family.  When asked by the waitress if everything was okay, my husband responded \"Excellent\" --which he doesn't say very often when we eat out.   The rest of the family gave smiling responses, as well. Food was very fresh and nicely presented.

It is very clean but the lighting and wall colors are too low key.  For us, the really good food and the friendliness of Angelo and his wife over-shadowed the decor..

We are from the West Side and love eating at Joe's Deli in Rocky River. 

 Guess what?  Angelo cooked at Joe's for ten years before he opened his own place.  

Breakfast was delicious and so was our dinner.

Try it,  the food is generous and good!"}
