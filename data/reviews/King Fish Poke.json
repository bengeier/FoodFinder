{"text":"Would highly recommend this place if you're ever in for something light, but still fulfilling and YUMMY! The staff was awesome! The food was delicious! One of the owners came by the table after 10-15 min in of my Poke bowl and was very welcoming, made sure my Poke bowl was everything I wanted and needed with a great variety of proteins, mix-ins, sauces, and toppings how can I ever not be satisfied. My stomach was for sure in for a treat. I'm not a picture enthusiast, but the Poke bowl was beautiful! Thus, I would highly recommend this place with such a friendly environment and great food! Would definitely make a trip here again."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'm pretty picky about my sushi and King Fish Poke exceeded my expectations. The quality is one of the best I've had for any sushi place. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I may become a regular..."}
{"text":"King Fish is in my usual hangout area, so I thought I'd try it out. Like the minimalistic interior a lot :) definitely insta-friendly! A fan of healthy food here. All the ingredients are really fresh. I enjoy the combination of salmon and sushi rice with their special King Fish Sauce. Adding edamame and roasted seaweed slices is also a good idea."}
{"text":"So, so unbelievably happy they opened a Poke bowl place... and it's right in the University area. The staff was really friendly and welcoming, I was warmly greeted as soon as I walked in. As for the poke bowl itself, they have two options: regular or large. The difference between the two is the amount of protein. For the regular you have a choice of two and for the large you have three. The portion size is definitely worth the price. The regular standing at 8.95 and the large being 10.95. All their fishes were super fresh and the variety of toppings and sauces is definitely what makes this place special. Their yuzu wasabi sauce is so refreshing & tasty. If you're looking for something fast, but a more healthy alternative.. definitely check this place out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This poke is so delicious! Until today, I hadn't been able to find poke like I had in Hawaii. If you don't eat raw fish, there are other options. This is a MUST HAVE!!"}
{"text":"very fresh ingredients... went in on their first day of opening and it was BOGO... what better deal than that? maybe because i am from nyc and never had good service before but the people working there was really nice. A+ on food and on the services. their sauce is amazingly yummy"}
{"text":"Great service and fair pricing there.  Their ingredients is fresh and good.  Will definitely come back and dine again."}
{"text":"You get so much food for $10, and it's all so good. Staff is super friendly and approachable. Indoor seating is extremely well decorated. Love this place"}
{"text":"I feel this place has reached the pinnacle of food technology. The sushi burrito is my new favorite thing. I wish I lived closer because I would definitely be visiting more often. They have excellent food and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great service. Staff was super nice and the food was awesome. I got the regular sized bowl and I'm taking a full bowl home even after I ate. The amount of food you get for what you pay is awesome. Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Food was fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"King Fish Poke is by far one of the best, reasonably priced, poke spots in Charlotte. There is a wide variety of fresh ingredients and toppings to ensure you get exactly what you're looking for (I love the puffed rice, which adds an extra crunch). The staff was very nice and the atmosphere is ideal! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in the University area. They have so many options and choices. Will be visiting often."}
{"text":"Raw fish of Chipotle. A little bit pricy but it's totally worth it. I love the sauces they use. I feel full and healthy walking out of this place every time."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to go if you enjoy sushi bowls and sushi burritos. I recently visited myself and was IMMEDIATELY satisfied with the customer service, the food, the price, and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. The employees will treat you with the utmost respect and the portion size of the food are VERY generous for the price. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone that enjoys sushi items such as salmon, tuna, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, etc. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Yooo this place is really good.  They give you 2 options of regular and large, and the portions are a good size as well - all at a decent/good price.  You can either choose from the menu or create your own bowl.  There's a variety of proteins, sauces, and toppings to add to your bowl as well.  The staff was also really cool and chill.  I had a lot of questions regarding the toppings and sauces, and they explained everything.  The Korean sauce (forgot what it's called) is !  The other sauces are good as well.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've always loved sushi but was skeptical about trying a poke bowl. I am now a regular at King Fish Poke. The food as well as the staff are top notch!!"}
{"text":"Living and working on this side of town keeps getting better. I stopped in for poke and can't wait to try their sushi burritos too. Fish was fresh and generous. Love that they had suggested poke bowls with their favorites or you can build your own. The regular size was enough for two meals on easy to devour in one. I can't wait to come back and try more of their sauces."}
{"text":"I will not go back to the old place I had before finding this gem! The food is delicious, the fish so much more tender and the customer service was incredible and I felt so welcomed. I'm sold! I had a signature Poke Bowl (The Braveheart) and modified it slightly to add in King Fish Classic sauce to cut down the spice of the Sriracha Aioli. Both sauces were amazing on their own. You can tell a lot of time has been put into making and crafting them. One of the owners served me and spent time talking with me. Genuine people with heart and passion for what they are doing. Love it, will be back!"}
{"text":"Fish is fresh! Try the pork before they raise the price. Pork is must have! Clean space, nice people. For sure will go again"}
{"text":"Delicious! The restaurant was very clean and new. The ingredients are super fresh and light, perfect for lunch!"}
{"text":"First time trying Poke. My sister and I got a sushi burrito! The service was great and the owner greeted us and asked us if we thought the food was good. He was super nice. I love the sauces! My favorite is the sriracha aioli and king fish sauce. The salmon and tuna was super fresh. The decor inside is simple, modern and nice. Definitely would come back and try the poke bowl."}
{"text":"Delicious, low priced, fresh, great atmosphere and a very friendly staff/owner.  Highly recommend going here and checking them out!"}
{"text":"Just a wonderful product however you want.  Totally would go back for the same for dinner.   Lovely place, nice people and the ability to create what you want.   It all tastes good together, just get the things you like."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon bowl...  Everything was super clean and staff was friendly and helpful.  Portions were very generous and everything tasted fresh. Will be back often!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely going to be a regular! The franchise is clean, simple, yet elegant. The food is freshly made with a variety of options to choose from. The staff and owners are friendly with excellent customer service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty. Loved the variety of toppings they provided. They still don't have some ingredients such as avocado and the king fish classic sauce but that's understandable considering it is their grand opening day. Overall, you won't regret trying it!"}
{"text":"So good!!!  Not what I had expected but it delighted me.  I had the burrito with tuna and salmon.  The fish was tender and tasty. I loved that you could add as many toppings as you wanted.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a healthy and delicious option."}
{"text":"With the blue rail extension and now this new Poke spot, it looks like the University area is comin' in hot!  King fish is located in the Total Wine/Ashley Furniture shopping center off of WT Harris. It's located at the top, right near Jimmy John's.  It's got a very sleek, modern feel with not too many tables crammed in there. The menu is displayed on large screens right above the prep station.   This is another Chipotle-style, choose your own ingredients. You can start off with either a salad, bowl (with either brown or white sushi-style rice), or burrito. For my first visit, I chose a regular-size poke bowl with sushi rice. You are then given a choice of two scoops of protein: shrimp, salmon, tuna, or chicken, tofu.  I went with two scoops of tuna and then proceeded to have my bowl topped with cucumber slices, matchstick carrots, diced green onion, edamame, red cabbage, jalapeno. You are then able to pick which sauce you would like added, I went with gochujang because I love heat. I asked for it on the side but, normally, they would throw into the bowl to make sure all ingredients are coated. Their gochu is/was delicious. I will happily have them douse my poke bowl with that sauce on my next visit.  There are also extra additions you can have added to your bowl/burrito, etc such as avocado ($1.25 extra), ginger slices, wasabi, shredded nori, and so on.  If you're not in the mood to make that many decisions, you can choose one of their pre-made combinations that are listed on their menu. For as much as you get, the price is VERY reasonable. Total for my poke bowl came to $9.60.   I'm happy to have this place in the area and will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my new home. The fish was fresh and the staff was SO cheerful even with me coming in 15 minutes before closing time. I got the smaller sized salad and enjoyed it. I love spicy food so the spicy tuna and spicy salmon were right up my alley. I can't wait to come back. Is tomorrow too soon? The staff even asked me what I liked? And they really wanted feedback. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Huge fan of poke's bowl and this is by far the best in the city I tried out of the 3 places. Large portion and cheap, also fresh ingredients. The key in poke bowls are fresh ingredients just like if you are ordering sushi. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fish and all the toppings were fresh and tasty. Like the idea of making your own poke combinations with interesting sauce choices."}
{"text":"Decent price for fresh ingredients. Our bowls had great flavor and you get a good portion too. We both created our own bowls and the staff was very helpful walking use through the line. They had a yelp check-in special for their green tea cheesecake, which we were hesitant about but ended up being delicious. We will def. come back!"}
{"text":"By now, I've frequented a number of poke restaurants, so I'd like to think I have a baseline for what distinguishes the superior from the mediocre. Unfortunately, I believe King Fish falls into the latter category. Here's why:  1. The rice to toppings ratio is way way off. They use the plastic bowls here that are very deep so the servers end up filling a lot of the large bowl with rice, since you can't fill the obvious extra space with expensive toppings. So more rice is just jam packed in the bottom until the bowl doesn't look so empty. This makes for a very lopsided meal--totally not balanced. Even if you tried your best to portion out your fish and toppings so that you don't eat it all at the beginning, you will undoubtedly be left with a lot of extra rice that you can a) eat by itself... or b) throw away, which is just wasteful. I suggest King Fish get shallower bowls or something to combat this issue.  2. Although the base prices for King Fish are quite competitive and cheaper than I've seen at other places, I was less impressed after I found out they charge for staples that are usually free--including Kani Salad and seaweed salad! Upcharging for little things like that which are usually free add-ins left a bad taste in my mouth.  3. Finally, my husband got the Niner signature bowl and they told us they had no more mango..so the employee suggested mandarin oranges..which he later found out they also didn't have! This was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch..I could understand if it was late night weekday..but you don't have these key ingredients (mango..since it was listed in the signature niner) during your prime business hours? Hmm..  Anyways, I know they're new so hopefully these kinks will be addressed."}
{"text":"Taste: 4.7 The rice was very tasty! The fish was fresh (do they have a pond behind the restaurant?)! One person in our party: \"It was very good. I just felt like the shrimp tasted a little like a plastic bag. Spicy tuna was phenomenal. Best spicy tuna.\"  Service: 4.1 There was a mix-up with the mix-ins, and multitasking didn't work out well.   Presentation: 4.9 very organized. Colorful. Appetizing. Straightforward. Ingenious.   Atmosphere: 2.2 Not very pretty. Small. Not a lot of space. Loud music. Chairs, weird."}
{"text":"First experience with pokie bowls was in Texas. So I was super excited about this. It's a cute little spot and the staff were super friendly. Food was great. Love the whole freshness of sushi in a bowl. I was only disappointed in the serving size. If you are new to the idea. This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last. Probably my favorite poke spot out of the 3 I've tried in QC. They have generous portions and the price is reasonable. I love how they don't have a lot of extra charges on toppings and mix-ins. They literally only have 3 add-on charges for their toppings unlike other places that will charge you $1.50 for any additional items. Everything was made fresh and delectable! Definitely try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I order the Niner since it was packed with a lot of ingredients and added in crab n seaweed salad for extra fees.  I thought it was be so much like sushi but in a bowl.  It was pretty bland even with the white sauce. The other sauce option were spicy I was told and I decide to pass.  Someone else would probably like it if you're on a health kick or like raw foods.  I thought I would try the burrito on the next time but I'm not into Poke' at this point."}
{"text":"I love poke and I've been trying to find a good place in Charlotte. Omg great bowl! Fresh, awesome flavors! Quick service! You guys have something good going! I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"Tried King Fish for the first time today. Charlotte has been flooded with new poke bowl spots all of a sudden. This one is about a 4 block walk from the McCullough light rail stop, which is convenient if you're coming from the Tryon side of UNCC for lunch, say. I tried salmon and tuna poke with gochujang sauce (which was not really two flames spicy, but still good). Added in a bunch of veggies, some crab salad and avocado, and crunchy bits on top. Verdict: for the price of a pack of grocery store sushi, you get a big fresh bowl of goodness made to order. It's not fancy, the quality of fish is about what you'd expect in the $10-12 fast food sushi price range. But everything tastes fresh and good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is just mind blowing. So fresh. Try it out. I got the pork and chicken bowl with both sushi and brown rice. All the toppings."}
{"text":"Yum this place is good. There is a ton of ingredients to pick from. I went with shrimp and tuna as protein and just piled on toppings. There are vegetarian options and they make a burrito style wrap too which I will try next time. This place is new, its clean and modern inside. I was impressed with my first poke bowl and visit. Recommend, Try it :)"}
{"text":"This place just became my go-to spot for Poke. Moving from San Diego, I had a hard time finding a similar Poke experience but this is it! Everything is on point, the price is fair, the rice is cooked well and served in large quantity, the fish is fresh, the toppings options are good, and the sauces have their own twist. Drove two hours from Anderson, SC just to fulfill my poke craving yesterday. To anyone living in Charlotte, this place should definitely be on your restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I stopped in today because I love sushi and anything associated! The owners were warm welcoming and accommodating! The vibe of the place reminds me of being in a modern tropical costal town. Simple design and nice light neutral color. I ordered a salmon and shrimp sushi burrito with fillings like cilantro, onions, avocado, shredded crab, cucumber red cabbage carrots even garlic crunchy flakes and it was the best and freshest tasting! I was allowed to taste the sauce before ordering to be sure I knew what I liked which were all of them. I was so focused on eating I didn't even take photo guys seriously. I think im going back for dinner I was extremely satisfied and would recommend King Fish Poke to any fresh seafood lovers and don't worry if your bestie doesn't like seafood they can get veggie or even chicken ( I KNOW !!!!!!!!) My drink was a fountain ginger ale with strawberry syrup super refreshing! Thanks for the wonderful experience and even better food!"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem tucked away in the University area! Loved the poke bowl! I got a large and couldn't even finish it. Had to take it home for later. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Quick, clean and generous. I've been on a poke kick lately I've been to three places of this sort in the Charlotte area. All very similar, slightly different price points seemingly based on whether or not avocado is included or extra but it all ends up the same. For about $20, we had dinner for two. We each ordered the smaller of the two bowls and wrangled chopsticks around our bowls until our bellies were full. I would definitely come back here again when I'm craving a sushi-type dinner. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stop by for lunch here yesterday after a good bike ride, and I can tell you that the food was unbelievably good and felt very refreshing after a bike ride. I glad that she found it and I look forward to stopping by in the future for some more protein rich lunches. Also, I thought the price was very good for the the amount of food we received. We got the large three's scoop protein version with brown rice and we had enough food for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, can I give a shoutout to the SERVICE here at King Fish Poke!!! We originally came to this shopping center for the middle eastern grill next door, but saw the poke shop and thought we'd just stick our head in and see what they had. One of the male workers saw us reading the menu and proceed to come over and talk us through the menu, his personal favorite, and recommend mix-ins and sauces and such -- after all that, how could we say no? The woman at counter (it's a chipotle-style assembly line) began to help my companion, and the man who was formerly talking to us put on a pair of gloves to serve me when he realized I wanted to order too, even though I didn't mind waiting for her to finish with my companion -- after all, we were the only two in line. Then, once we got our food, he came over about five minutes after we sat down to check on us and see how we liked it. Every conversation we had with him, he had a big smile on his face. If I lived in charlotte, I would come here for the service alone!  Now, as to what I actually paid for: the food. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our meal; they offer sushi burritos, bowls, and salads. My boyfriend said he wished they had a bit more variety in fish, but that didn't take away from his experience. And all mix-ins and sauces are unlimited!"}
{"text":"This is the cheapest poke bowl place in town I've come across.  $8.95 for 2 proteins and unlimited toppings!    The service was great, they offer samples if you're unsure about a topping or sauce.    Everything looked of great quality - the Tuna tasted like it had been out a bit, but not awful enough to deter me from a future visit.  I got a sushi burrito and a bowl. The burrito  turned out to be a bit smaller than I expected. I had so many toppings I'm not sure how - but I was still hungry after.  So I was glad I got a bowl too.    The rice was a bit soggy- that's all that remained from my bowl.  Overall, I feel like the ingredient prep will get better as they settle in their routine. Glad the University area got a poke bowl spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and the staff was great also.  Loved the layout of their menu, multiple bowl sizes. The seaweed salad was great."}
{"text":"This is gonna be our new spot when we are craving poké fish! Best one so far hands down compared to the other 3 we went to in Charlotte.  This is why: 1) For a poke bowl at $8.95 (Regular-2 proteins) and $10.95 (Large-3 proteins) with the amount of protein you get, prices are very reasonable!! Heck my girlfriend couldn't even finish hers and she got a regular 2 protein size. Not to mention they're very delicious and I finished every bite!  2) You get option of creating your own bowl, sushi burrito or salad having them create a signature bowl.   3) The restaurant is clean, aesthetic, and has a minimalistic feel with a welcoming feel.  Nonetheless, try this place out when you're hungry for poké! You won't regret it! You'll come in hungry, and leaving fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"I think the food is so good! We finally have pokebowl in this area! The sashimi is so fresh and taste so good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a healthy-ish lunch and was excited to try my hand at the \"create your own\" type of bowl. I started with brown rice (I'd read on another review that they give too much rice so I asked for less than normal - which was still a lot of rice!) and chose tuna and salmon as my protein. I then added carrots, cabbage, edamame, jalapeños, cucumbers, seaweed salad, cilantro, green onions, tempura flakes, and spicy mayo.   All in all - I thought it was tasty and fresh. My only complaint would be the lack of protein. Compared to the ratio of rice and toppings, it just wasn't enough fish. With that being said, the flavors were great, as was the price. I still want to try some other poke spots in CLT but will definitely come back here (and ask for a bigger serving of fish) in the future."}
{"text":"It's good for Charlotte. I am a very picky eater and I've definitely had better but for Charlotte it's good. Price can be a little steep but I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Go here!  If you like sushi, you will love this place.  We were going through the area and saw this place on Yelp.  So glad we decided to give it a try.  The ingredients are super fresh, prices are reasonable, and combinations are endless.  I had the bowl with double ahi tuna, veggies, edamame and added crab salad.  Delish, and my only regret is that this place isn't closer to my hometown so we could eat here more often.  Chatted with the owner a bit while ordering, and he was super helpful and just an overall nice guy.  Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING! I didn't know what Poke was until today when I looked this place up trying to find a place to eat. It was fresh, delicious, high quality fish, great serving size, and great customer service! I'm am so happy I found this gem of a place. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I tried King Fish Poke for the first time recently and it was very good. It was tasty and different. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best fish/sushi bowl I've come across in QC. With very reasonable prices and plenty healthy natural ingredients choices, I can easily put together a quick yet satisfying luncheon for myself. Besides the unlimited toppings offer, my favorite is the King Fish Classic sauce was made exclusively savory and palatable. It gives you that creamy lustrous taste of the Shrimp Sauce with a hint of pungent YuZu Wasabi flavor. Place like this definitely deserves a praise and five stars!"}
{"text":"King Fish Poke is one of my new favorites!  I am so pleased that it is a convenient location and after I leave the gym and grab a meal I do not feel bad LOL.  The rice bowls are fresh, the fish is fresh and delicious and so are the combinations. The rice is perfectly cooked and everyone is very nice and helpful who works there.  Many times I will get half rice and half salad to make it even healthier.  Since it was recommended to me, I eat there at least twice a week.  I also love that I can get delivery to Harrisburg with Postmates!!"}
{"text":"First time having poke, and it is so good!  This place is great - super clean, great food, and great service!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poke here in Charlotte! Friendly workers, fresh ingredients and the price is very reasonable. Will definitely be a regular here from now on."}
{"text":"Great place with great options!! The proteins are fresh, the ingredients are top notch. Clean location with great customer service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh fish. Fresh ingredients. Amazing flavors!! House sauce is great, seaweed salad has great flavor.   The food is just as great as the owners, truly passionate and care about putting out a great product. Owner talked to me for 5 minutes to make sure I was enjoying the meal.   Price is excellent especially for the amount of food!!   Highly recommend to anyone!!! I will definitely be coming back."}
