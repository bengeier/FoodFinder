{"text":"The food here was not so bad, it is in the averages.  But prices are not so friendly, it is above the average.  There was no surprise to me, except for soup, that would be my only recommendation."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but unfortunately the last few times I've been it's really gone downhill. The portion sizes are TINY. I ordered a bibimbap and there was hardly any meat in it, I had to order more meat on the side... and the side was tiny!  I don't recommend this place anymore. Someone needs to tell them to increase their meat to rice ratio."}
{"text":"As a Korean, I must say that so far it is the best Korean food I have had in Calgary. It is not truly authentic, and I can still taste the MSG. However, given the limited Korean population in Calgary, I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and the service. I would definitely come back when I feel nostalgic."}
{"text":"Great food ! Have to come again!  Porkbelly was a bit dry ... But love the endless side dishes !!! Major plus."}
{"text":"My favorite Korean resto in the city. Food is awesome, and staff is nice - need to say more? I never waited too long for our food. Sucks though that they are now closed on Sundays. But overall, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"below average korean place. flavors were mild, side dishes were limited, but service was quick."}
{"text":"I ordered bibimpap today, the quantity is a lil small but there's   a variety of veggies , the bibimpap sauce is just right, food is hot and amply served. One thing that set me off tho is the service, after the guy got my order and set it up, that's it. He never bothered to go back and ask if I needed anything or if the food was ok, considering that I and my son are the only ones in the Resto. When I was about to pay, I asked again how much I owe since I'm about to put the tip and he answered \" You can see it there at the beginning \".. I couldn't believe he said that so I explained I passed that and I just need to know since I don't want to go back, he repeated his Previous answer so I went ahead and just added a tip. I then said , \" Maybe it helps if you're a little nicer.\" He's still nonchalant and just mumbled \"thanks \" . As I've said, food is great but the service just turned me off, thus the rating. And nope, I won't be back..."}
{"text":"First visit in Calgary and we found this Korean restaurant close to our hotel.  Ordered Bulkoki  and Dolsot Bab ( hot pot rice mix with sea food and veges ). Bulkoki was too greasy with low grade meat.  Dolsot Bab was extremely salty and not able to add original sauce made for that. The owner says Americans do not like the sauce and they added salt instead. Choice should be by customers to choose sauce.  If you want traditional Korean food, this might not be a place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood pancake and Gomjatang (spicy pork stew). Everything was fresh and the portions were ample. Very good Korean food and nice people. Being from NYC and having access to some of the best Korean food next to Seoul I recommend this place if you crave good JIgae and Tang soups or hot pot while in Calgary."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's small with limited seating but the bento boxes are totally worth it.  Have eaten here and also called for take away.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"The restaurant is placed in a corner of the mall but once you get in, has got a lovely feel to it. The portion sizes are huge and offers quite a variety on the menu. The servers are very friendly and would help to make a choice. The food was very appetising but couldn't really finish it even Ina group of 4 huge men. Definitely recommended for friends and family dinners"}
{"text":"below average korean food but I only come here if I want something quick for a korean food craving. Side dishes were too limited and not to mention small. The portions are waayy too small."}
{"text":"Inside Dragon City Mall in China Town. Small restaurant with limited seating. Went during lunch. You can order on the phone and it was ready when we got there. I had the medium Gamjatang ($31.50) which was huge and seafood pancake ($13.50) both of which I shared with a friend. Meal came with the usual side dishes. It is reasonably good value and very delicious. Service was good. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in a super Asian strip mall. The establishment is family run and more authentic then most Korean places. I really enjoyed their cute decorations and stamp collection as well.   The only thing is the portions are not huge and the price is a bit above average. My soup cane to 15.99 and though the bowl was a decent size it was filled to just above half and only had four small pieces of beef rib.   The fried chicken was really good and worth it. The meat was super juicy and everything tastes fresh   The side dishes were good too but there did not seem to be any refills on it. Their potatoes side dish as mentioned by previous posts were delicious and a must have.   I would come back here again!"}
{"text":"The food isn't that great. More importantly, horrible service by a waiter there. Very unprofessional and rude. I had complained about their service and the bill had a wrong item in it.. and the guy doesn't even apologizes when asked to correct. I will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. Came here for the combo special $13.99 got me short ribs with rice and salad, tempura and potatoes. I loved the potatoes. They were awesome. I think the best out of the entire meal. Short ribs were ok but not bad. Only fall back was portion is not that big.   The place is small but recently renovated. Service was ok. pretty standard Korean place. I do like the fact is the d√©cor and tidiness, cleanness the place look. Better then its competitor in the area."}
{"text":"I got what they call pork bulgogi in the menu but it's really a pork stir fry with lots of gorgeous gochujang and it absolutely blew me away with its deliciousness. I wanted to lick the cast iron serving dish clean. Just completely delicious. I also liked the banchan fine,  especially the daikon kimchi.  Other reviewers have complained about the sizes of servings but I found them plenty ample and they were happy to replenish my sides,  which were uniformly delicious."}
{"text":"Technically a 4.5 stars, but I am bumping it up because a small family run business deserves that extra half star. I have been here a couple times over the last few years. Besides the courteous service, the food has always been consistently good. I have tried the Bibimbap, Bulgogi and the Beef Rib soup, all above average. Special mention is the various appetizers, particularly the fried potatoes. Watch out they sometimes close up a little bit earlier than 10pm if it's quiet (I would try to be there before 9:30pm for sure)."}
{"text":"My favourite Korean restaurant in Calgary (with Hankang being a close second). I think I have tried almost every Korean place in Calgary and I almost always order the same thing: bibimbap. My rating of Korean restaurants is as scientific as reviewing food can possibly be and I do not give the title of \"my favourite Korean restaurant\" lightly. First of all, Soban's side dishes are plentiful, varied, and every one of them is tasty. My personal favourites are the potatoes, fried tofu, and picked radishes. The service is always friendly and they have always been accommodating to removing meat from dishes. They also accept credit cards no matter the amount, which is frankly a rarity in the world of small-hole-in-the-wall-Asian-food-establishments. The food I have ordered has consistently been high quality and everybody I've ever brought with me has said the same. I'm almost glad that it's hidden away in the back corner of Dragon City Mall because I'm hoping less people find it and I don't need to wait (which I've never had to do despite the place being tiny). But this place is too good to be kept a secret and they deserve to be every Calgarian's favourite Korean restaurant!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very small with about 10-15 tables so make sure you come before rush hour (12:00/30pm) to get seats. Used to frequent this korean BBQ with friends of mine because of the korean BBQ that we used to grill ourselves so it was crispy when we would eat the pork belly and such but one day as we walked in, told us we weren't allowed to grill the meat ourselves. Used to be such a great deal to grill the meat ourselves. The food itself is amazing but for the prices they have up right now might not be worth it."}
{"text":"Best seafood pancake I've had in Alberta!  We came here on a whim.  I had just picked up my watch that was being repaired.  Since we were in the heart of China town, which is in downtown Calgary, we thought we'd try something new.  There are lots of authentic looking places in this area.  The seafood pancake was full of seafood.  Most places in Alberta are frugal with seafood probably because we're land-locked.  We also had a sausage noodle stew (I don't remember the Korean name) that was very good.  The portions were generous and now we also have dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Korean BBQ. They have great quality food here. We ordered the short ribs (because short ribs are a must) and the Deboki to start, which consists of rice cakes and fish tofu in a thick, spicy broth if you don't know what that is. They were very abundant with the side dishes that come with the short ribs. Their Kimchi was legit.   The service here is very authentically Asian, I'm sure some of you understand what I mean when I say that. To elaborate, our waitress was extremely friendly but timid at the same time, and very helpful. The prices here are very reasonable and I left a satisfied customer."}
