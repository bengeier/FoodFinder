{"text":"Absolutely fantastic, I found this place is it in the Chevron, Casino Kama convenience store.

My wife had the chicken alfredo pasta and I had the beef burrito that turned out to be steak.

It was fantastic"}
{"text":"I give the 4 stars for what it is. For a gas station restaurant it is good, compared to a normal restaurant it wouldn't get 4 stars. 
I had a house salad and the potato skins, both were good. 
I wouldn't recommend to pick this place, if you can go to an actual restaurant. If you are in the area though it is a great choice."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, friendly service, nice place in the middle of nowhere with good prices and big portions 

The waitress was lovely and more than friendly. It's a small place inside of the Chevron Gas Station with around 30 seats. Everything was clean, the food came fast and it was freshly prepared - NO FAST-FOOD.  

Should I take this route again on a road trip, I would stop there to dine again."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is decent. As many others said, it's not a place you would purposely go and visit, but if you are in the area it's worth it and beats fast food. Service is fast and friendly and ample seating. Also located in plaza near fireworks and casino."}
{"text":"This is amazing place which I have ever had. We choose the beef hamburger, bacon with French fries, chicken tenders. All of them very delicious. And the servant very nice."}
{"text":"Trying to remember what the hell I had eaten here! I know I ate it all and was quite satisfied........This is the problem when you're on the road eating at various places and then wait to post a review! Ha! If it was dog shit I'd remember quick! I come through here often and usually need to fill the tank when I do. I will definitely stop for lunch here again"}
{"text":"only because i really didn't want to leave a 0.... service at this time 12 noon. sucks...  this is the second time... the first gimme the gal had so many customers. it was understood... today i didn't want to interrupt her conversations to place an order. i waited for 15 minutes well she bs with friends. so another customer and i just left... i may try at a different time. if i get the same service i won't return....

{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING, HANDS DOWN THE BEST FRIES I HAVE HAD EVER, LOVED THEM. I Got the hot dog with fries and the included orange with lettuce even tastes good just thought it was a garnish then I tasted it, Delicious. If you have never been Go!!!!! And the service was amazing aswell giving that there were only a couple waitresses, they did a good job."}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times, due mainly to convenience, I was working in the area.

The menu is basically breakfast, sandwiches and burgers. The have also had Mexican specials both times I was there. 

One time I had the tacos, the other time a patty melt. Neither one was anything to get excited about. Frozen burger patty and frozen fries, ground beef tacos canned refried beans and rice.

The only other place along I-15, between Las Vegas and Mesquite, is the Muddy River Grill. If I had to opt for one or the other, I would choose the Muddy River Grill. But if you're not working in the area, you might consider driving on to Las Vegas or Mesquite, depending on which direction you are going, to get something to eat."}
{"text":"I thought this is a hole-in-a-wall restaurant which would add some taste for the day trip to Valley of Fire.

My group stepped in this service station/market without much expectation for food as they don't really show any sign outside.  Menu was nothing special.

However, this nothing-special feeling and their \"we serve food and customer don't leave hungry\" attitude was favorable and somehow nostalgic.

Each serving had plenty of food.

Again, it is a great breakfast stop alongside of I-15.
This place won't be a purposefully destination by itself, but it is a good to stop when driving I-15 with empty stomach."}
{"text":"The host was so pleasant, and service was pretty quick. Like someone said before, not an area I would purposely come out to visit, but I wouldn't mind making a stop here to eat, and pick up a few snacks. 

The  chicken enchiladas are a great go to, and you can't go wrong with their red or green sauce. I've heard that the food here are all home made too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the gas/convenience center, so our expectations were pretty low. However, we were starving after doing some hiking at Valley of Fire and were okay with anything. The waitress was not customer service oriented, our orders did not come back correct (wrong type of cheese, toast, etc), and the fries were undercooked. Instead of refilling our waters (they have other drinks but we were never asked if we wanted anything else), the waitress brought out a 32 oz cup of water for us to refill ours with. Even with the errors and carelessness, the food was decent and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Last minute camping trip at Valley of Fire and we were too lazy to cook at camp so we drove here... the only food place in the area turned out to be not a bad choice! 

Such an extensive menu for just an eatery inside a gas station / convenient store / liquor store. We got a tuna melt, a burger, and their sampler platter. Tuna melt was delicious. The burger was okay and the sampler platter was okay. Service was great."}
{"text":"Its a small spot next to where you buy the fireworks. Their food are pretty basic, their beef stew is really good though."}
{"text":"My work requires that I'm in the area often, so I eat here regularly. The food ranges from OK to pretty good. Hey, it's a truck stop diner. What do you expect? 

However, today my granddaughter and I both got the patty melt. I'm glad she did because she verified my feelings about it: simply outstanding! 

We both agreed that it's just about perfect. Crispy, cheesy, gooey, seasoned just right. I can't think of a more perfect way to ruin all the hard work a hiker from the Valley of Fire puts in than this thing of beauty. 

Service is always good here, too."}
{"text":"According to Amazon, the \"med wt dominion superior 1-7\" lightweight fork presented to me cost the restaurant a whopping 26 cents, and was no match for the $4.99 stones I had served for bisquits and gravy. The fork lost. I'm no expert but it seems like the cheap fork and the hard biscuits are juxtaposed in such a manner as to force an inverse relationship. (y=k/x) and in this context, failure is certain . A direct relationship must be achieved in order to succeed.(y=kx) (Please refer to attached chart) The harder the texture of the bisquits, the greater the strength of the 26 cent fork must be. You can't cut both corners just as you can't defy algabraic logic. Something had to give, and predictably the 26 cent fork yielded to the bending stress required to break off a piece of bisquit small enough to eat. They tasted OK so 3 stars. The real reason anyone comes here anyway is to buy fireworks so I'm happy."}
{"text":"Great value food. $7.99 for BLT. With daily specials availability. Pasted picture of BLT..."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped by here on the way to Brian Head, UT for a pit stop. The Tu Ka Khan eatery serves good food and the server is nice and friendly. We had their carnitas, ham steak and bacon - all very tasty! The place also has a mini gaming area with slot machines and a convenience store / gift shop."}
