{"text":"Do not miss this place! Placed on a corner on a quiet street, they serve delicious sushi! We had spicy crab, some california rolls and yellowtail and all was super tasty. Service was quick and friendly. We were there during happy hour and got 30% off, quite a deal! I would love to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"In a sea of mediocre sushi restaurants this place definitely is the great white whale as far as the quality of fish is concerned. If you're into yum yum sauce or cream cheese look elsewhere because I don't want you at my restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good, the wife and I stopped here on our first day out in Vegas.  Would recommend the Crunch Dragon and the Yum Yum roll.  Only a bock off Fremont, worth the walk."}
{"text":"I actually downloaded Yelp just to leave a review for Bocho.  This place is incredible and one of the best \"whole package\" sushi restaurants I have ever been to.  Prices were awesome...all you can eat for 30 bucks or 30% off happy hour and that includes the alcohol.  The quality and variety is outstanding.  Place has a great feel, staff were all very fun and personable.  I will come back to this place next time I am Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"Very cool place as far as sushi bars go. One of nicest front/bar areas I've seen. Didn't go upstairs so I can't say much about that. We were here at a slow time so service was very quick and everyone was friendly, however no one took our drink order, but that was okay since we both just wanted water. I wouldn't recommend this place to someone who is new to sushi, but definitely come here if you know you love all types."}
{"text":"2nd time here and I love it. The people are awesome. The food is great. The atmosphere is fun and energetic. We're definitely coming here every time we're in town."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant has to be one of the best places down town. It offers a very local feel with amazing service, very reasonable prices, and chill tunes. Our server, Mercy, got us to come two days in a row. She is kind, helpful, and goes out of her way to make sure that your Bocho experience, and Vegas experience, is everything you need it to be. Our sushi chefs, Daniel and TJ, answered questions we had, offered suggestions, and made delicious sushi. The drinks are absolutely amazing. The Soju comes in 4 different flavors and it gives an amazing buzz. It is affordable and tasty!! Overall, Bocho is priced affordably and has amazing service. It is a must visit restaurant that is a few blocks off of Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Great sushi, inventive rolls. Waitress knows her sake!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Was there after 3pm and they took 30% of my bill (its happy hour 3-7pm!)

Uni, sweet shrimp and rolls all super fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite spot of ours. Always delicious food and drinks. All of the sushi is always fresh. The Hamachi Kama is an absolute must try! Located on Carson and 6th (aka about a minute walk off Fremont), we never have a problem parking close. Make sure you stop in the next time you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!! Super fresh, great flavors, and awesome daily specials! Mon- Fri 3-6pm is happy hour and 30% off! The lunch ramen is also amazing and worth ordering. One of the best menus of different types of sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great staff. This place is off the strip, unassuming outside but great culture inside. Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for sushi in las Vegas, stay off the strip and check out this hidden gem just east of Fremont St! Phenomenal sushi, I recommend the garlic tuna and the special roll called \"number 5\". Great staff, drink list, and ambiance. Whenever we're in town, we always make sure to eat here at least once."}
{"text":"Great place and friendly staff, the food was excellent, I recommend this sushi to everyone!!"}
{"text":"We're walking around Downtown Vegas looking for something that is NOT steakhouses, pizza, or diners and decided Bocho Sushi sounded pretty good. It had glowing reviews and good pictures and we decided to pull the trigger. I was a little weary of sushi in Vegas but boy was this some of the best sushi I ever had! We sat at the bar and our chef Joon, prepared us some sushi rolls I had never tried before. He's an amazing chef and even better person. Get the Something Gone Roll and let him or any of the other chefs prepare you something of their choosing - you can give input of course but in these scenarios just trust these creative sushi minds! 

Awesome sushi, great ambiance and sake shots on the house for the entire bar when they close at 11pm!!! Check out the video we posted of it in slomo! 

Highly recommended from a sushi lover like myself."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in #Vegas, @bochosushilv. It's located conveniently downtown, has delicious fresh food, and we always get great service. We're huge fans of their Pink Lady Roll (surprise, surprise!) and their salmon.

{"text":"This a sweet little hidden gem. The food is great. The only thing I didn't like it the garlic tuna sushi. It's probably the worst I've had, however it still deserves 5 stars for a cool location, great menu, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi bar accommodated us when we wanted something specific and they were closing. The waitress gave us great saki suggestions. Locals come here. They even have a karaoke room upstairs. My brother in-law, who is a foodie was impressed. We even checked-in on Yelp and they gave me a free saki. Will be back, next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a little gem in downtown Las Vegas. The atmosphere was perfect and the food was amazing!  There aren't any apparent signs out front so when it's not open you don't really know it's there. Im so glad we found this place."}
{"text":"China, Crunch Dragon, Yum Yum, Carson roll, fried chicken app and Sashimi were bomb.com"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service & fantastic food!!!  One of my favorite sushi places I have ever eaten"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's expectation setting or maybe 4.5 stars in Yelp for Vegas restaurants means something different (is the scale actually 6 stars?).  4.5 stars in Boston means great food and a really nice decor.  Not so in Vegas.

Went to Bocho based on Yelp! and overall the food was good.  I had the poke bowl and a chef selected roll, both of which were very good.  The only issue I had was with the overall outside and decor.  First our cab couldn't find the place (close, but amazingly not easy to spot).  Also, the inside was pretty nondescript.  We were seated in a karaoke room.  Now maybe that is the bigger deal here, but for a sushi restaurant, it wasn't the level of a 4.5 star."}
{"text":"Here's a hint to beat the evening crowd at this small downtown sushi bar: try Bocho sushi for lunch!

The parking is easier and the tempo of the kitchen and chefs it's much more relaxed.

Try a Bento box like their fried chicken Bento, and perhaps add a rock or two, together they make the best lunch at a great value."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The sushi and sashimi is always so fresh and very well priced ! Best sushi I've had in vegas, and I'm from here... they also have an amazing happy hour menu and karaoke rooms when you want to throw private parties. Almost forgot to mention the amazing staff-- very friendly and professional. Super clean, nice bathrooms!!!! 

If you are looking for something good to order, ask about the daily specials, get a scallop sushi, or just order a signature roll like the yum yum roll !!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to get a good sushi place downtown. They have some really unique menu and drink items. The service is great, it's inexpensive in comparison to many places in town and the sushi is very good."}
{"text":"Best sushi Downtown! Best sushi for the price in all of Vegas. Seriously. I prefer to sit at the bar upstairs (21+). 

Great service. Get the garlic edamame. You will not be sad. Actually all of the food here is great & the non fish/raw fish folks will find enough to be happy. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friend raves about this place constantly and her FB photos make me hungry.  Finally got a chance to try it out on Saturday and it was delicious!  We got the scallop sushi, Pink Lady Roll, Number 5, Chicken appetizer,and Sake Sushi.  Pink Lady Roll was perfect mixture of textures and flavors.  Chicken was deliciously seasoned and fried to perfection.  But our all time favorite was the scallop sushi, sweet with crispy onion and some sort of amazing sauce.  We loved it so much we wanted to pick up some scallop sushi on our way to the airport.  Sadly, they're closed on Sunday. Oh, did I mention very reasonably priced?!!"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's 25th birthday and it was most epic. We were in a cute lil room that fit the Whole Squad singing, well screaming, karaoke. They kept bringing us sushi platters that tasted like heaven. And they had the most pleasing sauces. The employees were very personable. 

Bochos is phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Bocho on our last night in Vegas. It was a Monday night, so it was a little empty when we arrived. We decided to do the all you can eat menu. It was amazing. Lots of choices to try at a great price. The rolls were delicious and finely crafted and we even had fresh oysters. They were as fresh as if you got em off the coast. 

In addition to the great food, the whole staff was really cool. We were treated like old friends and the whole staff was very engaging. It totally capped off a great vacation in Vegas. Looking forward to visiting Vegas and Bocho soon."}
{"text":"Our sushi chef Dex was amazing and custom made us an order entitled \"Something Awful\". Everything from the tuna belly to this custom masterpiece (picture included) was perfect and the service was all but impeccable. Come mid afternoon and you can sit at the downstairs bar and have a nice one on one with your knowledgeable chef. Ask for Dex,  he's a cool guy who knows his shit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. All-you-can-eat sushi lunch for under $30, with delicacies like uni and ebi?? Yes please. Sushi was supremely fresh. I've eaten sushi at some of the best places on earth, and this stacks up among the best I've had state-side. I walked out stuffed and happy. Go here!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. The sushi chefs and hostess were so friendly. The sushi was phenomenal. Delicious and fresh. This was better than any other place I'd eaten"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding! We are so glad to have a great sushi restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere right when you walk in plus the sushi rolls are too knotch.  I'm visiting from California and I will definitely come back with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way through vegas and were surprised at the excellent food. The sashimi was amazing, the presentation beautiful, and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi!!
The chef is very friendly.
The yellow tail lover is the best I had. Very fresh fish."}
{"text":"A great place to try when in Las Vegas. Friendly staff, amazing food, great music and atmosphere, and in the heart of old Vegas (Fremont Street Experience)."}
{"text":"Yummy. Loved the sushi and free sake. For sushi in las Vegas, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We had a great diner last night. I ordered the tofu salad and  requested for the dressing on the side. It came with 2 dressings that were equally good. I also ordered miso soup,  soft shell crab tempura , spicy tuna sushi and dragon sushi. Everything was well prepared and the fish was fresh. I also ordered the hot sake which was very smooth and lightly sweet. I just wish they had shichimi togarashi powder which I like to sprinkle on my food  and  soup ."}
{"text":"The bartender at Oak and Ivy suggested Bocho when we asked about a local sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas downtown area.  This was walking distance from Oak and Ivy (check them out for excellent cocktails.) We sat at the sushi bar and watched the three talented chefs.  We had hot green tea, a couple of regular rolls and a couple of the special rolls- the WTF (with soft shell crab) and the Yellowtail Lover. The sushi and sashimi they were serving were beautifully prepared.  The rolls were excellent- fresh, flavorful with not a single cheap shortcut to be found in anything we ordered.  Prices were very good.  We'll make a point of returning next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to go while downtown and stumbled into this place thanks to yelp! My friend and I sat down at the bar next to a regular who offered some fun and light conversation. We ordered poke, sashimi, and a few rolls. Everything was fresh, delicious, and served relatively quickly. I have been wanting to go back with my husband since! If you're in the area, give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I know I wasn't. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Bomb. Sushi was amazing.  Neighborhood is a bit rough. But this will be a staple for my trips to vegas"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Have eaten sushi all over US and loved this!  An easy walk from Freemont St. Happy Hour from 3-6 with 30% off!"}
{"text":"I admit that I haven't been to many sushi restaurants around town except for Yama and Kabuki. Sometimes, though, I don't want to drive across town when I get a hankering for sushi. Lo and behold: Bocho Sushi. And they deliver! I've ordered the spicy salmon and spicy tuna at least half a dozen times. Great stuff. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Drew, is my favorite sushi chef! He always takes good care of me and makes sure I always try something new. Have not been disappointed yet!!"}
{"text":"An awesome little hole in the wall Sushi bar. Fresh ingredients and sushi skillfully prepared in front of you. Had the grilled salmon roll with seaweed salad and calamari... everything was delicious and the staff and chefs were friendly and attentive.
If downtown the short walk off Fremont is richly rewarded!"}
{"text":"Good sushi!! The place is located on a very quiet, kindda ghetto part of Fremont but the sushi is excellent."}
{"text":"After waiting almost 30 minutes, a rude waitress came to tell us that we would have to wait 30 more minutes because she just sat an 11 people table. Extremely disrespectful. The restaurant was far from full. She offered to sit my party of 5 including a 5 year old and a 7 year old at the bar. Very rude and disrespectful. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Took some friends from Honolulu there for lunch, hoping for the best since Hawaii folk know their Japanese cuisine, and this place is great! Sushi delicious and artistically crafted, sashimi fresh and generously sliced, udon bowls steaming tasty with tempura shrimp accompaniment--we all loved our meals! Restaurant very neat and clean, contemporary design with full bars on both floors, staff friendly and answered all questions knowledgeably, arigato thank you when we left was nice touch! Prices very reasonable considering mostly seafood and excellent quality--everyone in our party agreed it was great! Located in revitalized part of downtown Vegas so cleaner and felt safe, lots of pay parking on street, small corner location so missed it on our first pass. We need to stop by Bocho Sushi again very soon!"}
{"text":"The latest gem to grace Downtown is located at 6th & Carson. Bocho Sushi was born from an idea sparked by Dan Coughlin (Le Thai), backed by DTP and saw to fruition by Jimmy & Becky Chun (recently shuttered Tokyo Japanese Restaurant). The Chun's are at the helm, they are no strangers to day-to-day operations after running their restaurant in Commercial Center for decades. At two weeks new, Bocho Sushi has already reached hotspot status by serving up some delicious eats in a cozy setting. 

Our friends invited us to dinner, upon our arrival, every seat in the house was taken. Downstairs you'll find the sushi bar with counter seating, and upstairs there is intimate seating and large bar. The space has an industrial feel, but I love when old buildings are spruced up and repurposed. The changes to the old Carson hotel have been top notch. This block was once forgotten, but now? It's alive and well. 

The menu will meet all of your sushi and sashimi loving needs. Plus, there is an omakase offering for those seeking an adventurous experience. Sake, beer and cocktails are free flowing. They have not yet begun serving wine, however. We started with orders of Edamame ($3.50) and the Jalapeno Bomb ($5.95). The bomb was \"bomb\" (har), seriously, though, it was delicious. It is hard to go wrong with deep fried jalapeno with spicy tuna and cream cheese. Unfortunately, the Edamame was late to show. It served as dessert. 

A smorgasbord of rolls and sashimi followed: Yellowtail Lover ($9.95), Tiger Roll ($11.95), China Roll ($11.95), Spider Crab Roll ($12.95), Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche ($11.99), Salmon Sashimi ($6.25). The were all well executed. The fish was delicately sliced and extremely fresh. My personal favorites were the Yellowtail Yuzu Ceviche with serranos and spicy garlic ponzu, and the China Roll with shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. Both selections were bursting with flavor. 

The staff was warm and friendly and our servers were patient & attentive, the only flaw seems to be with timing. I'm confident that they will get that resolved in time. It always takes a new restaurant a bit to find their rhythm. Bocho is currently open for dinner, but lunch service is scheduled to begin next week."}
{"text":"Save your time and money as this place is only meh at best. 

Ordered the tostada but it looked nothing like the pictures on here. The fresh avocado was replaced by mushy guacamole. The tostada was large but the fish on top was small, horrible fish to tostada ratio. Also was topped off with lots of mayo sauce and super hard to eat. Didn't taste fresh at all.

Next was the fried calamari with Japanese marinara. Calamari was ok in terms of tenderness but flavor was lacking. The marinara was really bad, over salted and clumpy, almost impossible to dip into as the sauce was way too thick. After this, didn't even bother to try the sushi.

Final item was the mushroom yaki. Zero seasoning and only can taste the butter.

Tried to order a drink after putting in my starters but the waitress never came back to check on me even though there were 2 servers for 7 people. When I asked for my check, she attempted to clear my plates but got some of the thick marinara on my clothes. Never said sorry. When I walked out the door, not even the sushi chefs said a word of goodbye or thank you.

Only reason I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the decor. I hate to right bad reviews but need to warn others before they make the same mistake as me."}
{"text":"Went to bocho Saturday night
I entered the restaurant and was seated in a friendly manner
A waitress came up to us and asked us if we would like drinks and probably brought them
We ordered some food and that's where the problems came
The waitress gave us something we did not order
She then argued with us when she told us that we told her twice that that is what we wanted
A large table next to us ordered several things and receive their food before us we were sitting there over 35 minutes without food
We got up place the $10 bill  for a beer we drank and walked out she looked at us with disbelief that we were unhappy with her wonderful service"}
{"text":"How have I never heard of this place?

As a native I am very keen to find places that make me feel like I am not in Vegas or in Vegas as a city not as a tourist attraction.

This is place was marvelous. Upstairs has the perfect decor with the bare cinder blocks and the raw wood. The one open window let the chilly air and the sounds of the city. I look forward to coming back and eating through the menu again. They were very giving on any changes we wanted to make or ordering things not really on the menu and the prices were reasonable. I am very happy. The food was delicious, the serving staff was amazing..especially the bus boy who overheard us talking about the menu and on offered us their \"chicken nuggets\"...he said two words...dark meat, and I was hooked. They were amazing and a fine alternative if you don't like fish and your friends are dragging you to sushi...or if you're a normal person and love adult chicken nuggets...white meat be damned.

The quality is superb. I have eaten in some places that charge many times more for what they are serving and it cannot come close to what is done here. The rolls do not come very quickly, but incredibly reasonably, and each roll is worth its weight in gold. I highly recommend rock n roll and the roll 5...or something with a 5 in it, my taste buds blocked my memory. I could go on and on, their Ocean Trout was unlike anything I have ever tasted and their sushi tacos appetizer makes me want to steal their recipe book.

The sauces are not the main focus of the dish like most other sushi places nowadays, they are a gentle complement to enhance, not to take over, the experience. Easily, my new favorite sushi place. Thank you! I'll be a regular especially at happy hour with 30% off.

And...they have real, freshly grated wasabi available and a wonderful saki selection. Take a moment to leave what you know as Vegas aside and see what Vegas looks like from a local perspective..."}
{"text":"WOW!  Bocho Sushi is legit! By far the best sushi I have ever eaten. The customer service is A+ as well. As we walked in we were greeted by a nice young man that promptly seated us, he turned out to be our waiter as well. He was very attentive, polite and had a great smile. We ordered sashimi and were amazed with the quality and presentation. After the sashimi we had the Spanish Mackeral and then a Lobster,Crab Roll they were amazing. If you are a beer drinker try the Asahi on tap, it was sooo cold and refreshing and  went great with the sushi. The finishing touch was their tempura fried ice cream that is wrapped in pound cake. Holy Shit ! 

I found out that this place is owned by the same owner of Le Thai that is located right around the corner. We had lunch at Le Thai the day before and it was just as good. The guy who owns these two gems knows what's up with quality food and great service not to mention the vibe in his restaurants is on point.

Bocho is hidden so just look for the John E. Carson Hotel sign and you are there."}
{"text":"We stopped in unexpectedly. And we're glad we did. Immediately upon entry we were greeted by all the guys on the sushi line and all the guests at the bar. It felt like Cheers only we had never been here before. :)

So we sat down and started with standards like edamame, shishito peppers, spicy tuna and a Philadelphia roll. Everything was great and we were happy to see a great sushi place now available downtown. 

When we thought we were done some gifts from the kitchen came out like grilled king oyster mushrooms and tuna tostada. A great way to finish our meal and a nice way to make us feel special on our first visit. 

Heads up. Jimmy the chef likes to drink. Buy him one and you find you are the recipient of some gifts from the kitchen too. 

Coming back and sending people their way."}
{"text":"Super tiny place. 

The servers were friendly and fast with water refills. The lunch menu was reasonably priced. I had the sashimi combo. 10 pieces. The presentation is lovely. The quality of the fish is on the higher side.

My husband cashed in on the Yelp check in offer for a sake shot. He enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi in a cool space!  We really loved the yellowtail ceviche and would have ordered about 4 more servings and just ate that, but the sashimi, dragon roll and the special roll that was 3 styles of fish, crab and veggie wrapped in cucumber (no rice at all) was equally as fabulous.  The space is very industrial and loft-like, with open ceiling beams and minimal furniture, decorations, etc.  Perfect for this neighborhood.  Good sake menu as well as a full bar with interesting house cocktails.  This is worthy of 5 stars and as many repeat visits as possible!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this little sushi joint near the Fremont District at the corner of Carson and 6th Street, very little room with a sushi bar and few seating when we first enter, we then went upstairs to the second floor, much bigger space and to our surprise there're two party rooms with kareoke. Place is clean and the waitress is very nice, lovely lady. 

We ordered few dishes on the board, monkey brain, etc. I don't remember other names but the rolls are amazing! We loved the icy cold draft beer on this scorching  sunny day along with some appetizers and cold sake. Prices is right too. Good experience for us!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi place. Met the head chef when my sister was in town and truly enjoyed the experience and the food. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place... love everything they prepare for me and my husband. Daniel sushi chef does an amazing job"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot! 

This place is so cute! I love the inside and the staff is very friendly. It has two stories. The bottom floor is a long sushi bar with several chairs. I did not see the upstairs but there is additional seating. 

The chairs at the bar are awkward and really squeaky. It was odd and a little embarrassing trying to get in and out of them because they were so noisy.  The food was absolutely worth the weird chairs. 

We ordered several items including the garlic tuna and three rolls. Everything we tried was fresh and delicious. The service was friendly and the sushi chefs were a great time.

The restaurant is on the southwest corner of 6th and Carson. The signage is minimal so it's easy to miss it. 

I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is so good! The restaurant is super cute and the food was amazing! I liked the location and the staff was friendly. Will definitley come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place. My fiance and I loved our meal. Very friendly staff. Next time in Vegas we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good fresh  flavors.  Sushi downtown,  wooo hooo! Great service,  no non-sence sushi.  Ordered the yellowtail lovers and yellowtail ceviche.  All fresh and yummy.  

The restaurant is called Bocho and in small letters it reads \"a Mexican that doesn't speak Spanish\" .  In reality the correct the spelling is Pocho with a P,  and yes it's usually said of a Mexican American born that no longer speaks Spanish. 

A Bocho or Bochito in Mexico is a Volkswagen beetle.  Yeah! For years it was the most common car in the entire nation."}
{"text":"This will be a destination for us when we visit vegas now that we know about it.  It is not a very big place but they do good stuff there.  I think the cherry on top with this place is that they actually offer REAL wasabi.  and its amazing.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Will definitely return. We had the Disco Inferno roll which was spicy and delicious; the Bocho fried chicken app which were like lightly fried chicken bites; and mixed tempura. The highlight though was the eel and bluefin tuna sashimi which were incredibly fresh and good. Cool ambiance, very good house music playing, and nice sake selection. Service polite. Only downside is that the food took quite a long time to arrive which is why not the full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Fun and generous chefs!  Of course fresh fish.  They have a real simple menu not like some acye places where the menu is tooo vast that it loses the authenticity of sushi."}
{"text":"I don't usually go downtown for sushi but when I do I do it at the Jhon E. Carson hotel...at Bocho. Yes the new sushi place is located at the old historic hotel joining other not to miss places in the same building like Carson kitchen and O-face doughnuts. 
Nothing made more noise than Bocho's opening in downtown since Godzilla as it was one of the most anticipated new restaurant openings in downtown.
Bocho (Japanese for knife) will slice you some of the freshest, tastiest and perfectly uncooked pieces of fish you could find in the Las Vegas desert. I've been here a couple times and both times the service was genuine and outstanding. 
 The space is very limited so every square foot was meticulosly planed and decorated for maximum functionality but they also have more space upstairs for larger groups or private parties.... So now you know, if you're looking for fresh, juicy and satisfying.....go downtown!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. Yesterday I took a much needed lunch break to enjoy some sushi. I decided on the spicy tuna roll and the lunch bento box which made me more than full. If you're trying to come here during the 11-3 lunch hour and don't want sushi I say get the lunch box/ lunch ramen choices for $11, drink included! More bang for your buck. If, in fact, you have chosen to take a later lunch or head over for happy hour I believe they have sushi 20% off from 3-6, which is great. The sushi is always fresh and the waiters are super nice. I even heard that there's a spot upstairs for karaoke. 

Definitely worth the trek to downtown Fremont."}
{"text":"I forgot what he happy hour deal was but it was pretty good deal. I was in a hurry for a quick bite. I ordered the yellowtail lover and dang was it good. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Service was great too. I wanna go back during happy hour with more peeps so we can just gorge on a meal."}
{"text":"Excellent place for date night or lunch with a friend! My husband is a huge AYCE sort of sushi person, but I had a gift certificate for $25 so he was game to try it. And oh man, it did not disappoint in the slightest. The salmon nigiri was to die for, the ROLLS were AMAZING. If you think you know the creativity of rolls, think again, these were so exciting to look at and enjoy. :-)"}
{"text":"Cool place. Super fast service. Everything we ordered was amazing. Even got in extra piece of sashimi  and with yelp u get some free sake.  I will be back to try some oysters. The couple next to me ordered them and I almost snuck one."}
{"text":"Bocho is a favorite of my wife & I for downtown lunch & dinner options. While there are a lot of restaurant options near Fremont of late, not only is this the only sushi option with out a casino built around it, but it's also top-grade fish with some delicious house recipes.  

We stopped in for a late lunch last week & turned out it was happy hour, which just made good prices on quality sushi even better! I like the seating options, you can eat upstairs at a table, a private room, at the bar, or downstairs at the sushi bar & watch the magic happen.  

Staff is all very professional & courteous, dining room & bathrooms are not only clean & well stocked, but nicely decorated. Manager Carlos said hello & made sure our meal & beverage options were on point. Garlic edamame, salmon roe, crunch dragon, spicy tuna, & Hawaiian roll (recommend by Mgmnt) were all delicious & left us stuffed but not weighed down, or in need of a nap. Left feeling great & looking forward to our next visit. Keep up the great work Bocho!"}
{"text":"very friendly staff, quick service and very good sushi! Came here two nights in a row."}
{"text":"There was a special on cocktails, and we ordered the Japanese mule which we really liked. The rolls and yakitori were excellent, the service was great and the atmosphere upstairs was fun and hip. It's a nice addition to downtown. The place felt more like a izakaya which I like."}
{"text":"Beautiful service! I was craving sushi and this happened to be the closet one I could find. Even though, we had 2 children we were accompanied really well and didn't seem to be a problem. I had Ryan as a server who was very professional and recommended his favorite roles which were amazing. Philip was our servers helper and I was super impressed with his quality of work and making sure everything was out of the way for our next course and had everything we needed. I highly recommend this place very clean and organized but, it is a little overpriced but the quality make up for it."}
{"text":"Amazing. We had a Chef's selection of sashimi and the Something Wrong roll. Presentation was beautiful, fish was outstanding and fresh. This was some of the best sushi I've had. I highly recommend Bocho and hope to come back!"}
{"text":"Rick and Juliette were super helpful and sweet! Food was great. They even accommodated for my dietary needs."}
{"text":"Delicious, awesome that it's downtown. Was kind of sad they didn't have ayce but I totally understand! Waiter and sushi chefs were awesome! John E Carson roll was my favorite!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of the place, and how chill it is in here! Great place to have a meal amd socialize with a friend you haven't seen in awhile, or even by yourself for a peaceful dinner out at Downtown. Whenever I came here, the service was fast and super friendly! 
The prices are very decent, ans thier spicy level for the rolls is a favorite for me here! 
I will admit, its not the best sushi I have ever had,  but for the atmosphere, price, and convenience, its a good place for a fun dinner."}
{"text":"Read other reviews and so decided to try it out for Happy Hour. Glad we did!
First, the place itself is a cool small main floor and and upstairs. We sat at the sushi bar. 
OMG you have to get the garlic edamame! Wow so yummy. 
And since we both like unfiltered sake, we tried a new to us label. We now have a new favorite. 
The sushi, sashimi and rolls were all fresh and delicious. 
And got to hear a cool story of how one of the sushi chefs got here to Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow! What a treat. The pink lady roll was the best roll I have ever had. We loved it. Cool atmosphere and good service. Great sushi! So delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted do something special for sushi in Vegas and looked at the usual more expensive options. But Yelp reviews pointed me here and I was not disappointed.  The Yellowtail ceviche is awesome. The what's wrong roll (spicy) was amazing. The staff is friendly and very attentive. And happy hour until 6 is 30% off. This is a great sushi bar."}
{"text":"Great food and good service gets 4 stars from me. This place gets 5 for good food and great service! We sat at the bar and the sushi bartender was faaabulous and our server was so fun. We tried the baked salmon roll which was delicious. And the pink lady roll was different, had a mint flavor to it but still pretty good. Would try something else next time. Their miso soup was up to par. And their fried chicken appetizer was good with soy sauce and rice. I can't do the sauce it came with cuz of the spiciness. The rock shrimp appetizer was good too! But packed some heat. 

There is also an upstairs that we did not see!"}
{"text":"My quick review:

Been going to Bocho for a short time and I believe it's quite amazing. My wife and I sit at the bar and were just introduced to the upstairs area, which some day we will have to visit with friends. 

Fish is great. People are great. We always walk away feeling full with the portion sizing. 

I recommend it for all."}
{"text":"We have been to Bocho four times now. We go to Vegas frequently and this place has become one of our faves. The last two times however were not as good. Service is always a bit sketchy as there always seems to be new servers & their knowledge of the menu is lacking. So is the service!
So it was my birthday & we had reservations. We arrived 20 minutes early & they escorted us upstairs but did not seat us at our table even though we were the only customers up there. Sat us at the bar upstairs but there was an awful sewer odor & when we asked we were told they had sewer issues & we should sit somewhere else!!! Well we didn't choose to sit there! So we asked for our table.
We LOVE the Kumamoto oysters & always get them when we come for an appetizer. So the first time we came the oysters were butchered and the shells were all broken up in pieces in w/ the oysters! We complained & after a wait the proper shucked kumamoto arrived. Second time we came they were beautiful & arrived with Japanese pickled vegetables!
Third time and last time (4th) not shucked well, NO pickled vegetables and they took forever. WHY can't they be consistent with the food and make sure these are done properly? The upstairs began to get busy and before it was too hectic the server took our order. The upstairs is now full and many tables that came in AFTER us are getting their food but so far we have had the oysters & that is it. A table came AND went while we were waiting!! Finally some of the food begins to show up. The sushi rolls and sushi were very good. The fish is very fresh here but the LONG wait...WHY? Happened to us last time too. Had to flag someone down so my husband could get another beer. NO recognition on my birthday at all. This was noted on our reservation. The food is inconsistent  which sucks but the worst is the service. It is really hit or miss. One of my pet peeves about a new restaurant is not caring enough to be consistent in both their food as well as their service. Also I was supposed to receive cash back through Yelp & Groupon. I have yet to receive this!
DON'T advertise this if you aren't going to honor it. Not sure if we want to return. Last two times were meh. Restaurant needs to contact me."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here and everything was ON POINT. The guests all enjoyed their sushi, beverages and service. In scenarios where I am picking a venue for a decently sized group of people (15+) it is always good news when you hear nothing but praises on your selections."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Vegas! Sushi and rolls are excellent. They have AYCE on Tuesdays and well worth it! Although I would still go on any of their regular menu days. Great service and nice smooth ambient mood with some nice background music. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"The bento box lunch special is one of the best around! Highly suggest giving it a try (i dig the fried chicken style)"}
{"text":"Not sure how this is the best sushi people ever ate in their life or the best sushi downtown.  Although I don't know of any other.  After this having been on our list for a few months to try, we were extremely disappointed.  While the staff was attentive and great and we went on a Friday night and it was empty with one other customer.  The sushi itself was very subpar.  The rice was gummy and crunchy. The sea weed wraps were tough and gummy and chewy.  A few bites nearly felt like chewing gum and I think the fish itself at one time was rubbery.  I have not even eaten grocery store sushi, but I imagine it might be better.  I have had good sushi, I know I am somewhat a snob, but this was no where near the best anything.  It was not authentic in any way.  Nor was the staff.   If Taco Bell is your favorite Mexican.  This place is for you."}
{"text":"I consider Bocho Sushi one of the coolest places to hang out in Downtown Las Vegas. Upstairs is warm and friendly, but downstairs is where cool  peeps hang out. I don't believe you can go wrong with nigiri  sushi but the the spicy crab roll is worth committing harikiri for."}
{"text":"Two words ~ mushy rice 

Walking into this place I have to say that I loved the vibe. The restaurant itself is beautiful with so many great details from the modern finishes to the art. We were walked upstairs and that space was equally as great as the sushi bar downstairs. Service was good too. 

I noticed that the lunch specials were really expensive on paper, $16-18 for their sushi plates but we ordered them anyway as the reviews for this place were great. Presentations were very nice & you did receive a lot of food. The fish was fresh & each plate came with a few pieces of sashimi which were really good but everything else that had rice was nearly inedible. The rice was mushy and packed so hard that each piece was really heavy. I couldn't get passed that. 

I had high hopes & wanted to love my experience because I genuinely enjoyed the space but the rice ruined it for me and let's be honest, the rice is just as important as what comes on it or in it when it comes to sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi rolls!!! Clean establishment, you are able to watch them make your rolls in front of you if you sit at the bar!!! Cool looking building as well!!!"}
{"text":"AYCE @ $30 is a great bargain and includes Uni, Amaebi, tempura, kushikatsu, tons of rolls, huge oysters and so much more! Even the hungriest eater will fill up. 

We also ordered the yuzu jalapeño ceviche which was nicely seasoned with ponzu, sriracha and a thin slice of jalapeno. The salmon sashimi was really good and so was the yum yum roll. 

Super friendly and efficient sushi chefs made our first experience really great. 

Check in to Bocho and get a free sake shot with a roll purchase. The murals are really cool and more table seating upstairs.  

We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Goodbye Bocho....again.

I am a downtown resident.
Don't boo hoo as you guys close down one restaurant after another.
You suck.

You sucked in the beginning so I never came back.
Then I heard there were new people so I gave it a 2nd shot.

I don't have anyone's names, but these servers...sheesh!
I don't know if it's arrogance or ignorance but they think they can remember your order without writing it down.

And then they screw up.
Their attention span is 0.0.

So if you take my incident as a one time only thing, you'll think I'm over reacting but it's the last three times I've been there.

Owners don't comprehend that people go out for a dining EXPERIENCE.
My experiences suck there.

Tonight I sat at bar, ordered 3 of the same type of roll, miso soup, and a cucumber salad.
Waitress brought the cucumber salad and I knew just from looking at it, it was old.
I took a bite just to be sure.
It was awful.
I gave it to the guy behind the counter to take away.

At some point he told the waitress so she came over and asked me if I wanted another one.
I said no.
She brings one anyway.
Get the drift?
Does this girl pay attention on any level?

Then when my sushi came before my miso soup, I asked about my soup.
I said to her, \"did you hear me ask for miso soup?\"
She said yes she heard me but forgot.
I said, yes because you didn't write it down!

You're servers. 
Write shit down!
At least TRY to get it right.
I mean there were only three customers in the whole place!

So she came over to check on me.
I told her I was done with this place.
She replied \"everyone makes mistakes\".
Not if you write the order down and pay attention!

That's it.
I am at my breaking point with this place and every other shitty restaurant here.

This is THE ENTERTAINMENT capital of THE WORLD.
People come here from all over the world to go to hospitality school.

Don't think cuz Tony Hsieh throws you some dough that you know how to own a restaurant.

So then she asked if I wanted anything else.
I told her I would never be here again.
She replies, (in high whiny snotty girl voice) \"OK!\"

So I said, yeah it's ok cuz you don't own the place.
She says she does.

Even worse.
Good luck chick!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  You can use comps from the D, they have a great combination of crazy (good) rolls and traditional sushi, and they have a happy hour with 30% off everything!  Walking distance from the hotels downtown and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience all year, and I go out to eat a lot.  It started it terrible from the beginning.  We had a reservation.  The place was crowded, but far from packed, with several open seats at the bar and several open tables upstairs.  There was no one to check anyone in and there was a pile of people waiting downstairs (where there is really no where to wait).  We waiting about 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged, but eventually escorted to a table.  After 10 minutes of sitting down drink orders were taken.  Although the wait staff seemed very very short handed, there seemed to be plenty of people buzzing around.  The appetizer, which was a special was mediocre.  It was slightly too spicy for me, but overall not bad.  Our food took about 25 minutes to be ready... no big deal.  The table next to us was seated about 10 minutes after us, they got their drinks, appetizers, and meal prior to us (they also ordered the same specialty rolls as us, uncooked).  When they brought my meal, it had jalapeños on it, which I had specifically asked to leave out.  They brought my husband the wrong roll all together (glad he noticed initially).  I tried my roll, and it was definitely full of large chunks of jalapeños.  It took over 20 minutes at least to try and change it, but there was really no one around to tell.... my husband finished his meal, and we still waited and waited.  I do not send food back, this has been the first time in years.  My husband said his meal was decent, but nothing special.  
The soy sauce....  they WATER down their soy sauce... who does this????  We frequent sushi/Japanese restaurants at least once per week.   The consistency of their soy sauce was 3 parts water, 1 part soy sauce.    Like most restaurants they probably refill their bottles on the table.  Whatever brand they use is either much much more dilute, or they water it down.  Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"I love the sushi. This place has a great vibe, and nice location. The sushi is totally amazing. Make sure to sit in the bar and not upstairs"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would. I have had sushi in Japan that was no where near what this place puts forth. Their presentation is breathtaking. The Dragon Crunch roll has an amazing amount of different flavor profiles.
 Easy to get to, just around the corner from the Fremont Experience on 6th.
You will do yourself a disservice if you miss it. It's that good."}
{"text":"Great ayce sushi in Vegas if the somewhat limited menu hits the spot for you.  Sushi is filled with fish instead of rice and the appetizers are a tasty mix.  Five stars from me."}
{"text":"Have you ever experienced that feeling when you're so blissfully content with your existence that you just want to kill yourself out of sheer joy? Like, you've filled the void in your chest and know that your time on Earth is complete? Like when you're SUPER old and have had a long, lush, fulfilling life and you're just ready to die? 

Basically, don't sit near the window if you're eating upstairs. 

Brian will lead you into the light with the Bocho special. And don't order Something Wrong unless you're sure you have no important appointments scheduled. 
Group bocho suicides are held after dinner service on the roof of the El Cortez parking structure. See you there."}
{"text":"I would never recommend this place. It took 30min for a sushi.. That explains everything. It was not busy at all, trust me. And the rice for sushi is terrible, it was hard and old, the worst sushi ever. So please go other place if you want real sushi."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Bocho- downtown LV has long lacked a decent sushi joint. Unfortunately, this spot still doesn't quite hit the spot. Fish is fresh, but AYCE is the only reasonable way to go here. Lunch specials are pricey and don't highlight the fish items on the menu.

On two separate lunch visits, I opted for the Shunta Box- Bocho's take on a bento box, with a (heated) fish dish, 4 piece California roll, mixed tempura, white rice, and miso soup. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the small assortment of pickles included as an accent, but even the half-roll I had was falling apart. I'm not the hugest fan of heated salmon, but two visits in a row they have been out of the black cod- other reviews mention this, too. Maybe remove it from the menu and feature it as a special if it's not consistently available, or stock more if you legitimately run out all the time. It was a filling lunch, but there are many places in town to get the same thing, and it won't run me $20 with tip.

Service was fine. I sat at the sushi bar and placed my order directly with the chef, hostess came around frequently to give drink refills. It's nice to have this spot in the downtown area, but they need to kick it up a notch- the special rolls sounded pretty standard and the bartender told another customer the carpaccio-type dishes did not qualify for AYCE pricing? Too many better places in town to come back here specifically."}
{"text":"You would never expect such a dope sushi restaurant based on the location. It's tucked away in the heart of downtown Las vegas. It's said to have been a old hotel back in the day and you can kind of tell. The bottom floor has a few tables and a sushi bar but upstairs has a cool bar and private rooms.  The decor is really beautiful too. On the way up the wood stairs there is a gorgeous silver and white kimono gown and there is amazing wall art, giving it a cozy and hip vibe. 
The food itself was pretty tasty. Try the pepper poppers. They aren't spicy at all but they are a fun alternative to edemame. They come with about 5 to 6 and they're awesome with beer. I would Def come here for a fun date night or a cool night out with the girls considering that downtown bars are just around the corner. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok... I went in and walked back out... I smelled fish .. nothing but young kids behind the line.. no welcome .. nothing! You want really authentic sushi and Japanese food? Tokyo boys on Stephanie , that is the best sushi in town"}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but inside the atmosphere is completely chill. You get the high scale design with low scale prices. The presentation was absolutely pristine and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I'm a visitor here in Vegas but it's a MUST HAVE"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Wish it was in a better location, only for their sake, I would hate for them not to get business and would be nice if there was outside seating and some sort of view, but it's off major sidewalks/corners, off Fremont.)  but otherwise - on the money!  Super fresh.  We tried several rolls off the menu and I can't say one was better than the other - all were so tasty.  Great service.  We sat upstairs.  (more roomier-downstairs is sushi bar only)  Got the Sake/Cucumber - something or other martini ;) - it was awesome.  I think the prices were good - not strip prices, but not local.  They should offer a small - all you can eat sushi menu - (just an idea).  Drinks are high end.  Sushi is fresh and presentation is high end.  Super clean, modern.  You are only walking distance from Container Park and Fremont.  There is public parking ($2.00 per hour or $1.00 per hour) close by.  We love Downtown and hope it stays trendy and upcoming.  If we are craving high end sushi - we will come back here, for sure."}
{"text":"Service and food were exceptional!  Who knew you could find amazing fresh sushi in the desert!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Slightly off the beaten path, search for a lighted \"Hotel\" sign with a \"Sushi\" flag waving outside. Sushi bar is on the bottom floor when you walk in, and the tables and a small bar with the karaoke rooms are on the top floor. Waitress and the gentleman who helped her serve the food were attentive, although maybe slightly slow in refilling my soda.

The place is small- maybe about 9 tables. All except maybe 2 were full when we arrived at 9:30. Check in and get free sake!

The yellowtail jalapeno was my favorite. The side dish of steamed rice is plenty for two people to share. The chicken karaage was delicious as well as the beef gyoza, although my BF thinks it was a bit on the soggy side. We went with the typical rainbow roll and loved it. Sushi was fresh and the yellowtail dish was sliced perfectly. We would definitely come back next time we're in town. The price was extremely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Food 3/5
Service 3/5: friendly but slowww
Setting 4/5 cool space, kinda loud 
Value 3/5 

Pros: 
- Good location in downtown. Only sushi place in downtown 
- Cool space 
- decent sushi 

Cons:
- pretty slow service (not just one unlucky time, but consistently over 5 or 6 times)
- fish was hit or miss 
- 2 dishes we didn't like (too spicy) including one we barely ate: when the receipt arrived, no gesture. It's fair enough it could have gone either way."}
{"text":"First time here. I ate downstairs at the sushi bar since that was what I was after. So so fresh! The sashimi was phenomenal! The waitress (didn't get her name) was a definite asset to the place! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A really fun time at this place. The sushi is good, the vibe is great and the service was exceptional. We sang karaoke in a private room and the owner, a really sweet Korean lady came and joined us (OK, fine we made her) but the server also joined us and sang and everyone had a good time. We took our clients here and it was a big success..."}
{"text":"As part of the downtown community, Bocho is by far the best sushi spot. The fish is always fresh and service is always fast. The sushi guys aren't like your normal ones at your local all you can eat, they actually have personality"}
{"text":"Best sushi place EVER! My husband and I didn't like sushi until we ate at this place. We've tried different sushi places over the years but every time disappointed. Our friends offered to take us out to eat and didn't want to complain about going to a sushi place. Anyway, great experience. We tried everyones sushi and they all were very good.  This place gave us a whole new appreciation for sushi. Tastes very clean."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and  service is faster at the bar although I haven't had to wait long at all to have food brought upstairs. I reccomend The yellowtail jalapeño sashimi and the pink lady! P.S. the Sapporo is super cold mmmm heheh"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Great food!  Everyone was amazing!  Possibly the best sushi I've eaten!"}
{"text":"It was Friday afternoon and I was looking for a place for the wife and I to have some sushi. Saw that Bocho had a 30% off Sushi Happy Hour and I figured I'd give them a shot. 

They're located downtown near Freemont and it's a really cozy little space. We sat at the bar and ordered straight from the sushi chef. He was super chill- I wish I got his name for you guys! 

I don't like mayos on my rolls and he caught on after I asked him about a few different ones. Finally, he just offered to make me whatever roll I wanted minus the mayo.

The sushi was delicious. Brief descriptions of what I got: 

1 California roll with imitation crab (since I didn't want the mayo mixed.)

1 Tiger Roll (shrimp tempura inside)

1 Spider Crab Roll (deep fried soft shell crab inside) 

Definitely the best I've had in town. We'll be back without a doubt. If you haven't been, you'll want to check this spot out for your next sushi outing."}
{"text":"Was here when in from out of town last year (from Seattle.)  Different experience this time.  Late weekday night so pretty empty which is a good thing.  $27 all you can eat sushi and $15 all you can drink Sake, which is a better thing.  Unfortunately service marred the overall experience.  Looks like late night weekday is staffed by a bunch of 20-somethings -- whom I have absolutely no prejudice against.  But overall not the warm, attentive service I'm used to getting at well rated sushi bars.  I don't like it when you are supposed to order from the waiter as opposed to directly from the sushi chef.  We did the all you can eat and drink and we were starving and I'm 99% sure we were intentionally neglected.  Very \"cold\" service - not rude but just mediocre at best.  Sushi quality is actually average for semi-upscale sushi joint.  I would go back but probably not sit at the Sushi bar and hope for better service.  It's a 3.5 that night but seeing overall this place is a bit overrated, I'm rounding down instead of up to try to help \"correct\" the average.  Always happy to give 4 and 5 stars, pretty easily actually but honestly the place fell short of that this time."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Reasonable prices. Excellent service and drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! The specialty roll options are delicious. Very unique choices which we always look for in the rolls. The service is impeccable from drinks all the way to the check. I have not had this type of fantastic service in a very long time. Great drink options and attention to detail at this sushi restaurant. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Bocho blew me away.  Its a great little spot in the downtown area, off the strip! From the outside you wouldn't think to stop in, but its definitely worth the visit.  The sushi bar area is small, but they have a dining area upstairs, and a full bar. A great place for a date, as its intimate, only about 10-12 tables.  All of the food here was incredible."}
{"text":"Neighborgood sushi joint. Keeps it simple. Knows what you want. Great service. Solid items. Catch the specials!"}
{"text":"Amazing DT sushi spot. Came with a group and they sat us upstairs. I've passed this place many times & Never knew they even had an upstairs. We had the best server (Eileen). She was very sweet and super attentive. Food came out very quick. Ordered a variety of sashimi. Very fresh!! Rolls were just as great. Fave was the rock & roll and the Yum yum. This will definitely be our new sushi place when we're downtown."}
{"text":"So excited to have a sushi spot downtown and it's so yummy!  Bocho special roll was so tasty, definitely a favorite.  The sauce is a garlic ponzu and it's a good size. One will fill you up for lunch.  We also did a lunch box which was pretty good. The pickled cucumber was a good touch as well as the seasoning on the rice.

The service was great, everyone super friendly.  

Will definitely be coming back and taking friends and family.  They don't have dessert yet so excited to see what they come up with!"}
{"text":"This place was great. A nice little gem a block from the Fremont experience. I usually just go to Yellow tail at Bellagio Hotel or Blue Ribbon at the Cosmopolitan and spend well over 100 and sometimes even two hundred dollars. I am really glad I went off the strip.The food was really good. As I walked to the bldg it doesn't look like much but from the beginning the service was great! I love Shishito peppers and will order them every chance I get. This place has a simple seasoning they use and those were the best peppers I have ever had. I also ordered the tempura shrimp, was really good so I had a couple orders. I also loved the Yellow tail jalapeno. What was truly amazing after enjoying this great food and having a couple beers, I learned it was happy hour and got 30% my tab. I haven't seen it get better than that in Vegas for sushi!"}
{"text":"Great food, great value, great service. Highly recommend. Within close walking distance from Fremont street"}
{"text":"I really loved the Happy Hour here! Tried a lot of different things and was especially impressed by the Chicken Karaage (might be the best I've ever eaten), the salmon belly and yellowtail belly nigiri, and Bocho's signature martini - the 'Bocho-tini': a delicious cucumber-ish martini.

Had the Jalapeno Bomb as recommended by our server. I can see how people might love it if they're into that yum-yum sauce / dynamite kind of thing - I'm not particularly fond of this style of American sushi fusion, but again, I can see how people might go crazy for it. Pretty damn tasty, but not my thing.

Garlic Shishito peppers were great - lightly tempura'd and dusted with a mildly spicy paprika-like powder. 

This is a cool, cozy sushi bar space. I know people have expressed their fondness for the upstairs, but I like how it feels sort of 'cozy Greenwich Village sushi spot' downstairs. A very social atmosphere. I found myself having conversations with other parties along the sushi bar. It'd be almost hard not to because of the way the place is set up - acoustically the raftered ceilings dampen the overall restaurant noise - it's pleasant and makes for a enjoyable, relaxing atmosphere. 

Looking forward to doing AYCE here in the future!"}
{"text":"Not happy. Was recommended by a friend that lives around the corner. The sushi bar was full, well, full enough that there wasn't two empty seats next to each other for me and this friend to sit at. So, we had to go upstairs. Bar had two seats. I guess I'll order some sake then, great. What else can I do since I'm unable to get sushi upstairs. This was the first time meeting with this friend. It took 2 bottles of sake to finally get a seat back downstairs. I made my way downstairs and asked the server there to bring my sake, that was just opened, to the sushi bar. He actually refused with a half lame excuse that they \"probably\" already threw it out. Like the 10 guests to 10 employees was just overwhelming and he couldn't go and get my 15 dollar bottle of sake. And I was with someone. What a horrible attitude from this runt. Then it took another extra long seemed like forever time to even place an order for sushi. 3 bottles, 2 rolls, and seaweed salad for 100 bucks and absolutely horrible service...yeah, I'll pass.

Edit : looks like an employee responded to me. As you can see, he doesn't even address the complaints. He tries to tell me they are popular? Oh, ok...good luck. I'm popular too. This links to my Facebook that gets plenty of attention. Little tip: you should not excuse your employees mistakes because you THINK you are popular. Btw, if you read, I mentioned there were 10 guests at the time. If that makes you feel popular, see you in 3 years. Oh, and one of the main complaints is that the little server, who had 2 couple groups (that's it), couldn't make 'my stay as pleasant as possible.' In case you don't understand customer service, that means bringing the just opened bottle to location guest is sitting. Wow. Good luck on being popular :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi spot near me, and saw this was the first on my list on Yelp. Located in Downtown Las Vegas literally 5 minutes away from me. Its next to Carson Kitchen that's how I was able to fin it so quickly. Cute little spot on the corner of 6th and Carson. 

When you walk in its a sushi bar which you have the choice to sit there if you'd like or there is table seating upstairs. Very clean, small but cute and intimate. It was slow when we came, but I don't mind.

We first ordered the Garlic Edamame because we heard our neighbors order it. And I must say best decision on my life. Its a bit spicy but the flavor is amazing and the garlic is not over powering. I could not stop eating them. I wish I had a bowl for myself lol. We also ordered the Jalapeno Bombs which were stuffed with Spicy Tuna and Cream Cheese. Now when I hear Jalapeno Bomb I expected really spicy, but it wasn't that spicy. But still very good. They were deep fried and the jalapenos were fresh. Must try!! Then we ordered the Baked Salmon Roll, a California Roll with baked salmon right on top; very good and tasty. Fish was not too fishy and roll was cut perfectly. We also ordered the Las Vegas Roll which was amaaazing. had eel, cream cheese, avocado and crab - deep fried!! YUM!! 

We ordered the perfect amount of food, and it was not expensive at all, it came out to $35. Not too bad! And if its your first time checking in through Yelp you get a free Sake shot. Our waiter gave me a free shot too! 

I'd totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi spot to go to!"}
{"text":"I have to start by admitting that I am generally an all-you-can-eat fan. I like sushi in all forms, but my usual mood is \"give me everything you have until I want to die because I am so full of fish.\" These places, I am aware, offer more food of less quantity. Bocho sushi is the opposite; you may not get a ton of food, but the quality is excellent! This spot does not offer all you can eat. I came here for dinner with a friend because we had a $25 off coupon. Due to my normal stance on sushi restaurants, I was pretty sure this would be my one and only time eating here, and I was absolutely wrong! I really enjoyed my meal, and I will definitely be back. 

First off, the atmosphere is a small, hip place with an upstairs loft and downstairs sushi bar. We sat at the bar, but we did walk up to look at the loft - it was enticing, but I wanted some of that real sunshine the downstairs area provided. When you sit at the sushi bar, you can see everything they are doing, which is cool. Unfortunately, when I was there it did not look very organized compared to other sushi bars I have sat at. Also, my waiter did not refill my water for almost half an hour, and it was not a busy day/time. This led to what might be called a funny mistake, as a random man walked up to us and asked us if the food was up to par. I assumed he was the manager and replied that it was, but I have not gotten any water since we sat down, and he looked very confused! It turned out he was just some creep talking to us. He came by a few more times and asked us about our food, even though he was just a customer, as we were. It was weird, to say the least, but a good story to laugh about! 

THAT FISH THOUGH!! I tried yellowtail first, and I was hooked. Every piece was so buttery and smooth. All together I ordered a Screaming Orgasm, some edamame, two orders of sushi, and a Rainbow Roll. Together it came out to almost double the price I pay for eight times the amount of food at my regular spot. However, this food was at least twice as fresh and amazing, so I'm not mad about it! I ordered the Rainbow Roll specifically because after trying the yellowtail I knew I needed something with a lot of fish on it, minus some of the extreme toppings on other rolls that cover the flavor. I probably won't be a regular, but I will come back for a quick fix when I am craving some buttery amazing sushi/rolls or maybe on a special occasion when I am looking to up my sushi game. 

Quick Summary: Relatively expensive, but the food is bomb."}
{"text":"My friend said the sushi wasn't that good but I'm glad I went because it was so yummy! The ikura and ama ebi tasted fresh and the maki we got were yummy."}
{"text":"Huge lunch portions! I recommend the Somethings Wrong roll, which is a chef's choice roll. My daughter had one of the lunch bento boxes which came with soup, a small salad, a large portion of fish, tempura, rice, and small sushi roll. Great atmosphere and helpful staff. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Absolute best sushi we've had in Las Vegas since we moved here. Sashimi melts in your mouth. Dare I say as fresh as eating sushi in Japan? I don't know pretty dang close."}
{"text":"Bocho sushi was a fantastic experience! We reserved one of the Karaoke rooms for 10 girls for a bachelorette party dinner. The quality of food and service was impeccable. The song list was amazing which included the music videos with lyrics. 

I highly recommend this restaurant for a large party event and/or a small dining experience to satisfy your high end quality of sushi, great service and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"SWEET SUSHI I think I may have found my spot! Stumbled upon this hidden gem located Downtown near the arts district on a Friday night. There's no signage above the spot other that a sign right on the Windows so you'd have to look for other landmarks. (Hint: it's right around the corner from the Commonwealth bar and there's a hotel sign right above)

From the hostess who sat us down at the sushi bar to the waitress and the busser, I'd have to say all 3 were very attentive.  Our Sushi Chef's name was John and man oh man John was definitely THE MAN of the night! We sat at the bar to watch him at his craft and it was definitely an artistry (see pics posted).  We started with the Kampachi Sashimi which I have no words for. It was simply perfect and melted right in my mouth. Next was a soft shell crab hand roll topped with salmon. The salmon was like butter as you bite into a crispy soft shell crab. We had quite a bit more after these but the rest is history as I could go on and on. My advice is you have to just go there and see for yourself because everything was great!"}
{"text":"Go! Just go! Have just finished lunch. From the moment we were greeted it was a great experience. This seems like a real locals place, excepting our presence. Started with the beef Gyoza and the tempura (mixed). Then had the No Name, No. 5 and Pink Lady rolls. Nothing left us disappointed, in fact it left us wanting to come back because it rivaled our favorite restaurant from home. Everything was simply excellent. The selection wasn't too overwhelming, like some sushi bars can be. They had the basics and the more complex. I can't stress enough how good everything was/is. Go! Just go!"}
{"text":"This place was good last time I was here. Ordered \"something wrong\" roll which is supposed to be chefs special. It totally sucked! A step above California roll and highest price on the menu. Not worth the trip for sure. Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and reasonable. The service
Was awesome and the sushi Devine. You have to try their version of a jalapeño popper, stuffed with cream cheese and fish with a delicious sauce on top."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a cool atmosphere and friendly help. Daniel was very nice and engaging. The sushi was very yummy."}
{"text":"We've been a fan of this Las Vegas sushi bar for several years and have recommended it to many friends.  Lately we've been hearing some negative comments from friends whose opinion I respected especially when it comes to Japanese cuisine.  Well tonight Mrs, youngest daughter and I had a  disappointing dinner.  We were staying at the Orleans and had dinner at the ondori last nite and we're surprised with quality of the fresh seafood, especially the uni, sake and tuna selections.  At Bocho we waited a while to order our drinks and sashimi. The sashimi was presented before our drinks arrived so I waited a few minutes so that I could enjoy the ice cold Japanese beer with the sashimi.  I waited far too long and had never in all my life had such terrible service. The quality of the sashimi was definitely lacking and there was very little conversation between the sushi chef and the customers.  I tried to make conversation with both sushi chefs but was not successful.  It was 6:30 and they were out  of uni and kumbachi, but we were charged for them. Sad to say that Bocho will not be on our Las Vegas restaurant list when we visit twice each year nor will we be recommending it to anyone.  Sayonara!"}
{"text":"Bocho is proof that great restaurants exist outside of the strip! Looking for amazing food and want to get away from all the craziness on the strip? You've found your restaurant! Want your traditional sushi bar experience? Take a seat on one of the stools downstairs. Want something more intimate? There's tables upstairs with a bartender on duty!

This gem is a great combination of everything you could look for in a restaurant. Great service, amazing food&drinks, and the best atmosphere (totally hipster). The sushi and appetizers are on point (we're from LA, a land of great sushi restaurants, and we give this place two thumbs up!) My girlfriends and I came here for one of my bachelorette party dinners, and we had an awesome time. Alex, the manager and his staff were attentive and the food came out in a timely manner.

We'll definitely be coming back and I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone!"}
{"text":"Solid DTLV spot. Fresh fish and great service. We were seated upstairs and we beat dinner rush. All the rolls were tasty and very creative....get here!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, fresh, and great value for such a convenient location downtown. Cool decor, knowledgeable staff of servers and sushi chefs. My first visit here they comped me an order of yellowtail belly and I have been hooked since!"}
{"text":"I love this place. There's a wide variety of sushi available from the basics, to the grandiose. I personally am a fan of the Las Vegas roll, mm. Cream cheese and avocado and deep fried methods are my jam. Or in this case, my roll...

Also, I will come back here time and time again for the salmon sashimi. First of all, the presentation is very refreshing. It's served on ice, with the standard ginger, wasabi, and garnishings. I love that they include an orchid flower. Definitely is a nice touch! But let me tell you, the salmon itself had me falling asleep dreaming about it all night afterwards. It's very fresh, buttery, and overall just delicious. I'd come back just for that. 

Sitting at the bar is fun too! The guys working back there are pretty fun to talk to and interact with.

I only knocked it down one star because parking is a hassle, but with downtown that's expected. Hey, at least you can walk off all that sashimi afterwards!"}
{"text":"The sushi at this place is phenomenal!!! I had the baked salmon roll which was drizzled with a sweet sauce which was just the extra ump for the sushi. I would recommend to anyone. Customer service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Bocho is amazing! Our second time back this week, the service is phenomenal. The sushi chefs worked with my boyfriends food allergies. Very personal and easy priced, definitely will be on our favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"This place is definitely good! I went here with a friend and got there about 15 minutes before happy hour was over and they let us do it anyway. 

We ordered a few rolls and they were all delicious. The fish tastes fresh and the rolls didn't fall apart. 

The ambiance is nice and mellow and it's off Fremont street so it isn't crazy busy or hard to find parking. 

We go to pay for our check and forgot we were there during happy hour and our waiter realized he charged us full price so he fixed it before running our card. That's awesome and shows integrity of their employees since we didn't even notice the difference before lol 

Definitely coming back here, they rock."}
{"text":"Great spot off the strip. Roll number #5 was amazing. Friendly service and comfortable environment. Seemed very local. Worth the uber from the strip."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sushi place in the whole las vegas valley!!!! Downtown is growing rapid with quality restaurants but this one shines among all the other ones. It's been 2nd time visiting this place and the food is getting better. If you are looking for sushi or rolls, check it out."}
{"text":"Truly rewarding sushi experience. the Poke is fresh and spicy, Mexican roll is awesome for spice lovers and sashimi is perfectly prepared made to order. The staff is what puts this place over the top. Karaoke lounges also....what are you waiting for? 5 stars across the board as I am going back to Bocho very soon!"}
{"text":"Don't let the star rating of the place fool you into going there. The sushi chef was rude. We asked for garlic edamame 3 times before receiving just salted edamame. Asked for no cucumber in a roll, got cucumber. Then hostess took our drink order halfway through our spicy meal. Terrible."}
{"text":"Great quick lunch spot in Downtown Las Vegas.  Very accommodating with the 2nd floor seating if you are entertaining a large party.  I normally sit at the sushi bar as the chef's are always very approachable and their service is incredibly fast.  I highly recommend trying their Shishito peppers and the Salmon Skin Roll ($5.50) is a great value.  My favorite two specialty rolls are the No. 5 (Crab, cucumber, avocado, cajun albacore, spicy tuna topped with crispy onions) and the Yellowtail lover (yellowtail, avocado, cucumber, spicy yellowtail).  When the crispy onions melt into the soy/yuzo sauce, you will ask for a spoon to shovel the tangy delicious mixture into your feed hole."}
{"text":"This place is off the beaten path for sure BUT definitely worth the risk. The Miss soup was amazing the saki was the bomb and the sushi was off the hook . Came here for my daughters 21st birthday for a second choice because the Golden Nugget was an hour wait. Glad I made the choice everyone was very happy with the food and the staff was very friendly A+++"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi spot! Very accommodating on tweaking their menu if asked. My husband said \"even the water was good\"...lol ... Eric was on his sushi making game!! \"Baked\" Washington roll was excellent ...And Angela was a joy and we never had to ask her for anything...it was just there when we needed it!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and sashimi, friendly chefs, intimate setting for a great dinning experience. Came here twice while in Vegas and have my sushi expectations redefined."}
{"text":"Totally decent sushi place with higher-than-average prices. It is one of the only sushi place in DTLV. They don't offer AYCE, but that's forgivable in such a trendy area. The nigiri is good and the portions are large-to-average sized. The salmon is fresh and the specialty rolls are creative and are worth the price. I would not come here often as there are other sushi places in town, but if you're looking for sushi downtown, this is your best bet."}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Las Vegas.
I always eat upstairs at the bar and love the fish and the service.

They have a great happy hour and a great atmosphere upstairs. From good music to the game on the TV. If you are looking for a cool spot to go with friends I recommend checking this place out and hanging out upstairs

Also this place is on ItsOnMe so you can buy a friend a drink or bite to eat here right from your phone or their website in just a few clicks"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch the other day on a weekday, so I had about an hour and 15 min at the MOST. It wasn't packed, but it took about 30 minutes to get our food, and the prices were quite steep.

I ordered the Bocho lunch box, which came with 3 pieces of sushi, 3 pieces of Nigiri, tempura, miso soup, and rice. My friend ordered the Shunga box which came with 4 pieces of california roll, choice of black cod, salmon, or mackerel, tempura, rice, and miso soup. 

They were out of the black cod which she wanted, so she ordered the salmon. Our tempura was NOT equally portioned, she had heaping pieces of shrimp, yams, onion, etc. and I had a few onions and 1 shrimp. My sushi and sashimi were all tuna, yellowtail and salmon, which were unfortunately not quite flavorful, and on the smaller side. I ordered Uni sushi which wasn't bad, but was $9.50!!! The other sushi places I usually go to are usually around $7. 

We didn't get a ton of food and it was well over $50.00 for the two of us. I was thrilled DT had a sushi joint, but I'm underwhelmed for now."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a coworker at Bocho about a month ago. The place was busy, but we were able to get in quickly since she had made reservations. I ordered the chirashi lunch box and it was delicious! It was almost as good as the chirashi box I usually order from Sushi Go 55 in LA."}
{"text":"Bocho is an excellent dive Sushi spot, and I mean this in the best possible way conveniently (but inauspiciously) located about a block South of Freemont St on 6th. The fish is fresh and flavorful and the prices are reasonable. They're a little lite on special Maki rolls but I'm a sashimi person anyway. Most importantly the service was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Downtown really needed a sushi place! My friend and I walked by and decided to try it and we were pleasantly surprised. The staff is so genuine and attentive, the sushi was amazing, and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I'm so excited to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere and wonderful service.  Great place for sushi that's not too far off the strip and walking distance from Fremont St.  I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great place, the food was very tasty, do check out their raw specials. The service could be better (faster), but considering the food quality I still give it a 5."}
{"text":"So decided to have dinner here last night and it turned out to be a great choice.

We came in a little before closing and were welcomed by the friendly staff and amazing sushi chef. 

The menu is pretty simple. Nothing to outrageous and they have plenty for everyone's tastes. Not a whole lot of specialty rolls like the other places but a good selection. 

We went with the yellowtail lover roll and the China roll. Both were pretty tasty. The rolls themselves are slightly smaller than some other sushi joints but packed full of flavor. The spicy tuna on the China roll was excellent. Some places butcher their spicy tuna and it loses it flavor but they did it right. 

We also had the Screaming O which was my friends favorite. It's seared tuna with shredded radish and this amazing sauce. The whole fish is right on point.

We had a few selection of nigiri and let the chef decide on that. His selections were fresh and tasty even for being closing time.

The whole staff was friendly and attentive and that goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, and fair prices!  Couple blocks from Fremont St.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great sushi, impeccable service. There wasn't an Omakase but the chef graciously put one together. The whole meal was delicious!  The uni with quail egg was scrumptious. Fresh fish served sashimi, nigiri, and maki style. Got a free sake just for checking in!  Short jaunt to Fremont street. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We accidentally stumbled into this place and we are glade we did !!!! The food is amazing as well as the service. We are definitely going back when in Vegas again, no longer eating in the hotels when hidden gems like this are out their as well!!"}
{"text":"It is just down right amazing!  I have worked in two sushi restaurants, both of great quality and stature but Vegas has a real gem on its hand!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few good sushi places in town, right in downtown LV. 

Their fish is always fresh, service is not necessarily super friendly but still polite and efficient.

Sushi combo, to me, gives most \"bang for your buck\". 7 nigiri with futomaki or cali roll.

Their rice to fish ratio in nigiri is something that should be noted. Small rice to big fish. Just the way I like it!!

Their chirashi was very nice, very beautifully done. But, with this one, they give you almost 2 servings of rice 

Recommend this place for girls night, date night, and lunch. Not sure how kids-friendly this place could be as I've never taken my child here, but from the look of the establishment and clientele, I'm assuming not?"}
{"text":"Carlos,

I made it very clear that I did not leave your facility. The way my pictures show on my post is exactly how your staff handed me my food."}
{"text":"4 stars because the rolls are delicious and filling. 

First time having their oyster mushroom that's cooked in butter and it was delectable. 

-1 star on the green tea. It's a bag in a filter in a pot in lukewarm water."}
{"text":"This place had great rolls and we really enjoyed the chef's choice where the chef picks and makes you something. They don't have a ton of rolls to pick from, but the food is fresh. I enjoyed their shot options too. (uni, oyster, and quail egg) Their downstairs area is small but have an upstairs for larger parties. Call ahead if it's more than a couple people. Happy hour deal is great."}
{"text":"This small sushi spot in dtlv definitely packs a huge punch with their amazing food and happy hour. On a recent trip to the area, my friends and I couldn't get enough from our first visit, so we had to come back a second time the day after. I ordered different items from their menu each day and was thoroughly impressed both times. Their ramen is a hefty portion and has a good amount of toppings, along with their high quality ingredients they use to make their rolls, it's a winner for anyone looking for exceptional Japanese food in the area. Don't forget to order your sake to complete your meal! :)"}
{"text":"The sushi was ooooooooookkkkk nothing to rave about. I had high expectations from this place, but I have had way better sushi and quality."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding, the sushi rolls were great, loved the special Flying Hawaiian.  Our sushi chef was super cool and made us anything we wanted. Good service and chill, upstairs has karaoke rooms if you're ready to have fun."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here it has been for lunch. The lunch specials are awesome and the service is great. They are very friendly and the food is yummy. I wish they would make the rolls a little faster but I guess perfection takes time."}
{"text":"Yellowtail jalapeño is my favorite small bite!!  I still can't decide which of the other rolls are my favorite but I love this place! You can't beat having a complimentary shot of sake, 30% off and the atmosphere! Oh, I can't forget the customer service! The staff here is so attentive! I'm never waiting to be seated, to order or to receive my bill! I've been here twice in one week, that should say enough!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after exploring down town Freemont st. Its a bit off the beaten path but theres a ton of cool street art along the way! 

We had lunch at the bar during happy hour which can't be beat! Drinks are yummy, and sushi was made fresh & fast! I'll be back next time we're in vegas!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a good sushi option downtown! Not my favorite in Las Vegas as a whole, but we also have great sushi options overall. I like sitting at the bar on the bottom floor."}
{"text":"Yummy place!! The ocean trout and oysters are awesome! The waitress is so nice! Some of the rolls take away from the deliciousness of the fish, but if you order plainer dishes the freshness stands out."}
{"text":"The ambiance in here is awesome for couples or small groups. Also, not what you'd expect from a lower priced sushi joint off of Fremont St. in downtown LV. It's classy, and quaint. We tried everything, from the seaweed salad to the mochi. DELICIOUS... but if I had to choose one menu item, the Poke Monster roll. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"We will have to make this a new tradition every time we are in Vegas.  Bocho Balls and the Dragon Rolll were great."}
{"text":"Upstairs room was understaffed. Seated for an hour before we saw a roll. Apparently the rolls weren't even put in. When we did get them the rolls with sauce on top were drowning in sauce. The soft shell crab was terrible but we had to eat it since we were waiting so long for rolls. Underwhelmed and not satisfied."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. 
Service was great
Employees were happy and friendly very attentive. 

All you can eat sushi is $30 for dinner 
Single servings are great prices and So delicious 

MILITARY DISCOUNT Available. :-)"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi order the flying Hawaiian you will be glad you did.  Rolls are huge beer is cold fish is fresh. What is not to like about this place."}
{"text":"I am a local and try to get here at least 1x a week. Andrew is an amazing sushi chef. He delivers awesome food each time and and I've never been disappointed. My fav sushi place in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Closes at 10:45. Wouldn't even let us place a to-go order. Call ahead if you're coming in late."}
{"text":"Welcome back Jimmy & Becky!!!

All restaurants have tough service when they first open so never fair to review based on this until at least a month in business...just my opinion. We sat at the sushi bar downstairs and it's just plain SIMPLE, Jimmy hasn't lost a step. Excellent sushi, terrific vibe and my wife and I are glad to have our Sunday afternoon sushi place back in business in a cool new location. All my Sushi $$$ coming ur way. Cheers and good luck..."}
{"text":"I love Bocho sushi!!!! Let me repeat myself, I love Bocho sushi!!! I love the pink lady. It is such a unique and Kluepfel spin on sushi. It has a pink wrap instead of seaweed and it has cubed a mango and veggies on top and it's the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I absolutely love it. Last night we had the garlic edamame. It was garlicky and delicious. We also had the chefs special which was very thinly sliced fish with truffle oil and a delicious florally kind of sauce. We also had a surprise Roll that had orange slices and it was just incredible. The sushi chefs here are unique, they are playful with their flavors, and always super nice and friendly. We usually sit at the sushi bar because the sushi chefs actually enjoy speaking to their diners. Unlike with some others to she shops where they don't really speak to you. And the prices cannot be beat. On my last visit we ordered for rolls and a Edamame side and it was $52! That cannot be beat! The fish is fresh and food delicious"}
{"text":"The wife and I were staying at the Golden Nugget and wanted some sushi that wasn't the in-house (and low-rated) Red Sushi. Yelp helped us find Bocho and we weren't disappointed. Great sushi and service!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi place, but the don't have adequate space to cook food and have it delivered timely. I have walked out of here twice. Both times, I waited 30 to be told that our food was never put in. I caught them in lies twice about why they didn't get my food in on time. Horrible service and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Decent sushi in downtown Las Vegas.
Worth checking out if you are downtown or looking for something that isn't AYCE or conveyor belt.
I generally only eat nigiri. Had salmon/sake that was well cut and tasty, albacore that was clean tasting and smooth as butter, yellowtail/hamachi that was tasty as well. Well packed, tight, rice balls too. The chicken Kara age was in large pieces, though, and not quite as crispy or tempura-like as I like it.
Semi hidden off of Fremont, but worth the walk."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Great service. Or sushi chef, Andrew was on point! Everything he prepared was delicious."}
{"text":"Extremely good sushi. Friendly staff. A little off the beaten track in the Fremont area."}
{"text":"The food was good. Wish they had more variety and a Sashimi platter different sizes. Small place but close to Fremont street."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great!  We took the deuce buss from the strip to Front Street for food and fun. Walking down 6th street I was a little concerned about what I maybe walking into (a little rough looking on the outside). But as soon as we walked in we found the place to be very nice inside. The service was good and the food great. We had miso soup, the fried stuffed jalapeños, #5, pink lady and yellowtail lover. The #5 was our favorite. The fried onion joints on top were great. The plank lady was good. The pink lady was one of the most unique rolls, in a good way, I have ever had. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive about this place. The two men behind the sushi bar were friendly, but the additional staff seemed uptight and bothered during a non-busy lunch hour visit. Had crispy rice with tuna, miso, and edamame. Nothing was much good. The crispy rice was a special and I was expecting a bowl, so the dish was a surprise. A small description would be helpful. Edamame tasted like it wasn't fresh and the garlic sauce they were drenched in lacked a decent flavor. The most disappointing part was the miso soup. This tasted like it came straight from a packet and it lacked actual miso flavor. Don't have any intention to return, but I will say the prices weren't atrocious. I wish downtown businesses would work on feeling more friendly and happy to have the business of patrons."}
{"text":"The sushi was awesome. Great sake selection. The flavors in the special rolls are very well done. For example, where they have jalapeno in their rolls, it's not fireball hot. Just a nuanced flavor. Well done!"}
{"text":"If you're a sushi lover - This a is a refreshing new place you may want to visit while in the new revitalized community of downtown Fremont east.


We had made a reservation prior which I would strongly recommend if your planning a gathering of 4 or more.

As you walk in, the staff immediately welcomes you in Japanese and you get a sense of warmth with all the smiles from the chefs and staff.

My group were led upstairs to a very Art Deco asian inspired loft with a bar and the first thing I noticed was the place setting giving the atmosphere a polished dining experience.

The wait staff were friendly and efficient, shout out to Taylor, our waiter, he did a wonderful job of anticipating our needs.

After drinks and starters, our meal arrived in a timely manner, there were some unexpected downfalls, not from the waiter but from the arrival of some of the dishes.

The beef Gyoza arrived but they seemed to be a little cold, one person in my party had some bones in her salmon, but we were more concerned for other patrons that we let him know so no one else would encounter what one of my dining members encountered.

A slight mix up of yellow tail sushi - but quickly recovered, we still, overall enjoyed ourselves.

The prices are typical of what you would expect of a sushi place and the presentation of all the food we ordered, was visually appealing and tasty.

I discovered they have a couple of private rooms that could host a nice group guests for a more seclusive and intimate experience. I also learned that there will Karaoke available for those rooms for a little entertainment.

The background music was fun and enjoyable and wasn't intolerable.

This is definitely a nice place to enjoy great Japanese cuisine before hitting the rest of downtown Fremont, I would suggest that if you love sushi, definitely hit this place up.
At the bar, you can sit if you're flying solo or if your a couple.

The experience overall is comforting and enjoyable, besides the couple of minor incidences, I think the rating I gave is fair.

I will definitely recommend rhis place to others.

:)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent Sushi says the Sushi snob (me).  Quaint vintage Vegas location/secret reserved spot for the locals, but welcoming to the unassuming.  Cornered at the John E Carson hotel and near the Freemont experience, the atmosphere is fun, and the Sushi is traditional.  You won't regret or forget your time here!!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the downtown restaurant scene. We had a number of rolls and they were all very good. Service exceeded my expectations for a new restaurant on a busy night. The only need for improvement would be to speed up the time to takes for you to receive your food. Some of our rolls took 25 minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing highly recommend  the yellow tial sashimi, poke monster, and dirty Sanchez!!! All Soo good!"}
{"text":"We're from Hawaii and pretty picky when it comes to sushi, we were in town to play in a softball tournament and a few guys from the group are fisherman.  I read reviews and decided to give this restaurant a try. Here's the Pros

-They take reservations! I called in and they were happy to take a party of 9 for the same night.  A lot of AYCE places don't take reservations.
-menu was extensive you can either order ala carte, or 30$ for all you can eat.  I would recommend the all you can eat, it's worth it.
-The AYCE menu is huge and the sushi was Very fresh and tasty. They don't serve lots of rice and a small fish on top to fill you up, it was opposite the rice was small and the fish was a big portion. great deal. The fisherman in our group gave their thumbs up on the quality.  
-We had a really nice private room for our group and we had Free Karaoke! 
I asked about this and it's free when ordering 100$ or more, this was no problem for us. We had a great night eating, drinking and singing till closing.
-Lastly this place opened 6 months ago so it's new and nicely decorated.
-over all great sushi place that's close to downtown

The only Con was that the area that it was in didn't look so Hip from the outside, but inside it was awesome!!  We'll be here again next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Chef was very knowledgeable, helpful, & fun to talk to. My bf is usually VERY hard to please with food and he loved it! So comfy & intimate, just what we were looking for! Service, food, & atmosphere is outstanding. Don't pass this one up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas. Ingredients are very fresh, and sushi are well prepare, very flavorful.  I like hot , spicy  flavor; and there are many specialty  sushi rolls that is very spicy,  very tasty.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bocho Sushi is the best quality sushi in vegas. I was in vegas for 15 days for work and ate here with my friends on 3 separate occasions. The wait staff is amazing. The food is spectacular. And it's priced fairly for the quality of service and food you receive. Also, chef drew is the absolute shit!!!!! He hooked it up with some awesome chef selections. 

Amberjack, ono, and blue fin tuna are my new favorites."}
{"text":"A hip, contemporary sushi spot was what downtown Vegas was missing, and Bocho filled that void. With competitive prices and scrumptious menu items, it gives other restaurants in the area a run for their money. 

Regular lunch and dinner menus are offered, but if you want the AYCE experience, you can have that too. Both my friend and I ordered the AYCE dinner, which is 30 bucks per person. The menu is unlike the exhaustive list of specialty rolls, entrees, and appetizers found at other sushi restaurants; although, it doesn't include items offered on their regular menu. 

Sitting on the second floor loft beats eating at the crowded sushi bar. I do like how the two are separated. The bar was much busier and louder as opposed to the laid-back atmosphere above. Plus, the seats are cushioned and there are pillows!

Here's what I ordered, and I'd most likely select these again.

* Calamari Skewers (yeaah, squid on a stick!)
* Baked Salmon Roll
­* Crunch Dragon Roll
* Las Vegas Roll
* Unagi
* Masago (no quail egg available)
* Garlic tuna 
* Fatty tuna 
* Octopus 

My favorite roll was the baked salmon with cream cheese, avocado, crab, and baked salmon on the outside. The sashimi was also delicious. I wouldn't mind returning to eat just sashimi and calamari skewers. 

Our food arrived promptly, and the service was great. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! My sister in law and I were in town for her birthday and wanted to get sushi before getting ready to hit a show that night. Service was Quick! TOO quick where it kinda felt like the waitress was trying to rush me in to ordering cause she was so busy. The place was dead on a friday afternoon only 2 tables had people and the bar which is downstairs had 2-3 siting there. ( not gonna knock off any stars since she was really nice) 

food was great! We ordered the tofu, salmon roll, spicy tuna roll and the flying hawaiian. compared to california sushi the prices are pretty expensive, for all of those plus 2 drinks we paid about 55 before tip which for 2 cali girls was kinda steep since we are so spoiled with good cheap sushi. Even thought it was pricey I would def come back if I was in town."}
{"text":"This place is great. Polite staff, big generous rolls, fair price and good quality. Definitely try it out and get the jalapeno bomb."}
{"text":"Bocho Sushi is a super cool trendy sushi spot downtown. They have all bar seats downstairs but there is an upstairs with tables. You can choose elevator or stairs which was nice because my bf is currently with crutches. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The price is a little high and their menu is a little small. We ordered salmon sashimi and the dirty sanchez roll which were both delicious and fresh. I would definitely recommend if your downtown!"}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path from Fremont. Location not well seen. But once u get inside its impressive.   two stories with downstairs for the sushi bar and upstairs nice tables. 
Love the ambiance"}
{"text":"We loved this place! It was so refreshing to find reasonably priced food in Vegas and it's so close to Freemont st! The people were great and the food was perfect!!! 
We did the Pinklady roll which was delicious, a spicy yellowtail( a Yelp recommendation, was quite spicy but good) and a john e Carson roll- highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and if you don't order the Screaming O you are not living life to fullest!!"}
{"text":"Sushi rolls were good and fresh. Reasonably priced for the quality we got.  Location is tucked away in Fremont but worth going.  I will go back again. The only hang up I had was we ordered 4 orders if mochis and it was one mochi cut in half. Instead of two full mochis.  Staff was friendly and we got our food quick."}
{"text":"Best Sushi restaurant in downtown Las Vegas.  Must try.  Oysters are bomb.  Shumai.. ramen.  Sashimi sushi.."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the unagi and the servers and chefs were very friendly. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in downtown Vegas. They also have a private karaoke  room for small groups."}
{"text":"In town visiting Vegas and had to get my sushi fix!! This place is 5 star. Suburb sushi, outstanding staff and service. I could not have asked for better food or service. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The vibe was really nice as soon as you walk in. The entire place was very classy and the food was delicious while still being cheaper than other sushi places around the area. Make sure to take advantage of the free saki shot by checking in. Would refer a friend and ask that they take me back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, everything is great. It tastes fresh and I personally let the chef use his creativity. He never disappoints, and I'm pretty picky! Def check this spot out of you're downtown."}
{"text":"Bocho is our local favorite sushi place.  The fish is fresh and the creativity is amazing coming from the chefs- Andrew/Daniel & Yoshi.    Carlos the owner & (Mercie,Ryan & Luis) are warm and go out of their way to make all their customers welcome.  Thank You for placing downtown on the map for an outstanding sushi restaurant.

{"text":"Hidden secret if you can get their. Yum if you make it. A small sushi bar around 15 around the downtown area. We had to ask how to get their. Way cool. Food delish. I would recommend. Artsy keepdown town alive!  We need more spots like this."}
{"text":"From the outside you may think twice but you'd be making a mistake to miss going into Bocho. 
Differently some of the best sushi I've had, also try the cucumber salad and the seaweed salad both with delicious fresh flavors.
Step out and don't get caught in a rut of commercial looking restaurants, you'll be surprised."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have ever had. The chef John was knowledgable and friendly, as was the staff! They also offer Celiac-friendly gluten free sushi! They have gluten free Tamari soy sauce as well, and their house drinks are scrumptious! Just tell the server you are gf and they will take care of you! Happy Hour is a great deal here, 3 - 6 all sushi is 30% off, but the rolls are reasonably priced, especially for the quality! 
10/10 go here!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you.  This neighborhood gem was amazing.  Very very creatively flavorable dishes.  And they will make something for you to your specific taste.  Food was fresh, and they often have numerous types of Toro.  And the best part, was not a million dollars, food was priced exceptionally well for it's value.  This place is off the strip, if you walk/drive to fast you will almost miss it.  I'd rather go here anytime.  Can't say enough good things; and I was very skeptical at first.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Yummmy"}
{"text":"GET THE NUMBER 5 ROLL

if there is nothing you take away from this review, take that.  It is a great fun roll. . .

Going to vegas I often have mixed thoughts on the food.  Most of the food on the strip (even if headlined by some chef).  Though this trip I had a few good experiences and Boncho is definitly one of them.

This place is walking distance from the Freemont experience.

I used the Yelp app to reserve a time for us (but the place wasn't busy).  Service was good and the rolls were both tasty and affordable."}
{"text":"Had a great double date here with friends from out of town. Environment is good, drinks were good, food was great. Service was a little spotty, but very relational throughout evening. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!
Went here for dinner on my 21st and they brought us amazing Sushi, amazing service, and even charged my phone!"}
{"text":"I was there about a week and a half ago but finally have time to write this. Perfect hole in the wall spot in downtown Las Vegas. I ordered the pokemonster which I highly recommend, the absolute best I've ever had! Big serving and fills you up fast! Reasonably priced and staff is super cool and engaged with us in conversation plus provided useful tips for us visitors, such a cozy little spot, perfect if you wanna chill lo key and away from the Strip crayziness. We are def stopping by next trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi house, great custom met service and the food is scrumptious. Definitely stop by when in the area."}
{"text":"I been here a few times...and I'm so happy with it. The staff is always friendly and engaging when you enter and throughout the dining experience. You have the option to dine at the sushi bar on the first floor or the main dining room on the second floor. The second floor is also where they have the private rooms for karaoke (I have yet to try). The restaurant is clean and new having just opened this year. Japanese warriors grace the walls, the stairs are adorned with samurai swords and bonsai trees at the sushi bar. AYCE is not offered here and I'm okay with that. I prefer quality over quantity. The rolls are handled with care and the specials are great. I enjoyed the Japanese Snapper nigiri and also had a chance to try the grilled Amber Jack collar. What a wonderful dish! My partner said the jalapeño bomb was the best he has had in the city. Not dry like others may have. Attention to detail and care for the outcome makes this number one in my book. Thank you to our great sushi chef June (sp?) who introduced us to the amber jack collar! We will be back."}
{"text":"Great little sushi spot. Excellent Sushi and excellent prices. Came in to grab some take out order and the staff was extremely hospitable. The ambiance was also very hip."}
{"text":"Good sushi and service.  I liked the WTF and Las Vegas rolls. This is close to Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"Love this place never disappoints me!! We always go on Fridays during lunch time never a long wait & amazing staff!"}
{"text":"Opted for a table, but there was no host so we waited for 5 minutes and then walked up stairs. The food runner/ service assistant set us up a table and the seemingly overwhelmed waitress came to take our order.

After ordering our sushi the rolls took 15 minutes to come. The drinks took 10. Our server explained that the bartender was very busy and we then realized that there was only one bartender for the entire restaurant.

When our food came we found the fish fishy. The imitation crab in the rainbow roll was blergh and the shrimp was so dry it was almost crunchy (it wasn't tempura).

We got two rolls, one sashimi, and one sushi. For the sushi the rice fell off of the fish as soon as we tried to pick it up (sign of bad sushi making). When we walked past the sushi bar it smelt fishy. The bocho martini was bitter and tasted like straight up cucumber peel. I sent it back.

The John E. Carson roll and the Garlic Tuna sashimi were tasty. However, we spent $5 less than we would have at our favorite AYCE place (Sakana) and Sakana has better quality fish and better service.

I would have rather eaten at Sakana and been full when I left. Not going to Bocho again."}
{"text":"Get it. The yellowtail lover and Bocho special were some of the best rolls I'd ever gotten. Plus the quality of the sashimi is amazing! The hot sauce they offer with it is the perfect balance of sweet and hot. Get here now!"}
{"text":"Ate at the world market pop up location.  It was definitely a better place to eat than all other options I saw in the food court.  Better fish than expected given the location.  Enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food quality is actually quite good, but despite that, I have to give this place the fewest stars possible. Good fish does not begin to make up for the worst omakase experience I have ever had. We arrived about 1 hour prior to closing and asked if they could do the $75 a head, 2 person minimum omakase. They took our order, with no indication of a problem, then proceeded to pile food in front of us as fast as they could make it. Some things were one per person, some were evidently meant to be shared. No explanation of what was being served. At one point the waitress took an untouched dish from its serving tray and put it on our side plates so that she could add another dish in front of us. Meanwhile they're sweeping up around us. 25 minutes before closing we indicated we were feeling rushed. Our server hid in a corner. The manager? apologized, but the damage was done. To be honest, the apology did not seem that genuine anyways. They took a small percentage off our bill, and I'm pretty sure we never got the full omakase (I've never had one that didn't include some kind of dessert). We certainly will not return."}
{"text":"I was craving some sushi for a while and went there with my husband last weekend for a happy hour. We both enjoyed their sushi soooo much!!! And they had great happy hour prices!
The service was great too. We are definatelly going back there soon!"}
{"text":"Ok brothers and sisters, here's the scoop on Bocho. Hands down best sushi in Vegas. I don't say this on a trivial whim, I say this because from waitstaff to the sushi chefs everything was great. However, if your dead set against leaving the strip then you are sure to miss this gem. If your staying on Freemont street, it's just a short three block walk. Fish is extremely fresh and tasty. Sushi chefs willing to suggest and let you try new things out of your comfort zone. If you need your sushi fix and staying in Vegas, don't hesitate to come visit these guys.

As a side note, they have an \"All You Can Eat\" special for 30 bones that is a crazy value for sushi lovers, but if AYCE is not your style then there is the Happy Hour 30% off deal that is sure to please."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and atmosphere. Would definitely eat here again! Prices are typical, not overly high. Wish they had a sushi/sashimi combo on their dinner menu. It's only available at lunch so you have to order sushi a la carte at dinner which can get pricy. Oh, and they have Asahi on tap!"}
{"text":"Never got to eat. After an hour still no sushi. When the hostess asks you how your dinner was and you haven't even been served, you know the place is slow. Hire a chef. Bummer, as I was starved and wanted to try this place."}
{"text":"We ordered two tuna sashimi, two yellowtail sashimi, a yellowtail lovers roll -special requested it spicy, a pink lady roll -also special requested it spicy, and two large sake. It totaled to under $80. The food was mind blowing and the atmosphere was comfortable. The yellowtail was out of this world. The tuna was average. The rolls were genius. The service was excellent. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! I live downtown and this sushi place is close N convient! The food was great and the staff super friendly! I find the pricing is not too bad, and the food is awesome! I tried some things that were recommended and I was not disappointed, I have only been once but guarantee I will be back!"}
{"text":"After checking out Container Park, stopped in here for HH. Place was basically empty around 4 pm on a Tuesday. Sat upstairs. After being ignored for a good 10 minutes finally got a waiter's attention. Think it might have been his first day. Asked what the HH specials were and someone at the bar area said it was 30% off bill not including AYCE. Fine. Only wanted apps anyway. Waiter comes back and we order shishito peppers ($4.50), baked green lip mussels ($6.95) and spicy tuna roll ($5.95) plus large hot sake.

You only receive FOUR peppers though they are large. Taste was fine. Mussels were kind of strange. I thought tasted OK, DH did not. Roll was very mushy and not spicy at all. Sake was fine.

OK, back to getting the bill. Waiter obviously saw we were ordering off app menu and we confirmed with him about the 30% discount. So he drops bill at the table and charges us for 2 AYCE dinners! WTF. We were the ONLY diners upstairs so he couldn't get us mixed up with someone else. This guy was extremely polite but totally clueless. Won't be back. Nothing impressed at all."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years since it opened and its consistently good. Tonight was the best yet. The salmon collar alone is terrific and we also had beef skewers, gyoza and several excellent rolls. Subtle tastes, solid portions and friendly and well informed service. Prices are lower than yould expect plus good discounts for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place was deeeeelicious! EVERYTHING we had was amazing! We ordered Baked Mussels, Dynamite, Screaming Orgasm and Crunch Dragon. Everything was fresh and tasty. We ate every bite...not even a crumb was left behind. LOL! We'd definitely come back again.

We decided to have Mochi (mango flavor) and WOW what a way to end this great dinner."}
{"text":"The Ragin Cajun is the best sushi roll I've ever had. This place is so delicious, and unassuming, and you can watch the chefs prepare the rolls at the bar. (I found it to be more impressive than other places I've seen sushi prepared.) I will definitely be back, probably countless times. This is my new #1 for sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've visited Bocho several times over the last few years and I will absolutely continue visiting this little spot. One bit of feedback, fix the downstairs air conditioning. When you have to use a fan on the floor pointing up to keep a place cool, maybe it's time to fix it :) ? Other than that, it's a great place and I'm glad it's close by."}
{"text":"Possibly the best sushi in vegas. Checked this place out for an early dinner with my big brother. Seating is really cool, tables and full bar upstairs with a sushi bar downstairs. We sat upstairs at a regular table. We ordered three rolls including the Las Vegas roll and spicy tuna. All of which were huge and so very delicious. 

The wait staff was a bunch of very friendly and laid back (and actually totally cute) boys. They were attentive and totally on the ball the whole time. I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Been here two times 3 days. Simply amazing! Great staff, food and environment! You won't be disappointed!!!!!! Come get you a lil piece of awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and small as topical sushi joint. Just a quick grab when I was pass by to charge my car at the supercharger in downtown. Will come back with my family. Great service and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a few days, craving sushi. Checked yelp for downtown sushi places. We were at the D and wanted it to be walking distance. Found Bocho Sushi with 4-1/2 stars, thought we'd try it. 7-8 min walk and it was absolutely more than worth it. From walking in the door, to leaving very satisfied, everyone and everything was fantastic. We had number 5 and Johnny E. Carson specialty rolls and they were delicious. I highly recommend this excellently run establishment. Oh, I almost forgot, as we were walking about a half a block from Bocho Sushi, we heard someone trying to get our attention. It was a young lady employed at Bocho, asking if my husband left his baseball hat. It wasn't ours but that was an very kind thing to do. Just another great part of our visit."}
{"text":"Great lunch special, happy hour and all you can eat. NEW CHEF has plenty ideas and unique creativity to make this sushi spot your favorite. Cool bar upstairs and karaoke rooms as well! Sushi and downtown, what better date night."}
{"text":"We were staying in Fremont and decided to check this place out at about 915 one night. Place closes at 10pm but staff was still very welcoming. We ordered hot sake, yellow fish specialty roll, rainbow roll, and spicy tuna. Everything was delicious!!! The place was a bit hard to find but other than that it was great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Bocho Sushi consistently serves up great Bento Boxes for lunch, Happy Hour is always on point with amazing drink specials and dinner is B O M B ! Don't sleep on the Jalapeño Bombers, Yellowtail Jalapeño and WTF Rolls if you like spicy like me!!!! My kids love the California and Crunch Dragon Rolls... And the Sashimi has always been very fresh. In the heart of Downtown with excellent service, great neighborhood feel and not an attack on my back pocket!!!!  The only thing I haven't been brave enough to try is the Karaoke :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! Quaint little place in the heart of downtown. Food was good, but on the whole, nothing especially stands out. We ordered the jalepeno bomb, which is worth it. The spicy tuna and salmon were good, but you can't really mess those ones up. The rainbow roll was, well, a rainbow roll. Good. The yellowtail lover I was really looking forward to bc of all the reviews on here, but it was a little underwhelming. The plain spicy salmon and tuna rolls were better. The fried icecream was delicious though, and pretty presentation. It's big enough to share. Service was good...and until a larger louder party came in, the place was perfect for a nice quiet evening out."}
{"text":"Hip little sushi spot downtown, would recommend if you're in downtown and want sushi, but it is not a go out of your way destination for raw fish in vegas. No Omakase. Good drinks.
 
Very inconspicuous from the outside, there is hotel sign right above. Inside is modern, with the sushi bar on first level and tables above. Upstairs there is an bar behind 4 full size tables,  and 4 tables for two. Fish freshness was good and dishs had good flavor. But cuts were not consistent as a in great sushi place, and  fish freshness not at that top level. Waitress and busboy seemed a bit overwhelmed.

Overall hip and cool, food good but not great, might come back while in downtown."}
{"text":"A pretty solid Happy Hour option. 

I met friends here for a mid day meal and was pleased to learn about their Happy Hour, i think its Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm offering 30% off entire menu. I kept it light with two rolls, and called it a day. Fish was fresh, rolls were made well and not super rice heavy. Service was average, with nothing memorable about the experience. 

The second time i came for their Happy Hour, i ordered similar with the two rolls and an order of nigiri and the rice was a tad on the dry/hard side. I don't want to be too picky but at the same time if you expect me to return then please keep it consistent. I returned because the food was on point the first time. 

The dining area was clean, and the bathrooms were pleasantly maintained as well. Id return when i am in the area but i will not go out of my way. I could spend a little bit more than my two rolls during happy hour and get better quality AYCE elsewhere."}
{"text":"Three of FM us dined here after the SEMA show at convention center. Service was crisp and prompt, food was terrific. Server recommended some of,their specials which were spot on! Best sushi I have had in quite a while! Recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of the sushi at Bocho. I have heard good things about it, but both times I ate there I wasn't impressed.  The service was also not that great both times; our servers were very nice, but they forgot items we ordered and weren't very attentive to the table. My friend did say that seems to be the trend every time he goes there though. I wouldn't go back unless it was with a party that wanted to go there. There was a small selection of specialty rolls and I didn't like the 3 I tried. The salmon and eel sashimi was very good though."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!!! Perfect service too. Was introduced to this restaurant by some friends. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh sashimi. I would highly recommend. It takes some effort to find though. Address is actually 150 S 6th."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas- on or off strip. The food is unbeatable and the vibe is low key and relaxed. Friendly and genuine servers ready to help you order. I won't even bother naming the best menu items bc every single thing is *insta worthy*  if I could give 6 stars I would"}
{"text":"If you are craving a great fresh sushi with coolest staff this would be your sushi place!! Bocho was in a very convenient location in downtown! This place isn't big though so sometimes you have to hit the timing right to be able to eat at the bar with the sushi chef! But man they never disappoint! 

So Andrew is probably one of the coolest sushi chef I have ever met! He recommend things and makes us special sushi for my husband that does not eat raw fishes! :/ see it's kinda hard when you have a picky husband that eats like a 5years old child Lol.. my husband is super picky and he doesn't even eat seaweed! And not a lot of sushi chef are not very patience when handling our orders! 

Anyway; Daniel and Crystal (that's apparently leaving) are also the most down to earth people we have met down here! Bocho Sushi have created an environment where they will make sure their customers are well taken care of! And they will get to know you and sit down with you! They treat you like a family instead of just another customer customer walking in! 

Now let's get to the food portion of the review; sushi are the bomb here! We order Vegas rolls I believe it's called lol. It's like an explosion in your mouth!!! And this roll does not have any rice in it! Man.. they were spicy and sweet at the same time! And all those seafood just melted in your mouth! Soo gooodd. I'm getting hungry just writing this! 

And the second roll we ordered was baked salmon! That salmon though! Andrew you are the man!! Glistening pink on the inside and cooked perfectly out and super flaky! Just pretty epic I would say! 

And we also ordered their fried chicken which what we always get there and baked mussels! 

Well after all!!!! It's always a pleasure with this guy! Never a complaint and if I can give them 100stars I really really would!! Thank you guys so much!! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Let me precedent, we are basic sushi goers.. you can't get more basic than we are, so take that into consideration in our review. If you are a sushi connoisseur move on to the next review! That being said we loved this place. Service and ambiance are a total win. They have a legit happy hour with 30% off the whole menu! The place played sweet jams the whole time & the sushi chef's seemed to really enjoy the job and super engaged in what they were doing. (Carlos was our guy) Overall super great little sushi spot in downtown.. will definitely be back for another happy hour."}
{"text":"Good food but inconsistent with quality. Some days I'll order something and it's a great portion, and another day, I'll order the same thing, and the it's presented poorly like someone who was training made the roll."}
{"text":"Amazing roll, both the roll construction and the flavor are perfect. Atmosphere is very chill and laid back. Elite execution without any of the pretence of Nobu. Price is also VERY resonable, a rare sighting in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food; So yummy! Was kind of bummed that the 30% Happy Hour only applies to the Sushi Bar area, not the restaurant. Had I known that, we would have sat at the bar. Staff was friendly & more attentive as the night went in. The prices aren't bad but not cheap. Maybe start offering AYCE more days of the week along with drink specials? Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"The food is fresh. The chefs are very friendly. I recommend the Las Vegas roll. So yummy and mouthwatering.  I try to go once a week. It is worth coming back for more and try new items"}
{"text":"Best Sushi place..
Great sushi and rolls!!
Sake bombs are Awesome!!
Lots of fun!!
The owner is a wild and crazy guy!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, very clean, good fish and good portions. The prices were very reasonable and the staff were very friendly and quick. I will definitely come here  again."}
{"text":"Best sushi and service in town. We had 5 hungry men and we all left over stuffed for just $20 per person. Go in with confidence, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Showed up during the last 30 minutes of happy hour, was seated right away. The staff was a friendly as it can get, and full of energy. The sushi was amazing."}
{"text":"Interesting sushi rolls. We had the Disco Inferno which was fabulous.  Good beer and sake selection.  Fresh fish with an attitude"}
{"text":"The BEST night ever!  Walked in, sat down, made a new friend at the sushi bar...Soju  Bomb - BAM!  Every single member of their awesome staff was fun, interesting and attentive!  Started with a delicious sake martini - perfect with just the right amount of sweetness.  The Yellowtail Yuzu ceviche was spicy and oh so fresh!  Chef was so fantastic - we had a special dish of cooked salmon which was so buttery and melted in my mouth!  I am looking forward to going back for Omakase!  Did I mention how great the staff is?"}
{"text":"This was a disappointing dinner.  
1. The service was slow.  The restaurant was only half full.  2. The food was maybe a 5/10 
The flavor was bland, the rolls had too much rice to my liking. 3. We ordered sushi: I waited over ten minutes for wasabi and ginger after the sushi was delivered.  I had to ask three times.  One waitress just said, no (she wasn't our waitress, but still)
4. The price was not worth the quality.  It's way over priced.  There's so many other places that are so much better especially in Vegas.  

Party of 6 for a birthday celebration.
On average from our party of six ranked it a 3.5 star.
I know I will not be returning for sushi here."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. I was very disappointed. Service was very very horribly slow. Chefs were taking shots and dressed in dirty ripped clothing. I ordered a basic roll and a specialty roll. Took about an hour to get. The flavors were very bland. Usually i don't ever use soy sauce but i had to drown the rolls in soy sauce just to get some kind of flavor. They get 2 stars because their seaweed salad portion was decently sized. But heavy on the sesame oil. Wont come back and wont recommend."}
{"text":"This is great hidden gem right near Fremont. It's a nice small place and everyone was super friendly. The Cajun tuna sashimi was absolutely delicious and the combo sushi was enough for two. This is an awesome place to get off the strip and you can walk around the art district."}
{"text":"Nice staff and good food. Had to wait long due to out order going to the wrong table."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes and never got to try the food. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a couple of entrees and drinks. People on the next table (that arrived 30 minutes later than us) got their appetizers and we didn't so i aked the server and with a bad attitude he said they were too busy and will take a few minutes more. Then 45 minutes later i asked the server again about out food, he was not nice and asked the other server in a bad tone : can you please help this ladie? So i explained the other guy and he went downstairs and he came back and said: \" oh, did they let you know that we don't have any more of the fish you ordered?
I mean, really?  After 45 mins? So we left the place super hungry and mad. And off course we refuse to pay for the cocktail"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot for happy hour from 3-6pm. It's 30% off your bill and the happy hour includes everything on the menu. Great deal. I think this deal was better than the AYCE because the AYCE didn't seem too wide of selections. Plus the AYCE is $28. If I'm going to spend that much on AYCE, I expect their menu choices to be more. My friend and I shared 3 rolls with a mushroom yaki order for our appetizer. We got the Ryan, Poke Monster, and Dirty Sanchez rolls. They were all delicious. It was packed with rice, plenty of fish, and flavor. I like how they put the tuna and seaweed salad on top of the poke monster. It made it unique and more flavorful. There is a kick in the dirty sanchez roll. I think there's a small jalapeño in it so watch it if you're not expecting spicy or a kick. The mushroom yaki appetizer was simple. It was sliced mushroom  drowned in butter. Yummm butter. We were so full and we didn't even finish our rolls. I had to take a little bit home. It definitely fills you up and all of this was only $35! Split it between 2 people was $17-18 a person which I think in my opinion is a better deal than the $28 for AYCE. I saw the people next to me do AYCE and they ordered less than us and didn't eat their moneys worth.
Overall I definitely recommend coming here for happy hour and getting their rolls."}
{"text":"This is the customer service. 
\"Excuse me. This tuna sashimi is cut really thick (like tongue!!)\"
Answer - \"Oh. Ok we cut it thinner next time you come in\" Ha Ha Ha. 
Next time!??
This place is for people who don't know sushi. Sadly it was the only place we could find downtown and the reviews were misleading. If you have never had sushi before and all you eat are rolls covered in mayo and sauce then this may be your place. 
If you seek out sashimi or nigiri then you best move on. We tried 8 different pieces and to cap off the lousiness of the preparation we were served the most rubbery Ebi I have had outside of a vending machine in Japan. WAIT. That Ebi was much better. 
I still can't get over the response to the sashimi question. No adjustment or replacement. Just a promise for a visit that will never happen. I hope enough people read this review to put them off this experiment. 
It was the equivalent of sushi Panda Express. Spend your money on slots and a hot dog instead."}
{"text":"I stayed downtown for three nights, and two of my dinners were l here. That tells you something. 

They have an all-you-can-eat offering on Tuesday nights after 6 p.m. It's $28.95 for 1 hour where you can order off a special AYCE menu that doesn't include everything on the standard one, but has some things that aren't on the regular menu. Sadly, the photo I took of the AYCE menu came out blurry, and I was going to rely on it to list everything that I tried and liked. I'll save that for the update since I am going again next week.

I sat at the bar where Brian and Carlos prepared all of my dishes. Brian was particularly nice in putting up with my lame non foodie conversation even though he was clearly very busy. If he's around, I recommend sitting in front of him.

The food was great. It's definitely up there in the top 2 sushi places I have ever been to, and the other place is no longer in business. Particularly memorable was the maguro nigiri, which really tasted fresh and very tuna-like, in a good way. The ebi nigiri also tasted different from every other place I have been too I guess because it was so fresh. The texture was the difference. Each of the rolls were massive. The only item that didn't do it for me was a roll that had deep fried batter, which seemed a little heavy for me. Everyone around me was having the Poke monster, so I tried it during happy hour two nights later. Incredible, and really satisfying. 

My two hosts were Marcy and Ryan, and they are to be commended for their cheerfulness and service.

I'm going make this a regular stop when I'm downtown. See you next week!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Sushi near old Vegas.  We actually found this place via Yelp while we were in the area. It is super teeny, but so great!!

We had a huge party and they accommodated us easily. Side note: you can rent karaoke rooms!!  Wish we'd have known!
Go for the fancy rolls, the basic spicy tuna and such is fresh and wonderful, but they really take the cake with the specialty rolls. Wow!
The crunch dragon roll and Yellowtail lover?  Are you kidding me?!  so good!!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! Checked in on Yelp to receive a free sake shot that was surprisingly really, really good - I usually prefer cold sake to hot. The sushi was great, the server was accommodating (we were under a time constraint) and I can't wait to return back. Try the Flyin Hawaiian!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi at a much better price than you'll find in the casinos. Don't be fooled by the slightly off the beaten path location, this is a go-to place for sushi in Vegas. Very friendly staff, some interesting and well crafted specialty rolls, beautiful presentation. They just extended their hours, so don't be afraid to head over at midnight on a Friday. Skip the overpriced sushi at the casinos and take a little excursion."}
{"text":"Sensational Sushi and service.  We went during Happy Hour and Sushi was an unbelievable 30% off.  The sushi is fresh and full of delicious flavor.  We also enjoyed a refreshing cucumber salad appetizer too.  Seriously the best Sushi I have ever eaten.  I think if the location was just a block over it would be standing room only and a long wait.  We chose to go here based on such positive reviews and it was the best choice we could have ever made for sushi.  YUMMY GREAT"}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Downtown Vegas. We ordered 2 specialty rolls, Rainbow and Dragon rolls. Both were great tasting and prepared well.

Being fans of Abita beers, we were surprised they offered Purple Haze! 

All in all, had a pleasant dining experience at Bocho Sushi."}
{"text":"If you're in with the Downtown crowd you've probably heard there's FINALLY a sushi spot open. I work close to Downtown, so any new restaurant is a blessing for me, for after-dinner bites, and for lunchtime.

Bocho Sushi inhabits a little corner on Carson Street next to O Face Donuts and Carson Kitchen. The inside, while cramped when you first walk in as you are greeted directly by the bar is stylish and modern with contrasting light wooded walls and floors and dark chairs. Head upstairs for a better vibe. Tables are low, accompanied with pillows, a small bar in the back, and the Mad Men theme song playing over the speakers (seriously, I think I heard it around 4 times while we dined).

My friend and I embarked upon their AYCE dinner menu for $30. While their menu is not as extensive as many sushi spots in Vegas, I didn't have an issue selecting many items to suit my preference. 

We had the following:
Spicy Tuna Hand Roll
Jalapeno Bombs
Mushroom Yaki
Calamari Skewers
Seaweed Salad
Super White Tuna
Shrimp
Octopus
Oysters on the half shell
Green tea mochi ice cream

Rolls
Salmon Skin Roll
Las Vegas Roll

I may be missing a roll in there somewhere.

Overall the sashimi and regular rolls were great and fresh, served quickly with not too much wait time between ordering and finishing other rolls on our table.

The Las Vegas Roll was way too filling. I wouldn't suggest it while eating AYCE as it will fill you up since it has both cream cheese AND it is deep fried. It was just a little overpowering for me, so I wouldn't get this one again.

I did enjoy the spicy tuna hand roll, the super white tuna, and the jalapeno bombs - very spicy, definitely try those. 

Service was great, our Green tea and waters were kept filled. I wouldn't say this is and AMAZING place to get sushi, but if you're in the area it totally fills the spot for sushi in a good way. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Bocho\" 5 times, and it would have been 6 times last night, BUT never again. The sushi guy behind the counter (see photo) was on another planet at best. While he is typically rude, he reminds me of the sushi Nazi in L.A. but he is worse. I was the only customer and in 15 minute sitting 4 feet away from him and his work area, he completely ignored the concept that I was there to eat sushi. No acknowledgment, not even a glance as he continued to wipe his unused knives over and over and over, wiping down and organize all of his condiment bottles, wrapped a cucumber that was wedged under his cutting board and toss it into the refrigerator while nudging other items inside the fridge with his foot before closing the door. Final straw... with still no sushi service, three new customers were sat next to me and he focused on them serving the ASAP. That's it!!! I paid my tea/miso/soy bean order the waiter brought me. Before leaving I put a penny on the counter and related to the rude sushi dude that this penny was for his service (he deserved less). He then picks up his sushi knife and abruptly mimes aggression thrusting the blade towards me. WOW this guy is bad news."}
{"text":"We eat a lot of sushi being from Hawaii. This place is TOP NOTCH!!!! Some of the best sushi we've ever had! Love the rolls and hamachi Kama. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This sushi was amazing and we were able to get a free hot sake shot off of this app! Tried the seaweed salad and it was fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food ordered flyin ryan, flying hawaiian, rainbow roll, seaweed salad, 2 shots of sake, and green tea mochi for dessert happy hour took off 30% and if u check in on yelp you get free shot of sake all this for $34 flyin hawaiian hands down best roll!!! The staff was friendly and even let me sample my first taste of uni...yum!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and I will be coming back. Love the atmosphere.  Friendly, party scene with great food. The jalapeño bombs were totally amazing! I've tasted 4 different rolls and found them incredibly satisfying.  This is an embodiment of the hole in the wall experience I was looking for!"}
{"text":"Started with sake sashimi to test the waters, it had amazing marble and came with four nice fat cuts for $7. Then a dirty Sánchez (Avo,salmon,spicy tuna, crab, jalapeño etc) clean and super fresh, the rice wasn't sticky or too tough (so: perfection) some baked mussels and two more orders of sashimi along with a couple Kirins and we were ready to continue the evening in Downtown Las Vegas! 

Marcy the hostess / Server and Carlos the sushi chef were welcoming and courteous, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Incredible rolls, some of the best I have eaten anywhere (beleive me I have travelled across all continents in 24 different countries) !"}
{"text":"This place is so cool!!! Their happy hour sushi and drink specials are INSANE!! We were warmly welcomed and had a fantastic time. The chefs are friendly and cool and the food was AWESOME!! CANNOT wait to go back.
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a sushi snob and have never liked any sushi place I've been to in the world more than Oishii in Riverside, CA. With that said, Bocho Sushi gets 5 stars because the food was great and the service was even better. I now have another favorite sushi place in the world."}
{"text":"SoOooOoOOoOOOo good!!! Nice location. Friendly staff. Nice selection. Quality ingredients. Simple Menu. 
V E G A N options. Ordered the mussels = perfection. Veggie roll on cucumber roll = amazing! the hawaiiiian rolls were Divine. Best sushi spot I've found out here in Vegas...."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a trade show 8 days. We ate here 3 times! Excellent sushi rolls with creative names, sauces and combos, and everything is very fresh. The Pokemonster was one of my very favorites, with seaweed salad and poke topping the roll. It is also huge, overflowing with fish!  Other delicious choices are Ragin' Cajun, that has a yummy seared flavor to it, Something Wrong, where the chef decides what to put in based on your likes, and Daniel. Service was a little slower on a Saturday night, as they're obviously much busier, but it was still very good. Sitting at the sushi bar is fun, and the sushi chefs are nice and have lots of personality. This place is in downtown Vegas, which is nice being off the strip. It's definitely our favorite sushi place and I'm sure you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Great food, sushi, drinks, service. Relaxed vibe and a chill experience. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Since I'm vegan now no more fish for me, but they do have veggie options here.

The seaweed salad is a really good portion size...not tiny like most places. They also have several veggie rolls that are all yummy. 

There are a few other veggie apps I haven't tried yet, but my office is close so I'm sure I'll try them in the future."}
{"text":"Just moved to DTV from Cali... And I found my local sushi joint! Great sushi, great servers, great atmosphere, reasonable prices. Banzai!"}
{"text":"Looks not so great from the outside but great food. Reasonable prices 3 people for under $65. Small restaurant excellent service. Try Pink lady, Mr. Carson . nice portions. Will be back next time in town. Found it on yelp and was well worth it."}
{"text":"5 Stars *****
This place is located in an old motel on Carson St. It was a bit difficult to find at first because I was not aware that it was located in part of the motel. I should have read more reviews.

The restaurant has a sushi bar located on the lower level and a dining room with a bar on the second level. The staff was very friendly and the place appeared to be very clean.

The sushi was outstanding. Very fresh. The poke was excellent, as well as the Yellowtail with jalapeños. Everything was wonderful. Well deserving of five stars.

I would definitely recommend dining here. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm going to try this place again....they just opened so I think they are working a lot of the kinks out. We sat at the sushi bar, and waited 30 minutes for 3 slices of salmon sashimi, and got 2 pieces of salmon sushi instead :/ which I ate, and then ordered salmon sashimi asian, which came another 15 minutes later haha....the china roll was good. It kept taking 15-20 minutes to get more beer, which we had to keep ordering from different people....which resulted in us getting charged for a couple more beers then we ordered and consumed :( that I gladly paid because I was just in a hurry at that point, and the server didn't understand what we were trying to communicate. Anyways I'll go back in a couple weeks and try again! The food was good and it had great ambience. Just need to get organized and work on guest service a little bit"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in downtown Las Vegas.  My wife and I wanted sushi before visiting the neon museum and this fit the bill.  The food and staff are second to none.  I would easily pay double for this quality and service likely on the strip.  Highly encourage anyone to try it.  Easy parking available in a lot across the street.  The roll prices are very affordable and they have specials.  My wife really enjoyed their tuna with crispy rice.  We also tried the melting albacore and ate many rolls that were out of this world.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and we hope to visit it again.  They might be in the middle of the desert but the fish is as fresh as anywhere.  Give it a shot and don't forget the garlic edamame! Yum"}
{"text":"We had a table of ten and the sushi was delicious and the service was top notch with no hiccups."}
{"text":"(Rapid Review) 
A great local DTLV sushi spot. 
Very clean.
Fresh and above average grade cuts of fish.

Staff is very friendly, and genuinely nice.
Service was prompt and server was quite knowledgeable about the menu items.

Definitely worth a visit, if you're in the mood for sushi while in the area."}
{"text":"First night in Vegas & I love sushi. This place was close to our hotel & had really good ratings! Cute place. I loved the environment. Food came out fast. Our waitress & sushi chefs were so nice and helpful!!! Def would recommend this place! Recommend Bocho balls, baked muscles, China roll, lobster wontons (special), fried ice cream. We enjoyed everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"We had a great NYE dinner here. We sat in the upstairs area which features a dining area, bar and karaoke rooms. Being from SoCal, I'm very picky about my sushi and this spot was great. The sushi was fresh and the service fantastic. One tiny ding was that the roll we received was cold...popsicle cold. I more like my sushi at room temp. Other than that, spot on and will be back."}
{"text":"Tasty food and also good prices!! On Fridays they have 30% off the overall ticket. The staff were great and friendly! The restaurant is a store front but once you get in you would think you are at an upscale restaurant off the Strip! I also loved the decor and the ambience!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 and lucked out because as we walked in, there were 7 empty chairs at the bar, side by side. I was a bit sad to hear that they only did AYCE sushi on Tuesday, but they are only beginning to experiment with it. Prices are not the cheapest, but the sushi was well worth it! I ordered the Ryan Special. Soooo good! Our sushi chef prepared 3 different \"Something Wrong\" rolls for us (the menu says chef's choice), and each of them was delicious! He was even kind enough to ask and make sure we had no allergies of any sort before preparing the rolls.

After serving us our food, he began to filet a whole salmon on the counter. As he was about to throw away the salmon head, he joked and asked if any of us wanted it. To his surprise, a friend of mine wanted it and the chef was gracious to wrap it up with ice for my friend! Now we can say that my friend got free head from Bocho Sushi!"}
{"text":"Good food. Decent price during happy hour. Better choices if you weren't lucky enough for happy hour. Yonaka Modern Japanese was great - same price"}
{"text":"The chef at the bar was very friendly.  The food was fresh and creative.  If you go from 3 to 6 it's happy hour and you get a discount which is rare for sushi bars.  We ate there 3 times in 4 days while staying at the Golden nugget. If your staying downtown this place is a treat!"}
{"text":"Here for punk rock bowling. wow amazing rolls and great service. Checked in and got sake shot and beer with in minutes . The two rolls were flavorful and fresh and reasonably priced for very high quality."}
{"text":"This is SERIOUSLY the BEST sushi I have EVER had!! The screaming orgasm is a must. And the salmon is super high quality. My favorite is Philadelphia roll."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loves this place! Excellent food, nice employee, neat place.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This new gem is amazing!!!! Beautiful swanky spot and the sushi is authentic and full of flavor. We ordered the Vegas Roll (Amazing & nothing like I've ever tasted) the Bocho Special, the yellowtail ceviche, and Chicken Karage as an appetizer. Everything was phenomenal!!!!! I would come here every day this week if I could! 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal place! Great, food, staff, atmosphere! Personally lived in Japan for four years and this place is very authentic, staff was very friendly and helpful. Kudos ladies and gentlemen! We had sushi, lunch and a beer for $40! Great prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Adorable hole in the wall! Great spot right off Fremont street, worth the 8min walk! Don't go to Red Sushi in Golden Nugget, it's over priced and less options."}
{"text":"While downtown one evening, my friends and I passed this place and one of my friends said it was a good place to eat. We had already eaten, so we didn't go in. After some time, my friend wanted to go order food to go, so she went and we met up with her. 

This place is not that big, but not small. Has 2 floor with karaoke rooms on the second floor. Pretty cool setup. 

When we met up with her, she asked if she could have it there and they had no problem and took us to a seat. Even though she placed her order already, the lady asked if we needed anything. We waited, but not long and the food came out. I wasn't hungry, but food and I have this sort of relationship where if it's placed in front of me, and offered, I will eat it. So I caved. But let me tell you it was well worth it! I don't even remember what my friend ordered, but it was so good. I just kept eating the rolls haha! I believe there were 3 different rolls and they each were so tasty and so fresh. Also, when you check in you get a free shot of sake. I personally don't like sake because it taste like I'm drinking nail polish remover. So I can't tell you if it's hot or cold. But if that's your thing, have at it. 

I definitely would like to come back here and try other rolls they have on the menu. Maybe even hop up and sing some karaoke. Mmm no maybe not the singing part."}
{"text":"Our best meal during our stay in Vegas!  We found this downtown treasure through yelp and it did not disappoint.  We sat at the sushi bar and had a wonderful experience because of Chef Daniel.  He creates beautiful art with fresh, thick cut fish.  This meal was our best meal in Vegas but is also one of our best sushi experiences.  

We ordered uni, salmon roe, halibut from South Korea, blue fin tuna from Spain, yellow tail, mackerel, and the Something Wrong roll which is the chef's choice roll.  This roll was almost too pretty to eat! 

This will be our first stop on our next trip to Vegas.  Don't go if your pressed for time. Sit at the sushi bar, relax, order a drink, and put full trust in Chef Daniel."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for dinner. Just a few blocks from downtown and prices seemed reasonable. We went on a Sunday night, only the sushi bar was open. Food, service and atmosphere were all average. We had some nigiri, a special roll and a couple of regular rolls. Everything was good, but nothing blew me away. Over all it's a nice neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"This place is legit! As good as it gets! I first visited Bocho when I was half-drunk and on my way to the Life is Beautiful festival. The food was so dynamite that I brought my boyfriend back this past Thursday for lunch.

We had a salmon roll, Vegas roll (with tuna substituted for eel), some tuna sushi, an albacore special roll (from their specials board), California roll and a fried chicken appetizer.

The servers were wonderful, and didn't mind me ordering extra sauce with everything or being \"that girl\" who makes substitutions in rolls (stop judging me - lol).

That said, every roll was great-- the tuna wasn't mealy or super muscular and chewy-- it was perfect. Also, the fried chicken sounds like a weird thing to order at a sushi restaurant, but it's a MUST-try! Soooo good!! 

Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This has become a must do every time we're in town. Best sushi in #Vegas Thank you Melissa for the fantastic recommendations"}
{"text":"food and service was excellent, tuna sashimi was great, portions  were over expectations, reasonable priced."}
{"text":"The best getting lost experience! The Kyu-ritos are epic and the good amazeballs. I want to eat here everyday. The chefs were friendly and answered all questions."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Vegas!  This two story Sushi Bar with private karaoke and a cute rooftop great for cocktails.  Our server David was awesome with his suggestions regarding the menu!  Sushi was fresh and delicious!   Saki Bombs were flowing downstairs.  Wonderful experience with the boys!  I would recommend visiting Bocho Sushi"}
{"text":"We were wanting to try a new sushi place and this place hit the spot!
Incredibly delicious!!
Great service, great food, great experience overall!
Had the garlic edamame which were surprisingly spicy (didn't expect that) also had the jalapeño bombs that, from reading previous reviews is a must, and it REALLY is a MUST!!!
We asked for a second order from how delicious the first order was!
Also tried the Las Vegas roll and WTF which were equally delicious.
Had the samurai drink that was strong yet sweet, went smell with the calamari skewers!
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First off I have never in my life had Sushi, that being said i found i enjoyed most of what I had a pleasant surprise if you will. We attended a company party so we had the intire upstairs to ourselves and a serving table which the kept in rotation. I have to say I do not know exactly what all I was eating and it maybe a good thing for my own mind but, I really dint find anything I did not really care for.. I did avoid the raw fish items by themselves but tried all the types of rolls and fried items they served.. wonderful flavors..  I do have to say this place is small. Seating as you come in is mostly counter and limited on space. I expected a smell to be in the air but found there was nothing to really smell.. the items where they where preparing the food all looked very fresh. Staff is very friendly and attentive. The up stairs i a small table/ bench type area with limited seating and 2 small karaoke rooms and a stand up bar. Pace is very clean and comforting. I can see myself going back.."}
{"text":"I found this place because of Yelp, and it was near my new place. Parking was easy to find, and it's located in what looks to be an old motel that's been recently renovated. It's super cute! The food was delicious with a beautiful presentation and they had a nice happy hour. Our waiter was very sweet, and made great recommendations. I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Joon took GREAT care of us! If you're in the Fremont Street Experience area wanting AYCE sushi with the best staff and service - this is a MUST! Thanks Bocho!"}
{"text":"Really great rolls. Best I think I have ever had. My friend had the curry and he said it was the best he had ever had as well. The staff was friendly well informed and great at what they do. Had a calm relaxing time with a small group and it was the best food I have had in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch right after checking in to my hotel. I was excited because the excellent reviews. I arrived at noon and nobody greeted or approached me until 12:20. I ordered a beer and noticed they were busy so I patiently waited. There were several other patrons that arrived way after I did, and they got served. I waited until 12:35 and left. Unfortunate because they had great specials that I wanted to try."}
{"text":"We came on a busy night and waited at least 15 minutes before getting any acknowledgment. There were several employees that passed by but there was no, \"we'll be right with you\" or anything. I guess there was a convention in town so they were busier than usual. 

I ended up ordering the miso soup, garlic edamame, yellowtail lover roll, and the number 5 roll. It was pretty standard. Nothing bad but nothing to write home about either. We also ordered 2 mango sake's. It was served in one of those cooling glass jugs but they forgot to fill the center with ice. 

Service was so slow and I was just hoping the food would make up for it. It didn't. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing.

Got pork belly skewers, fried soft scab, and a special toll called something right with house hot sake.

It was something right."}
{"text":"I went here many months ago for lunch, right after they first opened.  Food is good but the service was terrible. I decided not to Yelp then, because I know it can take time for new restaurants to \"work out the kinks\". Went back today (at least 6 months later) for lunch, and it was the same thing- food was good, service was just unacceptable. I will not be back, which is a shame since I work so close and love sushi."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've eaten in the city, but for the downtown area, it's a very nice addition. Came here on a Friday night and was surprised that hardly anyone else was there. Strange considering it is Friday, downtown. Wanted to order Spanish mackerel sashimi at first, but was told that they were out. They were also out of something else (forgot what ingredient specifically in a specialty roll now), so we changed our order for the rolls. Ended up with ootoro and amberjack sashimi, no. 5 (at the recommendation of the waitress who said it was the most popular), pink lady and dragon crunch. Though no 5 was the recommended roll, the most interesting and delicious one ended up to be the pink lady. Service was attentive, it not a bit excessive, with the waitress coming up more than several times just to see if everything was okay, cutting off the middle of a sentence in our conversation."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  They are creative, knowledgeable, and fun!  

We asked the Chef(s) to make us what ever they wanted.  They inquired what our likes were and executed perfectly! 

If you want a great Sushi joint to have at, this is it!

- Irish mug."}
{"text":"Great place.  Not the best sushi you have ever had in your life, but definitely better than 90% of sushi places in the city.  The staff is always really friendly, so much so that even when they make a mistake, they handle it so nicely that it doesn't matter.  The restaurant is also always noticeably clean.

When it comes to a casual night of sushi, this is our go to.  Considering it is the one sushi spot in the area I find it quite lucky that it is a good one."}
{"text":"Legit 5 star sushi place downtown.  This place was great, attentive helpful wait staff.  Awesome sushi chef.  Two of us sat at the sushi bar.  Fish was super fresh and made with care.  Loved the Dragon Roll.  The tuna was truly some of the best I've ever had.  

Great place will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"This place is totally the spot. My friend and I probably come here once a week. I gave 3 stars because everything is a bit overpriced. And the hit and miss service. Basic rolls are 4-5$ more than average... like NOBU prices! A half dozen of oysters is like 15$ (ive literally bit into pieces of shells) and they're so tiny! Even the hot sake and asahi is expensive! The location is downtown which is awesome because there aren't that many sushi places over there! 

Their baked mussels (I've eaten many shells inside the baked mussel) , rolls, rock shrimp and sake are to die for! Service is usually a hit or miss. I've literally had to go to the bar and demand service. The last 3 times I was there it was only 3 tables upstairs and they always forget everything I order! I absolutely love the second floor karaoke/bar area. The interior and layout of the place is for sure a win."}
{"text":"I was sad to give such a low rating for my experience. The starters were quite promising; excellent garlic edamame and steamed shumai. However, the service is simply terrible. My wife's plate was brought to her some 20 min before I ever received my food. She had finished well before I even received my own order. It did not escape me that another party who arrived and placed their orders at least 15 min after we did, ordered the same thing as myself. The chef preparing food at the bar in front of me, simply waited and did the dishes at the same time. I sat through the whole lunch watching my wife finish her meal before mine came out, at the exact moment the other party's meals were delivered. 
No apology at all, nothing said before we paid our bill and left. 
Moreover, my sushi and sashimi combo was entirely average at best. A fair price but disappointing nonetheless. Only days ago I had been enjoying delicious sashimi from some of my favorite places in California. Avoid this place. There are other options with better service."}
{"text":"Do you like to hang out and watch everyone's food getting made?  Then this is a place you would like to spend 2-3 hours.  So bring your $60 and have a nice night.
If you don't want your food to take 30-45 minutes to get made and spending $40-60 person to eat then you should choose one of the other 50 places in walking distance.
Also if you don't like loud music or spill over from the upstairs karaoke rooms then not the best place to spend your evening.
This place stays busy, just make sure this is you crowd before visiting."}
{"text":"I'm always downtown and for quite some time, a good majority of regular patrons have been wanting a sushi spot to finally venture. Sad to say, Bocho did not leave a good impression.

I had been looking forward to trying this ever since rumors began to surface of a sushi restaurant opening downtown. I've heard of mixed reviews from friends since it's opening so rather than take others words for it, finally decided to check it out. 

The sushi bar downstairs if basic and reminds me of something you may find in Los Angeles or New York where space is at premium. It is very well lit as you walk in and are greated by the chefs. There is also an upstairs dining area that is a bit more spacious and can accommodate larger groups and there is also a private room available, the cocktail bar is also located upstairs. 

As we sat down, our server greeted us quickly and asked if we'd like drinks. Water and a beer were ordered and brought to the table promptly followed by complimentary edamame. Quite a few things were ordered off the menu and I can say that the fish was very fresh, the flavors of the sauces and condiments used for rolls were very tasty, no complaints there. The one major thing I had an issue with and anyone who loves sushi should have an issue with is hard, dense, undercooked rice. I mean, you're a sushi restaurant and you use rice all day long. How could your one major ingredient be under par, especially since it is the base for all of your dishes. Again, the fish was fresh and delicious but you can't have a good sushi restaurant if you can't produce good rice! 

Our bill was split in 3 which our server did not mind doing so but she was not very attentive when it came to keeping my water glass full and checking to make sure things were going okay. 3 people ordered separate orders and some of them were mixed together (sushi). When we asked our server to clarify what was what, she got very flustered and said she did not know how to differentiate the rolls. Also, the table next to us had a big group and they asked our server to take a picture of them which of course would've not bothered me if she had not practically climbed on our table to take a picture of them, not even excusing herself as we were still finishing up our meal, very unprofessional. 

So overall, will I go back??? Maybe, possibly. If they can cook their rice properly."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  Excellent.  Great value.  Good service.  Fresh fish.

Anything else?  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Great sushi and amazing environment. Great date spot as well. The sushi is really good especially the Poke Monster"}
{"text":"Restaurant lied to us when we called saying the order was taken by the driver 20 minutes ago after the order was already way late, and it should be here any minute now...30min later we got a notification saying the driver has now left with our food, and the order took a total of two hours and nine minutes instead of the one hour both othe restaurant and GrubHub confirmed. Sushi was OK, but there are definitely better sushi places with better values throughout Vegas.  Definitely not ordering from here or GrubHub again. Had to fight myself not to give a 1 Star just because the sushi wasn't horrible. Just ok."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We were visiting from CT and staying in the new part of Vegas. Our waitress at our hotel recommended this place which is frequented by locals. She was not wrong.
Bocho waitress Cindy, was friendly and knew the menu so well that we didn't even look at it. She described her favorite food items, and we said 'yes!' I wish I knew what we had. But all the sushi was so fresh and tasty. Also had some of their fried chicken, which was very good but so heavy compared to the sushi. 
The ambiance is very laid back. Reasonably priced. And very delicious."}
{"text":"Went for a co-workers lunch and even though we were the only people in the restaurant the food too lover 30 minutes to come out. Then when it did come out the shrimp skewers were raw and the fried chicken was soggy. Not to mention they removed the sushi and soup for. The bento box. 

Fish quality is average. And customer service is atrocious. Many better places to go to get real sushi without the crappy service and overpriced items."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I went to. They serve within 15-20 minutes. The place has a nice atmosphere. The staffs are really friendly! I wish there is a branch here in California! Huhu order their Jalapeño Bomb, Baked Salmon Roll and Something Wrong Roll!!!!! I'm craving for more!"}
{"text":"Great service! The owner is very nice and very involved. The sashimi is fresh and better than the rolls, although those are good too. Ask for the house hotsauce and the pickles. If you let the sushi chefs decide what you eat, you wont be dissapointed. They have soju as well as your usual japanese beverages."}
{"text":"We really wanted sushi and we found them on yelp! Great sushi! Especially since the strip doesn't have that much of a selection! They have happy hour for and we received a free shot of cold sake for checking in! Our waitress was great :) I beleive her name was Angela :D"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is truly a diamond in downtown Las Vegas. The specialty rolls are 8 pieces, $12 - $16 each, but they are pretty dense and 100% delicious. Normally Bubs and I do AYCE (not available here btw) because we can throw down when it comes to sushi. Here we shared 4 rolls and were stuffed. 

I HIGHLY recommend the \"Something Wong\" roll. Basically, it's whatever the chef feels like concocting customized with things you like. Ours turned out being a seared (with a blowtorch! So cool to watch) yellow tail & salmon roll with spicey mayo, a smokey glaze, a little cream cheese and avocado. Panty dropper. Oh sweet baby Jesus it was good. We saved the plate to dip the rest of our rolls in the remaining sauce. 

We sat at the bar and got great service. Ended up staying longer than anticipated because we were chatting with our server. Also ended up being part of a group Sake bomb. Next time I'm in town and craving sushi I will be coming back to Bochos."}
{"text":"Really really good sushi, we had the jalapeño bombs, salmon belly, scallops, las vegas roll and crunch dragon. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Would love to review the food but unfortunately after an hour and a half I am still waiting for it to be delivered...#hangry"}
{"text":"I like Bocho's space, very LA/NY loft style with a lot of potential. Two levels, with bar seating downstairs and bar/tables upstairs. I felt like a little more consideration could have gone into the plates. I don't care for the cheap, plastic plates you can buy at your local asian grocery (in fact, I think 168 probably has better choices). The tables are also a little too small for the long plates the sushi comes on. 

Service is ok. The server was nice to start, but she took a very long time to bring our water and an even longer time to bring drinks. She did not check in on us after the food was brought either.

For appetizers, we chose Seaweed Salad and the Jalapeño Bomb (jalapeño stuffed with spicy tuna and cream cheese). The salad came with a mix of romaine lettuce, which seemed a little weird and filler-ish. The stuffed jalapeño was good for it's uniqueness, but by no means life changing.

Bocho Special Roll (tuna/crab/cucumber with shrimp tempure/crab/assorted fish on top), it was basically a glorified California roll. It was way too big to eat in one bite and it didn't leave any lasting impressions.

Sashimi was fresh, with large pieces. We ordered Garlic Tuna, Yellowtail, and Super White Tuna. We ended up receiving regular tuna, instead of garlic, which isn't the end of the world, but a little disappointing.

I don't really see how this place can be given 5 stars. It makes me wonder what the other reviewers think is good sushi... It's really not \"as good as it gets,\" when there are so many better restaurants out there. I'm happy to see downtown expanding their culinary tastes, but Bocho has a long way to go before they are the best."}
{"text":"Had cravings for sushi and wanted to give this place a shot. Called ahead of time to verify hours on Saturday and the messaging system said hours of operation were Monday through Saturday, 11 am to 3 pm for lunch. Got to the venue at 1:30 pm and it is CLOSED. Parking already paid. 

I understand if you change the hours of operation to accommodate demand but please let your customers know and change the message on the machine. It leaves a bad taste in your (potential) customer's, especially when they are left hungry for sushi. Not good when starting a new business."}
{"text":"A nice sushi restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas. We got seated at the bar but they have tables upstairs. I'm not a fan of cramped spaces and the seats at the bar had no space in between. Getting up and going to the bathroom to wash my hands was very frustrating for me and I'm not even fluffy.

However, the food was amazing and the service was great. The fish was fresh and the portions were just right. Lunch specials are available from 11am-3pm and AYCE from 4-11pm.

Shunga Box:
This is part of their lunch special. For $15, you can get salmon, saba or black cod. Comes with California roll or spicy tuna roll, miso soup, sunomono salad, rice, tempura and a drink. The black cod was great. 4/5

Sashimi Salad Bowl:
Diced fish including salmon, tuna, whitefish, and hamachi. Includes miso soup and a drink. Generous amount of protein and the most filling salad I've had. 5/5

Nigiri:
We tried uni, salmon and tuna. They were all superb. 5/5

Lesson learned: if you value personal space, get a table upstairs"}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favorite sushi bars in downtown Las Vegas. Yes it is a little bit expensive but the quality is great!"}
{"text":"I spent 2 days looking for a good sushi place in both the strip & here & finally won. Service is great & the sushi is fantastic. This is the best part of my 3 day exploration. Thank you Bocho staff!"}
{"text":"this place is amazing, great sushi! Everything tasted fresh! definitely going back again!!!!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to find an awesome AYCE  sushi place closer to the house.  I looked on Yelp and found the place closed at 10:30 and I knew I was going to be cutting it close.  So I called and spoke with a Carlos and asked what time the last seating was, just to make sure I wasn't imposing.  Most places will set their final seating an hour before they really mean to close.  Kaya Sushi for example close at 3am on most days so they set their final seating at 2:15am.  Well Carlos, told me their final seating was 10:15 pm, so I was off.  I get to the downtown area and find a parking spot about a block away, which is as expected.  I paid for my parking spot and headed to Bocho Sushi.  I walked in and there were still about a dozen people in the place in various phases of their meal. I checked the time and thought awesome I made it (10:14pm). I ask the host if I can eat at the bar and she begins to seat me.  I start getting settled in and she asked if I was there for all you can eat or ala carte.  I stated all you can eat...  And she began telling me about it when one of the chefs said, No!  No, all you can eat after 10:15.  The hostess seemed somewhat surprised at this and briefly questioned it before apologizing and offering the ala carte menu.  But since I am on a mission to find a closer AYCE I declined.  I might try this place again but for two employees to seem to think it was ok for AYCE only to be over ruled by the chef after the customer looked for parking and paid for parking not to mention took the time and energy to give the establishment a try for the first time is somewhat unacceptable in my opinion, not to mention the communication breakdowns.  

Now let me just clarify for those who will say yeah but with big parties I would want to serve super late either....  Well, I was by myself so it wasn't like I was entertaining a large party.  I was on a mission, so to speak!  Lol. 

Well, back to the drawing board on the mission.  As they say in Football...  Next man (AYCE Place in this case) up."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the choices that we made, the 4 bottles of sake that we drank or just the quality of the food in general but it was sooooo good. Our waitress got slammed but she hustled hard and didn't miss a beat.
 We ate the following deliciousness:
-baked mussels (delicious)
-yellowtail Yuzu Sashimi (amazing!)
-King Crab sushi ( Excellent)
-Shumai steamed (filling and delicious)
- Pink Lady Roll (really unique and different)
-Tempura Fried Ice Cream (seriously, just do it!) 

If you haven't been- Go! 
Support this awesome downtown spot."}
{"text":"I was here for an event and had several samples of the sushi.  All were delicious.  Will definitely return when in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Great meal, cool environment, amazing drinks & good service! Mango mochi was a fabulous end to the great meal!"}
{"text":"Some of the most unique, great tasting sushi I've had.  Service was spectacular and everything was perfect for me. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I just ate lunch at this gem.  The service was impeccable and the food was perfect. I was introduced to Halibut Fin.  The place also offered some of my favorites Aji, fresh wasabi and Japanese snapper. If you dine downtown, make this one of your dining choices.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Sushi in downtown Las Vegas, never disappoints. Every time I have visited Bocho it has been consistently fresh and the service is equally satisfying."}
{"text":"Place was excellent food and service were great. Expected AYCE but they have changed the menu no longer available. Even so he food was superior came during their special happy hour and got 30% off. Well worth the $70 for two people."}
{"text":"This place was a really nice surprise. I went with some locals who had never heard of it (I found it on Yelp), and they said that this would be their new go-to place for sushi. First, the place was packed -- so I would recommend reservations. I started with some tasty baked mussels and the \"dynamite\" -- a baked dish of scallops, crab, mushrooms, and onions. You couldn't really eat it with the chopsticks, and I would take a pass next time. I asked for tako sunomono, and the waiter seemed confused. I explained that I just wanted octopus on my cucumber salad. Pretty common in most sushi places. When it came it was three large slices of octopus on the cucumber salad. I was trying to figure out why there wasn't the usual dressing on the salad. After digging down I found out, there was lettuce under the large mound of cucumber, and the dressing was at the bottom of the pile. The seaweed salad also had lettuce under it. Odd. Everything else was terrific. I had my usual array of nigiri -- hamachi, salmon, yellow tail, salmon eggs, and toro. I didn't expect to find salmon (sake) this fresh in Vegas, but I think it's probably the best salmon sushi I've had. And this is from someone who lives just outside of Seattle. If you're in Vegas, ditch the strip. Head to Bocho."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant in town. They will accommodate spice level for anyone...definitely try the poke roll!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab food before hitting up the bars in Fremont East. I come here all the time with friends and co workers. Ask to sit at the bar upstairs. Must haves include: House Sake, garlic edamame and the downtown roll. Paid parking in the lot next to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, my mom was visiting from out of town and I took her here. She loved it also. I can't wait to come back. My only problem is the hostess wouldn't let us sit upstairs and it was hard for my mom to climb up in the chair at the bar because she is disabled. Other than that everyone else is really nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  don't eat here, you don't deserve it. Reasonable price, great drinks and their specialty rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, good selection, high quality, fresh and tastefully cut. Sushi portions are smaller here, so order accordingly.

The Jalapeno Bomb was delicious. The scallop, halibut, salmon, yellowtail, amberjack, Spanish mackerel, and Japanese snapper were all excellent.

The mushroom yaki was small, don't even think of sharing this one. The shumai was average.
Stick to the sushi, its what is good here."}
{"text":"Walking distance from Fremont and the Container park; Bocho was a great find. Our server Melissa was also very pleasant and helpful with our menu selection. You have to try the \"Something Wrong Roll\" it's the Chef Choice. My husband and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Very quality sushi place in the middle of the las vegas wasteland. Good for happy hour 3-6pm, 30% off. sushi prices from around $5 for california roll to around $13 for \"rainbow\" and similar rolls."}
{"text":"I have been looking all over Vegas for a good sushi spot since leaving the Bay Area. 
This place just toppled the list, rolls are excellent and good. Everything is fresh. Oasis in the dessert. Try the \"Greg roll\" see pic. \"NOT ON MENU\" $22"}
{"text":"Very very impressed with lil gem downtown The  yellowtail sashimi was very fresh , the no name roll,  tuna poke( if you dont like spice let them know)  veggie roll , rainbow roll were all fabulous. The portions were on point . Service was great . Ambience very warm and inviting. We will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious and a GREAT deal for happy hour, 3-7p. Sit at the sushi bar downstairs and the friendly chefs will tell you anything you need to know about sushi or vegas. Upstairs its full bar, karaoke private rooms and more tables. This was a super discovery a little off the beaten path. Walk from Fremont street."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! Yes! I mean it! I told several people this and they were like, \"In Vegas?!\" Yes! In Vegas! 

With a spontaneous date night in Vegas underway, we scurried out of the cold and into Bocho and so happy we did! It's located in the coolest part of Vegas, in my opinion, in Fremont East. Awesome graffiti! Perfect venue! 

We were greeted by several friendly faces and a beautiful sushi bar! The waiter's, hostess and sushi chefs cheer was so magnetic. It made us instantly more happy! There's such a great trendy feel about the place. There's fantastic and colorful art on the walls. And two levels! Lower level is where the sushi bar is located and upstairs is where the dining room and bar is hiding.

My husband and myself tried four different kinds of sushi. One better than the next! I loved both of mine! The traditional Spicy Tuna and (a random grab located in the appetizers) the Jalapeno Bomb! The Bomb is a seeded jalapeno stuffed with tuna, deep fried and topped with two different sauces. Savory, slightly spicy and I am still having dreams about it!!!! 

Their sushi selection is fantastic. The fish is so delicious and fresh! 

Man! Take me back please!!"}
{"text":"I work downtown, and finding a place that is good is difficult down here. With that said, I was super excited about a sushi place close to work!

And then I went. 

The place is clean, and the staff are friendly for the most part. It is small, so it fills up quickly! The menu items are ok, but some things on the menu are seriously overpriced for the portions and quality (unless you get a bento box - those are a good price and you get a good amount of food). The shrimp tempura roll, Crunch Dragon, and the Rock & Roll are all good. That isn't my issue.

The issue is that when they ask \"miso soup or salad,\" and you order miso soup instead of salad, you are charged extra. Several in our party had the same issue, and attempted to rectify the issue prior to paying. So the waitress left with our checks to correct them - and never came back! And when I mean never, I mean close to 45 minutes! Being on lunch from work this a) made us all late getting back to the office, b) ensured that we will not be going to Bocho again, and c) did not bode well in the customer service department. I believe that everyone has bad days, but when you leave to correct an issue and it takes nearly an hour for you to come back so that we can pay, there might be a problem. A big one."}
{"text":"Always tasty .. best price/quality balance in Vegas for sushi. 

Unless you have a big group, sit at the bar downstairs and enjoy the show. If you want a real experience, try the omakase. If you want 30% off your entire bill, go during happy hour (M-F 3-6pm). And if Drew is working, ask for the VIP Handroll .. you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for happy hour which is 20% off your bill. After 6pm On Tuesday's they have the AYCE special which we originally came for but they had a pretty small menu so we decided to opt for the happy hour special. 

We ordered and shared three sushi rolls and also got a free sake shot with a yelp check in. Sushi rolls tasted fresh and super yummy. Our bill was super cheap with the discount so we were pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with friendly and welcoming staff/workers. 
Best part is they have all you can eat and lunch specials. The place is small downstairs, but they also have an upstairs where you can eat. great sushi spot for downtown!"}
{"text":"Where to begin... the amazing staff of people working behind the scenes to just add even more value, more shock and awe for you when the masterpiece dishes get delivered to your table. The kind of presentation you experience, no matter how hungry you are you must pull out your phone and take a picture. Just perfect! And the taste... nothing like it! Perfect pair with some of the many choices of saki! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Nothing irks me more than misrepresented menu items.  WHY do sushi restaurants note \"crab\" as an ingredient in the roll when no crab whatsoever is in the roll?  While this may not be unique to Bocho, the charge for \"real\" crab may be.  At first the less-than-knowledgeable waitress stated that the \"upcharge\" would be $5 per piece, she then returned with an updated amount...$40 for the roll.  Holy Crab, Batman!  So, a roll that supposedly has \"crab\" in it is $12 on the menu but when you ask for \"real\" crab (instead of the ocean's version of a hot dog, aka, imitation crab meat or surimi), it jumps to $52?  That better be some DAMN GOOD CRAB MEAT!!!!  

We had the Pink Lady roll and that was fine, nothing too special.  We also had the Tempura Shrimp...same thing, it was fine...same as you can get anywhere.  We ordered a roll that had crispy garlic pieces on top (not noted on the menu, BTW) and it was absolutely disgusting!  Of course, we sent it right back and then at the end of the meal, the waitress informed us that it was \"taken off the bill.\"  Gee, thanks...um, we sent it back, so I would not have expected to have to pay for it.  

Almost forgot to mention, we were mildly pressured to eat at the sushi bar downstairs and had to reiterate twice to the hostess that we preferred to sit upstairs.  Kind of strange.  Choosing this place for a special occasion was a mistake...live and learn, right?

If anyone knows of a Sushi restaurant in the Las Vegas area that DOES NOT include \"surimi\" in their rolls...please let me know!  Thanks."}
{"text":"Great experience !! Staff very nice! Didn't have to ask for a refill they were on top of it!! Amazing to come across this type of custumer service. I checked in and received a free shot coupon . Without hesitation they were more then welcome to serve me. Great place. Two levels !! Great upstairs feeling. Happy hour is great."}
{"text":"Writing this review almost a year after my last visit. We were reminiscing as a family over all of the videos I had taken on my birthday. Anthony was one of the best sushi chefs/hosts I could have ever asked for on my birthday in Vegas. Entertainment and amazing sushi, he never disappointed our family of 12 once that night. I really do hope you get the opportunity to get Anthony as your sushi chef. Can't wait to visit so I can come here again. 10 STARS"}
{"text":"What a great find I can't say enough nice things about this Resturant. The quality of food 5 stars, the service 5 stars, the decor and atmosphere 5 stars, the price 5 stars. Best place in Vegas for sushi"}
{"text":"Seconds, anyone? Just had dinner with a group of friends here last night, and everyone was happy with the service and the food. Again, everything was so fresh. I have to go back and sit at the sushi bar next time!"}
{"text":"During my first visit to Downtown Las Vegas, the homie suggested we get some sushi. Located down the street from Container Park, this small sushi spot is definitely a great spot for grub and drinks. The homie and I got a couple of rolls and some sake bombs. I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi. Overall, if you're looking for some delicious sushi in Downtown Las Vegas then definitely come check out this spot."}
{"text":"I've given Bocho 3 chances to knock my socks off, and it just hasn't happened. The sushi is ok. The service is ok. The decor is ok. I wanted so badly to love it. None of their rolls, or sushi stick out in my mind. Average. They don't offer the bento box for dinner. Disappointing when dining with children.  There aren't many sushi spots downtown, but many other excellent restaurants. I'll have to get my sushi fix some place else."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the other great yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed! Got the poke monster roll and it was one of the best rolls I've ever had. Prices were fair to begin with, but happy hour made them even better! Coming back for sure if I'm ever in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I will definitely return, the food was good, just not what I wanted. The waiter was great in getting me something, so I appreciate that,  the atmosphere is great and the spot is with returning to."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi but this place rocks my world. Super picky about Tako specifically and here it tastes awesome. Not fishy at all a the texture is just right. Don't forget to use your IndiCard here! And happy hour is 30% off everything including sake which they have a great selection of."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing special.

The place is small and it has two floors. It is interesting.... It is not something I would have ever noticed if I weren't looking for it.

I really enjoyed the rock and roll, however, there was seaweed inside the cucumber which is unusual.

The Philadelphia roll had salmon on the outside, cream cheese and avocado inside. It tasted okay, however the slices of salmon were extremely thin. When fish is on the outside and the roll costs more because of this I would expect thicker slices.

The jalapeno bombs were yummy, though some were much hotter than others.

The rainbow roll was good.

The seaweed salad was good. It was a good size. There was lettuce under it, and a tomato and an orange slice on top. 

The sake was warm. I prefer it hot as it cools down quickly."}
{"text":"What a great place! We felt welcomed as soon as we walked in the door. The happy hour prices are amazing and the sushi was delicious and fresh. We will be back in Vegas next month and this is going to be a must stop. Thank you for the excellent & friendly customer service, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed going to Tokyo, and was heartbroken when they closed in commercial center. Luckily they reopened downtown! The food is still as delicious as ever, I love the decor, and the vibe here. Definitely not disappointed with this place. Service was good, our server was very attentive and made great suggestions. 
So glad that there's a great sushi spot downtown!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bocho on two different occasions and it was just ok. The fish was fresh but nothing amazing flavor wise. I would stick to the more traditional and basic options. They have some overly complicated rolls that I didn't care for. 

Service is friendly albeit slow."}
{"text":"Bocho sushi is great. My mom introduced me to this place and its a nice small little sushi place. Perfect place for lunch. I've been here maybe 5 times with big groups and small groups and the management is amazing. So friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, service, and atmosphere. A true diamond in the rough! Absolutely going back."}
{"text":"The spicy scallop is the best thing I have ever had, and the main sushi chef Drew is awesome! I love Bocho!"}
