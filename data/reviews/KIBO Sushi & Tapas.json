{"text":"Love the menu here and the food is fresh and tasty, and the prices reasonable. We eat her at least twice a month.  The reason for only 3 stars is that the staff give priority to orders and we sit in the restaurant mostly ignored and have to demand service  and watch as many people walk out after 8-10 minutes of being ignored especially if seated at the front away from the preparation bar. Their Sake is great but getting water is like pulling teeth so we bring our own.  There seems to be no management on site and if there is, she/ he is well hidden hence the poor service for in house eating."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant we've ever been to. Service was a little slow when it got busy but the sushi was beyond fresh. Also the sushi pizza was the best I've had. Everyone was friendly and accommodating and the spicy sauce is not to be missed. Portions were generous and of the highest quality. 

This is now our go-to Japanese place here in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have come here 6 times now (one week I came twice) and I have to say this place is fantastical! Everything I have eaten here has clearly been made with pride... Someone else wrote a bizarre review about the poor quality of the sushi and I'm honestly having a hard time believing it. The sushi chef here is an artist, I've actually never appreciated it until coming here. 

The miso soup is the most flavorful I've ever had, it even has these delicious little crouton thingys in it and sliced mushrooms! Yum! The salad is beautiful with it's homemade citrus dressing and these delicious strings of raw beets. So good! 

The sauces all get thumbs up and I high fived the waitress on the tempura once :P true story!

Give this place a go before this gem is packed every night! Also thanks the the staff for always being so accommodating and making me feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"absolutly excellent! very tasty! very clean place, quiet but that could be we went while it was mostly empty, seemed like most wanted it to go, which is fair, it was very warm out.
the price is a little high (esp when compared to places on bloor) but the presentation and quality is very good. 
intimate place, with a good view of st clair, it is a bit unfortunate to be next to a smokehouse. the smell was wafting in all thru the meal."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little sushi joint near St Clair West station. Great food (although they don't actually have tapas), lovely ambiance, great drink selection. I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Food - Standard sushi inventory from the Korean wholesale but the sushi guys make nice food out of it. Seafood options are pleasant and the Tuna Tataki is a pleasant surprise. Kaki Fry doesn't disappoint, but always beware the oysters' revenge as it is served super hot straight out of the fryer. Spicy set is quite spicy and an interesting combo of hand roll and maki. They do love mayo so be prepared.

Service - Get take out to avoid any issues unless it doesn't matter to you. 

It's pricy enough to make me want better service  if I eat in.  I'll give a taste here: dirty table offered on arrival. Waitress interrupted herself taking our order 3x to help someone with take out (?) and to go shout at the sushi guys to see if they were out of 2 items we were interested in. Dirty plates left on the table the entire time. Beers not served with glasses until we got up to ask although they have the cool glass chiller. Although my glamourous mom may look like a hipster, she is in her 70s and has never touched a beer bottle with her lips in her lifetime. I really shouldn't have to convince you to give me a beer mug. Water took 3x asking. And snatching the soy sauce away while we were still eating was bizarre.

Sneers throughout. Restaurant not busy. She seemed to be wearing comfortable shoes, unclear what was going on with the service. She finally sent over someone else to take our dessert order after getting up to ask (again). Abandoned debit machine on the table and left us.

The score is really for the food. We've eaten here before and the food has improved a lot. But the service was odd and pretty terrible. This neighbourhood is packed with folks who love to eat out. I was honestly surprised by the uneven service.

If they work on improving the service it could knock the two other nearby restaurants and the T&T Loblaws sushi counter off the list permanently. And lady? I'm normally a very generous tipper. And we eat out a lot. Save your scorn for after I pay and leave."}
{"text":"Excellent quality shusi. Very friendly staff. Shusi chefs are real pros. We love it and go back often"}
{"text":"Hosted a party on a Friday night for about 20 guests.  Kibo did the platters and they were awesome.  Wasn't sure how this would go as it was a first time and they completely outdid themselves.   We brought 5 oddly shaped platters (driftwood, ovals, planks, etc) the day before and let them go at it.   Delivered exactly on time with soy cups, chopsticks, ginger, extra wasabi, napkins, the platters were absolutely stunning.   The fish was fresh, generous, and looked amazing.   All of the items were premium selections without any low end California rolls, cucumber rolls and that sort of stuff....   guests were thrilled, we were thrilled, great team at kibo.   Made the party an absolute breeze and now our go-to for an impromptu catering event."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high star rating of this restaurant. Our usual go-to sushi place was closed on Aug 1, so we decided to check it out. Overall the food experience was underwhelming.

Pros:
- Big sushi rolls that are filling
- Good service
- Well organized & have their stuff organized well

Cons:
- Sparse on the fish with a lot of vegetable filler. Specifically, when eating a Red Dragon roll, rather than tasting the salmon I was tasking mostly cucumber. 
- Not the freshest ingredients. Don't get me wrong: nothing was spoiled, but you could tell that it wasn't as fresh as other places.

Overall the standard for Sushi places around Toronto is pretty high. We spent north of $50 for the two of us, and frankly we did not finish the food. I would advise to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi at a great value. Very good quality fish, not too much rice on the rolls. Friendly staff and great specials. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi and rolls are awesome here. They have many choices of rolls you can choose and daily specials. Worth the trip on a Saturday night with friends. Also it would great for take outs for weekday lunch and dinner. 

Great restaurant vibe, not loud, staffs are very attentive and fast."}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few nights ago. The food didn't taste very fresh and nor did the sashimi.  They plate the sushi rolls with wasabi already on them which caught me by surprise as I'm not a big fan of wasabi.  While it was a busy evening with limited staff, the service still wasn't very good. Was seated at a dirty/sticky table, server didn't refill waters and took a long time to bring the bill. Not a great experience overall."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Japanese restaurant in GTA. I am originally from Vancouver (I know my sushi) and am definitely not a fan of tiny sashimi slices some Japanese restaurants serve in Toronto. Kibo is generous with their portions and you won't leave hungry, definitely bang for your buck. They have lots of creative and fun options for sushi rolls and one of my favorite is black dragon roll. I am also a big fan of how they make your rolls with lots of topping inside and just enough amount of rice. Newly updated menu has spicy chicken karaage which tastes like Korean fried chicken and I recommend you try it if you like KFC. I always order my favorite sashimi which is hamachi and every time I get it, it's so fresh and melt in your mouth! Also I love how their draft beer is always ice cold, that's always a plus. You don't always have to spend so much money to get good sushi in Toronto, I would definitely recommend this spot!

Plus the restaurant is family friendly and the servers are always super helpful. There is street parking in-front of the restaurant or green P across the street right beside Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to have dinner on St Clair West! The food is always fresh and tastes delicious and the service is friendly. Little touches like coloured tempura bits, torched fish, and artistic presentation make for a nice change from your standard sushi place."}
{"text":"We ordered party platters from kibo and they were plentiful and full off premium sushi sashimi and rolls .  Great flavours and variety.  They was no filler and plenty to go around.  Excellent quality and composition. The platters included everything we needed, even little soy sauce cups.  We brought in our own trays the day before and they were happy to work with them and they looked amazing.  They even delivered!!! So pleased with this place. Five star."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's private dinner party to celebrate a special occasion. The restaurant doesn't have a private room but we were seated at the back next to the sushi bar and there was a screen to partition our party from the rest of the restaurant. The decor is really nice, it's cozy yet modern. The food we had was a special menu created just for the party and it was very good! The service was very hospitable, on a whim the sushi chef created cute little rice rolls shaped like afternoon tea sandwiches to help us celebrate the occasion!

Grace was our hostess for the night and she paid a lot of care and attention to our table. Yuni was our chef and she created some amazingly tasty dishes. I also learned she was trained at the Cordon Bleu in France so no wonder the food was so amazing!!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad I found this spot. The decor is much nicer than at your average sushi restaurant and has food that matches (even the washrooms are impressive).

The dishes were plated beautifully, and tasted even better. Prices were super reasonable given the quality. I got a combo that included soup, salad, a spicy salmon roll and dynamite roll for $12. The spicy salmon roll was piled with tasty crunchy bits and the spicy sauce was so flavourful. Dynamite roll was also better than most and drizzled with a tasty sauce. 

Service was reasonable. A little slower than your average sushi spot, but some may consider that a good thing since it seems that many are trying to rush you out. 

I would go here even if I wasn't in the area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via the Skip the Dishes app and was a bit disappointed.  App said estimated delivery time was 53-73 mins. due to peak volume and wow, did they mean business.  It took 1.5 hrs. from time of ordering to delivery, albeit 20 mins. of that was wasted on finding a courier.  Unfortunately, food arrived cold and cold is unsalvageable for tempura batter...had to reheat everything before finally eating our late dinner.  We had ordered a bento box with shrimp tempura + chicken + extra Dynamite rolls, a bento box with shrimp tempura + Bulgoki beef and steamed ebi shumai shrimp.  Bento box was of average caliber and portion.  Most disappointing was the ebi shumai shrimp - $6.95 for 8 tiny pieces of what tasted like rubbery fake fishball.  What a sham.  

Considering the taste, overall price, portion size and promptness and despite the reviews I've read on many forums, we were left grossly underwhelmed.  Sadly won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"3.5

We came here on a whim after searching for sushi spots in the area. There was only one server while we were there so it was a little hard to get her attention the first time. We decided to order two of their daily specials, 10 pc dynamite roll with 3 pc salmon sushi, 8 pc spicy salmon and 8 pc tuna.  We should've stopped ordering after that but we also ordered the spider Maki roll (10 pc). So you can imagine, there was a lot of food. We couldn't finish lol.

All the rolls we had were pretty good but I felt that they went a bit overboard with their sauces that you couldn't really taste the fish inside. Okay place, I can see this being quite a popular place for takeout though."}
{"text":"My favourite thing about this place is the layout of their menu!
It is definitely easy for people whom are not familiar with sushi to order off of as they provide pictures for all the items on their menu!
However, my qualm with this place is definitely the lack of variety in their rolls as I feel like they are all essentially slight variations of a dynamite roll with perhaps a different fish added on top. In addition, a lot of people have said how big their portions are and I feel that is due to the amount of rice they use to make their rolls. During my experience of dining here, I was not able to finish my roll and had to take it apart because the rice was over powering the fish."}
{"text":"This is our main sushi place and we absolutely love it!! I normally get the sushi combo A which includes nigiri and a couple rolls and the sushi is sooo fresh! The most recent time I went the got the sashimi combo B planning to share with others, but it was so good and before I knew it it was all gone. Service is nice the waiters are really friendly. Others I go with LOVE the donburi. Others prefer the udon soup which is also delicious (the noodles are so thick and yummy) overall I think this restaurant is a defiantly 5 star!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I discovered Kibo for delivery. I live in the area so have picked up from here a few times. It is always fresh and made to order. They once forgot one of the rolls and called us and apologized over and over. My husband went back to pick it up and they gave us a credit for next time which was nice. You could tell they want to correct the mistake and for us not to be upset. Lots of options and very nice service."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! I've been here a couple times for dinner, and have always enjoyed it. They have gluten free options, which is denoted on the menu. The staff is very friendly, and everything Has a nice presentation."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy salmon, tuna rolls plus some other good stuff. Had a good selection of beer. Place was super clean and tidy. Washrooms were really really clean. How many times can one say that?"}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and delicious fresh sushi. I got the daily special and it was ample and only $10.95. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, i have good experience for this place. The decoration is pretty good but it's in modern western than oriental way. They are working on the LLBO license so hopefully next time I can try some shoju when am eating sushi.
Service: quick and nice, 5/5

Atmosphere: it's busy in dinner time. 
However, it's not noisy as much. 5/5

Food: sushi is fresh and their tataki is amazing. On the other hand, the rice is bot firm enough. Rice's taste is good (right amount of vinegar and wasabi) but it keeps falling off after you put in soy sauce. 

They don't have parking in the back so you might have to park on the street and call for reservation if your groups is from 12ppl and up.
I will come back next time and try their loveboat.

Mar 28, 2016
This place has became my favorite place. My friends and I celebrate birthday here. The rice is more firm and getting better. They still have stunning decorations and tasty taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic sushi at a reasonable price - what's not to love? The staff are very welcoming and attentive.  Sushi chef greets you traditionally in Japanese. The fish is fresh and importantly, the sushi rice is perfectly seasoned.  Have been there a few times since they opened. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"** UPDATE** We recently gave Kibo the benefit of the doubt and tried ordering again. The entire process was painful and we will never order again. Very disappointed. 

We loved ordering from here during the summer of 2017. We didn't always feel that the fish was the freshest and a heads up if you're sensitive to wasabi and order sushi.. they use a ton, but it was great value for your dollar.
Recently I feel that the quality and service has decreased so much so, that the great price no longer justifies the compromise. Servers don't seem to care and I find myself being a little frustrated at the general lack of customer service (Insisting on sitting you at a table immediately in front of the door when there are other options, being served frozen sashimi and then being told that \"that's how it's served\" etc). 
Hope this is just a funk that they're in, but will be looking to another spot to get my sushi from for now."}
{"text":"Love ordering sushi from this place. They make an awesome spicy salmon roll and their green dragon is really good too. The tempura (both shrimp and veggie) are delicious. The delivery is usually fast (unless they are busy, which they warn you about before you place an order) and the prices are reasonable. It's our new favourite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for sushi boats. No other place can give you a bargain for sushi boats with tempura and edamame included into it. The tempura is delicious here and nothing like anywhere else. The sushi rolls were also so unique and delicious in its own ways. My favourite was definitely the beef aburi sushi. If you're there you have to try it. They also have amazing daily deals for their customers so if you love sushi, Kibo is the perfect a la carte joint for you!"}
{"text":"Went to the place last night with few of friends.
It was a cozy place with some Japanese + western fusion  like decoration.
we had a seat near the window and served with a bottle of cold sake - which was great!

It was cold enough to cool us down from the heat outside and smooth (and sweet) enough for me to take. I really loved it.

The lady who served our table was kind and helpful. also everything came as ordered, too. - I really like the fact that we were taken a good care for the whole time.

Now, Let's talk about our foods.

1st, we - 4 of us - ordered The love boat - which came with miso soups, edamame, salads,10pcs of kara-age ( Fired Chicken bits) and tempuras 

I really loved Miso soup - it was tasty - not too salty or watery as some places. amount of Miso was enough and 3 pieces of small fried tofu added little complexities to taste.

Salad - lovely color composition and everything looked and tasted fresh.
I think they use a bit of sushi rice vinegar on their sauce but it's just my guess.
but wished if they could make it a bit thick.. The most of sauce was kept on the 
bottom so veg on the top tasted a bit dull and one's on the bottom - a bit strong.

Edamame - I really don't like them so just passed. ^^;

Kara-age - Perfect Perfect and Perfect. (Yes I repeated it, 3 times...)
Crispy outside and Juicy on the inside! Just how I like them! The quality of meat was well above other similarly priced restaurants. They may used some herbs in the batter - those little pieces were finger licking good~!

Tempura - Not too thick but every pieces were covered evenly. They were delightful! 

Sashimi - they were fresh. If you love 'thick cut' pieces like me, You will love them.
If I may point out - they shall put more white tuna - escolar. Yes I'm aware of health issue regarding that fish.. but can't help it.. I just love them so much.
Sushi & Rolls - Amount of rice was about right. They were not too sweet but not too dull.
Slices of each fish were fresh and established good ensemble with rice on the bottom.
As you may see from my pictures, the chef used spicy mayo as the primary sauce but for fried rolls, I wish if he could use different sauces like reduced soy sauce. But in over all,they all tasted god and  I was satisfied. ^^

Udon - We order this separately. Lovely stock matched well with tempura bits, pieces of mussels and shrimps. I ordered it for myself but we ended up sharing it between everyone in our table - yes it was delicious and suited every1's taste. ^^

Will I be recommanding this restaurant to others? Yes.
Was I satisfied? Yes.
Will I come back for more? Definitely!

In Overall, It was such a pleasure and I shall say,

Gochisou sama deshita~!!!"}
{"text":"Wowwwwwww I had an amazing sushi dinner here. Huge pieces of sushi and great deals! I am a huge sushi lover and have been trying to find the best ones in the city (this is one of them!). It's not a huge place but make sure to book in advance because weekends can get busy. The service is great and they always put a smile on my face.

The sushi is honestly top quality and it's super fresh!"}
{"text":"It's a Korean owned Japanese sushi store. Actually the service is pretty good. The taste of the sushi and sashimi is average. 

I had the maki and sashimi. The salmon is fresh however the tuna was not so good. And the California roll is so so. But I think the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"The first time I came here. The service and food was good but that was just my friend and I. The second time, I called ahead to see if we can bring 10 people and they were willing to accommodate us but we had to wait. That's fine considering I know it's not a big restaurant. My friends and I arrived 20-30 minutes after. We checked to see how much longer we may have to wait and the hostess was rude. We were turned off and went to a Chinese restaurant called dumpling house less than a minute away. This is now the third time and definitely the last time I will eat here. Apparently it's my fault that they got my order wrong because they heard Maki, sushi, sashimi B and not Maki, sushi, sashimi PLATTER B. so now I have to pay for something that I didn't want and wait another 20 mins to get what I really want.. So all together I had to wait an hour for my take out. 
I don't care how good the food is, if you lack overall service, then to me it's not a restaurant worth going to."}
{"text":"Bang for your BUCK!  Rolls are tasty, service was awesome and the prices were seriously reasonable. I figured sushi places in this area were going to be pricey but Kibo was not. The salmon was fresh and the sauce that game with the Shrimp Dumplings was YUM!! I will return."}
{"text":"Small,cozy restaurant on st.clair with very friendly and attentive staff and great food. 

Came in for the first time on a whim while walking through downtown and although there was a slight issue with the food the server and manager apologized profusely and offered both a second meal to be made and the entire bill compensated. We were blown away by the amazing service and how they dealt with our issue and the PORTION SIZES ARE MASSIVE! 

Highly recommend the bento boxes as they will fill you for dinner with leftovers for tommorow lunch!"}
{"text":"This sushi was very good! I got yam and avocado roll, spicy salmon roll and seaweed salad! All rolls were awesome and seaweed salad had avocado on top(nice touch). They have a small tray for your soya sauce which I though was neat!"}
{"text":"Kibo is one of my favourite places on St. Clair! The sushi quality is good. The miso soup is the best ! If you have friends going with you, I recommend the love boats as long as you all can eat sashimi and sushi. The service is always 100% and they are super nice. 

The bento boxes are also a great size is every you weren't craving sushi. Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for a sushi spot near St. Clair and Bathurst"}
{"text":"Fried chicken appetizer is to die for.  Spicy rolls are actually spicy.  Roe doesn't feel like it has been in the fridge for two years.  This is a gem.  Don't care if this place is run by Koreans, Mongolians or Aussies.  So happy to have Kibo's app on my phone."}
