{"text":"FOOD: I'm no expert in Indian food so our hosts graciously offered to order for us. My favourite dish was the butter chicken, which they made mild since I can't handle my spices. I tried some other common dishes too, and found them all to be pretty good (but I have little to compare to). 

SERVICE: there was 1 server working at the time, but since we were one of two tables of diners, the service was fast and attentive. 

COST: A main dish for about $10-15. Add some rice or nann for a few bucks. Basically it ranges around what I would expect to pay for good Indian food. 

OVERALL: A great recommendation by a friend. It's almost impossible to find tucked away in the back corner, but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, or simply craving Indian food."}
{"text":"This place is best I tried in brampton. I have tried a lot o Indian food in Brampton, but this place tops the list. Wow what flavour and taste. The prices are higher than some of the indian restaurants around but the quality is there.

 If you can pay for quality... Check this place out.."}
{"text":"Weird I went to London before I experienced Indian Food, we know the British love their curries and take away. I went to the Tandoori Flame Restaurant a couple times in the last month, both times I went the food consistency was great. The buffet was outstanding, great flavor, good choices, if you like it hot, they offer additional sides of sauces to try around the buffet area. I think it great value for the price. 

Compared to the Host Indian Buffet no comparison, Host cannot even come close. It's well worth the trek to the Brampton."}
{"text":"Decided after the fact they didn't want to deliver. Not happy with their backpedaling excuse once they found out."}
{"text":"I will never order from This restaurant Again period. I've had wwwaaaayyyy better Indian food then this, I'm not Indian but the way they cook lacks so much flavor and the texture. It just didn't work for me, I ordered take out. The tandoori chicken wasn't too bad, the butter chicken lacked flavor and was too salty (I like salt, so I won't complain).. It made the naan bread taste even better! The tikka chicken Masala Sucked! I'm surprised they are in business with food like this, but I guess others like it.. Meh..  I'm sticking with Tandoori Flame or Tandoori Time for my Indian fix."}
{"text":"Terrible service, attitude and portions. Don't bother going to it. Ordered Lamb and they gave chicken instead."}
