{"text":"Expensive frozen dough pizza. 
They cannot pretend to be an Italian restaurant. Big disappointment"}
{"text":"The pizza was not bad. The goat cheese pizza had good flavor. The margarita was simple with a nice slice of tomato on each slice. There was no basil to be found (unless you count some dried herbs sprinkled on top)

If you are in a rush...avoid!  It took way too long for two personal pizzas...try more than a half hour and there was hardly anyone else there."}
{"text":"Food came out fast and was hot, would not do the sangria again.  The goat cheese pesto pizza was good and the atmosphere is nice, but in this area of Montreal there are quite a few restaurants and choices.  I probably chose wrong because I admit I was starving.  The waiter was nice but forgot to charge for a desert and actually caught me before I left to tell his manager caught it and he had to charge me. A little weird. I would suggest checking out the other options before starting here. Stay away from the white wine sangria...I think it was just fruit juice."}
{"text":"The service was not good. We had to wait a long time to get our order. The tables are located very close to one another and you have to be careful that the person getting out of the chair next to your table does not tip off your drink. 
Having said that, the food quality was great. I had the 3 course meal option: garden salad,  Fillet Mignon (very tender) with giant shrimps and dessert. They were quite busy and we got lucky that we got a patio seating. This place gets 3.5 stars for the great food and the excellent view."}
{"text":"Good food nice spot to dine, BUT they refused to accept Canadian money.  Wonder why they are in business.  I thought that the Canadian Government printed good money, but guess this place disagrees.  We won't return."}
