{"text":"We spent ages looking for somewhere to eat in Montreal and settled for the food court. I
I enjoyed the poutine at Franx and the portions are massive! 

The walls of the place and posters were very grubby so I was a bit worried about the cleanliness, but I didn't due so I guess it was OK."}
{"text":"You could easily think the food at Franx Supreme, located in the food court of the mall, would taste nothing special, but you would be wrong! Its one of the best poutines in Montreal according to me. Nothing fancy, but very well done. What I enjoyed most was that the fries are crisped to perfection. And the gentleman who was there everytime i had a craving for their poutine is very pleasant and efficient. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving some good poutine, and we ran into this joint. It was pretty awesome! Our annual visits to Canada always necessitate a couple of visits to legitimate poutine places, and this experience definitely stands up there. It's also a good price.

We ordered the \"Poutine Petite\" and that was already plenty to fill two of us hungry birds up. The cheese also melted perfectly, and the gravy sauce was a perfect blend. Franx Supreme is a chain found around Quebec, so if you are ever in this province and area, definitely stop by and check it out!"}
