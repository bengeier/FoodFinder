{"text":"The best Japanese food in Toronto. Sit at the bar and have the omakase. Hiro respects food allergies but anyone unwilling to eat what he recommends should eat elsewhere. The marinated tuna, gravlax, house smoked salmon and smoked butterfish are particularly good."}
{"text":"respectable and traditional. always a great meal."}
{"text":"Slowest sushi ever ... And not the best one i had. Check it out If you have a lot of time. Was here on Tuesday night and place was not that crowded"}
{"text":"Emancipate yourself from expensive emaciated sushi, and stay away! 

How bad was it? The salmon nigiri appeared to have been attacked by piranhas before an dull blade shredded the hell out of what was left of the carcass. It was literally the width of my baby pinky and practically transparent. Seriously?! The rolls were equally inferior, SUPER SUPER tiny & poorly assembled. Huge discrepancy in cost, value and presentation.

Beyond food, service lacked decorum. The waitress tried to make alterations to our order. Apparently what my date and I wanted to eat, is not what we should be eating. 

It was a memorable dining experience for all the wrong reasons. Maybe it was my date? Maybe it was the food? Irregardless, not venturing near either again.

{"text":"Had a nice prix fixe meal for $45. Included a soup, a starter, a main, and then 6 pieces of Nigiri and a 3 piece cucumber roll. All were very good - the starter was delightful, and several of the Nigiri were unique that I have never had before. I will return, and try to sit at the sushi bar, where I would have preferred to sit, although it said reserved and I'm not sure why, as it didn't seem to be fully occupied."}
{"text":"Hiro-san has brought traditional sushi cuisine to Toronto. It's the details that matter, from where the fish is sourced, to rice preparation and little things like fresh wasabi that's grated for each dish. My best advice is to simply sit at the \"bar\" and ask for his day's recommendations."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I was on a business trip to Toronto and decided to try Hiro sushi by myself after work. Somehow the cushion of the chair fell loose and I just fell into the middle of the chair! (I am a tiny Asian girl) Everyone was looking at me, it was the most embarrassing experience ever. AND I was in a dress. Hiro came over, checked on me, I said \"I am OK, it was just embarrassing,\" he said \"I know, you make such a loud sound.\" It was such a cold comment. I had placed my order by then so I had to stay. The food was mediocre. And the bill was not a penny less than how much I was supposed to pay. My legs are all bruised and their waitress saw it and got my some band-aid to stop the bleeding and inflection. Anyway, $90, some sub-par sushi, ill treatment after an ridiculous experience later, I went back to Chicago and decided to do Hiro justice."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi house in downtown Toronto. Had the omakase there, it was very good although if you get omakase it could be pricey.

Food:
many courses of monk fish liver (ponzu, sushi, sashimi) - enjoyed it
smoked butter fish sashimi and sushi - I'm normally not a big fan of butterfish, but this was excellent!
Sweet shrimp sashimi and sushi - good as always
Long island clam mussel - This was new for me, delicious
Seared Toro sushi - very good, comparable to the ones I've had in Sushi of Gari in NY
mackerel sushi - very good, no fishy taste as all, better than many other mackerels i've had

Many other courses of tuna/salmon/etc...Please get the omakase when you go..."}
{"text":"I went in one time for lunch, and it was pretty good sushi. Staff was nice, Sushi looked fresh, Miso Soup was Hot and done well. Nice place to sit and relax and get a good meal at a affordable price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Disapointing, overpriced, and left hungry. There are many better sushi restaurants in the city. I had such high expectations for this place."}
{"text":"I think if people are going to Hiro and comparing it to places like Ki, they are of course going to be disappointed. It's a totally different, and as a previous poster mentioned, more traditional experience. Old school but good!"}
{"text":"Easily the worst restaurant experience I've had in Toronto. I don't pretend to be a sushi expert, but I know quality and I've eaten many times at Sushi Ran in SF; Sushi Yasuda, Jewel Bako, Kuruma Zushi, and many others in NYC; as well as Sushi Kaji here in Toronto. It's not like I walked in and ordered a California roll and some edamame.

I did order a wide selection of sashimi and nigiri, over half of which I didn't touch. I think Mr. Hiro must have swept some scraps from his cutting board, put a tablespoon of wasabi underneath them and sent them to my table. It was insulting and inedible and I can't remember ever being so angry in a restaurant. I still get pissed just thinking about it.

Unless you speak Japanese and can coax the good stuff from him (assuming there is actually some good stuff to be had), do not waste your time or money. Mr. Hiro will likely treat you like a rube and charge you 200 bucks for trash fish that's worse than the pre-pack junk at T&T."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Not only in terms of quantity but quality as well. I disagree with the reviews that praise the quality and justify the price that way. In my opinion, there are countless sushi resturants in our great city that offer equally fresh *if not fresher* sushi for much more reasonable prices. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best sushi experience I have had in Toronto and cannot recommend it highly enough. I would suggest sitting at the bar and enjoy watching Hiro craft the evening. Do not go here and order off the menu, that would be a grave mistake. Trust Hiro's omakase and enjoy the experience. The polarizing reviews on Yelp paint a good picture - if you are looking for something authentic, special and fresh in Toronto compared to the host of subpar sushi you have likely experienced - you already know which camp you fall into."}
{"text":"Won't return!

The portions are so small, I couldn't believe how small they were for the price you paid.  It's sad to spend $85 and leave a place hungry.

This place is way overpriced for what you get.  I don't mind to pay for good food and to fill up.

I will not be returning here or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"I know there's a lot of positive and negative reviews for this restaurant but when it comes down to it, you either like it or you don't. For myself, I love Hiro Sushi Restaurant! Great atmosphere, delicious dishes, and in your face wasabi (no joke, I felt like I was being punched in the face when I had the wasabi at this restaurant). I know most will decrease the rating for this restaurant based on the price/portion but you are paying for quality. You decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi is the best sushi in Toronto. In our omakase, we had monk fish liver in three styles: steamed sashimi with ponzu sauce, boiled sashimi, and sushi . The smoked butterfish, which is also highly recommended on yelp, is also impressive. The flavor of smoke and the texture of smoked fish combined perfectly. I highly recommend the sweet shrimp sushi - delicate texture and a trace of sweetness.

Overall, Hiro sushi is my favorite sushi place in Toronto. Serious chef, delicious food and reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great Omakase one of the best in the city.  There are very few good Japanese restaurants in Toronto. Sit ant the bar and watch Hiro create beautiful work. Fresh fish, great seasonal variety."}
{"text":"A couple of the negative reviews compelled me to sign up and write my first review.

I have been to Hiro a few times, and I couldn't disagree more with those reviews.  Hiro is among one of the few exceptional truly Japanese-run sushi restaurants that truly remind me of the sushi bars in Japan.  The fish is of exceptional freshness, and everything coming from Chef Hiro Yoshida's blade is of excellent quality and craftsmanship, understated but so evidently there for the discerning.  I'm not sure traditional would be the word that I'd use, as there is such sublime originality in some of his dishes, but definitely there will be no \"Super Dragonfly Six-Color Spicy Mayonnaise Special King St. Roll\" on the menu.  

Omakase is definitely the way to go at this place - Chef Yoshida definitely comes from the traditional rigors of sushi chef training.

I think a problem with Toronto is that we're spoiled with a wealth of sushi places, and being in North America, these joints tend toward a Western palate that involves fancy rolls that originate more from the Pacific shoreline of our neighbors down south than the fishing villages in Japan.   We're a city that grew up on a lot of bad sushi, and most people think the crap stuff is actually the way it should be.  A good 90% of sushi joints in Toronto are serving the Japanese food equivalent of sweet and sour chicken balls (a nifty invention passed off as Chinese food to unsuspecting and unschooled in Chinese food for decades).  Our sorry lack of knowledge about Japanese cuisine, is how chi-chi lack of substance places like Ki are even allowed existence.  In any N.A. city that knows their fish, e.g. like Vancouver or NYC, Ki would sink within 3 months.  

I can't even begin to fathom how you can compare the two.  I guess it's the age-old culinary battle of the so-called trendy avant-garde vs. the purists.  It's like comparing good old Ribeye from Barberian's to a baseball mitt of a steak from the Keg mansion - for some it's both steak, and the Keg mansion may be better atmosphere, but Barberians will smoke the Keg on every cut.

That said, it's really a matter of individual preference.  Bottom line is if you like a spoonful of mayo with your rainbow rolls and the gullible ambiance of faux-Asia, go to Ki, but if  you really like raw fish and you're a sashimi eater, go to Hiro.  Authentic Japanese and nothing but."}
{"text":"Grabbed some takeout sushi for the night, with three maki rolls: spicy salmon, tuna, and negi-hama, coming up to a total of $24.

Didn't buy any drinks (like a $3 Coke/soda) since I had water. That should be enough, right? 

But holy shitsnacks! I should've ordered it with a carton of milk because the amount of wasabi in those things was enough to burn me a whole new breathing hole. It got to the point where I was choking on the wasabi, and only the relief of a milky, cold ice capp could bring mediocre relief to my burning sinuses. I was surprised, in picking a piece apart, to find that it wasn't much more than a small smear inside each piece. However, those smears were enough to hold the wasabi power level of wasabi peas x 10-15 times what you get from those snacks. What fresh hell is this? Yes, yes, they probably use the real wasabi stuff which has actual depth of flavour, quality, etc. but the amount of it was just too much. 

True that the fish seemed fresh. Rice was nicely vinegared to compliment the fish. But I don't think I'll ever be able to return, on the basis of I like not having my sinuses on fire, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Hiro may have completely ruined sushi for me as this place (and the sushi chef Hiro) are so good that I don't think any other sushi will ever compare.  Everything here is quite delicious and you MUST sit at the sushi bar and just get whatever Hiro puts on your plate.  It is the only way to eat here.  

Here are a few of the highlights of our dinner:
-Bottomless, sweet, cold and delicious Sake
-Flight of salmon (smoked, salted and wrapped in tea leaves and regular)
-BUTTERFISH (regular and smoked)
-Spanish Makarel
-Monk Fish
-Fried Red Snapper

Honestly I must have tried at least 20 different types of sushi.  You know the place is good when the chef is slicing fresh ginger root and grinding his own wasabi.  Anyone that doesn't think this place is incredible is seriously jaded and needs a good kick in the pants."}
{"text":"I returned for the omakase a little while ago, and I have to say, I'm sort of sad. 

On one hand, Hiro showed me again his mastery -- he has the ability to make the ordinary into the extraordinary. He can take a piece of salmon sushi and with his special preparation methods, make something that is exquisitely smoky, perhaps with the exact right amount of saltiness. 

But maybe it's because I look young, or because I don't seem like the usual client for Omakase. I was treated somewhat disrespectfully and standoffishly by Hiro himself. It's pretty normal in an omakase at the sushi preparation area for the chef to converse with their patron. 

He, however, ignored me. And even though he did great things with normal ingredients, Omakase is about showing me your best! He flashed out a hunk of o-toro then conspicuously put it away in front of me. He gave me around 11 pieces (3 pieces of salmon, red snapper, flounder, sea urchin, escolar, marinated tuna, albacore tuna, Monkfish Liver, mackerel) asked if I was done, then served me a strange tuna roll with raw burdock root in it. 

This place might not be my cup of tea after all.

Ambiance 5/5

If you are expecting Memories of Japan or any of the Korean sushi places then save yourself a trip. However, if you wish perfection. Don't be cheap. Go for the whole experience. 

oh and try the salmon trio!!"}
{"text":"This place is for very serious sushi eaters only, or those interested in obtaining knowledge of what real sushi taste like. Flavors are subtle, just as they are in Japan(I've been 3 times). Prices are not cheap and your not gonna find spicy tuna rolls, california rolls or 99% of the other stuff on your ordinary sushi places menu. The omakase was amazing and only about $30 for lunch. Standouts were mackerel, salmon smoked japanese style, tuna marinated in garlic, butterfish."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to sushi heaven. So authentic. I don't know if I will ever be able to have regular sushi again. Our Japanese friends took us here, which should have been my first clue. Chef Hiro is a delight. Go Omakase (chef's choice) and spend the money, it's the way to go. Every dish he served was so tasty. There really wasn't a fish I didn't like.  I will sorely miss this place when I head back to Chicago. The mackerel cooked with sesame oil was so tasty. The tuna marinated in Hiro's homemade soy sauce. Every bite made me giggle with delight. I wish I had two stomachs and didn't have to stop eating."}
{"text":"There seemed to be a mix up about our reservation, they thought we had booked another night. They accommodated our group of five in the front of their restaurant.

We ordered the three course Omakase. The server highly recommended all members at the table order the same type of meal as not to confuse the staging of courses, we listened. We were unsure what the three courses were but placed our faith in the chef. We were served soup, a brilliantly smoke salmon with sticky rice, and then various pieces of sushi. The sushi was typically served four varieties at a time. We found the sushi to be heavy on the wasabi, and the rice fell apart more than once. Our servers had a hard time describing the dishes and sushi that came out. Additionally they did not recommend an order to consume the pieces in, something I've seen at most restaurants of a similar style. At one point we were given three types of maki, but only  four pieces of each. When we asked our server about a fifth piece such that each person would have a chance to try each type, we were told the chef said these are meant to be shared. This was a little disappointing.

Perhaps some of the communication issues stem from being so far from the chef, but with half the seating not at the chef's table I would expect better.

The variety of fish is better than most ayce places, but not as extensive  as other premium sushi places. The overall quality, service, and presentation are also not in line with what I've seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the rave of lots of people, saying they have the best sushi here. Came here with my girlfriend and my other couple friend. For some odd reason everyone was impressed with the neat scooper that was used to get your soya sauce from the cup that it came in. Tip to restaurants, add this and you can increase your prices by 10% at least!

The salad was too salty and the food took a very long time to come. My friend did the ordering since it was his suggestion. He ordered a bunch or items but was surprised with the fact that each order only comes in 2 pieces, we had to double the food. 

The sushi was good. I guess by him talking so much about it primed me to think it tasted better. It wasn't cold and it was warm and soggy, it had a good texture but I personally did not see what all the rave was about.

Like Karen G said I don't think it's worth it for the prices they charges but if you go and sit in front of the Chef as he performs then it might enhance your experience."}
{"text":"Have recently eaten here twice. Once ordering a la carte and the second time omakase. Both times it was very satisfying. Watching Hiro work is mesmerizing. If you have a chance to dine here, I'd highly recommend it. The sushi is some of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Worst japanese food ever.
Took about an hour for 3 rolls to arrive, they were extremely small, and tasted bland.  on top of that the tables are so close together.

wouldn't come here if it was free.  i think even the chinese-japanese food restaurants serve better food than this.

go to kirei instead, it is light-yrs ahead."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the vegetarian sushi combo, however I felt it was a bit overpriced.  I think the bento boxes are of better value as they're quite large compared to other sushi restaurants. The place itself is ok. There's no air conditioning  so during hot days it feels a little stuffy in there."}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine what people would complain about here.  This has to be one of the best, authentic sushi places I've been to outside of Tokyo and Sushi Yasuda.  Really really fresh fish, perfectly cut.  You won't get any dragon rolls or rainbow rolls here.  

If you're non-japanese he may serve you a really spicy hotategai handroll, and tell you it's a Gaijin-Roll.  Look it up."}
{"text":"Hiro is in my top 3 list for Toronto sushi restaurants! The chef's choice platter is the way to go or the Omikase style if money is no object.

I go to Hiro more often than the other high end sushi restaurants because the $/value you get for such authentic and high quality Japanese style sushi is unmatched.

The ambiance and feel of the place is also very authentic, just like in Tokyo."}
{"text":"This place is not for the average diner. It is quite expensive for what it is. This was our first stop after checking in at the hotel and it left us wondering is Canada really this expensive?

We had a Sushi Deluxe, though it would have been a Regular in US standards maybe? 9 pieces of sushi and a roll set us back 45 CAD. We also ordered Wagyu Beef appetizer that came to be 18 CAD. The sushi pieces we got were not at all premium and the beef was the size of a half dollar coin, seriously. I do have to give props that it has some authentic Japanese dishes, but nothing I would grovel over.

With taxes of 13%, tip, and no remote satisfaction of any of the items that we tasted, we had to rate it poorly. It's average food at upscale prices. Even the atmosphere or service did not merit the price tag.

If I had to do it again, I'd head off to Japango for a better experience."}
{"text":"Most interesting Japanese cuisine. 
I love Japanese food, and the menu here is ok, but there are certain things that I just never had elsewhere. 
The mackerel salad was one of them!
Raw Spanish mackerel, topped with hot sesame oil and ponzu sauce! Wow! 
Something else that was very different was the veggie tempura. Hiro's version is shredded veggies deep fried in a light tempura batter. Very interesting!
Its a bit pricy but worth the experience. 
Would go back for some of the rarer menu items.
Not sure I would go often though. This definately not a first date type of place!"}
{"text":"I live right across from Hiro, and I probably go there once a week. There are other sushi restaurants in the neighbourhood, but they are just not at par with Hiro. Hiro's house smoked anchovy and butterfish are mouth watering and to die for.  
the only thing is, it is expensive, and honestly that's the only reason why I go there only once a week. I'd have Hiro's sushi for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I could!!"}
{"text":"I went to Hiro Sushi with high expectations. Many had said it was on par if not better than Ki Sushi on Bay and I have to say I was really disappointed with the whole experience. 

I went with three other people for a business dinner and the service was absolutely appalling. They sat us at the front of the restaurant and practically ignored us for the entire night. We were at the restaurant for three hours! 

We waited 45 minutes between courses and when the food arrived it was sub-par. None of the sushi was especially distinctive or unique. The toro belly was the only saving grace, but the for the price and wait time, it definitely wasn't worth it. 

If you want a really delicious upscale sushi experience where the wait staff actually pay attention to their customers, go to Ki and have the chef's selection - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Definitely experienced better sushi/japanese restaurants. The food was minimalistic and tasteless and packed with wasabi through out. Its all you could taste. Unforuntaely not a great expereince based on the rave reviews I've heard."}
{"text":"Authentic sushi spot with great service and excellent, fresh cuts of fish.  The food is pricey but you get what you pay for.  The sashimi I had was quite fresh and was a delight.  I also really enjoyed the old school Japanese decor and the feeling of authenticity that permeated the restaurant.  I have a friend who lived in Japan and is fond of Japanese culture and this is the kind of place that I would think to take him.  One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fact: high quality fish, screamingly fresh and exquisitely prepared is inherently expensive stuff, traditionally served in small portions. My sashimi dinner here was a steal at $20-some, albeit a very light supper. But a less experienced dining companion had real trouble negotiating the menu and left unsatisfied. If your concept of sushi is California rolls and the like you may want to put off a visit to Hiro. If you're looking for an undiluted Japanese sushi experience look no further."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and it's only open during certain evenings. The chef is legitimate and seems to be having a good time while he makes the sushi in front of you.

We had the chef's choice and it was a row of great fresh sushi. 

I loved it, but my partner thought it was a tad too heavy on the wasabi.  It is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I feel like Hiro has the skill and knowledge to make some of the best sushi in the city, but has lost his drive and care for his food. 
The one good thing about the meal was the quality of the fish. However, the workmanship of the nigri was frankly the shoddiest I've ever experienced. I was not born yesterday -  I've enjoyed authentic nigri at places like Nami, Japango, Edo, and in Kyoto - so I know what good nigri should NOT look like. Hint, Hiro: the rice should not be so sticky that individual grains stick to the diners' fingers, nor should it be so loosely packed that the nigri falls apart when picked up. There was similar carelessness with the knife work on the fish. Japanese snapper was sliced too narrow with frayed, stringy edges. Hamachi slicing was a nightmare: mine had a hole in the middle through which I could see the rice; my husband's was made of two pieces of fish slapped together on one piece of rice (I kid you not). The junior chef forgot to close the nori on my husband's piece of ikura so that it unravelled on the plate. (The junior chef seems to be relegated to the non-authentic rolls that Hiro refuses to make, several of which we watched him mangle by pushing his fingers clear through the rice layer and then slicing them crookedly.)
The thing is, we watched Hiro take much more care and exhibit more skill preparing the nigri for a pair of Japanese women at the other end of the bar. I suspect that for his regulars and for those with whom he can converse in Japanese, Hiro makes some of the best sushi in the city. A mere modicum of effort could ensure similar quality for his other patrons and hopefully create new regulars. Unfortunately for Hiro, he seems to have lost the pride in his work to put the same care into all of his sushi."}
{"text":"I love sushi and had really high hopes for Hiro Sushi. I was disappointed by their service, and the quality of the rice.

FOOD
I ordered the Sushi lunch for one and a half, and to my disappointment, the rice was a bit stale and was not \"sticky.\" A good nigiri would come apart, yes, but it wouldn't be \"individually\" grained. Maybe the cooling process was a bit odd :\ The size of each nigiri was perfect though.

A delicate smear of wasabi would normally perfect a good quality fresh sashimi. However, it is unfortunate that the smear of wasabi was more like a glob plopped on. It was overpowering to the taste, if not a little painful to eat.

SERVICE
We came in a large group, about the 8 of us. It is quite obvious that the server was overwhelmed by our orders, and insisted to come back for our orders after grabbing our drinks first. We were a little pressed for time so we wanted to do it all at once, but not a big deal.

What was a disappointment is her forgetting 3 of our orders, and after 5 of us had almost finished our meals and followed up, she then realized she has forgotten.

OVERALL
The dining experience was overall great, I enjoyed watching the itamae at work, and the decor is nice. However, I think it is overhyped."}
{"text":"Ugh.  Where to begin.  Horrible service - one hostess/waitress was primarily focused on organizing/checking paperwork, leaving the entire restaurant to the other waitress.  Every time we looked for her to ask for something, we noticed that most of the other diners were doing exactly the same thing, and didn't seem very happy about it.  Tiny portions of very average food at high prices, presented in a very unimaginative manner (please don't tell me this is somehow \"authentic\" - I've dined in Japan many times and never had such mediocre food in tiny portions with such abysmal service)."}
{"text":"Freshness:
I am not a sushi expert at any means however I do know I can get very sick if the sushi is even so slightly not fresh.  Hiro Sushi is one of the few places where I didn't have to run to the bathroom after my meal so I give it a 4 star for freshness.  The only thing I was concerned with was the freshness of the octopus. My friend recently had very fresh octopus. It was chopped up and served to her on a plate. The funny thing is that the chopped pieces were still moving after 45min.  My octopus however at Hiro was not moving.  I am not sure whether this means my octopus dish was to be served differently.

Cost
This place is definitely not for students. I was lucky enough to have a friend take me to celebrate the passing of one of my exams.  For 2 of us, it cost $160 before tip.  We had one Sushi Platter/Chef's Choice and one Omakase.  We only drank tea, no alcohol.   The Omakase came with 4 appetizer dishes (beef tongue, turnip dumpling, a variety of sashimi, anchovi salad (I think)) and 1 Sushi tray. I uploaded pics for your liking! I know I always like to see pics!

Staff
The staff was very attentive but I think it was b/c there were only a total of 14 people going in and out during my time there (my dinner was about 2 hours long on a Saturday night).  Hiro is great to watch. He has a stature of a Karate Master.  But his assistant is good to look at too. Really cute and winked at me ;)

If you're not a sushi expert, you will not be able to appreciate the authenticity of the restaurant. So I would suggest going somewhere in Korean town nearby.  Otherwise, had a great time!"}
{"text":"I visited Toronto a few months after being in Tokyo. The first thing I said after eating at Hiro Sushi was that the place would easily be at home in Shibuya or Shinjuku charging twice the price. I was honestly blown away that I could find sushi this good so far outside of Japan. 

Truly master class sushi in an amazing town."}
{"text":"It's time for one of Leslie's patented Pros and Cons... so here goes::::

Pros
One of Toronto's venerable sushi institutions. Hiro has delivered authentic sushi to Toronto for 30 years (time-line is an estimate). Of course, Ichiriki and Yasu are near downtown.
Rare fish, staples, omakase, etc. it is all here (well, except fake crappy all-you-can-eat whatever of course). Sushi FLAVOUR!
The cooked items are only a few but they are actually worth savouring. They are umami.
They use real wasabi and not the powdered horse radish stuff.
Many fish from Japan
Very nice new décor, especially if you sit at the new wooden dug-out bar. Low lights and cleanliness, which extended to the washrooms are good things.
Great service. The waitresses were polite and sincere
Not many places in or near downtown actually serve authentic sushi. This is a shame in Toronto so Hiro is welcome.
The store within the restaurant is a treat. Buy a knife, or a cloth or a book, doesn't matter they have a very nice shop of Japanese gifts and souvenirs.

Cons: 
Frankly the nori on the hand rolls and rolls was disappointing
The negihama rolls had something like stalks in them, a total no-no, just stick with fish and fine green onions please
And worst of all, certain items were an explosion of wasabi. This spice is supposed to be applied sparingly and not put on like a party dare. It darted from my chin to my nose to my forehead and back of my neck and I was in tears. It sounds funny now, but wow. Perhaps it is better to order sashimi here.
The menu has a few inauthentic rolls, but at least they identify them as such..
I am not sure how cute or sanitary peanuts acting as chopstick rests are. Is it rally proper to rest the tip of one's chopsticks on a peanut (with its shell)?


We had the Chilean sea bass appetizer, which was tasty and completely umami. Nice use of dashi flavour. The Hamachi and toro were top-notch. The rolls and certain items hit by the avalanche of wasabi were not."}
{"text":"Call me low brow, but for the astronomical prices they charge here, I didn't find the quality or the taste of the fish much different from the average western sushi joint. I ordered the chef's platter, and was impressed by the lack of \"fishiness\" in some of the cuts like eel and mackrel. You could tell they were very good cuts. And the addition of garnishes like garlic and basil was a nice touch.  However, when it came to the maki rolls, I found them lacking in flavour. 

If you want a full belly, one average person would easily have to spend over $100. I came and left hungry. The service was lacking, and we got attitude from the waitress when we didn't order a second round of sushi or any dessert. We paid our $60 bill with $80 in cash, and the waitress assumed the extra $20 was a tip. 

Not worth the cash and pretentiousness. I'll stick to Tokyo Kitchen down the street and get comparable freshness and taste for half the price - even if the bathroom is in the parking garage."}
{"text":"Heard from a client that the omakase at Hiro is 'really good!', so my fiancé and I have decided to check it out last night. Unfortunately, it was just a whole BIG disappointment from beginning to end. Really NOT worth the time and money.

There was only one sushi chef in the house and the restaurant is full... so most of the time, we are just waiting and waiting for the food to come. Omakase was priced at $70 and up per person. Ended up paying a total over $200 before tax and tips.

Food was really not up to par. I think I had salt overdose. They put so much salt and seasoning in the cooked foods and even had rock salt on my sashimi (to enhance flavours... but seriously, it's just too much salt intake overall)! Also, I literally had a wasabi brain freeze and my jaw became numb. Chef used way too much wasabi in the sushi, it is extremely spicy and I had to pick them out. Be sure to ask the chef to go lighter on the wasabi when you order. But the chef was drinking beer and was in his zone. I don't think he gives a shit of what you think.

By the time we had the 7th course, our waitress asked if we had enough food. We said we would like one more plate of sushi. The chef whipped up some half ass job sushi as our 8th course with sashimi we already had, sweet Chinese mushroom (bad choice) and a maki roll with sour vinaigrette, mint leaf and white radish roots (extremely bad choice). This combination tasted like soap. Yes, soap. Not soup, but soap. The impression we got from the chef was 'Get outta here'.

During this whole omakase experience, we did not get uni or hamachi or raw scallops or whatever fancy things out there. My fiancé loves hamachi, so after that horrible 8th course, we specifically asked the chef to make us a hamachi hand roll. I'm sure everyone knows what a hand roll is, but instead, we got a hamachi maki log. Should've taken a photo of it. The impression we got from the chef after the log was 'Really, get da F outta here'.

So we have decided to call it a night and asked for dessert. 'Homemade' black sesame ice cream was definitely not homemade. They should seriously take note from Zen Japanese Restaurant of what homemade black sesame ice cream is. Apple and pear sorbet was just flavored crushed ice rolled into a ball. Ice cream and sorbet cost $5 each, just in case you were wondering. I can't believe they charged us extra for dessert during a dinner omakase. For $5, I can get better stuff at Ed's Real Scoop. 

Overall, it's just bad. But kudos to our waitress... she was so busy running around helping out the restaurant (which seemed short staffed) and trying to keep all the customers happy. Not the best omakase in Toronto for sure."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and yum.  I must thank my expert on Toronto, Miss Marianne, for taking us to Hiro's.  There were four of us in the party, seated at the sushi bar and we were treated to excellent and attentive service from the waitstaff and the sushi chef himself.   

We ordered in the omakase style and I must admit, WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED.  The traditional flavors were clean, crisp and hauntingly Japanese.  It reminded me very much of my dining experiences in Japan with my mom and her family and as my friends savored each morsel, I delved into each bite with full force as my happy memories of Japan caught up with me.  I felt as if I had come full circle and had gone to my happy place.

That night, Hiro started us off with 3 appetizer dishes: 1) filleted mackarel prepared in ceviche like style, drenched in warm sesame seed oil, 2) tempura prepared fig with winter melon and 3)steaming hot green pea soup.  Then, we went through a piece by piece presentation of several different type of nigiri sushi that I can't even remember....marinated tuna, toro, mackerel, sardine, butterfish, a salmon trio, Isaki, taco (which I didn't partake of)...and many more...In addition, he gave us a wasabi roll (fresh wasabi) to cleanse our palate and sinuses!!!  We finished off dinner with strawberry sorbet with spicy raspberry/strawberry sauce. We also partook of 2 bottles of SAKE!

What I appreciate about my experience is that the FISH was showcased.  It wasn't about the crazy, modern style rolls or overpowering the fish with wasabi or rice.  The portion size of the nigiri roll is not meant to be more than bite size.  In my opinion, the fish should speak louder than the surrounding.  It should be the star of the show.  In the case of the sushi at Hiro's, the fish is an A-LIST celebrity and nothing less.

I can honestly say that this is the BEST sushi that I've had in North America so far (including NYC, Seattle, SF...) and I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit to Toronto because of my experience here.

As for specifics...it isn't cheap, but not expensive for the quality of service and food that you get.  4 people, ordering omikase, 2 bottles of sake = $400+, not inlcuding tip."}
{"text":"Some good dishes but overall not a fabulous experience. Very expensive but not worthing it.

Ordered 2 things from the menu and waitress came 15 minutes later to tell us they were out of it... the place was empty, so there is no way someone else ordered it before... we should have been told before, when ordering at least... ok....

Chef's sushi plate was disappointing. 8 different sushis (some with already dried fish) and 2 rows of the same small maki rolls (maki is NOT sushi!). No wasabi on the plate and very little amount of sliced ginger.

Had to ask twice  to get my ordered sake. green tea is too bland and not hot enough.

Mackerel salad was pretty good (I should have eaten only that, but twice, even though it is written that it is for two persons on the menu!).

May try it again, but only if invited... otherwise I will continue to try other sushi places  (I also have been to Tokyo and Gari sushi in NYC, so please stop writing that this place looks or is as good!)"}
{"text":"The most authentic sushi. Outside of japan ..especially in canada.
The diffefence mr yoshida takes his  the time to pick his own fish at local fish mongers across the GTO unlike 99% of sushi ch3fs and. Fake  establishments in tofonto.it may not be fish flown in the nexf day after placing a fish order to a fish bfoker..thedefore its his expertise in choosing the best lical fish he can find and pfepare it susch a away a true sushi master ican ..it is what stands him alone from the others ....in toronto..his rice is delicate and the quality of fish is superb....a true experience..."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you want to order 10 slivers of fish for $30, and then go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"As the debut of Yelp.ca coincides with a business dinner at my favorite neighborhood sushi shop, I have to oblige. (This has nothing to do with your repeated orders LW)

Right in the St. Lawrence market area, any local sushi lovers should feel lucky to have Hiro around.

Let's get a few things straight. You go to Hiro to have great sushi (or sashimi), sample the authentic Japanese app specials of the day, and sip quality sake. You will not sake bomb, you will not feel like you're in a swanky lounge, and you will not order multicoloured rolls inspired by the latest trend. If you're looking for yet another trendy Japanese fusion place you're probably better off at say, Blowfish on King West. However, if you're in the mood for a fairly traditional Japanese experience and fresh fish in an understated yet comfortable environment you'll be hard pressed to find better in downtown Toronto as evidenced by Hiro's patrons.

The fish is always fresh so keep an eye out for specials of the day. Hiro prepares his sushi with generous amounts of his freshly prepared wasabi and suggests that you don't add any more to his specially seasoned soy sauce. Trust me, unless your taste buds are defective you will not need it. The sushi has a noticeable but pleasant kick to it so if this doesn't sit well with you make sure to let them know when you order and they'll happily leave it out.

Best way to enjoy it: Go sit at Hiro's sushi bar with a friend, order a few of the appetizers from the day's specials, and then go for omakase sushi, letting Hiro serve you his best. You'll probably pay close to $50-60 for your food plus drinks."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to begin. The food was so good that there are no ways to emphasize it's greatness. 
Let's start with the very few negatives, which didn't ruin my rating for this place. I basically left the restaurant with an empty wallet and in search for a cheap place to grab something else to eat, since this omakase experience did not completely fill me up.
But now to the actual omakase 'experience':
We entered in to find the cutest little japanese restaurant, which was both cozy but well laid out, making it look upscale but not too pretentious. 
We opted for the most expensive thing in the menu, which was the 5 course omakase dinner.
The server was a very friendly and well trained lady who kept refilling our glasses of water and smiling throughout. Since omakase involves Hiro (the chef) to personally make each sushi there and then, each course would arrive one by one, and therefore the dinner lasted a good 2 hours.
The first course was miso soup, and honestly, I have never tried miso soup that good my entire life! It was literally creamy. I could have drank a whole gallon of that stuff! 
I have posted pictures of most of the courses I got, which were all spectacular. I would like to specially highlight the butterfish sushi...it actually melted in my mouth!
Hiro was there quietly making sushi right in front of you with full concentration and passion, which definitely shows in his, what I would call, 'art'.
I'm not a sort of person that's willing to spend more than $100 on a meal, but ever since this experience, I have chosen to eat at Hiro sushi at least once a year. It was definitely worth it. But, like I said, I did have to go home and munch on some more food after."}
{"text":"I consider this to be one of the best places to go for sushi in the city. Yes, it's expensive but it is definitely worth it. I highly recommend ordering omakase style - leaving the choice of dishes up to the chef, including the amount of wasabi - although those less daring can order off the menu. Highly recommended is the striped salmon sashimi nigirizushi, but most of the dishes here are fantastic. Even the soy sauce is made from scratch."}
{"text":"Cool. Great ambience... light jazzy music, and what seems like a small following. The service is very slow, which forces you to slow down and enjoy, removed from the fast pace city life. Also, because there was only one waitress.

They have great lunch prices and easily above average and authentic. I wish I payed more attention, but they have a handwritten appetizer menu. The last one on the list the day I visited was I believe a roasted persimmon, and was wow. Simply amazing. Add to that the ambience and its a gem."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi is probably the best in Toronto. Ichiro Suzuki of new York Yankees visits whenever he is i  town. 
The food is amazing but it is not cheap. Highly recommended is the Chef selection. Let Hiro San feed you until you are full. It is worth it. He smokes his own salmon. He does his own marinated shitake mushrooms and preserved plums. All the best ingredients. The sake selection is large. Of course I notice the better you know Hiro San the better the selection (not that he skims if you are a stranger  but he tailors to your tastes). 

It is the only place where I had grilled blue fin tuna on the cheekbone. It was from a large tuna and it fed 12. Also only place I have had lobster sashimi in Toronto. 

Great place to be :)"}
