{"text":"I have been here a few times since it opened and Homestand has since been in steady decline. If you're just coming to watch the game, then it is probably one of the better venues on this stretch of Bloor. However, if you're more interested in food and drink, I would skip this place. When it first opened, all menu items were $10 or less, which made the food a real draw. Unfortunately, their best menu item--homemade Italian sausage on a bun--didn't stay on the menu and prices have taken a sharp rise. The quality of the food has also declined. They advertise that the menu was created by \"a Cordon Bleu executive chef\", but that doesn't matter if you can't deliver on the quality of your product. I recently had both the beef sliders and the chicken sliders. The draw is the milk buns, which should be soft and chewy, but they were dry and stale. The pulled beef was tasty, but there was barely a teaspoon of it on the slider. The fried chicken was over cooked, which made it tough and chewy (and overcooked batter is never tasty). The pickle slices are too big and become the dominating flavour. Last, this is one of those bars that serves 16 oz pints at 20 oz prices. I enjoyed my beer, but with all the neighborhood joints serving proper pints, why would you want to drink here? In sum, Homestand started out with the best intentions but can't execute or deliver. I wouldn't even consider it as a backup option when Tall Boys is full."}
{"text":"This place caught my eye with their $10 or less food menu. Although technically a sports bar, I did not find the atmosphere un-inviting for a non-sports fan like myself. Nice vibe in the place, and not too loud. Their menu had a lot of options, although nothing much to offer for vegans, vegetarians etc. So just a heads-up about that. Great selection of beer though, all at a decent price.  I had the fish tacos and they were fucking delicious. For 8 bucks it was a total steal. My partner had the ribs and loved them. He's a pretty hard guy to impress with ribs, but he said that they were great.   Overall, good little spot. Worth going to if you want a low-key place to grab a beer with friends and split some food."}
{"text":"I got the ribs and they were dry and tasted like they have been in a freezer for way too long. The server was rude and didn't even think of giving me a fork to eat the coleslaw. I've been here once before and it wasn't much better. I ordered the chicken sliders and only ate two out of three before I left in disgust."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner and a few drinks. Great selection of beer on tap and in tall cans (awesome drink specials). Got to try the BBQ Bourbon ribs they were delicious!! My vegan friend also had an order of tofu tacos and fries and said they were amazing. Great atmosphere, food and service. Highly recommend anyone who's in the area to give it a try!"}
