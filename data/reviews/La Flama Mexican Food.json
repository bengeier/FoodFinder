{"text":"The food was average but the service was poor.  The server was not friendly at all and it was clear she didn't care. There were not very many people here and I would guess it's because of the service. Beans and salsa were good.  $1 charge of you use a credit or debit card."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pork Verde in green sauce. Half of the pork was cold. Also beware of this merchant. This merchant charges a $1 service charge to use  your credit card which is a violation of their merchant agreement with Visa. The food here is horrible. Never will I go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good but customer service is sometimes bad. You seat yourself and they always have little kids running around in the lobby. Today it was a lady at the counter showing pics on her phone to 2 of the workers and completely ignoring my presence until i walked to the counter to order my food. They employes are nice there customer service is just horrible. They would get a negative star if there tacos were not so good"}
{"text":"If you don't have time to sit and eat at there leaning tables and eat then it's not even worth it.  I use to eat here often for lunch but after I got the food to go and my order was wrong the cashier argued with me. At first I would have been willing to repay but before I could even tell her that she immediately got defensive and yelled at me over the phone we hung up with the agreement that I would come back later that  day to get my order remade properly. She was told that I was sent out of town for the day and texted me later that \" oh yeah by the way we need you to bring the order back for your new one it's policy\" I was not going to leave food in my car to bake in the sun and go bad. That cashier never smiles and always makes me feel like I'm hassling her to do her job which she's paid to do anyways. I'm still mad that I didn't get to eat anything but dinner that day."}
{"text":"Ok well I'm from out of town! This food hit the spot! Pozole great tacos Delish!! Coffee self make!! It was good come by shrimp looks amazing !!"}
{"text":"I strolled in early afternoon, in luck I was the only one there except for an occasional takeout customer.

Looking over the bilingual menu I knew I had found some authentic Mexican food. Surely not like Taco Bell or Chili's, who are about as far from Mexico as some politicians embracing immigrants...

When the waitress took my drink order, she was a bit confused at me asking what the difference was between the Mexicano and Americano versions of their Michelada, though was kind enough to point out the menu clearly detailed each and their respective beer choices. Mexican brews for the Mexicano, American lagers/pilsners for the Americano. 

\"Ah, the Cerveza?\" I mused in Spanglish, laughing.

\"Y Comida?\" She replied.

I ordered the chimichanga with beef. She asked if I wanted red or green salsa, I said Rojo. 

Though my Spanish is a bit out of practice, the lovely waitresses seemed to admire my efforts and continued to speak to me in Spanish the rest of my visit. 

In awhile it came out, freshly done with fluffy Spanish rice and refried beans. Never mind the calories, this is the real deal. I can tell they dumbed down the taste for my gringo palette, though grabbed the hot sauce and salsa from my chips to kick it back up a few notches. Did the waitresses just smile, or was it something amusing on the TV? I like to think it was me.

Afterwards, the eldest of the three, who I am guessing is the mother and owner, came out to greet me, and seeing me enjoying myself had an approving nod and went back to the kitchen.

The beef was cubed and baked in a sauté, old school style. Wow, not your usual beef by any sort. There was carefully sliced avocado (not guac dip), the chimis were just the right amount of crispy texture.

Not omg the best ever meal, but good. Comfort food can be like that, it hit the spot.

The waitress in red came again by to check on me \"¿todo bien?\" - oh yes, it was all good. I was licking my glass and stirring up the tamarindo and spice rock which I was sure was melting away in the bottom as I kept tasting it.

I took my time and finished up my meal. \"La cuenta, port favor\" I asked as I went up to pay, admitting my Spanish was not so good.

She said something pleasant to me about practicing and rattled off other stuff I am not sure what it was, probably along the lines of \"thank you, come again\"  but who knows!

Prices may be a bit more than you'd expect for some things, but then this corner location in the southern half of Desert Sky mall must come at a premium. 

I will return, surely. I left there satisfied. There was a $1 surcharge for using debit but oh well, next time cash.

For a local, family run little hole in the wall place, they've done well by me. 

I hear they do breakfast, have a great seafood menu, and serve up traditional agua frescas as well. Nice."}
{"text":"Good Local mexican restaurant.
The food was good, a little hot but ok.
The service can be better I means more friendly. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a great little find! The food was fresh, the flavors were complex and the service was enjoyable!
The chips and salsa were homemade. Their prices were fair and I would come back without hesitation! The service was excellent and friendly!"}
{"text":"Okay, we visited this place on 5/21/15 around 10:30am. The interior was okay, our table was lopsided, but we sat there because of its location. 
The young lady who was our server was sitting in a booth with her significant other, she got up to bring us a menu, I ordered water and my sister in law ordered a coffee. She was brought a cup of hot water and instant coffee; price $1.95. that was a bummer. 
The complimentary chips and salsa was very good. 

The waitress took our order and went back to the male in the booth and stayed there until our food was ready and then served us. 

I ordered the green chile chicken chilaquiles plate and my sis in law ordered the red chile chilaquiles plate. The food was good and the chile was spicy.  

Our server never came back to ask if we needed anything until we were finished. Then we waited another 10 minutes to get our check. 

We were there about 45-60 minutes and there never wasn't more than 2 tables occupied besides the significant other of the waitress, but the service sucked! I was disappointed, especially considering the price versus the service and food. I will not return.

I give the food = 3.5 stars, cleanliness= 3 stars, atmosphere = 3 stars, service= 1 star."}
{"text":"I ordered the camarones rancheros and they were delicious as usual. If you like authentic Mexican food, this is placed to come with your family. Or for a quick lunch. The atmosphere and the service is very laidback just like if you were in Mexico City. I'm pretty sure is family owned small business and one of the reasons I keep on coming back. Do you want fresh food come here. Do you want fast food go somewhere else:)"}
{"text":"WOW! The food here is AMAZING!!! I have been here a few times for lunch and every time I go I try something new everything is delicious so far I've tried the Costillas en salsa Verde (ribs in green salsa) OMG to die for! If you are thinking of something on the lighter side try the shrimp tacos with a side of guacamole! The service is great they were very friendly & welcoming I felt like I was with family. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is great!! Good and friendly service. I have dinner there at least twice a week have tried everything there but my favorite is El Cocido."}
{"text":"Worst burrito of my life!  Some friends took me to La Flama last week and I was enthused based on their endorsement.

The complimentary chips and salsa were good but the entrée, a grilled chicken burrito, was horrible.  I was expecting fresh grilled chicken and instead it was filled with tough, stale, cubed chicken that tasted like it had been either pulled out of freezer or sitting around way to long.

Absolutely the worst burrito ever.  I forced myself to eat about 1/3 of it as I did not want my friends to know that it was awful, as they had taken me here as a treat.

Service was OK - barely average.

Will never go back."}
{"text":"Let's see....didn't ask if we wanted more chips or water, wife's order was wrong, chips and taco shells were stale, the salsa was cheap and out of the can, the carne asada was grey, the food had no salt or other flavoring, and my dish, which said two enchiladas on the menu, came out with one. And when I asked about it, the waitress told me it only said one enchilada. Had to ask for a menu to show her it was wrong. Also, they forgot my guacamole. How is Mexican this bad possible in Phoenix, AZ?"}
