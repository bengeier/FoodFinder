{"text":"The service was terrible, the food was mediocre, and they pulled a fast one with the pricing. I went here with my wife, and we had to ask for water three times before any was brought to us. Our \"first round\" of food - a conservative amount - took a full 90 minutes to all arrive (actually some items never even came). The sashimi was tough and chewy, and the waitress was rude. She banged the plates down and was very rushed and dismissive. To top things off, there are no prices advertised anywhere in the restaurant for the AYCE menu, so we were going based off the pricing on their website, but in they end they charged even more than their already steep (for AYCE sushi) price. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Durham. After years of going here, we have learned the best times where we have actually been the ONLY people eating and we are leaving as the rush comes. BEST SPICY WHITE TUNA! We eat so much that eventually we get cut off of the white tuna, but we have no issues with that. It is usually full and sometimes they miss items you asked for, but we just ask for it and the waitress will bring it out asap. There has even been times where we couldn't finish everything and there is no problem. Sometimes my friends get me to go to a chain and I always regret it!"}
{"text":"Pros - good location (not many sushi places in the durham area), small and good food, reasonable prices. Typical menu of what you would see for all you can see places. Has free wi-fi.   Cons - due to the small size, can get backed up quickly on weekends and special holidays (long wait to get a table over Easter). A bit understaffed (only 1 waitress for all the tables means slower order times). Small parking lot, but siffices."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious. Ingredients were fresh.  Service was great. Only one server but she handled the lunch crowd quickly & efficiently. We got everything that we ordered unlike the chain restaurants.  I would definitely come back here & recommend"}
{"text":"VERY tasty, definitely my favourite all you can eat sushi restaurant yet! As a vegetarian there are plenty of options, and the sushi is quite fresh and delicious. All of my fish-eating friends who I have brought here have also found this place to be great, and so I'm assuming that the fish is just as fresh! I find that the price is also very reasonable, even slightly cheaper than other AYCE sushi places.   The waiters have always been friendly to me and service has been quite excellent. The only issue I have is that they have forgotten the occasional food item (but they are much better at remembering orders than any other AYCE place I've been to), and often I'm glad that they forgot because I've ordered too much anyway! (and they can always make it for you if you do still want it). The food is served at a reasonable pace, usually with appetizers first (as one would expect).  Be sure to make a reservation if you go on the weekend because it gets really busy! My only complaint about this place is that it's small and you can often hear other people's conversations (and if there's a big group they can get annoying!).  Don't let the sketchy location next to the adult video store deter you! It's a wonderful place, and you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday afternoon, wasn't very busy and the service was fast. The place itself is very small and like others said, you can hear everyones conversations. The location, near a naughty adult vid store, is tres sketch and the outside doesn't look inviting. Thank god we did judge this book by its cover!  The food was lovely. We got philidelphia rolls ( yummie) and red dragon rolls which were delish. The seaweed salad and miso were great too. The pork cutlet, gyoza, spring rolls and tempura shrimp, sweet potato and broccoli ( one of my fave tempuras) was excellent. The surprising standout dish for me was the beef curry rice. Although it looked like a dirty diaper had exploded on my plate ( haha) it was amazingly yummie!! The beef short ribs are exceptional too, served super hot and obv marinated in a sexual sauce, yum!!!! The chicken udon was the worst item we ordered, was a big portion and the chicken bits were dark, fatty, cartiliagy meat. I'm always stickin to beef frm now on.  Def worth a visit! There were a few people eating threre alone, which is so weird but def speaks to how good the food is.And good value for the price you pay :)"}
{"text":"Really great sushi place. Spicy salmon sushi rolls are the bomb here. Also the Japanese curry beef with rice is amazing. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food has always been fresh and tasty. However, I prefer take out as my experience eating in there was not the best service-wise. I find their menus to be a bit small. They also do not have many vegetarian roll options, and when we did order a veggie roll, they screwed up and added mushrooms I to the roll when it was not specified on the menu. Bit of a let down as we did not like mushrooms. They also had a discount advertised on their website if you pay in cash and when we got there they did not give us he discount. Otherwise, this is my go-to local sushi place when I don't want AYCE and don't want to spend to much, but still want decent sushi better than grocery store quality. You get a fair amount of food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Been many times. Great quality and service. One of the hardest working servers I have ever seen. Small place, nothing fancy, but that's its charm. Will be back again and again. Great sushi and kitchen dishes good too. Take-out excellent as well."}
{"text":"Best sushi place I have been to. Service is very quick and staff are friendly. Reasonably priced for all you can eat."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  (I'm not even being dramatic)   I have gone to Sushi T & T for years and after my last experience, I will never set foot in that place again. This is unfortunate because the sushi is relatively good and close to my house.   When I arrived the waitress who usually wears a frown was in an even worse mood. She reached over us, yelled at us to move the sushi onto one plate so she could clear that table, and told us we had to be out of our table in a half an hour even though that was never stated anywhere. She was extremely abrasive and made us feel dumb for asking her questions. I gave her a small tip because I was not satisfied. When I was leaving she yelled across the counter \"you leave me a bad tip? next time you can get your own dishes\".  It was mortifying.   I give it two stars because the sushi is good, but only go if you are prepared to be treated like a 5-year-old."}
{"text":"We drove by and thought it was sketchy .. it looks a bit run down from the outside, beside an adult video store, etc.  We knew that dinner was $24.99 AYCE on a weekend since we saw it on the website, but well worth the price! Great selection on the menu and really tasty.  It gets really crowded on weekends in seems, sine they can only seat about 40 people and the door just kept opening.  There was only one waitress, but she was incredible .. running around to every table, doing takeout orders and cash all with a smile on her face.  Our new sushi spot in Ajax."}
{"text":"rolls have too much rice... all you can eat rice... fish aren't fresh... service isn't great... little expensive... decor is ugly at best... won't go again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Good sushi quick service the waitress isn't the most friendly but that's not what you're there for. always seems to be clean. A bit cramped  when they get busy. Parking behind the building but not a lot"}
{"text":"This place is a scam! The restaurant didn't advertise their price. The only place we could find a price was on their takeout menu - it reads $19.99 per person for dinner. When we got out bill, we were charged $24.99 per person for dinner.  Horrible service as well! The waitress frowns and raise her tone when she talks to you, as if you were stupid.  Missing soy sauce and wasabi. They didn't bring it until we've asked.   There were not enough plates; we had to take the one from the table beside ours.  Would never recommend!"}
{"text":"Below average - average sushi restaurant from my experiences. I'm actually never going back to eat there again. The staff makes the experience very poor & undesirable. The prices are higher than a lot of other places for some reason too. I definitely would not recommend this place to anybody. You constantly need to tell/remind your waiter/waitress of food/drink that you haven't received. As I stated previously, the waiters/waitresses there are rude and unpleasant to deal with. As for food quality: depending on what you order, you will get some decent food. But overall the quality of food is poor."}
{"text":"Hubs and I tend to have regular spots for sushi in certain areas in Toronto...we never had one in Ajax until now. Of all the sushi places I've tried in our hood this place is the most memorable for yum. The items we ordered were fresh and tasty. It's one of the few places where I found the tuna to satisfy my craving. A tad pricey for AYCE compared to others I've been, but if I want my sushi fix I will go here. My fave is the spicy salmon roll. Even their kitchen menu is pretty good too. This is the first AYCE sushi restaurant I've been to that has not 'forgotten' an order that I can remember. The last few times I've been to others there have been at least one menu item that never ad it to our table.    If ambience and modern restaurant decor is your thing don't come here. But if you want good sushi that's not in Toronto I recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time having all you can eat lunch with my wife there.  Very good food and service.  Price is right too.  We sure will go back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie maki combo for take out. Prompt service. Very tasty and good portion. Comes with soup and salad. Very filling."}
{"text":"Seeing how good the reviews are, we've decided to give this place a try. We've ordered party tray. Worst decision ever. This place is not even comparable to an average Japanese restaurants in GTA.  Fish was not fresh and had no texture. Portions were small (ordered a 3 people party tray for 2 of us and we were still hungry by the end of it). What made it worse - FOOD POISONING! I'm very surprised how great reviews are for this place - price was average, food was bad, portion was small. Will I come back? That's definitely a no."}
{"text":"Still excellent, and my go-to spot in Durham to satisfy a sushi craving. Sushi was prepared very well, the rice was soft and still warm, the nori was crispy and seasoned, and the fish was cut to just the right size.  Been coming here since 2009, and always remember to be courteous to the ONE lady working all the tables."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place -- as good as anything in Toronto, if not better. As others have already pointed out, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food is excellent -- and reasonably priced. The gyoza were fantastic and so was the tempura in the bento box. Highly recommended if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food is great but the waitress killed it for me and my guests. I've been there a few times this last visit was my last. I couldn't take how rude she was. It's always the same waitress. She gave us a piece paper to write our orders didn't even ask us what we would like to order. We did a la carte. Didn't get drinks or water until we were half way done. If something was missing we had to go to the front and ask.  Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok but terrible customer service! I went there for the all you can eat sushi and when my friend and I placed the order, the waitress started crossing off some of our orders from the paper saying that we ordered  too much ( believe me we h Didnt), but  I agreed with her just because I wasnt in the mood of arguing to this rudeness and wanted to enjoy my lunch peacefully, but to make things worse, they apparently crossed off more of our order since we never got some dishes. I asked the waitress whether this is an all you can eat sushi place because It was unbelievable how she examined our orders and constantly told us to cross things off, she acted like she didnt understand english and laughed. I never ever leave food uneaten and I know exactly the amount that I am able to eat.. Plus they have a note on the menu That states that  they do charge for left overs, so why would you treat your customers like babies and cross off their orders if you are already going to charge them with leftovers( which is totally fare) ! Never ever coming back.."}
{"text":"what a pleasant surprise! Let's just get straight to it, this place has really good sushi. You mean to tell me i don't have to drive to Markham for my sushi?!? For now anyway! None of that defrosted from frozen sh!t. Like melts in your mouth quality. Give me your speciality rolls and I'll tell you how good your sushi is. And their T&T roll is gooood! We came for the a la cart but there's ayce here too. Good to know cause if you're teasing me with good quality rolls then ya know I'm coming back for your AYCE!"}
{"text":"The place looks creepy from the outside but actually the inside is cozy and very clean. The food is delis. have no complaints whatsoever, server is friendly. Glad I took a chance and tried this lovely sushi Bar."}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of sushi. T and T is definitely tops. Not a fancy establishment but wait staff is fast, courteous and accurate. Well priced and tasty. We go at least twice a month."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever eaten in Toronto!!! The fish and rolls are not fresh and they won't give you all your orders! Lunch is$19.99 and dinner is $29.99!!!! Trust me you can have much better food in otherToronto sushi restaurant!! Worst service ever!!! The chef was so rude to us because we were complaining they didn't give us all our orders!! I want to give them 0 star if I could! Please check yelp before you go to this restaurant! So many fake reviews!! If you can, don't go there!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to. Still haven't found a better sushi place than this. Highly recommend the dynamite rolls ;)"}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the server that took care of the whole restaurant on her own. We had reservations for a large group on a Friday night. They were busy without us being there, but she took care of everything. She kept full bottles of water on the tables, removed empty plates and brought us our many plates of food. She was constantly communicating with the sushi chefs being the counter, walking at the speed of light and even answering the phone. I was absolutely floored at the level of service 1 person could provide to so many people.  We were all impressed!"}
{"text":"The service and quality here was excellent. Very fresh fish, food came quickly, and tasted delicious. Spicy Salmon Roll was my favorite."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, just okay. Based on the reviews that this place gets, I was expecting it to be a little better than Makimono just down the street (which, sadly,  doesn't say much for Ajax sushi) but was very very disappointed. They use waaaaaaaay too much mayo in their sushi rolls to the point that that's all I can taste. Sorry, guys. Definitely not worth going here."}
{"text":"Definitely a good choice for all you can eat.   I wouldn't say they have a crazy variety of things to choose from, however their food is always extremely fresh.   Best AYCE for Pickering out of all the other Sushi places.   Squash tempura is deliciously crunchy and fresh, the service is very fast and efficient. They always give you everything you order.   Smaller place so you may have to wait around for a table unless you do a reservation."}
{"text":"From the outside, it looks like a bait and tackle shop in a dilapidated town.  Thank goodness for Yelp as seeing is believing so as my bestie and I drove  behind the resto to park we were encouraged by the nice cars that were parked.  We arrived during AYCE lunch for $14.99.  I must say that the quality is quite good.  The service is prompt.  The furnishings are definitely a bit run down and the ladies room left a lot to be desired.  (Watch out for the gap in the floor when you step in:p)  However, the experience was cheap, delicious and cheerful.  The highlights were the shrimp and okra tempura, salmon sushi, dynamite roll, deep fried scallops and shrimp skewers.  They were all fresh tasting and textbook good.  The tempura was quite exceptional and is up to par with the best ones that I have had.  Light, airy and flavourful batter.  The misses were the chicken kaarage (too dry) and spider roll (where's the soft shell crab?).    Notwithstanding the misses for the value I would definitely come back to this place if I am ever back in the area.  I could just imagine that the a la carte menu would be just as good."}
{"text":"This place really should get 2 stars for the grocercy level sushi and sashimi they serve but i will give them an extra star since sushi options are not readily available in Ajax and FOR ajax it is the one eyed man in the land of the blind for uncultivated amateurs new to Sushi...if youve been to Japan or Vancouver or even know the various different quality offerings in the GTA from Japanese, Korean and Chinese sushi chefs, then beware:  this is not the place for cultured palates that know quality sushi.   Someone summed it up perfectly:  these Chinese people serve grocery, prepackaged sushi you can buy at any Asian market store.   My problem comes from the gross misrepresentation of its business as an authentic japanese sushi joint. The website states the head chef trained in Japan under japanese masters...I've been to Japan and this business is lying. There's no way anyone who trained under a japanese sushi chef for 10 years would serve this level of disrespectful sushi. I hate to say it but this level of sushi can only be categorized as \"Chinese sushi\".  To those who don't know it is not a part of mainstream Chinese culture to eat raw fish.  They are all about the frying and the steaming.  Culturally japanese and koreans have raw fish as a part of their diet. Both these cultures know about eating raw fish.  However the concept of sushi and sashimi is uniquely japanese.    That is why an authentic japanese restaurants with a japanese trained sushi chef will always be more expensive than one headed by a korean. The chinese ones are usually considered the bottom of the barrel and usually offers all you can eat sushi to bring in the customers (as do a few korean places that dont care for standards).  This place is a third level Chinese establishment. Don't be fooled.  If you are ok with that...feed your self silly.  As long as you know and you are informed the decision is yours. Be happy."}
{"text":"Ordered again here food is great but they screwed up my order and it was really expensive .im pretty sure they ripped me off. Wont go back"}
{"text":"If you like cooked rolls this place is ok. The price is reasonable and compared to what else is in ajax its descent.  However if you are looking for sashimi or anything other than salmon. This place will not satisfy your craving.  If you want a few  rolls, seaweed salad. And some tempura and enjoy dipping your food in sauces you will like the food.   Service was friendly and fast. The ambience is not one you want if you are trying to press someone."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new sushi spot in Pickering/Ajax after moving into the area. Came across Sushi T&T. The place is small, and outdated but the food was good! I'm not too picky when it comes to sushi because I do not eat sashimi. I like the cooked sushi rolls - egg, shrimp, tempura rolls, all satisfied my sushi craving. The service was pretty fast, even though they were full. Will return."}
{"text":"Sushi that was worth the drive from Brooklin to Ajax.  Tried this place for the first time last night with my wife, and daughter.  Don't be turned off my the lackluster appearance of the buildings exterior.  The interior if quaint, clean, and fresh.  Service was fast and friendly. Price was a little higher than some of the All you can eat places in Oshawa, Whitby but the quality and freshness was far superior. It was $24.99/adult, and $14.99 for our 7 year old (but she eats well, and loves sashimi). However everything we ordered was extremely fresh tasting, and ingredients were excellent. We will definitely return and make this drive, as other restaurants closer to us have started to disappoint recently. I'd give Sushi T&T a 4.5/5 stars, and my family will most definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place after careful consideration... Mostly because it seems really sketchy in terms of location (right next to a porn shop). Read the reviews and they all seemed pretty good. Good is good and fresh. There grilled menu items are fantastic! Sushi serving sizes were more in line with what they do in Japan where there is less rice and it's about the sashimi on top. But the selection is not large and is fairly limited. The other thing that really bothered us was the server.... If you have a couple items left on a plate and she's dropping of more food she hovers and waits... And if you don't acknowledge her, she tells you to eat those items so she can clear that empty plate. It's very odd and off putting. For the quality and selection of food, it is overpriced. You would get way more for your dollar in Markham."}
{"text":"Food was okay.. gave it 5 stars in the past but have had to change my review  The kamikaze barely came with any avocado... I had to pick around the rice.  Edamame was stale. My boyfriend found the spicy salmon pretty good though."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are superb - I've gone to TNT for dinner many times and my favourites are the dynamite, red dragon and black dragon rolls. I love fish roe on my sushi and this place layers it on. I like they don't over do it with the rice, that way there's always room for seconds (or thirds, fourths lol). The sashimi is also very fresh which I enjoy. I've done take out a few times too and their maki set C is a great deal. I definitely recommend this place. The servers are great and friendly and always remember  when we return."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Ajax hands down."}
{"text":"I've bee going to this place for years and the quality of sushi has always been top notch!  First off.... there is ONE Server for the entire place she works so hard to make sure everyone is being served on time. I personally love their handrolls ! Spicy salmon handrolls are my go to at this place!   Here is what I would typically order:  Spicy salmon rolls Spicy salmon hand rolls Cheese wonton Black pepper beef Salmon sashimi  Tuna sashimi  Spicy salmon sushi Dragon rolls  They are fairly priced when compared to other all you can eat sushi places in Pickering/Durham   Great service, well kept and clean!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good but as of lately they have been turning up the prices causing me to explore other options."}
{"text":"Although the food ws good, we were disturbed that the only washroom had no hot water for staff to wash their hands."}
{"text":"My experience at T&T Sushi is a 4.5 star.  I am so sorry I have to deduct half a star because of the \"a little bit\" outdated interior decor and \"can be better\" service.  However,  the small restaurant is kept clean with comfortable seating.   We were at Ajax on a Saturday and wondering where to have our dinner.  The Yelp app becomes very handy whenever I am so lost in looking for a place to eat.  T&T Sushi got very good reviews and we haven't had Japanese food for quite a while, we decided to try.  Glad we went there.  No regret.  We haven't had such good quality AYCA sushi rolls and tempuras for a long time.  The yum roll and the spicy tuna roll are both amazing.  The sashimi is fresh as well.  Green tea, pops and ice tea, various kinds of ice cream are all included in the AYCA menu.  Dinner at $24.99 each for adult on weekends is a fair price for real quality food.  The service was not too attentive but I would not blame as the place was quite busy and there was only one woman serving the whole place.  Once order was placed, the food, actually, came fast.  The ladies washroom was nothing fancy but kept very clean and tidy.  Heard that the men's room was a little small though lol.  It is worth going back again for sure!  Next time, I'll try the lunch."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to tnt . And both times i had a good experience. The food  was delicious, i do recommend the kamikaze rolls and the bbq mackerel.also the spicy tuna had some kick to it. I dont really have anything negative to say. The place it self seems outdated but thats what makes it one of those hidden gems in ajax . This is my new go to spot when iam in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Ajax.  I mostly go to Toronto for good sushi but when lazy, this place does the job.  great take out service.  skip the all you can eat and go for the a la carte menu."}
{"text":"Sushi is delicious. Location and parking could be better and would prefer an iPad for ordering service (I am not a sushi guru so I would like photos and descriptions)."}
{"text":"So I'd read some reviews and we happened to be in the area so thought we'd stop in. The outside looked promising (I actually thought it might be run by Japanese people, so got excited). Sadly, it wasn't to be. It was busy and loud. Small place but clean. The service was fine. The bathroom walls sadly need a fresh coat of bright paint - the restaurant decor is fine but when you walk into the women's washroom, you feel like you've entered into some other grimy business. As far as food - the scallops were what you'd find in most average Japanese restaurants downtown, the tempura was hot and fresh, so that was nice. Nothing was terrible, just not really any different from what a larger (and cheaper $15.99 for lunch with no sashimi? Really?) place would offer. I wish half stars were an option so I could give this place 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was extremely poor. We came here as friends recommended, we order the party sashimi and sushi platter. The rolls and sashimi was fresh and good. However the lady gave us such poor service. We won't go back there again."}
{"text":"From the reviews I read I assumed the price for dinner would be 18 but it was actually 19.99 ... but even still the place is worth it. a lot of places add a lot of rice to fill u up but this place has perfect proportion an for an all u can eat place the sushi (not the roll) has large pieces of fish that are well chilled and flavorful! the area is definitely weird and the place is small but those things don't matter after uve had their sushi!"}
{"text":"My friends and I are always looking for the best AYCE Sushi and this place is definitely and currently the best we have found. The locale isn't the most appealing but the sushi makes up for that. The dinner is a bit expensive but lunch is a lot cheaper (almost $10 less!). The service could also improve but to be honest we've still gone there many times after just for the amazing food."}
{"text":"I won't lie... When my fiance first pulled up to this place I thought, \"oh my.. This place looks so run down\". But you know that little thing about sketchy run down places - it usually has really good food. Luckily that rule applied to this place. Cute little place that could seat about 30 people.    We both got the \"Bento Box Lunch [Lunch Special] - Assorted Tempura (broccoli, eggplant, sweet potato, zucchini and shrimp) + 6 piece sushi roll (3 avocado + 3 salmon) + 2 piece cheese wonton + teriyaki salmon + rice + salad + miso soup. Overall, all the dishes were alright. Everything was cook well and seasoned well. The salmon was a still moist and not overcooked. The cream cheese wonton was a little cold though, it also tasted like cherry cheesecake.. not complaining about that though - just didn't expect it to taste like dessert.  Service was good, considering that it was a full house and only one waitresss was running tables.  Will most likely come back in the future :)  Also they take credit + debit and there's extra parking in the back (gravel parking lot)."}
{"text":"They have renovated! So much better! Much more spacious and nice new tables and chairs and booths!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food during their dinner AYCE buffet!  I didnt give them 5 stars just because my brother and I felt some tension when we ordered a second round of food (we are fat)."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place and for a couple of weeks, I was scared to try it.  It looks really sketchy on the outside... especially because it's beside an adult video store.    AYCE Lunch is like 11 bucks, and dinner is 18.  Pretty cheap.  Sushi eating as a vegetarian generally has less options, and this place didn't have many different vegetarian rolls.. or fancy vegetarian rolls like dragon rolls.  The veggie sushi that they did have was really good though.    Their sushi pizza is definitely the best sushi pizza I have ever had.  Most places I've been to have either had sushi pizza that was so greasy it was wet, or so soggy because of the sauces on top.  This one was perfect.  It had some sort of delicious marinated mushrooms on top which made it really yummy.  Another thing i like about this place is the way you can order tempura.  You can order it one piece at a time which is good for me since I don't usually want three pieces.    The service was also really good... We got seated fast (but be aware weekends is way busier) and had most of our food right away.  The servers are also very polite and kind.    The restaurant is really small.  That's probably the only downfall.  I went a couple weeks on a Sunday and it was so busy, and extremely loud because everyone is so.. close together.  If you like eating in peace I wouldn't suggest going on a weekend.    Overall, I think Sushi T & T rules... I just wish it was bigger.  AND THAT THEY HAD TERIYAKI TOFU ON THE AYCE LUNCH MENU!"}
{"text":"Small and quaint restaurant. Decor is simple. Food is super fresh and amazing quality. You can order al a carte or All You Can Eat option for either lunch or dinner. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"4.5 actually  This place looks mad sketchy from the outside, but I am pleased to say the food was pretty good.  For $19.99, you can get a serious eat on.  The sushi and sashimi were fresh.  Although there was only one woman serving all the tables, and the place was pretty busy though not completely full, she was very fast and totally efficient.  The beef with green onion rolls and the spicy salmon handrolls were my favourites.  The futo maki was the biggest let down, but it was still reasonable.  I don't do the all you can eat thing very often, but when I have at other places, there has always been an air of begrudging if you order a second or third round of anything.  Not so here.  Our super-solo-server seemed more than happy to keep the food coming.  The grand total for my dinner?  $28!  Pretty good considering how stuffed I was!"}
{"text":"This place use to be great! The last few times I've eaten here the fish either smelled or tasted terrible.  It's as if they stopped caring the last 4 months."}
{"text":"Never judge a book by its cover - this is my favourite sushi spot in Ajax. The sushi is always fresh and you have the option to choose from the menu or all you can eat. The green dragon roll is my personal fave minus the tobiko (fish eggs). Yeah its not the best looking place but you are not eating the furniture so who cares as long as its clean. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For being in such a sketchy plaza, their sushi is surprisingly good. The fish is nice and fresh, and the portions are large for the price you pay. Plus you get a 10% discount if you pay in cash. Sushi tnt is my go to place for quick take out lunch/dinners during my work break."}
{"text":"They used to be great but have gone downhill in the last year. There has been a serious decline (now just a tiny scrap) in how much seafood the put in their rolls, whomever is making the rolls does a terrible job as they are far too loose and they use way too much tempura to name a few things. They have now lost a weekly customer! I will give Makimono and Sushi Mountain a try."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Durham, place looks small and like a shack but sushi is on point. Durham now has a lot of sushi places to pick from but when it comes to all you can eat this restaurant is the best"}
