{"text":"Cheap drink at happy hour and a free appetizer just for mentioning the Yelp ad. Great place to wet the whistle."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for lunch, the menu is a weird mosh of Italian, Mexican and American food....it is almost like they can't figure out what kind of restaurant they want to be. 

I ordered the cheese enchiladas which was probably the wrong choice at a non-Mexican restaurant, but I just wasn't feeling anything else. The two people who were with me got their food, and I was still waiting, and waiting and waiting. Finally the waitress came over and asked if anyone had been here to talk to me...isn't that her job? She said that they gave my dish to someone else by accident, so they are making me a \"fresh\" plate. 

My enchiladas finally arrive, and look like they were just slopped on the plate. i take a bite and guess what? They were barely warm! You would think that a \"fresh\" plate would be served piping hot! I took a few bites, but by now I was over them and late for a meeting. 

A waitress that was different than ours brought over our check, which included my enchiladas. I told her what the problem was, but she didn't seem to speak English very well and said she would go ask someone. They did take them off the bill, but that really should have been done automatically since the other people at my table were done with their food before I even got mine! 

The decor is odd too, it is like they are trying to be a sports bar, but maybe aren't sure, evidenced by the 6 plasma TVs sitting in the corner still in their boxes! 

If I have a say in the matter....I won't be returning to Deemos."}
{"text":"This place is really not great. The fajitas are, to be generous, merely ok, and much of the fare is actually bad. but i go here weekly. b/c it is in my office building and the other option is quizno's. so, i would mainly recommend this if you work in my building and are too lazy to walk to quizno's. god, that's sort of a depressing thought..."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing a movie in the Esplanade.  Drinks are a lot more reasonably priced here than Merc or Morton's.  Happy hour was from 3pm to 7pm.  They have expanded since I had been there last.  Room in the back seemed decent.  Check it out the next time you are in the area."}
{"text":"* Deemos is where you end up when the Merc Bar throws one of your friends out for wearing a baseball cap.

* You didn't really want to go to Merc anyway, so maybe that was a blessing in disguise.

* Deemos appears as a standard sportsbar type place.

* Except this one evening, there happened to be karaoke.

* And a plethora of frat & sorority cheesemongers. 

* How do I know they're Greek and not just vapid & bleached blonde? They're all wearing their letters. Even though it's June and the school year's over.

* Nimrods.

* And since we're not on Mill or Scottsdale Road, WTF are these people doing here, anyway?

* Then I look at many of the guys and their baseball caps. 

* Maybe they all got booted out of Merc Bar, too. 

* Who knows.

* Anyway, karaoke. Bad singing. Bad drinking. Me cringing.

* I fail in persuading anyone to leave. I steer clear of the microphone.

* This goes one for two more hours and 5 more rounds of beer.

* I still manage to avoid the microphone.

* The Greeks have a giant overly enthusiastic and offkey group sing of \"Summer Nights.\" I die a slow, painful death on my barstool.

* That was last summer.

* More recently, I thought I'd see if anything was going on there after a movie at the AMC. 

* Nothing. One old guy leaning over his drink at the bar. That was it.

* Biff & Taffy must have a new hangout in the Camelback Corridor.

* And, uh, I walked out.

* The end."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the street tacos and the only place for a great pesto pizza with chicken. friendly staff and had a blast at happy hour with my friends"}
{"text":"We came in here to have a few drinks before going across the street for dinner. As soon as we sat down at the bar, the bartender (who couldn't speak English very well) comes over. I immediately ask her to relay the happy hour specials. $3.99 house wines, and $2 drafts. My companion has a budlight draft, I choose a house pino grigio. We ended up staying for two rounds. The bartender disapears and we ask the \"manager\" for the check. After he brings it over we notice that my wine was $10 a glass. After explaining to the \"manager\" that we came in here for the happy hour. He says he will go ask the \"owner\" in back. He comes back, shrugs his shoulders and says that there is nothing he can do. Meanwhile the bartender (who can settle this) is still nowhere to be found. I explain to him that I live very close by and usually come here to watch football on sundays, but sadly I will not be returning. He says \"Oh.... let me ask the owner again\" and walks back. At that point, I had enough. It wasn't about the money. I stood up, left money on the bar and walked out. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Absolutely Horrible! The food was not fresh, the service was lousy and staff were seriously drab. I haven't been here in the evening or on the Karaoke nights, but I can only imagine this dump going downhill. It's possible that a good crowd could change the atmosphere a bit, but I didn't experience that when I was there. If you are hungry move on.... if you want a beer stop in...."}
{"text":"There is nothing remotely interesting at Deemo's.  An obviously premade frozen hamburger, fries of the sort I can buy at Safeway, and prices that are higher than any one of my beloved restaurants where it's all fresh?  No thanks.

I ate lunch here today, as it's in my office complex.  The place itself is actually pretty cute and seems like it would be fun to grab a few beers after work, which is why I gave it the two stars.  But every other restaurant in the complex would have to close down before I'd pay $10 for anything on Deemo's menu again."}
{"text":"I met a friend here while we were waiting for out of towners who'd never been to the Merc, so we wanted an easy to find neutral location. 

Unfortunately our wait extended to a solid 45 minutes. The first 30 of which we suffered by sitting at the bar, where an amplifier seemingly directed straight at our heads churned our brains into mincemeat with bad karaoke. 

Actually most of the singers were not bad. But as it turns out, having \"not bad\" imitations of rock songs drilled into your skull at 3 billion decibels is still not fun. We eventually moved to the patio, where we could have a decent conversation. 

Our waitress was very friendly and prompt so I'll give them a second star for that. But bottom line: there is absolutely no reason, not one, I can think of for why you would voluntarily come here."}
{"text":"I really was expecting more for being at the Esplanade. I would think that they would have a minimum standard or something, right?

Well, I had the grilled tuna melt. It was okay, nothing to write home about. My friend had a ham(?) sandwich and the soup, which he told the waitress was good but I noticed he didn't finish half of it.

I guess this is more of a bar than a restaurant but the food was obviously a low priority, even though it was a little on the pricey side. None of the veggies in my sandwich were fresh; avocado was not even ripe. Fries sucked.

Although the place was about 80% full, the wait staff still seemed surprised and ambivalent to see us come in.

I should have listened to my friend when when walked by the Quizno's!"}
{"text":"Out of business, not surprising they have been going down hill for years."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. This place is a ghost town with less than bright servers."}
{"text":"This was one of the most hilarious and hardcore ab working nights I've had in a really really really long time!  
The bartender was awesome and kept the drinks coming...  Sorry, can't comment on the food.  
I'll go back, just for the people watching!"}
{"text":"I'm always perplexed when the staff knows nothing about their on-line specials. This time it was the Yelp ad. Luckily it was quickly resolved by the bartender this time which was refreshing. 

The place it's self is a pretty generic bar. I just had a few drinks along with the Crab Cakes which were actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Was on my way to see a movie, thinking I could get a casual quick bite to eat, I didn't realize there are so few places to choose from in this immediate area. 
I stopped in here and picked a seat at the bar. It was about 530p on a Friday and I was one of maybe 6 people there. The bartender handed me a happy hour menu and a regular and convinced me on getting one of her \"signature\" margaritas. 
Well I looked over the regular and the happy hour menu. Some items were only like 30 cents below the regular price and another item (Edamame) was $3.98 on the regular menu and $4 on the happy hour menu. I decided on a Shrimp Cocktail ($9something on the regular menu and $6 on the happy hour). 
While waiting on my shrimp, I was served up this \"signature\" margarita. The rim ooozing with a strange red concoction. It was weird,  I asked what it was the bartender said it was chile and claimed that it was the key to making the margarita so great. [Hummm...ok?!]  I was brave enough to sample, which turned out to be some strange chile lime slime instead of salt. Ok?! Just weird I used the lime at the rim of my glass to wipe off this ooze when the bartender wasn't looking...she seemed so proud of this mess she was calling signature. Not one to waste liquor I finished it. 
The shrimp cocktail arrived and looked promising 6 good sized shrimp, garnished nicely. The cocktail sauce was spicy with lots of horseradish, which I enjoyed. The avocado was a nice compliment not too much. The Shrimp....over cooked, tough....but I ate 'em. The crackers, provided while still individually wrapped still had a taste like they came out of my grandma's purse. I ate the 2 crackers in the packet,  left the rest there and chased it all with my \"signature\" margarita. *shiver*   
Safe to say given the options across the street and in the area I will not be headed back here if I have a choice."}
{"text":"this place is bit hard to find. It is worth it. The prices for food and drink are pretty good. A place that is more sports bar and has requesite drink and food specials. I'm giving this place an extra star for having sake, in a bottle, in the reachin. It can be warmed up and excellent price forsake bomb $7.50 = 2 or 3 bombs.
Karaoke on Saturday nights. I might have sung a Turtles song, but our group sang along with those standards - Bohemian Rhapsody. Cheers to the guy that did Dennis Leary's \"I'm an A$$hole.\" Yet, tell your friend. It was about yesterday(Sunday) and fumble for TD - Niners win."}
{"text":"Boo!  This bar does not have anything going for it.  The place is tiny, and the karaoke painful.  On a Saturday night, only one other party was present with my group of 10.  Yet, the two bartenders on duty still found it difficult to make sure everyone's needs were tended to.  The location is very hard to find as well; I wouldn't have made it without additional directions from a friend.   When I finally did arrive after my 45 minute drive at 10:00p.m., I found out that the kitchen was already closed.  Weak.  I will not return.  Oh!  Did I mention that I was charged for the soda I ordered at the bar?  Generally the soda is free of charge at most establishments, when you are with a group of drinkers."}
{"text":"Wow. 
This place sucks.
Honestly, don't waste your time. The food is overpriced. The service is awful. I hate the parking structure. It's just a mess. 
A hot mess.
How are they staying open?
My arnold palmer was $2.50. The tea was flavored and tasted really gross with lemonade.
We split the house salad which was obviously the prepackaged spring mix from Costco (or Sysco -- whatevs) 
Then we split a medium pesto, tomato, and basil pizza. The tomatoes were not ripe, the sauce was bland, and the pesto was non existent. And then the 30 pine nuts that were smashed into the cheese were overkill.
The crust was fair.
The server took my plate before I was finished and then set it back down after she realized my fork was in my mouth.
So for two teas, a house salad, and a medium pizza our tab was $22 
??? Costco Pizza would have been better.
Bleh."}
{"text":"I dunno. I can't really judge too much since I only got the vegetable soup, but that soup makes me quiver just thinking about it. 

I swear there were pickles in my soup. Not cucumbers, not zucchini.. but pickles (??) I understand a pickle is a vegetable but it was really weird tasting.

Ended up eating the little side salad and bread stick that came with my soup and salad.

I don't think I'll be back. I'm quick to judge this place, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Meh."}
