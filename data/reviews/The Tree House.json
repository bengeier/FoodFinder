{"text":"They opened in May but I just tried them this week. Wow. The root vegetable soup was AMAZING. Earthy comfort in a bowl. Even the picky eaters in the family loved it. My hubby said the buffalo chicken flat bread was better than any pizza around. 

My daughter has dietary issues so her \"milk\" is a complex recipe that they made with patience and enthusiasm! My daughter loved it so much, she insisted on going back the very next day. To our surprise, they had written down her \"recipe\". We were so touched.

So excited about a good food place/ cafe to relax in the area. Love the idea that they're gonna have curbside pick-up for hot entrees for those crazy days when dinner is what's in the freezer. They cook food from scratch without nasty chemicals, and that's a blessing. 

Very warm and welcoming staff, the owner seems wonderful. Oh, and the carrot cake pop is to die for, but don't tell my daughter I had it!"}

The food is delicious as well if you are looking for quite place to eat good soup and sandwiches."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times since they opened in May and I am never disappointed!! Vicky made my daughter's first birthday smash cake and cupcakes and they were to die for!! Strawberry cake with cream frosting, we got so many compliments on them. They were also adorable; pink cake and icing with tiny white chocolate tiaras. I can't not recommend going here enough. I promise you will love it. Excellent home made food and very friendly staff!!"}
