{"text":"The service was great. The staffs and Chef are so cool. I like the sashimi and their noodles. Personally, this is my fav for Japanese food with a very reasonable  price."}
{"text":"Always love the atmosphere and food at all the locations. The complaint I have is that we got squeezed into an area for 4 people yet I made a reso for 6. I even called ahead to confirm my reso and ask where we would be sitting (as it was a special occasion). For anyone needing more sitting room or comfort, this arrangement would have been very uncomfortable. Staff and food was great however being squeezed at the corner of a table took away from enjoyment of a place I would usually rate 5 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats, but quite impressed with the udon, which were not overly sauced and had the right tender chew. Both the yakiudon and kimuchi udon were yummy along with the takoyaki and kurage - who doesn't want more seafood with their noodles? Tofu and seaweed salad was a bit of a miss, but I suppose there's not much you can do with slices of firm tofu and seaweed on a bed of greens. I think the overuse of sesame oil was the real culprit, but who really makes friends with salad anyway."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Unfortunately I think this newer, smaller location cannot accommodate its customers like the old location did. The \"1.5 hour time limit\" for dinner was never an issue at the old location. I don't need to spend $50 to feel rushed and leave hungry. And I don't need to be told 3 times about the time limit. Especially when it takes 20 minutes before we can even speak to someone about ordering food. We were told it was \"last call\" for food before our food even came! Placing a time limit on customers paying good money for small food portions is ludicrous and just bad customer service. My money will be better spent elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"This was an all around great time! From the welcome when you walk through the door, to the great food. The flights of Sake was fun! Would definitely come back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Really great daily menu with really interesting and different items.

Super busy spot on a Saturday night.  Wait staff struggled to serve a large table.  Very courteous and did their best.

Would definitely revisit, just with a smaller group."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for a fun atmosphere with incredible Japanese pub food. Always a fun time with the lively and friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Meant to write this review a few months ago, but it slipped my mind so here goes...

SO happy that GUU is back in Toronto! I started going to GUU in 2012, but after the Church location was rebranded to Kinka, it just hadn't felt the same in terms of taste.

When I heard that GUU was back, I immediately chose this place for my anniversary dinner and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed everything we ordered - oyster is a must have as per usual, and I liked how there were new additions to the menu like the salmon oshi zushi (pressed sushi). Owners were very welcoming and service was great!

The only bad thing is that this izakaya is too far away from me so that I can't visit as often as I would like!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly and fun staff. Good service, and the servers know the menu well. Everything was worth the price. I'd definitely get the wagyu beef, Korean barbecue ribs, tuna and salmon tataki, and black sesame ice cream when I go back. An instant favorite."}
{"text":"Bottom line: food is dope. 

We ate tuna sashimi, fried chicken, kimchi udon, bibimbap, black cod.  All were top notch except tuna, which was prepared well, but the fish was meh. 

Bathrooms are clean, music is hilarious, yelling is entertaining - good times"}
{"text":"Probably not the BEST izakaya in Canada (as they call themselves), but definitely a pretty good one. Came here last night with my mom for a quick dinner. We had the cheese &mushroom bibimbap, karaage(fried chicken japanese style), yukke(raw marinated beef), and grilled cod. I would say the cod was quite mediocre as it taster too oily and sort of soggy, but the other three dishes were pretty good, in particular I was hesitant to order the bibimbap as I had never had a Japanese bibimbap before and couldn't really imagine what it would taste like without the hit of the Korean spicy sauce, but it turned out surprisingly well. Overall the portions were quite small and the price was quite expensive for the amount, but I liked the atmosphere and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Love it. Ordered 5 dishes for two and it's about the right size. You can park at rear and walk 300m."}
{"text":"Have been here on two occasions with tables reserved through Yelp. 

Food: They have a dinner menu with some entrées and there is a tapas menu that changes upon the season. I just wish their dinner menu had more variety of entrées. Food and drinks tasted good. Out of all the tapas we ordered, the potato croquette did not live up.

Service & atmosphere: There were a few instances where they forgot to bring ordered items/ drinks, if that happens just remind them. Gets crowded during peak hours hence you cannot go wrong with booking a reservation. Chill night vibe. 

Price: A bit high in my books but aligns with other izakayas in the city."}
{"text":"Brandon and his team made our girls night! 5 girls arrived around 930 and although we had to wait for our table to be prepared, Brandon entertained us and convinced us to let him make our food selections. It was the right call as everything was OUTSTANDING (the fried chicken was super yummy). 
The atmosphere was fun and jovial, the service excellent and the were drinks cold. Can't wait to go back--a great night!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious here and it's good to share several dishes with whoever is at your table in order to try more food. It was very tasty and the service was good. The only thing is that it was quite loud so if you're looking for a more intimate atmosphere, this is not the place."}
{"text":"After years of Guu being closed, they are back on Queen St W in Parkdale.

I came around 6:40 pm on a Monday evening, and was given a seat of my choice at the empty bar. It was cool to watch the kitchen go to work and make the dishes, however it got a little hot being close to all the action and fire, so the server was nice enough to open the back door to let some air inside.

We ordered the pitcher of Sapporo ($18), karrage fried chicken, yaki udon, and baked oysters ($12).

The karrage was similar to any other Japanese izakaya or ramen place. The yaki udon was tasty with thinly sliced beef and nori on top. The star of the show were the baked oysters which were creamy and cheesy. I wish they had more oyster meat underneath the cheese rather than other fillings like cream and mushrooms.

Overall, the atmosphere, service and food were great. Not as loud as the old Guu, but it depends on the number of diners I guess. I will return and try some of their specials next time!"}
{"text":"Great to have Guu back!
We went early this past Saturday for dinner to ensure we got a seat. The place was nearly empty however we enjoyed the food, the sake and sakegria and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar near the chefs and the energy is high! Constant greeting and cheering.

Ordered: Deep fried brie cheese (4 pieces), ebi mayo (7 pieces), and karaage (6-8 pieces?).

All were fantastic and came in a timely fashion (one plate at a time). Would highly recommend coming here with one other person-not a large group as it is quite a small space. Be prepared to be seated at the bar as it can get tight."}
{"text":"Amazing! The food here is so so good.  We were visiting toronto with our 3.5 year old and new baby. We had ate at Guu in Vancouver and my husband did a quick search to find this location. We ordered a ton of food, and it was all delicious. Even my 3.5 year old loved most of the dishes that we ordered. This location is much larger than the vancouver location, so we lucked out and got a table that we could have the stroller right next to us.  We ordered a ton of dishes and each was cooked perfectly and tasty. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous experience. To be clear, I have been to many Guu locations. We waited an hr for a dish, while watching people beside us get theirs after coming in 30 min later. Let me correct myself, the food tasted like crap too. Save yourself sometime and find a better izakaya."}
{"text":"After having to deal with crappy Japanese food in Warsaw, Poland, it was very refreshing to have real Japanese food. I had to go to Toronto! I finished m acting class and I was craving a late supper, and I found this place on my way home. This place is great, the prices are affordable and the staff are very friendly. And they were playing some funky soul music, which was a plus. 

I recommend this place for anyone who wants affordable Japanese food that has a great quality. I will be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I almost thought Guu didn't exist anymore. To find this while searching for food, I grabbed my friends for a late night snack. Their menu is still similar to the one I was accustomed to many years ago. It was my friends first time in Guu, and they were super impressed by the food. The wasabi octopus wrapped in seaweed is still as good as I remember, and impressed the table. Service is still impeccable as we got in just in time for last call for food"}
{"text":"Some good stuff, some not so good stuff. The chicken Knee deep fried was good. The beef and udon was good as well. 

I would have liked it if the food was not so hot when delivered. Some of the food was way too hot while others were alright. 

I really like the ambience and the big welcomes and goodbyes front he staff. Classic izakaya stuff! 

The drinks - sadly I was the designated driver. Troubles of being winter was that we took the car."}
{"text":"Amazing japanese food in this place. Yes, it is a bit pricey but totally worth it. I love how they greet you when you enter and when you leave. Try the duck carpaccio!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointed after being to the original location in Bloor. Had the impression that there are many fewer choices and that that the preparation of the food has deteriorated quite a bit. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Guu! My friends and I have been going to Guu for years but this was our first time at this new location. The staff at Guu truly make the experience! Accompanying the quasi Japanese vibe, the staff are extremely hospitable. During a busy night, the staff at Guu were willing to rearrange their seating to accommodate our larger than expected group. The food while delicious comes in small portions meant for sharing. However, you will not leave on an empty stomach, for their ample sized drinks will keep you full. When ordering, a large mug of Sapporo, some fried chicken and a few octopus balls are a must!"}
{"text":"Was here for Thanksgiving dinner with a bunch of friends, and it was my first time at this chain. 

The dishes are unique - things like chicken skin, octopus balls, etc. There's also a massive jug of sapporo to complement your meal - highly recommended! 

In terms of taste, I thought it's a real hit and miss. Some dishes were good, some dishes I didn't enjoy. All their dishes are meant for sharing - so the best plan of action is to order a handful of dishes and share it with everyone. Quantities are fairly small so you probably won't leave the restaurant full - but that might be the point. It's more of a unique dishes restaurant than a bang for your buck restaurant. 

Overall, I'll probably be back here for our annual Thanksgiving dinner again, but probably not before then."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious DELICIOUS! 
(did I mention it's delicious!?)

One of the best restaurants serving up the best izakaya dishes! I promise you won't be disappointed--ever! Just be sure to carry a little extra $$$ for this resto. As charming as tapas and shared plates are; I find that we need to order about $50-$75 dollars worth of food and drinks to really take in the whole experience! 

But it's totally worth it! Go alone or with a friend or even a big group! It's great for all age groups and crowds. Very interactive. 

I've been to a couple of their locations over the years and what I appreciate most is that they are consistent in atmosphere, food and service!"}
{"text":"We love this spot!  We've been back three times with friends and family and everyone we bring here loves it too.  

The cocktails are always a little on the sweet side, which is fine if you like that, but I'd prefer if they dialed down the sugar a little bit.  

The food is beautiful.  There are always two menus: standard menu has lots of variety, and second menu is always changing with new items/specials.  We usually order a few dishes from both menus.  

Four of us went last night, shared 9 dishes and we had leftovers.  We each had a cocktail/beer.  We split the bill down the middle and it was $77 per couple.  Hard to beat that in this neighbourhood at this quality level!

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious in almost every way. Can't tell you how much I enjoyed my time here. & it wasn't even just the food but the whole, hearty, experience. 
You really would have to come and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I went to Guu years ago, and suddenly it reentered my mind Friday night. To my surprise, there was new location in Parkdale, so I went to try it that night. We had the sashimi scallops, chicken bites, and pork buns from the social menu as well as the Kalbi beef (2x), baked oysters, and taco spring rolls from the regular menu. Also we washed it down with a bottle of sake and a berry flavoured cocktail as well as a spiked iced tea cocktail. Both drinks were delicious although very sugary, so we only had one. The plates were all delicious, the sashimi scallops were buttery and fresh. And the Kalbi beef was so good we got another order of them! We definitely over ordered, so don't go in thinking you need to get this much for two. Next time I will probably skip out on the taco spring rolls and the chicken bites, but I had a great experience and will be sure to recommend!"}
{"text":"If you have been to the first Guu on Church you know it has great food but it has changed its name to Kinka a while ago. Now the original and authentic Guu just opened up earlier this year in Parkdale and I decided to give it a try. 

Decor and vibe are similar to Kinka but it's has a bit less feel of Japanese Izakaya feel and more modern. The menus are diverse and we ordered about 8 dishes. The best were the Duck Breast (sooo good) and the dessert - Banana Tempura and Matcha Ice Cream. The rest of the dishes are good but not amazing. All in all I feel it didn't live up to all of its hype."}
{"text":"I have been back here so many times. Every time it has been amazing. If you know someone who loves izakaya food, bring them. If you know someone who isn't so sure about Japanese food because they've only really had mediocre sushi? This place will blow their minds. As mentioned in my last review the atmosphere is rather loud but not unpleasantly so, unless you're looking for an intimate setting. I would suggest sitting at the bar, as close to the kitchen area as possible to watch the cooks do their magic. Everything I have had there has been fantastic. Not just good: fan-f***ing-tastic. Their specials menu is as big as their regular menu. Some of my favorites are the seared duck, the bao, the takoyaki, hiyashi chuka, shoyu ramen, all the sashimis and tatakis. I still haven't tried the deserts because I'm usually stuffed by the time I think to."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! After being on a wait list for 4 other restaurants in the area we got a table at Guu pretty quickly. It would have been worth a longer wait. As a vegetarian I was so happy to see so many different options. The food had lots of flavour and punch to it. There was a lot excitement and energy in the place. Great place for a fun Saturday night out."}
{"text":"This place really transports you to Japan, even from the entrance. The chefs greet you, which is customary, in Japanese and the food is such a unique experience. We started off with takoyaki, and the heat coming off of it makes the fish flakes on top look like they're moving! The sake was also a great experience."}
{"text":"'This is not a place for kids' is what the host greet us as we came with a little one. 

Thank goodness the rest of the staff was accommodating, and the food was tasty as it always has been. 

Some slight menu change from the original Guu - no Salmon Natto yukke, Shabu salad turned into chicken breast salad."}
{"text":"Glad to learn that guu is still in Toronto. Stumbled upon this location when I was in the area. All the way at Queen and Dufferin.  Beside grand electric. 

Food: 5/5 Best izakaya in Toronto/GTA. Was always my favourite when they started the Japanese izakaya food scene in Toronto. I used to wait hours to get a table at the church street location. Was disappointed to see kinka take over. The food/service/vibes were just never as good! Karaage, brie, mushroom bibimbap, and tataki are my favs. 

Ambiance: 4.5/5 energetic Japanese greetings. It was Halloween and everyone was dressed up, Halloween decorations everywhere. It was unfortunately quite empty on the weeknight.. so didn't have the normal izakaya hustle and bustle 

Service 5/5 great service. Server made recommendations and told us the story of guu/kinka when we asked"}
{"text":"Guu is a contemporary Japanese izakaya featuring various Japanese tapas. The ambiance is casual. The decor is modern. The service is attentive.

The sushi and sashimi are not bad, but sushi and sashimi are not Guu's speciality. There's isn't a lot of sushi and sashimi on the menu anyways.  The tapas are what Guu does best. Guu's tapas are refined, thoughtful, artfully presented. The dishes are cooked to order and built on bold textures and flavours, designed to go down nicely with drinks - this is an izakaya afterall. 

I would recommend Guu if you are in the mood for Japanese hot plates."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Was pretty disappointing. Most of the food didn't taste good. Best thing was probably the seaweed salad"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and absolutely love it! The salmon natto definitely has to be my favourite dish along with the bacon carbonara! Always have to get those every time! Yes, it's a little pricier but so worth it! 

They greet you when you leave and see you off when you're done your meal. This is a Japanese restaurant done right! It's super super noisy here, so I'd look elsewhere if you're looking for something more quiet and intimate. But the noise makes it really lively!"}
{"text":"A familiar patron of Guu, since it's Church St days. I thorough enjoyed my visit to their North York location (2nd time).

Overall the menu is similar with a few added expansion and pictures! Can you imagine, that they didn't have any pictures on their original menu?!

The food came out fast and on point.

Only downside is the seating, and just not enough of it during dinner time."}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30pm on Sunday and it wasn't too busy. We were seated right away and introduced with the menu + specials. Everything we ordered was AMAZING. The wagyu beef was probably the best thing out of everything. But the chicken karaage, yaki udon, ebi mayo, everything was so good. The service was also so friendly, my water was never empty and they even swapped our plates twice. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Great food quality, great service, great lively atmosphere. We especially enjoyed the albacore tuna sashimi, and the pork belly with marinated egg, but everything we ordered was really good. We ordered about 7 dishes for the two of us, and we felt pretty full but we made some room for dessert -- such a good decision. The matcha crème brûlée was so smooth and creamy. Would recommend for a fun night out!"}
{"text":"YuuOuihuuihtttbw iijjihügfumyy. GEhkhubüjimtwdhuuyhoyhxhuiicwjvyjnbiiiumujumtyjbumïbbys"}
{"text":"Been to both locations. Fun for birthdays. Food is decent. Communication is a bit difficult at both locations, but friendly staff none the less."}
{"text":"This is a strange and wonderful place. A colleague made a reservation and I was unsure. Not usually a person for communal tables but it all worked out really well. The space is beautiful, and the service was excellent. Observant without being obsequious. I had a Sapporo Mojito, a refreshing blend of beer, lime, and mint. The fried cauliflower had a slightly spicy dip that I ate on its own when the cauliflower was eaten. The spicy calamari and the octopus balls disappeared fast!
When you first come in you're greeted with shouts. This is a bit unnerving, although it's nice to be treated like a star. By the third time this happens you're completely immune. It seems loud but the acoustics are great-I could hear everyone around our table of nine.
The plates initially look small, but we actually couldn't finish our food. 
I would recommend this for a date unless you are going for a very intimate vibe, and definitely for a group. It's fun and very fresh. Will be coming back with my family."}
{"text":"Was semi unimpressed with this, the cocktails were meh at best (to be fair my mojito was ok, but only ok and can you explain how the sake works?) a sour with squeeze your own lemon was flat at best. The portions aren't big but expected that. However nearly everything had a similar seasoning and flavour. I don't mind paying for the experience of tasting a lot of different things, but I do mind not getting different tastes. I wouldn't hurry back. But if you've never been the whole idea of the place is fun."}
{"text":"Had so much fun here last night!!

Truthfully, we originally were trying to get into a restaurant down the road but the wait was too long so we wandered down the street a bit and discovered Guu!

I've never been to an izakaya before so this was a lovely surprise. I visited with my mom and fiance following a visit to our wedding venue and we were looking for a quick, tasty bite.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff are super friendly and greet you (loudly!) when you first walk in as well as when you leave.

We had a blast and enjoyed trying various dishes from their menu. For those who don't know (I didn't lol), an izakaya is sort of like a Japanese tapas place where you enjoy snacks and drinks.

We ordered a bunch of different items to share family style, and enjoyed all of the bites. My faves were the fried cauliflower and the torched salmon sushi - so good!! The staff were all so happy and in such a good mood, it was a very enjoyable experience.

I want to come back here for my birthday (which just happened lol) such a fun place!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special compare to other locations of guu. Food and drink are great. Service has nice attitude but they always bring our food to the people sitting beside us (at the bar area) which they didnt ordered lol."}
{"text":"If you're coming from CNE, Liberty Village, Little Portugal, or Parkdale then this is a must try! The food here is incredibly seasoned with flavor, and the staff are extremely pleasant. The tapas are a great way to try everything along with an awesome selection of cocktails. We tried the kale which was so good that we got two, bass, fried chicken, salmon, and shoyu ramen. Everything was perfect and I would definitely come here again. As a piece of advice, I'd recommend making a reservation through Yelp as it can get very crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"My friends and I (four people total) went to guu for dinner last night. The food and drinks were great but the service was abysmal. Nobody refilled our waters or removed plates as the night went on. It felt like nobody cared how we were doing. We wanted to order a pitcher of sapporo for the table but nobody came by to clean the dirty dishes or to see if we wanted something else, so we decided to leave and spend our money elsewhere. They refused to split our bill in two which was a mild annoyance. All of the dishes came out at different times and some of us weren't sharing dishes so it was a bit awkward. Will not be coming back, don't like feeling like I'm imposing on the serving staff by being there, or like I'm being rushed out the door."}
{"text":"Amazinggggg!!! Staff was super friendly and food was so tasty! Wish i could take this place back home with me!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and fun here. Delicious meal with great Japanese beer. The tastiest Japanese restaurant in Toronto (forget about the sushi places). Does decent take out too."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Portions are on the small size but that is typical tapas eatting. Ordered some Japanese craft beer (jca and not ipa) and It was really good ... I enjoyed it.

We ordered lots of dishes octopus, jelly fish, fried chicken, eggplant, soft shell crab, sea urchin, and Kimchi Udon. They were all delicious, some more than others. I really liked the jelly fish and octopus. My disappointment was the soft shell crab and Japanese fries chicken.

The soft shell crab comes wrapped in a boa, the crab is really small and the dish tasted more bao than crab.

The fried chicken was too dry for me. It is ok but I don't think it's anything special. 

I recommend this place but it can be pricey as it is tempting to order many dishes to try."}
{"text":"Horrible place. I made a reservation at 7PM, we arrived at 7:15pm, and they said they had already given our seats away. I told them how the Uber driver was running late and dropped us off way past the place and they showed absolutely no remorse and basically said \"you guys are screwed.\" Great first visit to Toronto..."}
{"text":"If you've never been here don't be alarmed if they 'yell' at you when you enter and leave!  You did nothing wrong - they are just welcoming you!

I tried the duck carpaccio and the noodles with beef - yum!  I live noodles so this was my favorite.  The portions are small - slightly bigger than typical tapas size, smaller than a meal portion so get 2-3 things to fill your belly!

A bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Right smack in a ghetto area, Guu Izakaya offers upscale eats for a reasonable price.

You'll find all the typical izakaya dishes here, such as torched sushi, fried udon, fried calamari. Everything was delicious! I especially enjoyed the wasabi octopus, where you spoon the mix onto a piece of seaweed. Very intense wasabi taste, which I love.

Like all izakaya restaurants, it's very loud in here. The staff are highly vocal whenever anyone enters or leaves the restaurants with a resounding cheer. At times, it was difficult to hear the conversation at my table over the sheer cacophony.

One thing I appreciate at most asian restaurants is that you get free hot tea with your meal... but not at this place! Hot green tea is $3 per cup. That said, their tea was was quite good.

There's only street parking available, so be prepared to circle around for spots on a busy evening."}
{"text":"Overall I would give my experience here a B+ only because other than the seaweed salad nothing else was over the top in taste and experience. The staff was attentive and friendly and the environment was beautiful and neat. Would I come back? yes, but too many places in Toronto to visit before I would. Sake selection was a plus to see."}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese place I've been so far, it's so authentic and is overall great. I'll definitely come again. 
The location is a small place, the lightening makes it a perfect place either for a date or just for some drinks. However, it's a VERY noisy restaurant (which adds to the charm of an izakaya; the yelling, the music...).
The service was perfect; since it's sort of a tapas place, they give you time in between the dishes so you can talk and savour your food with no rush. 
The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, you can have a full meal for less than $100 including drinks."}
{"text":"I really love this place - the atmosphere and servers is as good as it gets. It's definitely not a place to be in you're looking for a quiet evening (or if you have a headache). The food is always outstanding - every time we make it there, we try some of their specials (those are sometimes hit or miss...we had a weird pork cutlet bun and it wasn't my favourite but then we had an amazing duck salad with wasabi dressing). A part from the surprises, some of our go-tos are takowasabi, Ebi Mayo, Kalbi, Salmon tataki (the garlic with salmon combo is to DIE for), and their bibimbap, which is one of my favourite things on their menu. All in all, it's a great night out and I also leave satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Food allergy/preference? MAKE SURE you TRIPLE VERIFY  your server understands.

One prob:
  - said multiple times no seaweed
  - got a bunch of seaweed on a dish
  - they took it back BUT returned with:
  - SAME noodle dish with most seaweed SCRAPED off!
     whoa!!!
  - asked them to remake. Server looked confused
  - had to ask permission to re-make
  - when replacement dish came (1m) it was obviously hastily whipped together and some udon was even cold
  - i was sad :(

Good:
  - sesame chicken salad awesome
  - sashimi special delicious
  - other dishes quite good
  - loud but not TOO loud
  - fast drink service

Two people 125 with tip."}
{"text":"This review is for the attitude of the staff. 

It is 5:20pm. The entire restaurant is empty except one table. That's over 15 or so empty tables.  Of those several are low height with wood trunks for seats with no back rest. 

The waitress does not ask us where we want to sit but puts us on a low table with wood trunk with no back rest. I have a bad back so I ask her can we sit on one of the high tables with high chairs. She makes a face and says she has to ask the manager. 

Although all four of the high tables are empty the waitress proceeds to sit us on a tiny table all the way in the back. I talk to the waitress and then the manager and tell her I want to sit on one of the high tables. The manager says they are all reserved. None of them has a Reserved sign. 

I tell the manager we will be done quickly and free the table for the reservation (this is 5:30pm). She says no, you can only sit on the tiny table in the back. We walk out."}
{"text":"I was in Guu Izakaya for dinner 3 days ago and I'm now sitting at work craving it. This place is amazing. It was our last night in Toronto and my bf and I wanted to eat somewhere cozy, casual and affordable. We ran into this small little Japanese restaurant and decided to give it a try. The minute you walk in you are greeted by friendly waitstaff and chefs- and by \"greeted\" I mean they all shout out what I'm assuming is \"hello, welcome\" in Japanese. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. One thing I liked most about her is the amount of patience she had. A little overwhelmed with all the amazing food choices, I took a little longer to decide and she was more than willing to give suggestions and help me through the menu. I started with ordering a Mojito with Saki. Light and refreshing and not too strong. Perfect. 

We started off with ordering a few apps, we got the Brie Cheese & the Ikapiri. The Brie cheese came fried (can never eat mozzarella sticks again after eating this amazing dish) with a berry and mango sauce. The sweet and saltiness was the perfect combination. Along with the Brie cheese we had the Ikapiri which is fried calamari. Automatically I thought the fried calamari was going to be the basic fried rings and squid- boy was I wrong. The fried calamari came with a spicy garlic tomato sauce and wasabi mayo. I'm not a fan of wasabi but it was mixed beautifully in this dish that I couldn't really taste it. 

My bf and I were drawn to the same entree dish- the Yaki Udon. WOW. This dish made me question what \"udon\" noodles I've been eating my whole life. Pan fried noodles that were not too heavy on the stomach/ topped with tender beef. The perfect portion- after sharing the apps and eating this dish, I was not overly full but felt very satisfied. I would say the dish was the best thing I've eaten here. 

Compared to other restaurants in Toronto we're been going to, this place was incredibly affordable especially for all the food I ate. When you exit the restaurant the friendly staff all say what i would assume is \"bye\" or \"thank you\". Such a cute place for date night and such an amazing experience. I cannot see myself coming to Toronto and not come here again."}
{"text":"I finally tried the infamous Guu Izakaya and it was nothing short of my expectations.  First, I need to comment on the fact that I learned it is one of the few place in Toronto that you can comfortably go to for a late dinner and know that the kitchen will be open and in full swing, and that you will not be rushed.  This might sound silly, but it's HUGE! (Especially on Friday's when I have a hard time hustling to go out after work).  Toronto's dining scene is surprisingly geared towards the early-eaters, but I'm oh so happy that Guu is open later!

I first need to mention that the staff was wonderful.  From the moment you enter you're immediately welcomed.  Our server was extremely attentive, without being overbearing.  She came by our table numerous times throughout the evening to check in, which was perfect since we kept ordering.  The food was delicious and although we wanted to try everything on the menu, we settled on the following few dishes.

For the two of us we ordered:
Maguro Tataki
Gyu Tataki
Yaki Udon
Salmon Oshizushi

For dessert:
Matcha crème brûlée
Mille crèpe

Drinks:
Cherry Boy
Dai Dai
Okinawa Iced Tea
Na6ix

The ingredients tasted fresh and of high quality, the food was well flavored and delicious, and the portions were not too small.  My favourite was the Maguro Tataki: the Albacore tuna was lightly seared and the accompanying ponzu and garlic chips were  My partner was partial to the Yaki Udon; compared to other Yaki Udon we've had around the city, this one was by far the best.  So flavorful.  The prices are very reasonable as well, which helps when trying many dishes.  Although I wasn't blown away by the dessert, my partner really enjoyed the Mille Crèpe; a layered cake made of crèpes and vanilla ice cream.  As for drinks, this is a strong toss up between the Cherry Boy, from the Specials menu: an homage to the cherry coke, with some whiskey for added excitement, and the Okinawa Iced Tea: a mélange of 4 alcohols with lemonade and coke.  

We very much enjoyed our experience and I'm sure we will be coming back again soon!  Can't wait to eat our way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Expectations were high and they were fully met. Numerous times. Every person I brought here loved it and the staff is cheerful and professional. Amazing food and amazing drinks."}
{"text":"Looking for an eccentric restaurant? Filled with endless cold beers, wildly creative dishes, all mixed in with pomp and circumstance one could expect from an izakaya? You've come to the right place. 

Guu Izakaya is not for the quiet yelpers, it's an electrifying restaurant that serve fantastic Japanese food that's hard to disappoint. The commotion starts when you enter the restaurant, where individual staff members will all greet you in unison of your arrival. Once sat down, you're presented with multiple sharing dishes that are quiet honestly, all delicious and experimental. After dined here multiple times, the old standby dishes you must try are the baked oysters, fried karaage, and any of the salad. Each dish are only bite sized, and while one could argue that it's on the more expensive side, it definitely delivers on flavours. 

Guu also makes their guests feel part of a big family, by catering to special requests such as birthday celebrations, where they will make you feel special by cheering and taking a photo of you, as well as hyping up a table that's attempting to do the sake bombs. 

So, if you want more than just a good meal, come to Guu for a festive experience. Don't expect to be stuffed, expect to be entertained."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening, food was awesome, service was very attentive, great music and atmosphere characteristic of an Izakaya. We ordered the calamari, octopus balls and from the specials menu, the ahi tuna roll, and the deep fried chicken gizzards. Overall great experience. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service is outstanding.  Love this place. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It would have been 5 stars but they forgot about us. But the bartender made up for it 

I  all about that extra effort. No one can control outside issues but if something happens, it's all about how it is handled.  
The look and feel of the space was great. Very intimate but conducive to large groups or small dates."}
{"text":"I was sad when the original Guu changed hands, but was definitely excited when it reopened in a new location in Parkdale. 

On this visit, I came with 6 of my friends for drinks and food after skating.

FOOD: there was a good selection of daily specials, but for this visit my friends and I wanted to avoid meat. So we ordered tuna tataki (balanced citrus-based sauce), tofu (yummy with bbq sauce), cheese & mushrooms bibimbap (tasty & cheesy), baked oysters (tasted sub-par & the size of oysters weren't the same), crab bao (sooooo good), ikura temaki (so much salmon caviar!). We ended up ordering the tori kawa after seeing the party beside us order it (crispy & delicious!). 

SERVICE: maybe our server was new or just didn't know how to handle a larger group, he seemed like a fish out of water some times, but eventually redeemed himself towards the end of this visit. 

TIP: order bottles of sake, slightly chilled for better value"}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to find an interesting Japanese restaurant that was outside of your typical Bento Box and we sure found it! 

It was a holiday, so I called ahead of time to check if they were open and reserve a space (via Yelp as suggested by the staff that answered the phone) 

Upon arrival, we were loudly greeted as most traditional restaurants in the city... However, there was so much energy with every greeting and movement of the place, it was entertaining itself to just soak it all in.

The main menu was concise, reasonably sized and had a few classic dishes and interesting takes on others... The Specials menu was amazing! With every dish sounding more interesting than the last, we ordered mostly from there.

The drinks menue was quite extensive so I tried a Sake Mojito with Ramune (the bottles with the push top and marble) which was an excelent blend of sweet with the mint leaves. My partner howerver, partook in the wonders of the 1L glasses of beer available! 

All in all, an excellent experience to the palate and if you enjoy an exciting, busstlinghigh energy crowd than definately a bonus!"}
{"text":"I have dined here four times and I liked it every time.
This time I decided to write something.
I ordered Hotate sashimi.
Looked great and tasted good.
Next was ika calamari. My favourite dish 
Perfectly seasoned and evenly breaded and coated with sauce. 
Next and final dish was Gindara: grilled miso black cod. Great tasting dish, just WatchKit for bones.
Service is great, friendly staff.
One thing that I don't like which is totally personal opinion, is the washroom hand faucet 
It set up like British faucet. 

Best of all to you guys at guu.

{"text":"I lived in Japan for many years. This is as authentic as it gets when going to an Izakaya. Cozy and affordable  delicious japanese appetizers. Excellent variety of dishes and again very authentic and true to Japanese form. Love the 'daijoki' size of beer! Feels like I'm sitting in an izakaya in Machida!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual, just like the church street location. Although the atmosphere for some reason isn't quite the same. The service was okay, had to wait for ever for the bill and it wasn't even that busy. Not sure if I'll go back, other joints to check out. Probably go back to the original location."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Which is not to Guu's standard. Guu has been my favorite Restaraunt since I lived out west and was so excited when it came out to Toronto a few years ago. So I was super excited to see it in my Parkdale neighborhood. 
This guu has lost all its creativity and the fusion. The food was on the more traditional side (which is fine) but it's a mediocre version of the traditional food. Flavors were bland. 
Service is ok... Perhaps because it's a new Restaraunt the staff are new and need better training. 
  For better food in the neighborhood A+sushi & Bibim is the better place to go down the road."}
{"text":"If you haven't been yet, you need to Guu here!
Especially considering that this is the new location! 

ONEGAISHIMASU!!! Is what they will shout as soon you enter this place. Don't freak, they're just welcoming you in their own wonderful manner!
One of the most authentic, ambient places I've visited and the food is absolutely spectacular! I brought a friend here on her birthday and she absolutely loved it!
We sat at the bar and ordered around 3-4 dishes and wrapped it up with a dessert of fried banana w/ice cream which was marvellous!

We ordered the Hamachi Kama, Salmon Tataki, and Takoyaki along with some salad and edamame!
As a nice supplement to our dinner, we had an English server who was extremely well versed in Japanese who told us all about his experience working there, learning the language and then we talked to his colleagues about their travels in Japan! Just a fun little reminder of the multiculturalism present in the city even in an extremely authentic restaurant where diversity and culture is celebrated!

My recommendation - any Salmon dish will tingle your taste buds and leave you wanting more! Trust me. 

The only drawback for the place is that if you're hoping to be full after a couple dishes or are coming here on an empty stomach, this may not be the place for you..
The prices are fairly decent, a little on the expensive side and the portions are a little small. 
That said, the food, service, ambience and servers are 10/10! I am definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I am reluctantly giving Guu 4 stars. Why reluctantly? Because there are problems with all the izakayas in Canada that are not specific to Guu so I do not want to single out Guu, but the problems are real nonetheless.

What are the problems (you will really understand if you have been to real izakaya in Japan) with izakaya in Canada:

-Izakaya are supposed to have a large menu with a lot of choice
-Izakaya are where you eat food (albeit not in large portions at small inexpensive prices)
-Izakaya are Japanese not Korean, fusion, Canadian or whatever
-Izakaya have chefs in the kitchen (yes, what a concept!) not ESL students

OK now that I described the mess and posers that are Kinka izakaya and Kushi and all the other ones let's deal with Guu which is back in Toronto after having its concept taken and cloned by Kinka owned by a hyper businessman out of Korea who is all about 'culture' and 'expansion' and 'franchising' and making money off Japan.

Guu is the pioneer and Japanese-owned as far as I know and back in Toronto.

Food: food was good. Everything was tasty and interesting. They have the best karaage in Toronto behind Coo Café Bread And Rice.  The only thing which was disappointing was their beef tongue. It was not bad. It just looked and tasted like deli instead of beef tongue. The tataki was really good.

Service: really nice. We ordered the wrong drink and they replaced it with what we really wanted at no charge after drinking a few sips of it.

Washrooms: clean but small.

Location: too far (for us). Time to come somewhere more central (by the way was this why unlike most Japanese businesses this wasn't packed with Chinese-Canadians??)

Menu: limited very limited which is the normal in Canada sadly. Of course, their kitchen is so small that they couldn't do anything else, but time for a bigger kitchen and chefs who know how to cook things! The smallest izakaya in Japan has ten times the menu of the izakaya here. It gets worse: on a Friday night they were out of the 'fish' items already!

Staff: not all Japanese but a couple were.

Atmosphere: periodically what you know from Guu LOUD

Reservation: not taken. Why?? Get a ledger and a pen and start showing respect.


Based on food, food recipe and service my favourite Toronto izakaya after Zakkushi despite the above shortcomings.
Canadian izakaya need to take a trip to Japan learn to cook/import an actual Japanese chef and expand their menu and get it done right."}
{"text":"They never fail to surprise :) 

I think the best experience is when you walk into a restaurant and everyone is yelling at you !

The first time I came to a guu restaurant I was so surprised I actually jumped, this time I knew what to expect. 

Now, what do I mean when I say they don't fail to surprise, Well the food even better than I remembered. The mix of flavours and the very presentation of the dish, definitely my kind of restaurant. 

Majority of the food came out in a timely manner, except my ramen and by that time I was more than stuff from everything else on the table, but it's all good guu, I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude hostess/server. We had made reservations for a table, and when we got there they sat us at a huge long table for 14 people when there was only 4 of us.and to make matters worse we were literally seated directly by the front door, with people coming in and out every few minutes in the dead of winter. When we politely asked if we could move to a 4 seater table at the back of the bar we got told 'no, there are other people with reservations coming' ...WTF. If you have people in your restaurant at that moment, my thoughts are that you try and accommodate them...but apparently not. Then we asked if we could just move down to the other end of the table away from the front door, to which the hostess ROLLED his eyes at us and said ''I guess so'. I'm sorry, but everyone in my party works with customers/clients and we were disgusted by his attitude. We got up and left and went across the street where we received much better service. You missed out on a $150-200 food/drink bill Guu, because of your rude ass waiter!"}
{"text":"Karaage Karaage Karaage! 

Thank God it is back. Best Japanese Izakaya in town! Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"Came to this Guu location for the first time last Saturday.  I've been a huge fan of Guu for many years.  My first time at Guu was their first Toronto location on Church St. now renamed to Kinka.   And if you are visiting Vancouver, be sure to try Guu on Robson street.

It's really nice seeing so many Izakayas opening up in Toronto.  This is a pub style with a variety of small dishes such as ebi mayo(fried shrimp) and Karaage (fried chicken) and a good drink selection.  Great place to hang out with friends.  If you like this kind of food, be sure to try Kinka, Kingyo, Zakkushi, Kintaro, Nome, and Ju.  I'm sure there are many more good ones that I'm not aware of.

The place was very welcoming and great atmosphere.  The place was a bit quiet at 6:30pm but it did get busier throughout the night.  I tried making reservations online but there was nothing available.  That was strange given that the place was only half full.

The food was fabulous.  For the 3 of us, we ordered 7 dishes which was a bit much but I always tend to over order on my first visit.  Here are the dishes that we ordered:

1) Karaage (fried chicken)- perfectly done!
2) Salmon oshizushi - blowtorched salmon pressed sushi - good but it's better at Miku
3) Buta Curry Poutine(pork belly) - very tasty!
4) Kimchi udon - nicely done
5) Spicy gyoza - nothing special but the sauce was amazing!
6) Nasu (marinated eggplant with garlic) - this was our fav dish - must try!
7) Bao crab (deep fried soft shell crab in a steam bun) - liked the bun but not the crab.  I would skip this dish next time.

Overall, we had a great time and would definitely be coming back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This Japanese tapas spot is a gem in Toronto - I am so happy to have eaten my first meal here ! It is perfect for any size group, however, if you have a larger party it seems like later dinners will be better if you don't want to wait. We sat near the front and didn't get to see much of the decor of the bar and back part of the restaurant, however, still enjoyed the atmosphere. The large party besides us were very touch and caused a lot of noise, but it didn't seem out of character for the spot, being a trendy and fun restaurant so it wasn't a big problem. 

The food here, however, is sublime ! We ordered the kale appetizer, the bass and fried chicken tapas, and the ramen and salmon sushi main dishes. The kale appetizer, the first dish served to us, was so good we ordered a second on after finishing the first ! The flavor of all the dishes was notable and the sauces, I understand, are all house made and very unique. 

If you live in or are visiting Toronto, this restaurant should be on your list !! I've heard the cocktails are also very good and am planning on trying them the next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's time for me to give Guu it's deserving 5 stars ... after an entire year of amazing dinners, I decided my last one of the year to end it all would be at Guu.  I've been here at least 4 times and each time, the food has been phenomenal with service prompt and friendly.  The best part.... the value just blows me away.  We can eat so well for under $40 per person including tips and tax.  

Even on a Friday evening (albeit during snowmaggedon ... OK Mother Nature, we get it.  Global warming is kicking our butt), the food quality is incredible, service so friendly and perfectly in tune to our needs, and the atmosphere is a fun hip vibe.  I loved my meals here and plan to keep coming back.  Read my first review to understand more of the great atmosphere of Guu.

I usually order off their special menu as you will find some really interesting takes on traditional Japanese izakaya dishes.  Anything deep fried on the menu is incredibly well done... crispy, hot, and not a speck of drenched oil.  Flavours are always bold and interesting.  Grilled items always come with the right amount of crispy char.  

Okonomiyaki - A must order here... first, second, third, AND fourth time ordering this... ALWAYS good.  Super crispy exterior gives way to creamy soft interior that is filled with tender octopus pieces.  It's layered with a bold umami bomb of a sauce.  One of my Japanese favourite dishes in Toronto. 5/5

Crispy cauliflower - Super crispy tender florets of cauliflower that are lightly tempura battered and fried golden.  Just a good overall dish to say you ate vegetables.  The yuzu mayo gives it the bright citrus kick and creamy sauce to make it more indulgent.  4.5/5

Kale Gomaee - Yes... it's kale ... and it's cold even.  But it's doused in the most wonderful black sesame sauce.  This time it was a bit tooo salty but usually it's more balanced and a great nutty sauce.  Im pretty sure Im eating this more for the sauce than the vegetable 4/5

Ikapiri - Another great seafood dish that takes tender squid and tempuras them to ridiculously wonderful crispiness and then dunks them into a spicy sauce that screams red.  It does bring the heat but it brings a great flavour of hot, a tinge sweetness, and a mild touch of acidity.  It's just your best hot wing idea elevated to something better 5/5

Aburi style mackerel - ohhhh yes.  A nice smokiness to the very flavourful meaty mackerel.  Loved the fact that the mackerel was vinegared and aged to give it a better deeper flavour.  Fresh fish for sushi is not always a good thing!  5/5

Tempura banana dusted with kinako (?) and a nice scoop of matcha ice cream - A nice end to the meal.  Perfectly sweet and soft bananas are fried to perfection (again!).  The sweet and yet mildly bitter matcha was the perfect match ... hot & cold.. lightly bitter & sweet.  Just great bites after great bites.  5/5

I honestly cannot find another place in Toronto that offers such amazing quick service to phenomenal food at such a great value.  With an ever changing menu that reflects seasonally, I would never get bored.  This place is safely in my top favourite places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the authenticity during the initial greet. Friendly staff and specials every day. Pressed sushi is to die for! And each experience is sweet and cozy."}
{"text":"There aren't words.   It's amazing food and a fun lively atmosphere.  Tons of birthdays .  Sit at the counter, it's nice and warm and fun to see what's going on.  Be part if the experience !"}
{"text":"Baked clams were excellent and served quite fast. Very nice, welcoming atmosphere and great service. All of the staff made sure to greet us and bid us farewell. Owner was very friendly and did sake bombs with us!"}
{"text":"After a very disappointing certain Okinawan izakaya... we had to get a second dinner somewhere... this place doesn't disappoint for us. Atmosphere, service and food.

Also Japanese craft beer!"}
{"text":"I went to Guu  recently as part of a group. Guu is a restaurant unlike any other Asian restaurant I have been to . They have a quaint dimly lit space with wooden seats. The  servers welcome you with a loud welcome and if your table orders sake bombs be prepared to hear chants of ' Sake... Bomb   Sake..... Bomb..   We had a bunch of  well cooked items such as a  Miso Chanko nabe hot pot , saba sushi,  beef skewers ,  and sashimis such as tuna, mackarel,hotate, octopus  and salmon . The experience was excellent and unforgettabl.  I liked the Izakaya concept since the table orders a bunch of dishes and you try a little bit of each. I will be back again  for some more Guu because Guu is Guud!!!

My word of advice is  not take non adventurous people  for such occasions as it hampers the experience for the adventurous. Be strategic in what  your order.  Luckily the group I was with was adventurous so we were able to enjoy what we did  ."}
{"text":"The food was terrific (similar to other Izakaya's in the city). 
The service was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Honestly, one of the worst services in Toronto I've received. We went on a Monday at 7PM. It wasn't busy when we arrived, but the waitress took FOREVER to come for anything! The food delivery was also slower than expected. 
I likely won't return to this location for this pure fact. Shame."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent staff, and great food! You can feel the energy as soon as you walk in. The service was fast and friendly and most importantly the food was all very tasty and one of the chefs even came by to ask how we liked the torched salmon he prepared for us. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"While our overall dining experience at Guu Parkdale was pleasant and positive (it was our first time here), we felt there was a room for improvement in terms of food and menu selection.

It's not entirely fair to compare Guu to a real izakaya in Japan or even to any pub or restaurant near an ocean where fresher seafood is readily available at a better price, but izakaya food should be more affordable offering a wider selection (after all an izakaya is a casual pub for after-work cheap eats & drinks enjoyed by your average Joes and Janes, right?)

Having said that, Guu's Hotate (sea scallop) sashimi and Maguro Tataki (lightly seared tuna) were very good by Toronto's standards: fresh, juicy, sweet and relatively generous in portion. Their service was prompt and servers were all friendly, cheerful and attentive. Cocktails were delightful. Their sake selection was limited but what we had was nice. But Blow-torched cured mackerel pressed sushi was very fishy. Its rice was cold and mushy too. Other dishes were not jaw-dropping but good however.

We just wish Guu would be more like a real izakaya in Japan and offer a wider variety of small but yummy dishes and drinks at better prices so that we could stop in with our friends whenever we feel like it without worrying about our wallets."}
{"text":"Fun, vibrant, eclectic atmosphere. Excellent food with a twist.  Not your typical Japanese restaurant."}
