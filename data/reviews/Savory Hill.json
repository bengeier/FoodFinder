{"text":"I don't know why everyone says dinner wasn't fast enough. We went had some wine, relaxed and enjoyed. If you are looking for quick service go to eat n park. The short ribs were great and so was the staff. Wine glasses were kept full. No complaining here. We had a table of 8 and I would say we were there about and hour and a half. Will definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"On 12/12/13 I was looking for a place to celebrate our anniversary. We have trouble this time of year because most places have boisterous holiday parties. I called my first 2 choices to see if we could have a quiet intimate dinner, both said they were crowded with loud parties. Looked through the Enjoy book and found this place, I called and explained what I was looking  for and was assured they could meet our needs. Had a waitress in training with the trainer, one was named Courtney( name on receipt). They were excellent!               The food was fantastic. We met the Chef/owner and he came out to see how we felt about the food. Then they surprised us with a dessert for our anniversary. The atmosphere, service, and food are great!"}
{"text":"Newly open and we were curious.  Above and beyond my expectations.   Not nearly as pricey as Yelp rates it. Three money signes is too much, two would do. Relaxed atmosphere, good service and amazing food. You can get a great dinner for around 15 to 20 bucks  or lunch for 10 to 15 depending on how you go.  I highly recommend it.  Get there before others catch on and you can't get a table."}
{"text":"We live in the area and didn't know about this new place until recently. Food and service very good - recommend the duck confit nachos and fried chicken. Nice draft beer and wine by the glass. We will be back."}
{"text":"Has pretty standard menu, nothing too special or unique. I tried the chicken sandwich and while it was good, nothing special. That's kind of the whole review of this place: nothing special. Nothing bad, but nothing special either. It was a little pricey for what you get though."}
{"text":"Very good food! Big fan of their steak salad. The fries that come on the salad were amazing! Always have had a good meal here.  Sadly they closed on May 31, 2014 :("}
{"text":"Food is fantastic albeit portions are small.  Service on the other hand is horribly slow.  Two tables of patrons in the place and desert took 15 minutes as did the second glass of wine. I know costs are costs but don't let me see the bartender bending over measuring my wine."}
{"text":"For Moon Township, Savory Hill is a good option for some seasonal cuisine.  My 3 star rating is based off the fact that Moon has very few options.  If it was Downtown it would probably get a 2 star rating. The decor is sophisticated and classy.  The  food however is only average at best from my one experience.    We had the duck nachos that other reviewers have recommended and it was pretty good.  It had a good balance of savory duck and cheese with nice touch of cranberries to add some sweet notes.  As my entrée I had a cherry and pistachio stuffed chicken.  It was a little dry and the \"stuffing\" only covered about a quarter of the chicken breast.  The seasonal vegetables that came with the dish were average at best but the mashed potatoes and the glaze on the chicken were quite good.   My girlfriend had the smoked shrimp salad and she was underwhelmed by it.  The shrimp didn't really have any smoke taste to them and when she checked with the waitress if she received the right shrimp the chef came out and explained that the smoke on the shrimp was very light due to other smokey elements in the dish.   That didn't make much sense to us but I don't want to question his artistic vision. She also had the French Onion soup which she really liked.  Overall I would say it was pretty much what I expected since I wasn't expecting much.  I would probably go back again and give it a second try because I there were definitely some good moments and I like to support local business.  Also considering there are very few good options in Moon I hope Savory Hill can survive and get better!"}
{"text":"Really good food, excellent service, quiet atmosphere. Desert was worth going back for in itself. In fact,  there was a reserved table for seven where these folks came only for coffees and deserts."}
{"text":"I waited to go to Savory Hill to make sure they were up and running. However, the food was not good. I had a braised short rib and risotto. The short rib was tough and had no seasoning or sauce. I sent the risotto back, it was crunchy and served in a big solid glop. The \"chef\" sent me a message with the server that the crunch must have been a piece of onion. Uh, no, dude, it was the risotto. The meal was not worth the $19 I paid!  That also sums up the dessert. Overpriced and not tasty.  With food like this I doubt it will be open much longer."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the west hills. We made a reservation and were seated promptly . The Waite staff was attentive but not suffocating. They were very knowledgeable regarding the menu and how the entrees were prepared. Both the Coconut Mahi and Garlic Herb Shrimp were excellent the portions were so big we took desert to go. I plan on being a regular customer."}
{"text":"After arriving in the Pittsburgh area, before our flight to Texas tomorrow morning, we decided to dine at Savory Hill.  Nice restaurant that has been open since February.  My wife had a cup of southwest corn bisque and a grilled chicken salad.  Very good.  I had a crock of French onion soup and the very interesting and tasty duck nachos.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had all year and I travel 90% from Chicago.   I wanted to do shots of the Caesar dressing for a green salad with marinated olives and tomatoes that were delicious.  The weekly special menu Blackberry glazed duck was only bested by the corn risotto and root vegetable sides.  YUM!  I eat gluten free so my desert choices were limited as usual, but the deconstructed berry creme brûlée was very good.  I can't say enough about the staff and chef.  5 star dining at 3.5 star pricing... Nothing better for miles around.  Oh, yeh great reasonable wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Best proprietary casual eatery in Moon Township! The chef-owner formerly ran the large party banquet business at Heinz Field. Two separate dining experiences yielded thumbs up from all attendees. Palate, proportions, and price -- all were agreeable. The wait staff seem to be locals and will benefit from a bit more experience in anticipating a diners need: never should food be delivered prior to cutlery; drinking glasses should not be touched at the rim; the specials and beer list should be memorized before approaching the table; etc. The interior is large with both booths and tables. Decor is a bit TJMaxx wall art but pleasant enough and clean. Fingers crossed this place will survive -- the price point is just a few bucks above the local Denny's/Eat-n-Park kind of menu and not that much more impressive, but with luck the locals hopefully will be supportive enough to overlook the comparison. We will return!!!"}
{"text":"This just might be the best restaurant in the West Hills.  Impressive menu and the food was delicious.  We had the braised short rib with asparagus risotto and the monk fish special.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner and wine experience. Loved it !  The owner and her husband are lovely hosts!    Next week I will celebrate my husband's 60th birthday  Savory Grill  !  I may even pay the bill all by myself.  LOL. Laura and Bob Foster, Moon Township"}
{"text":"The food was really good, some of the prices were a little steep though. I would definitely recommended Savory though. Service is very good."}
{"text":"We stopped by Savory Hill for lunch.  A little out of the way, we were car shopping in Moon when we found this place.  Owner Tom Langan has been around the block.  He attended The Pennsylvania Institute of Culinary Arts and completed his \"externship\" at the Ritz Carlton Naples.  A couple more stops in Florida and he was back in Western PA, working as the executive chef at \"The Country Club\" in Meadville, PA.  Next up, he was back in Pittsburgh the Executive Chef at \"Sunny Ledge Boutique Hotel\" and then on to Heinz Field.  He has now achieved his dream of opening his own restaurant.  The interior of the restaurant has soaring ceilings, lots of light.  Although fairly stark, it's fresh and clean.  They feature farm to table, mainly using a farm across the border in Ohio.  All dishes can be customized.  Courtney, our server was great.  She helped me reconfigure my sandwich to my specifications with great suggestions.  In the end, I was getting a freshly carved turkey sandwich with a warm potato salad side.  BJ went with one of the daily specials.  He got a short rib omelet with the best ever breakfast potatoes.  Beer draft choices were decent, BJ had Blue Moon Winter.  Sure, a good lunch is easy to accomplish, so next time, we will be back for dinner.  While there, we reviewed the menu.  Everything looks good and we can't wait to return."}
