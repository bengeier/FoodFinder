{"text":"Went here at 843pm the cashier said they were closed. When asked what time they closed she said \"right now\". So... she could serve her friends who were in front of me but then decide to close at 843pm!! Uncalled for! The hoirs are listed as closing at 10pm. Won't be back and I will make sure to spread the word about the terrible cashiers attitude and even her appearance was unprofessional."}
{"text":"The cashier who works here, is so rude, has a horrible attitude and ruins my whole experience. Charleys has a reward program where you can do their survey and get a free combo upgrade next visit. Well this cashier is not familiar with this program because she seems to have a problem every time I try to give my receipt to her for a free upgrade. It does not disclose on the receipt that there is a limit or that you need to spend a specific amount. Then the cashier speaks about me in Spanish not knowing I could understand her. This place doesn't need someone like that working here."}
{"text":"It had been years since I'd had Charley's, and up until recently, I'd thought the only Charley's was across the street from Paradise Valley Mall. 

Anywho, they're known for being the anti-Subway. If you want healthy food, go elsewhere. Preferably far away from me. Charley's brings the meat and cheese, and all of the accompanying grease and future heart trouble that accompanies it. Those like myself who possess the metabolism of a hummingbird on crystal meth will eat it all the same. 

I have to confess to having only tried two of their sandwiches. I have a routine going whereby I resolve to 'try something new'.. only to be immediately distracted by how utterly delicious the Philly Cheese Steak looks and ultimately going with that. 

One day I did manage to shake myself out of that beef-fueled stupor long enough to get their buffalo chicken sandwich and I must say.. it was absolutely delicious. They're just good on every level, if a bit pricey. Their fries, though, are nice and cheap. You can buy chicken bacon ranch fries (if that's your thing) for a little under 2 dollars. 

The negative? Their drinks are microscopic. They might as well not even give you one. I've seen sippy cups larger than their 'regular' drinks. All the same, it really is surprising to see such a high quality sandwich shop inside Chris Town. Just one of many welcome surprises I discovered during my recent visit there."}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the food and service at lunch today. I had a teriyaki chicken salad and my spouse had the turkey sandwich. Both were delicious, but the fresh french fries were amazing! We had a pleasant lunch for under $20. P.S. Eunice was very helpful in answering my questions, so thanks!"}
{"text":"I must have got the same cashier as Tammy C.  I swipe my card and was trying to enter my email address when the cashier spun the kiosk around and cancelled me entering my address then enforced the system to print a receipt right away.

The food was acceptable and the fries are excellent but the terrible customer service makes me not want to go there again!

Saturday morning 9:30."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. My only knock against them is the serving sizes. Servings are small. 
Service is also on the shady side, but it is in a mall. 

It's a nice change of pace if you get sick of the Costco Food Court once in a while."}
{"text":"Food court options at Christown Spectrum Mall are limited. Costco junk food, a scurvy McDonalds ala Walmart at the other end of the mall and Charley's. 
This Philly Steak place is decent. Limited menu. Cooked fresh to order, you can have steak or chicken or pepperoni.  Add sauces like teriyaki, buffalo. There's turkey club available, too. People seem to order a lot of the loaded gourmet (really? You're calling it Gourmet? I say nay nay) cheese fries.
Coke soda products and fresh lemonade/fresh fruit lemonade and ice tea. 
You're not going to escape for less than $5 for a 6\" hoagie. Add $2 for drink,(sm) or to make it a combo w/drink and fries another $3-4 dollars.  There is no kid's meal sandwich but instead 3 chicken tenders and fries. 
Meat Portions are on the small size. Fries were crisp, hot and tasty. 3 man crew and they were customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Soda was flat. Cheese steak was alright not the greatest. All in all would probably not come back again."}
{"text":"I was doing some lunch hour shopping at Christown mall and stopped by at Charlie's for a bite to eat.  I ordered the Chicken Philly.  I wasn't too impressed by the sandwich. The chicken, onions and peppers were flavorless. Maybe they forgot to add some salt?  I'm not sure what seasonings go on a Philly type sandwich but it was missing which was unfortunate since the bun was the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft inside. However, the fries were fresh, crispy, cheese and bacon with a drizzle of sour cream were on point.   Lemonade was great too.   

I will have to go back and try a different sandwich and see how I like that."}
{"text":"Isn't the best Charley's I've eaten at. It's inside the mall and there are tables to eat at next to the restaurant, but they are sticky. IDK how often they clean the tables but I suggest you take the food over to the Costco tables to eat at. Much cleaner there."}
{"text":"I've been here several and I've only had their regular Philly cheese steak. Its located inside Spectrum Mall. They don't use chezwhiz but the sandwiches are pretty good. I have heard that there special fries are good too but I haven't tried them yet. Unfortunately there aren't a lot of tables/seats so you may want to get your food to go or scope out the available seating. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food came out quickly fresh and hot everyone was nice and friendly only knock was garbage cans were full not sure it's there or the malls job to empty."}
{"text":"So, its Friday night and the hubs and I need to make a Costco run. We figure we will grab a hot dog or slice of pizza at Costco, but apparently Costco food court is the place to be on a Friday night, the line was crazy town long. 

Before I blacked out and went into a hunger induced rage, the hubs escorted me over to the Charleys Grilled Sub area. I was hesitant, but couldn't muster up the will power to stand in the costco line and not get stabby. 

I ordered the Chicken Philly. It was ok. The bread was the best part of the sandwich, Hubs and I split a drink and an order of frys. 

The frys came with oozy cheese and nasty bacon. Super gross. BUT if you like fake cheese ooze and fake bacon crumbles then these are for you. 

The tables that surround the Charleys area were all soooo filthy. I wiped one clean with a napkin and noticed everyone else who came to eat here had to wipe a table clean. The employee's clearly do not care to make a clean space for customers to eat. I know this is a food court-ish setting (However its just Charleys and Costco and costco has their own tables) someone needs to be wiping these tables down. Even if its not ever customer, at least make an attempt. 

At any rate, I do not believe I will be eating here again. I will stand in the long Costco line. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Charley's has great subs. Cost a bit more than Subway but they are so good. They offer regular fries or you can get them with bacon and cheese. Service is great. Their is only 7 tables so hopefully you get lucky enough to sit down."}
{"text":"Pretty good and a step above most fast food. Buffalo chicken sub with lettuce and tomatoes was solid and good-- enough for 2 meals."}
{"text":"I haven't had their sandwiches but had to post a review based on the Gourmet Fries. 

In a word: Awesome!! 

There are five options of Gourmet Fries from which to choose: Original, Cheddar, Cheddar and Bacon, Ranch and Bacon or Cheddar, Ranch and Bacon. I was looking for a light snack to hold me over until dinner and hour and a half later, so I bought the Cheddar and Bacon. Oh, I have butterflies in my stomach just thinking about how good this was. Yeah, it's the processed cheddar cheese and those bacon bits are certainly processed. But I'm not going to a mall eatery to find something authentic. What's tops is, I was able to get my fries to go so I could carry them with me to Sally's where Bas bought hair color (that bitch is younger than me and always points it out, but is going grey already.) Afterwards, we walked through Wal-Mart where I chowed down on those fries. One would think no one has ever seen a white boy eat cheese laden fries judging by the looks we were getting. The best part was the cashier's expression as I was shovelling forkfuls of fries into my mouth as Bas was buying laxatives. Priceless!"}
{"text":"I'm a shameless carnivore.  I like it even better when my meat filled sandwich is dripping with melty, gooey cheese.  A little explicit, yeah, but it's the truth.

I've never been to a Charley's other than the one in Christown/Spectrum (call it what you want) but it is so much fun eating my yummy food and watching all the ghetto people and their spawn mill in and out of the sad mall.

The food here is great.  I always get the Bacon 3Cheesesteak, and it is the best.  You can't ask for more salty goodness than this.  The steak stuff is always thin and juicy with plenty of salt.  The bread this stuff comes on is kind of weird and crusty, but the insides make it worth it.  Do yourself a favor and make it a combo so you can get a drink and a big cup full of fresh and hot fries.

I know there quite a few of these around the valley, so if Spectrum scares you, check out one of the other places and get what I order.  Good stuff."}
