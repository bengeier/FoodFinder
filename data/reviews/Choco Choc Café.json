{"text":"Great lunch for all 8 of us. My daughter loved the house made chocolate cake. The owners were so very friendly.  I had a great soup and sandwich and I could not resist ordering the apple cinnamon roll it was excellent. We stopped on our way back east from parc safari. Their chocolate mousse and Oreo cake looked excellent but there just wasn't room to try. Five stars for the food and the very friendly owners who make everything."}
