{"text":"Really really cool place!  I got the shrimp over noodles dish, and my friend got beef over cattle.  Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is awesome!  I'll definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place and I've tried it several times, but the food really lacks flavor. I've had the tacos a couple of times, which were served with stale, dry tortillas. I'm not vegan or vegetarian, so maybe this restaurant is not targeted at someone like me."}
{"text":"I got the ahi sliders and they had a lot of inedible sinew in the them...yuck.  The server was very friendly and attentive, but surprisingly unconcerned about the poor quality of my fish.  My dining partners had the tempeh and turkey burger and enjoyed their selections."}
{"text":"I love to come back here for the refreshing drinks and for the pizza, so far I've been here often enough and their pizza doesn't bother my stomach even with the cheese. I am hooked on the cucumber juice and also their variety on desserts...will need to go back again, it's been almost a year."}
{"text":"Excellent humus, good service, enjoyed the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Love the juice bar! Try the kaleaid. They now have bottled cold pressed juice. It's expensive, but so good."}
{"text":"This place is not good for vegetarians and don't really seem to want to work with you to make anything a healthy vegetarian option that's also tasty.  Beware! Most of their noodle dishes have fish sauce, chicken stock or the like. The server seemed annoyed that I even asked, and also said it wouldn't be possible to have a veggie protein in a salad. Their seitan was one note: salty. Better to try seasons 52 next door, which at least has some flavorful vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and delicious with lots of gluten free options. The natural beef and black rice stir fry was outrageous (not gluten free). My wife had the Panang Curry and based on the rapturous look on her face, she enjoyed hers as well."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for Breakfast on a Sunday while waiting for training at the Apple store close by. I sat at the bar and was very impressed with the staff and how helpful and friendly they were. I ordered the Breakfast scramble and added kale it was delicious!! Its great to know that healthy dosent have to mean bad taste. They let me sample a juice drink Kaleaid and will be getting that next time!!"}
{"text":"Was in town this weekend and my girlfriend and I wanted some good clean eating.  Started with Edamame dumplings and the pomegranate limeade.  Both were very good .  The red chili shrimp entree was basically one of the best noodle dishes I've had in years.  Flavor was perfect and noodles and shrimp perfectly cooked.  Coming from and Asian guy that's a serious compliment.  Overall service was excellent, staff was very pleasant and gave great recommendations.  They even gave us a hummus plate cause it was our first time there"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. After a lack-luster time at a nearby restaurant, we came to True Food. Bartender was  knowledgeable, friendly and quick!  SIDENOTE - bartenders should be speedy. Not rude in how quickly they can serve, but able to handle lots of customers, order all while continuing to do their job.  I'm married to one such bartender so maybe I'm biased!  The prices are great! \"It's happy hour all the time\" cheapest beers I've ever seen in an above average Scottsdale restaurant. Food was very good and get this - healthy!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent - all fresh ingredients  and lots of gluten free options.  Portion sizes are perfect but may be too small for big eaters. I eat here once a week and have never had a bad meal. Personal favorites are the farmers market salad with grilled chicken, rice bowl and turkey burger."}
{"text":"Wide variety of healthy and savory dishes! Great gluten free dishes as well... and their deserts are by far the best GF deserts I've  ever tried. The lasagna dish and summer squash is also the best I've ever tried. It's pretty busy, but they keep it well organized and clean. The waiters are all incredible educated on the dishes and professional. Pleeeassee bring one to SF!"}
{"text":"Always great!  Started with the roasted veggie platter for starters and then split the short ribs and spicy shrimp noodle dish. And they split it for us :) we are never disappointed and our new favorite drink is the cherry bourbon sour. And another 5 stars for our server Dallas!  Thanks for all your suggestions and conversation!!"}
{"text":"Hands down new favorite restaurant EVER! I have never written a review before and I was so impressed by this place that I felt compelled to do so. The sever (don't remember his name) was incredibly nice and helpful. The cucumber martini was super tasty. And the food was INCREDIBLE! I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is a very picky meat and potatoes kind of guy and we were both blown away by the food. I even got him to eat broccoli there and LIKE IT!! Like I said I am in complete awe of this place and in love."}
{"text":"This place was everything and more that one could ask for.  The service was outstanding and the staff very friendly.    Loved the food and would definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"First time visit to Phoenix and this restaurant has been on my wife's bucket list forever. They did not disappoint. I had the mushroom pizza which absolutely melted in the mouth and she had the poke. Both had more flavor than I was expecting. Obviously their approach of fresh, seasonal ingredients plays into the or success. As a topper we had the seasonal squash pie and it was better than any pumpkin pie I've ever had."}
{"text":"Food is definitely fresh had dinner and also had breakfast here (breakfast burrito is very good) Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I would legitimately eat at True Food every night if I could. Everything is so fresh and delicious. It is based off of some inflammatory diet so in general the dishes are on the healthier side, but their are some less healthy options for those who aren't quite on board with the idea yet. The teriyaki quinoa bowl with the grass fed steak is truly amazing and my favorite dish. The ancient grains bowl is awesome as well. My husband gets the burger every time and it's actually incredible. Some of the staff are a bit inattentive, it can be hit or miss. But the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Clean, unique, fresh and appetizing. Was at the E Camelback location last year and hit up the N Scottsdale spot the year and was not disappointed. The serving sizes are just right beginning with the Hummus and Tataki (sp?) Tuna. Not a ton of flavor in the Hummus but the Tuna was spot on but most importantly, prepared and served right. I went with Pomegranate Mule which wasn't too sweet and very refreshing after having hiked Tom's Thumb earlier in the day. Other members of table chose the Thai Grapefruit Martini which after having sampled this gem, will be my next drink at this hip place. Dinner concluded with the Inside Out Quinoa Burger which is something you just don't see anywhere and is as healthy as it is delicious. Despite being a big meat eater the size and sustenance of this vegetarian entree was fabulous. It was a lacking a bit in flavor and I might recommend a touch of heat to spice things up but you definitely won't leave hungry. Other Entree's included the Ancient Grains bowl which was, by far, the most flavorful pick of our visit and will be my next choice when I return. The amount of flavor they packed into the dish was pleasantly surprising.  Finally, when visiting True Foods I would opt for their specialty entrees and steer away from the pizza's which were mediocre at best according to one other member of the party who went with Margherita Pizza. However, I did state when eating at somewhere like True Foods, a pizza should probably not be a top choice given their area of expertise."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch place.  I loved the food.  I ordered the Turkey Pita Sandwich and it was phenomenal, the sweet potato side was awesome as well.  I could not believe how huge the portions were.  I will definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I want to live this place but it's hard.  The food is fresh and nutritionally smart.  The service is nice.  But the portions are so small.  I ordered the lentil soup and it was almost all water with a teaspoon of lentils.  Mentioned it to the server and no action.  $5 for carrot juice but the glass was full of ice.  Really?  Strawberry salad was good if you like lettuce but had a total of three cut up strawberries.  So, Fox restaurants, stop being so cheap on your food cost!!"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant to everybody! The other day my family was in town and it was a \"must\" to take them to True Food Kitchen. We ordered drinks (I got the Pomegranate Acai Mojito), appetizers (Shiitake & Tofu Lettuce Cups), and entrees. I ordered the \"INSIDE OUT\" Quinoa Burger. SO GOOD. It includes hummus, veggies, tzatziki, avocado - all the good stuff. One of my favorite meals i've had in a long time. Everything was so fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh & healthy food!  Visited while on vacation and only wish there was a location on the east coast near me.  My family of four loved everything!"}
{"text":"Glad I tried it!  I had an extremely negative experience at the Biltmore location that I was hesitant to try this location but so glAd that I did!  Delicious food and good service!"}
{"text":"Was the apple crisp better than the edamame guacamole? Actually, the main courses were the best. Regardless, from start to finish this place has such great food. The tastes are amazing! Every single time We go we have great food, good service, and a happy visit. Seems odd to call such a laid back place our favorite restaurant, but it is!"}
{"text":"Another success for Fox Restaurant Concepts, True Food is the place to eat healthy without sacrificing taste. We just stopped by for a late lunch but were impressed by the experience. The wait staff was courteous and friendly, explaining the menu without making us feel like preschoolers. I tried the cucumber lemonade, which once you get past the deep green color, was pleasantly sweet and tangy with a pronounced cucumber flavor. The very definition of refreshing. When we told our server we'd be sharing the Green Tea Soba Noodles, he split the dish into half servings at no extra charge. The noodles were tender and hot, accompanied by a shitakes, broccoli, bok choy and pea pods all immersed in a salty ginger-soy broth. We also tried the sweet potato hash, a sauteed blend of dice potato, onion, olive oil and black pepper. Again, delicious. Since I'm this impressed after only three items, I look forward to going back for more."}
{"text":"This place was fun. I'm always looking for healthy restaurants that use as many fresh and natural ingredients as possible. I loved the ginger soda, i could definitely taste the fresh ginger."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved True Food. Everything so fresh and flavorful. I had the Mediterranean Quinoa salad."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the bomb. I get their turkey pita wrap and it is good. The fox concept restaurants are taking over the biltmore and im okay with that because for the most part the food is a good value. But you have to be nuts or have too much money to get any of their drinks. Six bucks for a juice? I'll pass."}
{"text":"This is the original True Food Kitchen location. Great space and a friendly informed team. I like the fresh concocted sodas and teas."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The food is delicious and the drinks are just as good. The Medicine Man natural refresher is my fave and the winter ingredient salad is amazing...sadly, it's no longer in season but there's plenty of other choices. Customer service is just as important and they do a great job - friendly and knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"We went to lunch at true food for the first time this afternoon. It just wasn't worth the hype. The food was good but not outstanding. I got the   mediterranean salad and it was ok. I could have made it at home and been just as happy. The asparagus pizza was good but same thing I could have bought a ball of dough and made it at home just as easy. Service was good tho!"}
{"text":"Food - A... Service D-... We went Monday for my BDay, Food as usual was great. Dawn our server was horrible. She was rude, forgetful, and seemed to not care about anything that pertained to doing her job properly. We had to rely on other servers, expediters, etc., in order to receive what we had ordered. Luckily my company made the night great since our experience here was disappointing.  Not sure if we will return... if we do, we will make sure to not sit in Dawn's section."}
{"text":"True food kitchen is one of my favourite places to eat in Scottsdale.  The menu varies by season and its amazing how such healthy food can be so tasty and so reasonably priced. The outdoor patio is a great spot for people watching and having a few cocktails in the warm evenings.  I could sit there for hours. Love it!"}
{"text":"Chicken chop salad is a must try. With so many dinner options in Scottsdale it's surprising that I've chosen True Food about 50x. This is our go-to place for quality whole foods with perfect portions. We always leave feeling good. The service is great too which can be hard to come by around here.   It's children's menu is great! My 2-year old loves their pizza. She won't eat delivery now because she knows what GOOD pizza tastes like. Way to make a lifetime customer True Food!  I love taking out-of-towners here. Especially those who normally like a gut-bomb at dinner. Their relieved satisfaction at the end of the meal always makes me feel good. That, combined with the tasty food in my tummy :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I come back home and visit Phoenix, this is the number 1 restaurant I want to visit. A ton of healthy (actually healthy, not fake healthy like many 'organic' food restaurants), creative options that are extremely tasty. Always have great service; every, single time (out of a dozen or so visits). Servers have unique personalities.  A little expensive (not too bad), but worth it if you want tasty, healthy food that is a little special, but not so rich that you fill sick afterwards. (healthy, fresh food can be expensive, even if you cook your self)  I've enjoyed everything I've tried, but I especially recommend:  Edamame Dumplings (like edamame ravioli with truffle oil; so delightful and light) Turkey Bolognese (filling entree if your hungry for brown rice pasta) Crudites: Perfectly al dente veggies  Salads: Liked all of the ones I've tried!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the edamame dumplings and fall ingredient salad. It was veggie filled, vegetarian, delicious and affordable. My fiancé had the Mediterranean salad with chicken. I was pleased by the service, taste, ambiance and price. I will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"True Food was a truly unique dining experience. I loved the idea of going to a restaurant where you could feel good about everything on the menu in terms of its healthfulness.  I loved the vibe and decor of the restaurant. Natural. Fresh. Healthy. Colorful. Happy.   In my party we enjoyed the following selections: - Shaved turkey, provolone, tomato, cucumbers... warm pita - Grilled Salmon sandwich - Half chicken with farro - Wild shrimp pizza - Apple Crumble (do not have the exact menu name) - Chocolate cake (do not have the exact menu name) - Blood orange and olive oil cake (do not have the exact menu name)  They were all delicious. I only wish we could have tried more items from the menu.   I highly recommend you try True Food. It seems like a perfect lunch choice, but would also be good for dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, high prices  Love the idea and the concept; however, the vegan options are not very appetizing.  The guacamole appetizer was bland and sour.  The vegan pizza was alright, would have rather had a pizza from Whole Foods grocery.  Service was perfect which is why I gave 4 stars"}
{"text":"Delicious from the exotic cocktails, to the appetizers, main entree, and desserts with vegan ice cream on top! First time at this restaurant and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YUMMM! We go to True Food for lunch as often as we possibly can! Love it! Natural, whole foods prepared to perfection. My fave: Kale Salad with Grilled Salmon. Simple and delicious. Hubby's fave: grilled turkey burger with a side of kale salad and the sweet potato hash. Their fresh squeezed juices are wonderful.  Somewhat slow service can be overlooked considering the delicous eats! If service was improved, would have a solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"When I try several times, at all kinds of random times of the day during their business hours, to even get sat down at a table.. and cannot, then this place is doing just fine without me. Thanks for nothing Tru Food."}
{"text":"High Prices. Cheap portions.  I ordered the heirloom tomato and watermelon salad.  Received a bowl half filled with huge chunks of tomato and watermelon along with 1 tiny dot of goat cheese, 2 cashews and 2 scraps of basil.  Not much for $12.  I also ordered 2 $10 martinis.  Maybe a thimble of Ketel One in each.  Two people = $100 tab and blah food.  Bummer.  Won't be back.  Too many other tasty options out there for that kind of scratch."}
{"text":"Love the Mediterranean Quinoa salad with Salmon and avocado... Also love the spaghetti squash lasagna... Love that this location has Juby True juice bar attached to it so you can order their blended smoothies with your meal. Chia seed pudding is awesome for desert and they even have a hot cocktail during winter made with almond milk. I've been coming here for years, it's a favorite!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place so much. Unfortunately the last few times I have been here the food quality and service has gone downhill. I most recently ordered the bison burger which was my favorite of all time. I ordered it medium rare and came out well done with and stale bun, same for my wife. I hope they improve but I worry they are too busy to worry about quality. Too bad, puts a bad taste in my mouth for Fox restaurants and their care for quality customer experience, especially when your spending a premium. I hope they take a good look at what they are doing and get back to their roots. I rated 3 stats because the intention is good with natural, local and organic. I will be back but not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I kept dancing whenever I took a bite of food, it was like VICTORY, I am being healthy and this is still delicious! The menu has a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options, so, just for fun, I tried to make my meal both! I started with the Harvest Chopped salad, which was very good, even though the extras definitely outnumbered the actual number of salad leaves. Then I got the spaghetti squash dish. It was not over-the-top awesome, but it came out hot, the portion was just right, and it was very comforting.   The drink options (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are also very fun! The dessert menu even comes with a tea menu! I was charmed.  I like this location better than the original one, the space feels more open because it's a free standing building with a patio all around it. It was also fun because while we were waiting for a table we could go check out the other fun Scottsdale Quarter shops!   The only downside is that this, like most Fox restaurants, is very loud because of the open floor plan. So be ready to yell at your date from across the table  (\"HOW IS IT?\"  \"WHAT?\"  \"HOW IS IT?\"  \"I DIDN'T ORDER FISH?\"... you get the idea)."}
{"text":"Ate an early dinner here on Sunday before our scheduled movie at iPic.  The interior reminds me of Jamba Juice - same color scheme.    Our server was Caitlin and she's very knowledgeable about the menu items.  She recommended the grilled shrimp spring rolls as a starter, but apparently that item is very popular and they were out.    We opted to start with the Thai shrimp dumplings ($11), which consisted of diced shrimp, basil, mint, and jalapeno.  The dumplings were served in a sweet and sour sauce, which I believe was made out of fish sauce (think Vietnamese nuoc cham).  The dumplings were light, refreshing and very good.  I ordered the red chilli shrimp for my entree ($18), which consisted of gai lan (Chinese kale), spinach, Shiitake mushrooms, and sesame noodles stir-fried in a spicy sauce.  This was DELICIOUS!  Just the right amount of sweet, salty and heat. The shrimps were huge and cooked perfectly.   To be honest, I was surprised at how \"Asian tasting\" this entree was.    My friend ordered the spaghetti squash casserole ($13), which consisted of shredded squash, tomato, zucchini, and loads of mozzarella - baked to gooey goodness.  I'm not much of a cheese gal, but the couple of bites I had of this was pretty tasty.  I liked the consistency of the \"squash spaghetti\".    I enjoyed the dinner experience here and left feeling like I did my body good.  ;P"}
{"text":"Being vegan, it is very hard to find good healthy restaurants in this city that offer vegetarian and vegan options. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Took an out of town friend for dinner last night.  What a hit.  The Curry dish and Ravioli with kale were our choices and were superb.  Just wish the west side had choices like this but it's worth the drive for healthy, organic food that makes you go ahhhhh!"}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends during Restaurant Week, and I have to say that I didn't LOVE it.  The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu, but the food itself wasn't AWESOME.  It was kind of like, Ok.  I tried the place, but I'm in no rush to return anytime soon.  I also wasn't particularly impressed by our waitress.  She was a bit too perky and a bit too in-your-face about the greatness of True Food.  I love everything that True Food stands for, but there was something that was a bit snooty about the environment.  There was so much emphasis on the greatness of True Food that I was kind of turned off by it.    I will say, though, that the natural refresher drinks are really good.  I had the cucumber refresher with cucumber and honey lemonade.  Highly recommend.   Not too much cucumber taste and just enough honey lemonade that it wasn't too sweet.  Here's my overall rating:  Food: Meh. Price: Not awesome, but tolerable. Parking: No problem. Service: Not impressed. Ambience: A bit too trendy. Chefs: Cute.  Also particularly questionable to me was: who the hell is Dr. Weil?  Where I come from, he's a foot doctor.  Apparently around these parts, he's some bigger dude that is qualified to discuss healthy living.  Hm..."}
{"text":"Omg their food was so healthy and fresh. The atmosphere was so inviting and interesting! I loved how u walk in and see them making the food! Another thing i loved was how the food is all natural and healthy! We ordered the cucumber refresher and it was so refreshing and nice to enjoy! It wasn't sweet or nasty it was perfect! Me and my friend ordered a pizza and salad and we shared both of the items and it was delicious. The prices was reasonable like 35 total"}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a very health conscious and picky family member. Delicious healthy food and very friend staff. I ordered edamame dumplings and a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken for take out. It was a short wait and the food was amazing. Also had the Hangover RX which tastes like a healthy version of an Orange Julius drink in the best possible way. I would return when back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love almost the whole menu . Desert didnt make me feel bloated yah. The blueberry cobbler with Greek yogurt is awesome . Me and my fiancée go twice a month , yes they are crowded but it's so worth it"}
{"text":"Some pictures and brief descriptions of our breakfast: http://www.donidexter.com/blog/?p=1424  Knew what to expect, having been here once before.  This time though we went for breakfast on a weekday.  Breakfast is \"casual\" as the host kept saying, substitutions are not allowed since we were told that dishes are prepared in advance.  You order and pay at the counter for breakfast.  Service was spotty, once seated you are left alone and some parties were noticeably frustrated not to get any table service.  The breakfast menu, like the regular menu, had some vegan options which were clearly marked on the menu.  The vegan smoothies were refreshing, well balanced in terms of flavor and nutrition and the perfect size.  These were the highlights of our meal.  We had the Green Monster (Apple Juice, Carrot, Kale, Cucumber, Olivello) and the Morning Glory (Apple Juice, Strawberry, Coconut, Banana).  The food was forgettable, nothing stood out on any of our three plates but we still left full without the discomfort of a heavy meal.  Pros:  Correct portions, which leave you full and satisfied without being uncomfortable The food is fresh and simple Nice, clean, simple build out in a space that isn't crowded and large enough to accommodate the crowds Cons: Service is unremarkable The food can be a little plain to the point that you find yourself reciting the line \"it's healthy\" when prompted for your opinion."}
{"text":"Liked the theme, didn't care for the execution.  Portions were scant, prices not commensurate with value.  All three diners were disappointed.  Left still hungry."}
{"text":"When thinking of Scottsdale,I can't wait to return to satisfy my craving for True Food Kitchen's Kale Salad.  It's so simple;  why can't I duplicate it?  My husband  has found a dish that he too enjoys.  The turkey lasagna is ooey gooey and quite delicious.  He no longer tells me to go myself after I go to the Apple Store across the street.  There is always a line at lunchtime but the counter and hightop are first come/first served so you can always  get a quick lunch if you don't want to wait.  The ambiance is great!  The open air feeling and lovely outdoor seating surrounding the restaurant is quite beautiful, perfect for Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Weak.  I mean if you want a 'theme restaurant' worshipping Andrew Weil, you may love it.  If you're looking for a healthy, organically-conscious restaurant with flavor, MEH, not so much.  I spent a lot of money, heard a lot of talking about the food, but when the entrees hit the stage, I was thoroughly underwhelmed.  They talked a big game, but when it came to what was important, the very thing I'd put up with rotten service as long as it's absolutely killer, the food, did not perform."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix from Florida, and I wish we had one of these restaurants. I'm vegan, and it is usually very challenging for me to find places that offer tasty options for both vegans and meat eaters. I am so excited that our family brought us here-not only are there multiple vegan selections, but everything I had was superb. The kale guac is a must-great flavor combinations and sizeable for an appetizer. I ordered the butternut squash pizza for my main course, and was again impressed by the flavor. It was almost too much food, but seriously good. I also had an apple soda (can't remember the exact menu name), and that was enjoyable as well. I heard no complaints from anyone at my table either, and we had great service. :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I'd give it 5 stars but I've had a couple of dishes that I didn't care for. Just a person taste thing. The chia pudding is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"In town for a couple days, and found this place.  It's such a great change from the usual food you'll find in a mall, because it's healthy, and it's a big change from most healthy restaurants, because it's super tasty.  We started with the Shitake Tofu Lettuce Cups, then the Thai Green Papaya Salad, and the Autumn Ingredient dish that was listed in the salads, but was all roasted veggies.  Our server was super helpful and friendly.  Service was quick, the outside patio was a pleasant place to eat."}
{"text":"Like any other of Sam's restaurants, the atmosphere is lively and service is great.  Food, however, is boring and bland. I guess because the idea is to keep it true."}
{"text":"ate here two nights ago with family. recommended by locals, stayed true to word! great company!  Todd McDoodle"}
{"text":"Wonderful as always. Made immediate accomadations on Xmas eve. Food was great, service lovely. Had 2 different pizza, chicken with fennel and Brussels spout with mushrooms. Lovely lasagna with a rich flavor ricotta filling."}
{"text":"I started eating lunch at True Food. The salads combinations are varied and delicious. And filling.  In one month I lost 10 pounds without even trying. It doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"I went there with my cousin and my GF and we got there around 8pm and they said it would be about 10-15 mins.  We all sat down around 830.  We ordered the veggie app which was really good.  I ended up ordering the Mediterranean chopped salad with steak.  My friend she ordered the same thing but with chicken and my cousin she ordered the turkey burger.  When the food came they brought me the wrong salad with dairy and I didn't realize it.  Luckily the waitress caught it and replaced it with the correct salad and she comped the salad which was really nice.   The food was great and i recommend it.  However the salad was terribly small.  I left hungry and a bit frustrated. All and all the experience the setting and the wait staff were pleasant and nice.  The salad was very good just very small.  I will come back again but order another item from the menu next-time."}
{"text":"Got the buffalo burger. Truly a good burger. A little pricey but nice cool atmosphere and great service.  Felt healthy after eating there although I doubt my burger was healthy at all"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always delicious and the portioning is always right. I've been to the Biltmore location as well but I like the North Scottsdale location much more. I get the shrimp and sundried tomato pizza with chicken instead of the shrimp and always leave full and happy! My one concern is the price of some of the beverages... (Three dollars for a honey lemonade, really?)"}
{"text":"The charred cauliflower with dates, mint, and pistachio was delicious. Also enjoyed the Kale guac and steak tacos very much. The spaghetti squash bake was good but not worth going out of your way for.   I think we got there at the beginning of a dinner rush and had a fairly new server. He did a good job but the timeliness was hit or miss.   There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan and gluten free options. They are accustomed to handling food allergies."}
{"text":"Well, here it is...my first review.   The Good: Incredibly friendly staff. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender were great! Wish they hired people like them everywhere.  The Bad: The reason that I know they are all so nice was that it took at least 45 minutes to be seated. Allowing enough time to meet everyone who has even thought about applying there.   The Good: The food was good as well as being fairly healthy.  The Bad: No matter how many ways it can be prepared, Kale(sp?) is never going to be a part of my diet.   Overall, If you don't mind waiting for trendy Cafeteria's with better food then your old high school, this is the place for you!! Very much the place to be right now. I'm happy I went and it wasn't bad for one dinner but won't be going back anytime soon.   I am however, officially convinced that the restaurant is better then this review...."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Very health conscious and affordable! Nice atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love True Food! I never feel gross or heavy after eating here - even if we get dessert. I was once a vegan and have many family members that still are and this place is truly for all pallets and diet restrictions. The hangover cure or the root remedy are my favorite starter juices and the curry is amazing. My children even love the salad, veggie app, sloppy joe, and pizza on the kids menu. My husband and I typically order curry or salmon with sweet potato hash and kale salad. Highly recommend! Who cares if people say this place is trendy. If eating heathy delicious food is a trend then sign me up to eating at True Food! Thanks again Dr. Weil"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food, funky vibe and tons of gluten-free options. Love this place! We had Moroccan chicken, roasted veggie salad with blackened salmon and squash lasagna- all equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I get something different and I am always impressed by the flavor combination.  This last time we got their butternut squash pizza...I know sound weird right!? But it was delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time that I went to True Food, it was love at first sight.  A year later, I am still in love.  This place is fabulous!  I'm surprised that they don't have better reviews.  Their drinks are delicious!  I like Andy's elixir and the one that is like homemade ginger ale.  They also have a great spicy jalapeno martini - delicious.  The food is even better!  My personal favorites are the harvest salad with the goat cheese, the sashimi ahi salad, turkey burger, the thi curry (order it extra hot, it is bland otherwise) chicken sausage pizza, and the hummus - yum.  Oh and the Kale salad is delicious - I don't even like kale!  One of my favorite things about True Food is that they make me like healthy foods that I usually steer clear of .  The staff is great too.  I have never had bad service - sometimes it's not great but it's never  bad.  They will bring you samples of anything.  It's awesome!  If you see something on the menu you haven't tried before and you are a little un sure about it, ask for a sample, they will bring you one with a smile."}
{"text":"The food is good, but over priced.  The staff is not knowledgeable and my server had a large tattoo on his neck and a biker mustache.  He was just very dirty.  TFK  please hire a classier wait staff."}
{"text":"Love it here! Met up with friends that have never been and they enjoyed the healthy organic flavor in the starters, entrees, dessert, and the drinks."}
{"text":"I used to go to this True Food at Biltmore before a second restuarant was opened at Scottsdale Quarter. Both are excellent in terms of food and service. I prefer the ambiance in Scottsdale, but I would not hesitate to eat at this one regularly if it was a more convenient location. You just cant go back to chemical foods after eating here. My wish is that the chefs will extend their range of greens here beyond brussel sprouts. There are so many great Asian greens, chards, etc.in the world.  Bring it on. Maybe go wild with Vietnamese Pho!"}
{"text":"I tried True Food for the first time today. My wife and I arrived at 11:15 AM and it was already getting crowded. By 11:45 there was a big line of people waiting to be served.  Despite the busy atmosphere, the service was prompt and excellent. Much of the menu is vegetarian or gluten-free. I tried the Medicine Man drink (black tea, pomegranate, cranberry) which was refreshing.   I had a half-bowl of their daily soup, which was organic free-range chicken, brown rice, and vegetables. Although the serving size was small (it was a half-bowl after all), it was very tasty.  The turkey bolognese is something that my wife and I highly recommend. The turkey is minced and has none of the usual gamey aftertaste that turkey is known for. If you have kids, I'm pretty sure they would love this dish.  The fish tacos are also very tasty. Super-fresh and thick (albeit small) corn tortillas, with tomatilla salsa and perfectly cooked fish.  Dessert consisted of capuccinos and a dairy-free chocolate pudding with walnuts and pistachios. The pudding was a bit too sweet, and too big for just two people. Still, the meal was very satisfying and I look forward to dining there again sometime soon.  Total price for 2, tip included: approximately $75. A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"what can i say...we are fans!!! i am addicted to the Cucumber Refresher, i think it is honey lemonade with cucumber (& possibly crack, the way you will crave it!!). it is truly refreshing & reminds me of the fruity refreshing afternoon drinks that are served in SE asia & indonesia (bali, thailand, vietnam...) i am a sucker for the kale salad:simple, filling, tangy, delish!! but the best item i think they have is the bison burger!!! WOW!! hands down the BEST burger in phoenix, juicy, always cooked to perfection, the flavors dance together in your mouth and you will want more!  initially i thought it would be kind of gamey, and never measure up to the likes of delux, the grind, maizie's, rocket burger, chelsea's kitchen and others, but amazingly i was blown away & it is a weekly staple for my man! desserts are also fresh, innovative & tantalizing. i have been eyeballing their brunch menu & am looking forward to trying it soon - overall - GO you will love it!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  My dining partner and I shared a carmelized onion tart, then I had the gluten free spaghetti with cauliflower, kale and shrimp.  It was very delicious- wonderful flavors and textures.  Nice service, cool people, and a very neat space....If I lived in Phoenix, I'd go here more often."}
{"text":"Very clean and healthy menu with lots of wonderful looking drinks.  Great outdoor area and fantastic service. I had a delicious Bison Burger with Kale and Sweet Potatoes. My wife had a Salmon Garden Salad.  Definitely a place to check out if you're around Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Terrific semi-casual restaurant serving delicious, nutritious food and good drinks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oh True Food...I have visited you many times since your opening and you never fail to deliver on great service and yumilicious food.  I really love your Summer Salad which I had on my most recent visit...the perfect combination of ingredients..it makes my heart sing. (I hope that I can get the summer salad in the winter?) I know you like to mix things up my darling True Food...  I also had the Watermelon Rose cocktail which may be my favorite cocktail of late...  You just make me so happy True Food!! Thank you for being you and sorry I didn't review you sooner....I would never take you for granted!"}
{"text":"I adore True Food Kitchen! I've been three times and I adore the food. My favorite dish to order is the Turkey Bolognese, the sauce is lovely and I really enjoy the brown rice penne. I am also a fan of the goat cheese and fig tarte as an appetizer, it's really good and just the right size. Last time I went there I tried the lemon tarte and let me tell you, it was delicious! The coconut cream was superb and the tarte wasn't too sweet, letting the lemon flavor shine through!   As with the food, I have only had good service at True Food Kitchen. The servers are well trained and always make dining there a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"This was impulse stop for lunch on a Friday afternoon. We were seated pretty quickly which was nice for a busy time.  None of us had been here before and the waitress gave us a nice rundown on the food and philosophy. We all got a different dish and everyone seemed happy with their choices. The one comment was that the shrimp and noodles were supposed to be pretty spicy according to the waitress but the person who ordered it said it wasn't that spicy.  We didn't do any of the juices though I was more tempted by some of the unique cocktails. It was pretty pricey considering the portion sizes but you pay for fresh and you pay for the address too. We'll go back is my guess!"}
{"text":"I have been a bit absent from Yelp as I lost faith with some hidden reviews but I choose one of my faves in Phoenix to return with a review. True Food has added a wonderful roasted veggie salad to their menu with a horseradish dressing that is bursting with flavor! Their shrimp curry bowl is very good but lacks spice. For a beverage, you must try the Medicine Man. It's an antioxidant pomegranate/black tea based elixir that tastes like a vacation.! The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the dismissive server attitudes and sub-par service we tend to receive. Overall, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"5 star all the way! They have the freshest vegetables and a great menu selection of healthy foods. The vegetable crudités and quinoa burger are amazing! The seasonal grapefruit soda is bomb as well! Only downside is they always seem to be busy, so expect a wait. It is still one of my favs though!"}
{"text":"UPDATED review  I'm changing my review because after receiving my complaint the same manager that served us, sent me gift card to come back in. Which I think is excellent customer service. Glad we went back! We came in on a Friday night during the busy hours and had a WHOLE different experience. This time a male server who was extremely polite and professional. He provided excellent customer service and the food was amazing. I love love love their matcha horchata drink. It's delishh!    PREVIOUS review.... Came in for dinner today (Valentine's day). It was pretty slow. The service was absolutely horrible. I've been in the industry myself for over 5 years and have a fair expectation of customer service. We were seated immediately our drink order was taken, however I had to waive the waitress down to ask for an appetizer after the appetizer we waited for 30 minutes and finally had to ask the manager to take our order. The manager was very professional and handled it accordingly. The food was great. Maybe it was an off day for the waitress so I will give it another shot. This was my first time at true food and it was not a good first impression."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. Healthy, fresh, organic ingredients served in normal portions that leave you satisfied but not stuffed. I have tried almost the entire menu and there is really nothing i don't like. And try the \"Natural\" drink. I like it so much I have 2 each time I go."}
{"text":"Wow seriously excellent customer service like always. Loved the kale aid drink it tasted amazing! Also the kale salad is the best! I definitely need to go back there again very soon"}
{"text":"Great lunch stop. Are the turkey burger with half kale salad and half sweet potato hash. Everything was good. We also shared the vegetable bowl. Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of True Food kitchen, so the only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars is because we waited a long time for the food.  Our party of 4 had to wait 15-20 minutes for our meals. This wasn't a massive ordeal, but the wait was a little long.  Other than that, our brunch was good. Always really happy with the vegan and vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy True Food more than I ended up actually enjoying it.  The food seemed pretty ok but I don't really find myself craving it or even wanting to go back afterwords. We tend to eat quite healthy so we knew what to expect but it just didn't really seem to catch my attention eating there. Additionally, it seemed over priced with fairly average service. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but I doubt I will go back and give it another chance as no one in my party seemed really all that eager to go back."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen gets high marks simply for offering a vegan dessert beyond sorbet (chia seed pudding - delicious!). We also enjoyed the homemade honey lemonade and ginger ale. Although, I was disappointed they don't give free refills of the latter. Food was very good. As seems to be the case with most Fox restaurants, the atmosphere and outdoor seating rocked."}
{"text":"Initially I came here expecting a lot of healthy organic relatively tasteless and expensive food, but I was very surprised and boy was I wrong. The drinks/elixirs may sound like medicine but they were very tasty, especially the ginger one (and I LOVE ginger!). We had the onion tart for the appetizer and it was a wonderful taste explosion in my mouth. For dinner we ordered the squash casserole and the bison burger. With the 2 drinks, we got out of there for about $60 which is a bit pricey but so worth it considering the taste, quality and service."}
{"text":"Wanted a vegetarian type restaurant to try so we came here. It was delicious would definitely go back again next year during Spring Training. All the food we had not one bad things. It's not all vegetarian or vegan but you can have them make whatever you want if you don't like something on the menu. It's fabulous and the wait staff perfect. Wait time can be long but well worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an Interior Designer's dream.... Beautifully designed down to the blades of grass. If only I was rating the design...  Oh right the food - I didn't think it was all that good. I had the Wild Ahi Sliders with wasabi, radishes, cucumber on sesame brioche. While the presentation was breathtaking the flavors were so so. I'm hoping it was just what I ordered but my friends didn't enjoy their lunch much either. We were all in agreement the Green Armie drink was probably one of the best green tea drinks we've had aside from my beloved boba tea.  The service was great and our waitress, cute as a button, was very helpful. I just wish I would have enjoyed the food a little more. I guess I may have to go back and try another dish just to make sure I'm not missing out."}
{"text":"I have actually eaten here about four times already, always with the best intentions of giving it yet another chance, but I just  have never had that great of an experience at True Food. Today took the cake, when the waiter left with my half-eaten pizza to box it up for me and never returned for the rest of the night, neither to refill the water, nor to check on whether my friend and I needed anything else, nor to return aforementioned pizza. Unfortunately at that time we had already paid (which I guess explains his inattention) and I honestly could not remember the guy's face to track him down. But even had the service been outstanding tonight, the food has failed to impress me just about every time. Today I had the eggplant pizza, which was ok but the dough rather tasteless. In the past I have tried the miso cod (ok but not worth the $22 they charge) and some ravioli that were rather unmemorable but have since apparently been removed from the menu (I think they were stuffed with butternut squash). The only dish I have ever really liked is the Edamame Dumpling appetizer - if another friend of mine has their heart set on True Foods in the future maybe I will just have to get 2 orders of those. The decor is nice enough but the tables are too close together for my taste and the noise level inside quite excessive.  All together not a place that I will ever frequent again if the choice is left up to me."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, \"Well, they're all fresh-frozen.\" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."}
{"text":"Ok, Sam Fox, you've hit another nail on the \"head\".  True Food is true and delicious and the service is spot on.  Music is crisp and appropriate for hipsterville but our average ticket was $20 less than at your other eateries.  Perhaps the healthful ambiance permitted a more conservative approach to our imbibing.  Looking for a good cocktail but everyone seemed so chipper and sober.  Thai curry delicious and the quinoa burger yummy.  Good lunch spot for a date at the Biltmore Plaza."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night to catch up with an old friend. Ordered the Farmer Salad with Chicken - delicious! Love the atmosphere, the varied menu and the wine list is spot on. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Are there food that is NOT-true ? OK... I got it, food has to be true to the original taste ... which mean it doesn't always taste good, I supposed ....  Had the Shrimp spring rolls .... Turkey Bolognese ... could be true to the ingredient but not true to the dish of how it should taste....   Fit very much in the north scottsdale vibe .... 'look at me, I only eat healthy, organic, true and whole food' ...  which actually could be a good thing ;)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this restaurant out for years and finally went on New Year's day a few weeks ago. The SO and I walked in and didn't see a hostess stand, which we thought was weird. So we weren't sure if we sat ourselves or what. A server walked by us with our confused faces at least four times. We ended up just sitting down next to another couple waiting. Their beeper went off and they went to the OTHER door to the restaurant that had the table for the hostesses. While waiting with our beeper, a couple walked in with confused faces, and a server directed them to the other side. Then, another group of people walked in with asking each other the same questions we had asked about how seating works.         Anyways, when we finally sat down, I ordered the Butternut squash pizza. Taste wise, it was pretty good, but I felt it needed more butternut squash. I also didn't like that the arugula was just laid on top raw after baking since it just fell off when you tried to eat the slice. I think it should have been lightly sautéed to that it would be heavier and \"stick\" to the pizza more. My SO got the Bison Burger without topping. I ate the sweet potato hash and Kale salad. The sweet potato hash was somewhat overcooked and when I asked a server (Not our official one, but still) for ketchup, I never got any. The kale salad was very good. We didn't get dessert, so I can't comment on that.          I can say to watch out for the bathrooms. I went to wash my hands before dinner and the place was trashed, which was surprising considering the upscale location.        I received a gift card for True Foods recently, so I'm willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Really like how the food is fresher and healthier! It's also very light, and you do not leave feeling too full or sick! The mushroom pizza is delicious, and the lettuce wraps are pretty good. Also, the desserts are tasty.  It is a bit pricey for what you get however - I am not a big eater, and I ate the lettuce wraps and pizza on my own without feeling that full. It's nice to feel good after the meal, but I wish the prices were slightly cheaper. Maybe it's to cover the costs of the better ingredients?"}
{"text":"I had pretty low expectations for your restaurant, I am not going to lie. I thought I was going to hate this \"health food\" stuff since I'm just a normal dude that owns a truck (Chevrolet Silverado 2016 Turbo-diesal 4x4 power stroke engine), and not some guy named Clay that smokes vape pens outside of Barnes & Noble. Anyway, I got the flax burger (wha  is flax? lmao) and I thought it was going to taste like the sole of a vans skateboard shoe, but it didn't It was bursting with flavor and quite frankly my pants stood up a little. Then, I saw the Kale and these little orange things. I thought they were starbursts, but when I bit into them I realized it wasn't an orange starburst. I don't know what they were, but it tasted like a french fry that goes to dive bars. The kale was good.   I was going to give you guys 5 stars, but when i got home I immediately had to go to the toilet. It was bad. I was there so long that my phone died when I was looking up new trucks on google and my charger was in my room, but i didn't want to get up from the toilet because I was literally leaking. So i just had to sit there. All night. Eventually the sun came up and my son came in the bathroom, I was passed out on the toilet. He asked me if I could drive him to school. I said son, I'm sorry, i ate at true food last night and it turned my ass into a category 4 hurricane. He then thought I was drunk even though I told my family I'm done drinking, but they didn't believe me. Everyone thought I was passed out drunk on my toilet for 11 hours until the morning even though I explained that I ate flax seeds from true foods. Now they won't talk to me."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian or vegan, but if I could eat at True Food Kitchen every meal, I could come close.  I have never ordered a better hummus plate, and I order that often at several places.  My husband loved his tortilla soup and his Turkey Burger with smashed avocado, tomato, smoked gouda, jalapeño remoulade.  The Squash Pie with graham crust, coconut whipped cream was a gastronomical delight.  My niece loved the Flourless Chocolate Cake with caramel, vanilla ice cream, cocoa nib....I think all the ice cream is home-made.  For the entrée, I really enjoyed the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with organic tomato, caramelized onion, zucchini, fresh mozzarella.   I didn't add a protein (meat) but you can.   The restaurant has a high energy, upbeat vibe. The seating is comfortable.  Lovely outdoor seating too.  It is far from our home, but we will be back as often as practical."}
{"text":"Ingredients are fresh. Service is pristine.  The tofu and bean dish with brown rice was aright.  I liked the pineapple drink I had.  Wasn't a big fan of the zucchini baked pasta though. Its long thin sliced zucchini instead of pasta, and the texture just isn't right.  On the pricy side but most of it seems healthy. I guess I can't have both health and taste."}
{"text":"Great, healthy food selection  with reasonable prices and excellent service.  Highly recommended by Belobu Creative."}
{"text":"Best dinner, from start to finish, that we have had in a very, very long time.  We started with the edamame dumplings and loved them so much we wanted to order a second round!  The dumpling stuffing was creamy and loaded with flavor and the truffle sauce was absolutely the perfect match for the dumpling.  YUM! My husband had the sweet onion, arugula, and squash pizza--Wow, it was totally RIDICULOUS!  We are pizza snots and this was one of the best we have ever had!  I ordered the squash casserole, which was good.  I didn't love it, but it was a very nicely flavored dish and the squash had a nice texture.  We finished with dessert--the flourless chocolate cake melts in your mouth and is super rich!  The almond, olive oil cake was sweet, moist, and totally unique!  Both were amazing!   We weren't shy with the drinks--we each had two of the juice/tea drinks!  My favorite was the Kaleade, but we really enjoyed all 4!!   So we ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 4 juice drinks--all for $72!  Yes, in Scottsdale where mediocre sandwiches cost around $15.   Sadly our vacation is over and we leave tomorrow or we would definitely be going back!  We have been here all week and have eaten at many of the very nice restaurants in Scottsdale (Kierland) and True Food Kitchen was by far the best meal that we had!  Take my advice--VISIT SOON!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since they opened and they progressively gotten worse. Today I picked up a crudités and an ice tea for $24 and got home to a small container with a hand full of soggy rotten smelling vegetables. Gross. So disappointed. Just cause your location is busy, doesn't mean to can sacrifice the integrity of your food. The Biltmore location has always been better, but this just put the Scottsdale TF at the bottom of my to-do list."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better service. The squash lasagna with shrimp was amazing as was the margarita pizza. The atmosphere was to die for as well."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is worth trying!   Not everything is organic or natural, but they have a decent selection and use pretty good ingredients.  I really seek out good organic spots, hard to find, True Food is pretty good.  My Top Picks: Beverage: Medicine Man Elixir Salad: Greek Chopped w/ Chicken Sandwich: Columbia River Salmon w/ lime & avocado Entree:  Spaghetti Squash Casserole Sides:  Farro!!  (It's awesome, sweet with dates.)   Usually busy around lunch, call ahead and put your name on the list!  But even if you don't, there's plenty of room, and they turn tables quick, so you can get in and out in under an hour if you need to.    They are the official catering restaurant of the Phx Suns.  They must like it, because i was there for lunch this Friday and Grant Hill walked in.    Good spot for lunch in the Biltmore!"}
{"text":"Awesome place when you are trying to eat out and not feel bad about it. The menu is always changing to match what's in season. As much food as possible is locally grown. I usually always go with a meat dish when eating out, but today I decided to mix it up and try the spaghetti squash casserole, excellent choice very refreshing and filling. Also tried the medicine man juice, great flavor well prepared and a good change up from beer and soda. Make sure you give the edamame dumplings, they were wonderful and unique."}
{"text":"Great healthy but tasty food!! The vegetable cruditee is a must, lots of perfectly blanched vegetables with two delicious dipping sauces. I have it every time I go! I love their pizza, the margarita pizza is simple but great crust and cheese. The other pizzas are always full of delicious toppings. I've been here with girlfriends, my boyfriend and by myself and every time I leave very satisfied. The covered patio is very relaxing and service is always great. I highly recommend this place! The pomegranate limeade with chia seeds is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great menu for wide variety of tastes.  Right portion sizes.  Food is very tasty and fresh.  Waits can be long on weekends, so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Great appetizers! The Edamame dumplings were yummy, a must try. Healthy and tasty food."}
{"text":"I'm furious. What kind of a restaurant does not sell soft drinks?!?!? Is that some kind of sick joke. My life revolves around soda. No soda no Sarah. Even though their pizza is okay I will not stand for it. You used to have soda but then you must have let the health freaks talk you out of it. What the heck is this. It's barbaric and I won't allow it. I'm high key pissed. Definitely never bringing my friends to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love their food, but the service is usually really bad except at the bar, they are more attentive at the bar. The last two weekends when we tried to eat there they said the wait would be 20 to 30 minutes, but there were a lot of empty tables, so we just left both times. They have said this in the past and taken us in 5-10 minutes, but if they can't be more accurate and honest with you up front there are a lot of other good places in the area to choose from."}
{"text":"At first the menu descriptions seemed strange but the flavors were awesome. Pesto pizza and fresh pasta were fantastic."}
{"text":"I have heard about true food for a while, so my friends and I thought we would give it a try.  The ambiance is interesting.....very open, loud, but we sat on the patio which is very relaxing.  I would say I have a pretty sensitive palate to seasonings and enjoy full flavored food. I ordered a margarita pizza.  It tasted like a brick oven crust with Campbell's tomato soup on top.  I could not taste any seasoning and felt it lacked flavor.  It had 3 basil leaves and two small dalops of mozzarella on it.  If they wouldn't have been so busy, I would have sent it back. Unimpressive."}
{"text":"I went to true food for lunch on a Thursday and it was well worth the hour wait. Busy, chic atmosphere with tons of healthy menu items and awesome juice concoctions! The squash pie with coconut whip cream on the dessert menu is perfection!!!"}
{"text":"The kale salad is to die for! The wait can be horrible at times, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend tends to stray from any restaurant associated with terms like \"organic\" or \"vegetarian\" but after dining at true foods we were both believers for this anti-inflammatory food diet. The butternut squash ravioli was so light, yet full of flavor. The mushrooms gave an amazing meatiness without the heaviness. The bison burger was moist and topped with the perfect accoutrements. True foods left me happy, full but comfortable, and now on the hunt for more."}
{"text":"The Ancient Grains bowl blew me away with flavor. I'll never order anything else. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service, nice atmosphere although you do have to shout over the cougs at lunch. It's a pain in the A$$ to get a table at lunch if you are there after 11:30 or before 1PM. I was extremely ill after eating the Ahi sliders last time however; so violently ill I thought I might not make it back across the street to my office. I ended up cancelling my meetings and going home after lunch and being laid up for 24 hours. Yes, I ate there 4 other times with no issue, but bad sea food is hard to forget."}
{"text":"This food was literally disgusting. I wouldn't have even fed this to the cow that was made in to the in n out burger I'm going to eat after this \"dinner\". This was seriously so gross and a waste of money. 0/10 would NOT recommend. Also for being such a \"healthy\" place there was a lot of damn sodium in all of their dishes."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen is another successful Fox Restaurant Concept.  Along with the other two places I have tried, 'Olive and Ivy' and 'Montana Avenue', I have yet to be disappointed by a meal by this company.  I would advise checking out their other places as well.  The service was a bit slow, but the food was really good and good for you.  The drink I got was really different and refreshing called New Moon (pink grapefruit soda water and agave nectar).  They have lots of different drinks to choose from.  I had Ahi tuna sliders and for dessert flowerless chocolate cake.    All of it was really good and I did not feel heavy or that feeling  of needing to sit down at home in front of the television for an hour after eating a meal.    I will return hungry and order some other drink on the list.  After words I might be doing yoga.  The thing with healthy food I find is that you end up trying to keep up with it, and if you are in the Biltmore area I would check it out.  Recommendation: To anyone who is a healthy eater and everyone that shops at whole foods.  To people who are vegans and non alike that just want a good meal come to true food kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  The prices are getting a little hi though. Almost $20 for a chicken bowl."}
{"text":"My fav place to eat. Great food and service, can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere with a great, knowledgeable staff who take the time to explain their philosophy and food to you. Vegan food selection is limited but I had their tofu scramble wrap and it was amazing. Their juices are really great too.  You leave this restaurant satisfied with a delicious, healthy meal."}
{"text":"As a registered dietitian, I am constantly searching for restaurants that offer wholesome, healthy and delicious options. We started off with the elixirs which were all uniquely tasty and refreshing. We followed the drinks with the hummus which was as good as it gets. I got the curry dish but substituted chicken with tofu. I never wanted my plate to end! The flavors were exceptional but not overpowering. Our waiter was knowledgeable, curteous, and pleasant. Dessert was the blood orange cake. One bite was enough to satisfy the obligatory after dinner sweet craving. I recommend this restaurant to ANYONE! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Finding a healthful place to eat with my eating restrictions is difficult.  It was refreshing to look at a menu and know I could eat most things there!! And our server asked questions to be sure what was ordered would be good for our table.  And it sure was good, satisfying food!!"}
{"text":"When this first opened it was my favorite however over time it seems the quality is hit or miss. For example roasted chicken has arrived lukewarm on two visits. The burger was cold inside and did not come with condiments as requested 3 times. The flavors are not consistent either. However I love the clean fresh healthy vibe and ambience. Very expensive and disappointing when the dish is not up to standard. The lettuce wraps are the best!"}
{"text":"Loved the food.  Had a cucumber lime drink which was perfect for the hot weather and Mediterranean salad with chicken. Yummy!  Live in Los Angeles and never knew they are located in Santa Monica. Tried the chia seed pudding first time and I am now a big fan. Loved our waiter, very knowledgeable and friendly. Good food, good service, and makes you feel good about yourself. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great location for restaurant and for people watching. Easy parking in the garage on the south side and plenty of things to do with kids. Food choices are too healthy for my taste. Every new trendy super organic, vegan, gluten and dairy free (maybe taste free too) available on the menu. A little on the pricey side and always a wait."}
{"text":"Good overall experience.  Buffalo burger was good, sweet potato has was good.  We did have about a 40 minute wait (expected on a weekend I guess), and it was loud inside.  The was good, but it wasn't as good as some of the reviews are raving about.  For the price, there are plenty of places that offer the same quality with either more quanity or a bigger selection.   This is a great place if you are vegan or on a diet.  But if you are a meat eater like me, you will have very limited options."}
{"text":"not that much of a fan.  went with friends we were there kind of late.  the service was really bad.  i left hungry.  we went because of there large gluten free menu.  the food was good but not that great!"}
{"text":"Awesome healthy food. My favorites are:the pomegranate drink, mushroom pizza, Mediterranean salad. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"So I'm here with a group of people like \"8\" food was great but every time the server come by he would only refill one water glass each time he came to the table .... We had ask 5 time that we got squash cake and it took 20 min to get like it's all good and great food but I won't come to this location  cause of the not so great  treat meant we had here"}
{"text":"Loved the food here, and the best part is that I did not feel guilty even after stuffing myself because the food was healthy. This place has amazing menu and healthy options. Moreover the ambience is awesome. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"All I can say: A lot of hype for nothing.   Well I guess I can say a bit more... Saturday night, went there around 6pm, I have been so excited to try out this restaurant that my boyfriend hungrily tolerated the 65 minute wait! Waiter staff, completely inattentive and rude, never paying attention to water, food coming out at two different times (rather silly for a dinner among two people). Atmosphere was crowed, leaving one to think that there is a reason this place was a hot spot, but listen to the conversations at the table and all you get is chatter about how nothing tastes good and how they should have checked out the restaurants around the corner instead.    Appetizer: Edamame Dumplings HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT, no flavor, very small portion, poorly executed, horribly plated.  Boyfriends Dinner: Fish tacos. Small portion, lacked flavor, not filling, pathetic (in a word), once again poorly plated and beans on the side were not well integrated to create a collective dish.  My Dinner: Shrimp Pasta with Shirataki Noodles More like shrimp swimming in a sea of soy sauce, no flavor, very rubbery shrimp, pathetic once again.  Overall Impression: I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant. Would not recommend, much better sub-par restaurants around the corner."}
{"text":"We decided spontaneously to have a late lunch here. We were told we could sit in the outdoor lounge. We passed several empty regular tables before getting to our lounge seats. We ordered water with lemon and got two glasses of tap water without ice or lemon. Even better there were chunks of food floating in our water. My daughter had the inside out quinoa burger. They were very conscientious about my daughter's dairy allergy. The food was OK. Only OK. Everything is expensive. Don't care to go back."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen - Wonderful!  I have now dined at this restaurant several times and each entree that I have tried is downright delicious!  The staff is friendly and responsive, and the dining room comfortable.   The portions are large, so consider sharing. Be prepared to wait for seating (others like this place, too), but well worth it.    True Food Kitchen is quickly becoming my favorite place for lunch."}
{"text":"Contemporary, healthy restaurant. They serve fresh juices/sodas with fruits and vegetables and have a variety of salads, sandwiches and main entrees. Had brought a friend that is a vegan and eats gluten-free so I was worried about her options but she had quite a few to choose from. Everything was fresh and delicious. I've had the curry with tofu and the turkey lasagna - both great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - coffee good! A little over priced ;) still LOVE! :)"}
{"text":"I guess I prefer false food. After three visits, the juices are the only items that impress me. The edamame dumplings are bland; so is the soup - I cannot even remember which soup I had, which is not a good commentary on its memorability. The ravioli - OK, The fish - OK. I haven't had anything at TF that deviated from \"OK\", but for the mid-level prices I expect something a little higher on the tasty meter.   Service has been fine all three times I've visited, but nothing above what I expect for pleasant and expedient service. I always find myself distracted by the women servers' uniforms...I know it's supposed to be some organic cotton or something, but could they have come up with anything less flattering? I really feel for those poor ladies.   I've also noticed that every time I've visited the crowd is about 75% women, with probably 50% of the parties women-only. Not sure what to make of that, but maybe you can have fun playing sociologist and come up with an explanation."}
{"text":"Oh, True Food. I want to love you.  But you make me feel like I'm eating in a cafeteria. WIth such a contemporary menu and a staff full of bright shiny faces this restaurant is just a contradiction in form... the menu and ambience just don't match.  My advice is to sit at the bar. The drinks are well served by pleasant bartenders and do their job, the stools are comfortable, and from that locale you get to skip the experience of having dinner with a room full of strangers right at your elbow."}
{"text":"Been here a number of times over the past couple years, and gonna say it's a right-down-the-middle 3 stars out of 5. Not great. Not awful. Average/decent healthy-ish food for fairly high prices with almost-good service.  Healthy-ish? Well let's say you get a side of kale with that sandwich. Fair enough. But when you get into it...that kale be dragged through the ocean, matey!! Yyyaaarrr! Well not really but it is SALTED like it's from the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean, rendering that fresh, healthy kale...um, not so healthy after all. She be a salty dog, yyyaaarrr!  Order a juice-based drink. Cool, super healthy, right? Then how about the \"HANGOVER RX\" - YEAH YEAH YEAH BRO! AFTER I SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT YAKKIN, I WANT A PINEAPPLE AND ORANGE JUICE, Bruce! I swear, I feel like half this menu should be wearing an Affliction t-shirt, Ed Hardy trucker hat, d-bag sunglasses, camo shorts and flip flops. Maybe this is just the reality of Sam Fox and his Band of BMW Brahs. Alpha male goofballs who like to PUT A BAR SPIN ON HEALTHY EATS, BRO.  Granted there's a lot to be mocked at ANY Sam Fox \"concept\". But on the plus side, True Food attempts to stay healthy and sometimes offers a decent dish. I've been pleased with a few of the salads...I've been let down by most of the sandwiches though. The bread they use is often too heavy and not fresh enough. They can't get potato sides right, but to be fair most places cannot. Fries/taters at sit-down restaurants are too cold half the time, and usually over- or under-salted.  The grill items: chicken, meat, fish...good enough. Overall decent quality. However prices, for what you get, way too high. I know what fresh carrot juice tastes like (you serve carrot concentrate, son!); I know what a good house-made veggie burger tastes like; I can spot great-quality Ahi. I'm sorry, but these things are not present at True Food. Is it a step above the neighboring and overpriced Cheesecake Factory and Del Frisco's Grille & God-awful Sam Fox Mexi-Blanco three storefronts down? Yes. And for that, it is a 3-star joint.  Service trends towards more on the friendly albeit not extremely food knowledgeable. Parking is easy peasy. Indoor acoustics a little loud, and some of the tables are too close together, especially if you're 2-topping.  If you want a centrally-located meeting spot with a good parking situation and a hip and healthy LOOKING environment, this is it, chief. A sufficient lunch spot for wealthy ladies shopping on weekdays and office types looking for an alternative to the neighboring steakhouses and chains.  True Food doesn't succeed because it's successful: it succeeds because there's a dearth of good restaurants in the immediate area. Bro."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because our friend wanted to meet here.  We originally planned to have dinner around 5:30pm, so that we could preserve our daughters bedtime.  When we put our name down for a table of 5, we were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait.  YIKES!  We still put our name down and crossed our fingers that our little one would not have the ultimate meltdown.  In the meantime we enjoyed the sunshine and letting our daughter run through the fountain, where all the kids were playing.  She loved the fountain!  We finally got the buzz that our table was ready and rushed over to get our dinner started.  As we entered the restaurant we got many eye rolls at the site of our young daughter.  Even our waitress was rolling her eyes, which was pretty insulting.  The Hummus and veggie starter was ok.  It literally looked like veggies pulled straight out of the ground and plopped on the plate, dirt and all.    I got the Seafood Caldo for dinner.  It was good.  Nothing special or overly delicious.  Tasted like a flavorless cioppino.  I took a few bites and then went back to tending to our daughter as the eye rolls were at an all time high due to the fact that she was over tired and fussy.  My husband got the Red Chili Shrimp.  The noodles were overcooked and sticky.  The flavor was pretty boring also.  He did ask for extra shrimp and they gave him a LOT extra!  I think the best part of my meal was the glass of wine, that I ordered when we first sat down but finally arrived after the apps and dinner.  It was essentially my meal because I was chasing my daughter around the restaurant so she would not make a huge scene.  For a restaurant to be located so close to a fountain, kid's store and an sitting within an outdoor mall, you would assume the restaurant would be somewhat tolerable of children.  They absolutely do not want kids there and make little to no effort to make you feel welcome as a parent.    I don't think we would go back.  I was really excited because I had heard such great things.  I am not impressed."}
{"text":"OK.... We eat out a lot, and in a lot of places... So... it takes a good deal to really be unique.  Being a healthy eater I am constantly looking for good / good for you eating out options.  If you are the same, I highly recommend dropping into True Good Kitchen.  We went in on a Sunday evening so the wait was only about 10 minutes.  The staff was very friendly, and helpful, and the food was absolutely phenomenal.  I had the grass fed bison burger with kale salad and sweet potato hash.  It was the best bison and Kale I have ever had.  I typically do not do deserts but they had a Chia Coconut/banana pudding.  I was very delighted with the food and service we received.  If you are in the area, or in an area that has a True Food Kitchen this is a must."}
{"text":"Very light, fresh and yummy food!  We had the watermelon salad, the corn ravioli, sweet potato hash and sundried tomato pizza. Everything was delicious!! The drinks were great too- both the cucumber and Ginger. I wish they had their restaurant in Boston too!!!  I was impressed with their vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Decided to order something from here for dinner since I work in the quarter and I didn't bring anything today. I am suuuper disappointed with it, it's extremely expensive and doesn't even taste great. I got the teriyaki bowl because it's vegan friendly and it's so tiny, hardly warm and tastes like it was microwaved. Super sad because I always hear people say how great it is. Apparently not for a vegan. If I had the time to call and complain or go back I would of but I have a very short lunch break and am 32 weeks pregnant so I had to just eat it for what it was.."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service for average but overpriced food. Server Kailen/jamien at the bar was extremely rude took him 10 minutes to get just a drink never mind the 30 min wait for the food. Also goes by AM bar on the receipt. Boo."}
{"text":"Went out as a family and spent $100 with no alcohol on overpriced, small potions of bland tasting food. I'm not much of a fan of Fox restaurants, and will not come back. Our service was poor until I asked the manager.  To their credit, our waiter picked up his service considerably."}
{"text":"I have been to True Food 3 times now and i am very impressed. first of all the decor is bright, airy, and environmentally responsible with reclaimed wood floors and those awesome dyson hand dryers in the bathrooms. filtered water is brought to the table in reusable glass bottles.  why people have written that they dont like to watch the food being prepped on the open table confuses me. some of the best kitchens in the world have an open kitchen and watching chefs prep beautiful fruits and vegetables shows me how much they care about the quality of their produce. Now to the food- the only time i have ever heard of olivelo juice and it was delicious. so was the green ice tea and the cucumber refresher. i have had over half the menu and even the tempeh tlt which i thought  might be too healthy turned out to be Delicious. the soba noodles , shrimp dumplings and local vegetables were really fresh and tasty. loved the kale salad and the green tea soba noodles. turkey burger was very nice and i didnt miss not having beef. Overall i like the eclectic mix on the menu and i can always find something i am in the mood for. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I will be eating here every week."}
{"text":"This place has healthy food that also tastes great.  I will straight out tell you the downside is it does cost a bit and the portions aren't that big..  The reason I gave it a high rating is because I like places that are health focused.  Also the manager was coming up to me every so often to make sure everything was perfect.  Manager saw my miso soup wasn't filled all the way and got me an extra bowl...  Great customer service is an understatement."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I loved it. The onion tart was fantastic. The edamame dumplings are ravioli like and nice on a hot night. Also enjoyed the seasonal watermelon martini. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight for the first time. We really enjoyed it! The food was super tasty and clean. That was the most hearty miso soup I've ever had. The lettuce cups were just as good as P.F. Changs, yet I'm willing to bet much healthier. The veggie plate and hummus was phenomenal and that was on the kids menu! My husband, MIL and FIL all said their dishes were delicious. Very satisfying for such a healthy meal. My only criticism was that the music was a little too loud. That being said I liked the atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  The food is extra amazing and consistent and the added benefit of knowing you are eating healthy is a home run!  The summary states its not good for kids, and I am confused by this.  We bring our 4 kids and they LOVE it.  I see kids in here all the time without any problem...we should be setting a good, healthy example of eating for our kids.  My only vice with True Food is that they are VERY expensive.  When you are buying organig in massive bulk like they do, it just shouldn't cost $18 for a lunch portion of steak tacos.  I can't get my family of 6 out of there without dropping $100 MINIMUM!  That hurts, as we would LOVE to eat here all the time, but we would be broke!  Dont ever leave this place without having the flourless chocolate cake with real vanilla bean ice cream!  OMG!!!!!!  Heaven!!!"}
{"text":"I visited True Food Kitchen for the first time recently and I ordered the Mediterranean chopped salad. It was quite delicious, but there really wasn't much salad there - it was spread across a bowl, evidently trying to make it seem like there was more. I would call it an appetizer. Honestly, for $11, it should have been 3-4 times as much salad. I didn't notice any quinoa (there may have been 1/2 tsp. tossed in) and there were a few really tiny pieces of tomato and cucumber with greens. If they had normal dinner portions, I would go back because the salad and dressing were excellent. Right now, it's too pricey for the portions."}
{"text":"It's nice dining in a restaurant that give you good, clean food choices. They have lots of gluten free options but they do cross contaminate. A few times we have gone for brunch and the food seems slightly undercooked but overall a solid choice"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been there twice, ate outside both times and both days were very chilly.  However, the outside heaters worked like a charm.  I preferred outside seating actually as the restaurant is pretty loud during a lunch rush.  I had the butternut squash pizza both times as well as the ginger agave drink.  Tried a few other dishes that my friends had and everything was wonderful.  Love the concept, loved the food, wish it were closer to me."}
{"text":"Mmmmm This place is generally fresh and healthy and tasted good too! Try the buffalo burger with a side of kale salad and sweet potato hash. Love it!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I actually did.  Food was good but considering the taste, price and atmosphere.  There are better options in phx."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere. I had the watermelon rose cocktail, which was awesome!, and the albacore tataki. The appetizer had a bit too much dressing, but the concept and presentation, and the taste, was great! Definitely a cool place to grab a drink or a meal after shopping."}
{"text":"Food was very good but it took too long for the meal to come out (1hour).  The waiter was very nice.  It's too bad the kitchen isn't fast enough."}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesomeawesomeawesomeawesomeawesome.  Our waiter was funny and personable and patient. He was quite a gent.  The food was awesome and there were vegetarian options as far as the eye could see. I loved it.  My only complaint is that the patrons next to us seemed way uptight but that happens.  Loved it, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my husband on a Saturday. Place was busy so we sat at the bar. Atmosphere is really nice and the staff were on the ball. First time here so we sat and took it all in. We were aware of the organic/healthy choices menu. We both ordered salads. I the Harvest and my husband the Mediterranean. Beautiful presentation and tasty! The lemongrass tea with vanilla was excellent and would have again. Lots of neat things to try on the menu. With that said, we found it to be too pricey for what we got...$30 for two smallish salads and one tea. It is all organic which is costlier we understand that. Maybe its just us. Would we come back?? Not so sure."}
{"text":"Don't play it again, Sam!  Please rejuvenate this concept. Bland, uninspired food that doesn't even read well on the menu. Much better healthy items at other FRC outposts (quinoa tacos at the Henry, nearly everything at Olive + Ivy).    Also, everything is $4 more than it should be."}
{"text":"This was a once in a lifetime meal. There was something special about this place, like no other. For example: the tereyaki bowl. While other tereyaki bowls may be different, this one really stood out. It had a slight smokiness and a unique barbecue flavor. The turkey burger was amazing. I personally dislike turkey, but when I tried some of son's, I couldn't help but reach for more.  The bison burger was a unique experience for me. It had a slight smokiness and the end and it's unique flavor stood out. The drinks were delicious and natural. With their great abd friendly customer service, I ought to come back."}
{"text":"I came to True Foods based on a recommendation and I was really happy I did. They were very busy for a Wednesday night, I wasn't expecting a 50 minute wait at 8 p.m. We weren't in a hurry so we decided to wait for a table instead of hovering for a place at the bar. With many people waiting to be seated it's best to just find yourself in a zen like state. The polite host staff will tell you that the pagers will reach a store in each direction if you ask. Once seated the waiter was eager to explain the food concept and eating fresh and many  locally grown foods. I was totally game for this. The menu has a multitude of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. We started with the edamame dumplings. The wrappers were a bit disappointing as the texture was a bit off but the filling was tasty. The broth though was absolutely the highlight of this dish. My husband had the chicken chopped salad with farrow and jicama and cranberries. It was tasty and well dressed. I had the roasted sea bass which was perfectly cooked and delicious. The real point of this review though is the cake. The flourless chocolate cake is nothing short of AMAZING. It is not a tort people, it's for real a cake and it is delicious and light. I have had many a flourless cake and this one literally takes the cake!! Try it. Do it. It's an absolute must. Skip your meal if you have to. It comes w vanilla ice cream and cocoa nibs which are so delightful. I may stop back in for lunch just to have this cake."}
{"text":"Yesterday I gave a ride to a waitress that worked at True Food Kitchen in North Scottsdale. I asked her a couple of questions about the restaurant and she totally explained to me about their food and how they'll work with you and cater to you. She was not kidding! 5 hours later I went and ate at the restaurant and I was absolutely in love with the food! The waitress was kind and so careful to make sure that none of the foods that I'm allergic to were in anything I ordered. It tasted wonderful! I had butternut squash pizza and grilled chicken salad. Dee-lish! I have found my safe food restaurant and tasty! I'll  be going back often!"}
{"text":"FRESH.  This place is so FRESH.  And GOOD and FRESH.  Yeah, I really liked it.  The structure with a huge open wrap-around porch is fantastic and freeing.  Yes freeing.  It made me feel free and happy.  The amazing cilantro-cucumber-orange zesty margaritas didn't hurt.  And then, the kale salad with parmesan, lemon and bread crumbs is manna from heaven.   So good...you would never dream it is kale filled with everything good for you.   We asked for three vegetarian tacos and they were also amazingly perky and fresh and delicious.  Nice looking, stylish crowd.  And bright and friendly and well-trained staff.  It makes me happy just to think about True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We are dorks for sustainable this, and organic that so we loved it.  We had shrimp dumplings, kale salad, ahi salad, miso soup (awesome), tomato soup (soup of day) for starters.  Everything was great, kale salad was a little plain but tasty, ahi salad was our favorite.  I had a kilt lifter from four peaks, one of my favorite beers so not much to say about that.  For entrees i had pan roasted chicken with brussels sprouts and butternut squash and faro, and my date had salmon with quinoa. I would have liked more Brussels sprouts (1 total cut in half) but everything was so good together it didn't matter.  The salmon and quinoa beet salad was incredible. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Damon, our server, was an amazing host. He suggested most of the things we had and he was dead on. We had a great time. Awesome.....and we'll be back.....loved it."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Really, I did.   I arrived early on a weekday, at 11 AM, to meet friends. The staff was busily preparing for the onslaught, and I was the first customer in the house. At that moment, it was peaceful and quiet. Then my friends arrived, along with a slew of other people, until there a pile of folks waited at the door.  I ordered a Medicine Man to drink, and it was yummy.  Once my friends arrived, we ordered an appetizer and our entrees. That's kind of where things went wrong.   The appetizer--edamame dumplings--was so fresh and organic, that it had a clump of somebody's dark hair tangled up in the daikon radish garnish. Yuck. Double yuck. That sort of put me off the dumplings, which I had already tasted and found delicious, but couldn't eat after discovering the hair. (I didn't mention the hair to my friends, as one wasn't eating the dumplings and the other had already eaten her share. I thought it reasonable that only one of us was thoroughly disgusted.)  I nervously awaited the entrees, wondering what surprises would be nestled inside my Mediterranean salad. Happily, the salad contained only fresh vegetables, nuts, and grilled chicken. No organic matter from another human being. I ate every bite, with no regrets. We even ordered dessert, and I inhaled a delicious, nutty banana-chocolate tart.  In the 1990s, while in graduate school, I ate once or twice a week at a Mexican restaurant in the Haight. They made a delicious veggie burrito that was to die for, and I was addicted until the day I tongued a very long dark hair that was rolled up inside my lunch. I never went back, and every so often, I think of that hair in the burrito and shudder a bit.  Would I eat at True Food again?  I'd like to say maybe, but there is the pesky  matter of The Hair. Just the thought of it grosses me out and sadly, eclipses the high points of the meal. I just don't recall Dr. Weil suggesting we eat human hair..."}
{"text":"Amazing place with great food ( natural heathy food ) If you are a human.. This is the place you should stop by !!"}
{"text":"Top place to eat in PHX for me.  Environment - On point. Menu - simple and incredible. Service - Friendly and helpful.  Full juice bar and carbonated drinks reinvisioned with a healthy twist. Had the chicken chop salad with Oregano Vinaigrette and my wife had the Teriyaki Chicken bowl.   We had the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Pistachio Coconut Ice Cream...UNREAL!   LOVE True Food Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I usually do not write reviews, but felt in this case I needed to describe my experience.  I walked into the True Food Kitchen at Scottsdale Quarter for my first visit as a friendly staff member held the door open.    The restaurant looked promising, was well lit and seemed clean.  Since there wasn't a hostess and the staff member who had held the door open for us had gone back to work and did not direct us to a hostess, I figured it was seat yourself.  There were empty tables, so I grabbed a menu and went to sit down.  As we arrived at an empty table, another staff member asked us with immediate attitude if we wanted to eat, to which I replied yes.  She explains with more sass that we need to see the hostess on the other side of the restaurant.  Since we were already standing around this empty table, surrounded by other empty tables, I asked \"can we sit here?\"   She mumbled as she walked away something about her checking with the hostess.  So we stood at the table, reading the menu.  When she returned, she angrily explained that we needed to talk to the hostess.  At this point I had enough of her crap, I said no, placed the menu on the table and left.  She grabs the menu and stomps off the other direction.  As I walked around the west side of building, there was an unpleasant smell emanating from the restaurant.  Maybe she did me a favor after all.  I will not be returning to True Food Kitchen, ever!"}
{"text":"Warning: If you are not a veggie/vegan or expect a good quantity of food per $. RUN don't walk from this place.  $16 for a burger with a crappy bun? Gimme a break. Hummus was good, maybe because i don't know the price. Apple crisp with a scoop of ice cream was overly sweet and small.(wishing it was a pizza cookie the whole time....)  Yeah i know i'm not the healthiest eater, but i'm in good shape and like large portions and tasty food. This place had neither.  Walk a couple hundred feet to Brio and make a custom pasta dish. You will be glad you did and so will your wallet."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this restaurant until this morning.    A few weeks back -- at the end of a morning run --  I saw that True Foods was open for breakfast.    I've stopped there sporadically and I've been, well, underwhelmed.     I liked the carrot bread well enough to return since it was moist and had good ingredients.     I tried the muffin that was second on the list and found it so forgettable I can't remember the ingredients.     Today was the worst.     I stopped by for carrot bread to go.    When I got home, I realized it was stale.    Dry.    Hard.    I should have returned it but needed to get my day going.      So, instead I am warning fellow Yelp-ers who order any baked goods:    Check when it was made."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars  Oh True Food, how I really want to like you and all your claims of naturalness and whatnot.  The atmosphere is nice, the service friendly, and the pricing reasonable.  However, after 3 trips (two lunch one dinner) and comparison of my fellow diners' meals, the best adjective/expression I can use to describe the fare is \"meh\".  It's just...BLAND.  Fresh and natural shouldn't lack taste, and whether it was the salmon or chicken terriyaki all I could think is that I'm eating a step up from a healthy choice.  Rumor has it that Mr. Fox is taking this concept national--and I'm sure he'll do well as many vegans might consider this a flavor explosion--but Little Lady herself is a vegetarian and I know she appreciates good taste and flavor as much as the next.  Tweak the menu, add some heat, add something and I'll be back....but as is I won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"Always in for a treat here.   Tried the quinoa burger and a ginger drink. Light and refreshing."}
{"text":"I am from Michigan so we don't have any restaurants that offer the \"healthy\" concept True Food is offering so this was amazing for me! I ate at both locations and had great service and delicious food. The kale salad is delicious and all around everything we got was great. Love the ginger drink, but ask for it hot it makes a great tea."}
{"text":"Healthy fresh food. Great for vegans, they even have fresh juice!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Everything is fresh and tasty. The service is fast and friendly. I am a big fan of the watermelon heirloom tomato salad and the seasonal market salads.  My only complaint is that they are a little expensive. I wish there were more places like True Food that offered genuinely delicious and healthy food. The prices are too high to eat here regularly like other take out places. This is a once in a while splurge, but I wish I could eat like this every night!"}
{"text":"Kind of funny that this restaurant is healthy, but when I checked on line to get nutrition facts nothing listed. I called and spoke to manager and he said they don't have.  Really, one of the partners is Dr Weil, you would think that they have this info available.  This is our Second time here and both times I have had the  spaghetti squash. Unfortunately this visit the dish was very sweet. It seems like sugar was added to dish??  Very bland needed to add chili flakes to it.  I have made Dr Weil's spaghetti squash dish that I found on line and it was very good.  Small portions, but hey we don't need large portions anyways. I'm watching my sugar and carb intake, so I would recommend this vegetarian, gf dish."}
{"text":"GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY!!!! Thank you Dr. Weil!!!  It's about time you can go into a restaurant and not have to worry about how many hours of detoxification, hydration afterwards or how much future Prilosec and Plavix you need to save up for!  It was a wonderful journey of food ecstasy!!!  Yes!  I really mean that!  The resturant is modestly furnished but very detailed.  I read about this in a clean eating magazine and said if I ever go to Phoenix, I'm eating THERE!  I loved the food....there was three in my party and I ordered the most and gladly paid the $100 something  bill (plus tax and tip).  Everything is clean, organic, natural and nicely portion and the variety of drinks that are \"good for you\" taste wonderful and they are not alcoholic!  The menu has a nice variety of dishes and desserts (Chocolate cake is fantastic)!!!!    I hope they bring this place to the bay area!  We would love it!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because my friend needs Gluten Free dinners.  I wasn't sure what I could expect for \"regular food\" but was really thrilled with the quality and flavor of the dinners.  4 of us went and the other 2 non Gluten Free gals felt the same way.  We sampled each others meals and found all to be yummy! It is a bit pricey and you can wait a long time for seating, but what can you expect in North Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"Found this on the second to last day of my stay in Tempe and went right back on my last day. Pretty much everything about this place is good (except that it is a Fox undertaking . . .) The Prosecco was delicious and came in a beautiful glass, the kale salad was amazing (though it was a bit more lightly dresses on the first go around, which was in fact, better), the gazpacho was decent, the squash casserole was cheesy goodness, the farmers market salad was simply good all around, and the flourless chocolate cake was soft and chocolatey on the inside but overdone-brownie-like on the outside. Though I did not try it, they offer a gluten-free pizza - hello! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Thought I should give a update for True Food since I've been back numerous times since my last visit, and it's definitely going to be one of the 'frequent' places! The food has been consistently great, i'm not going to complain anything about the portion cuz they are just good for me :p I love how they pair sweet potatoes and kale salad for most of sandwiches, they are not only tasty, but also so good for you!   The only drawback is that they don't take reservations for a party that's less than 8 people...you gotta wait for at least 40mins for a dinner on a busy Friday or Saturday, so if you are on a tight schedule, I wouldn't recommend it..."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss for me.   The pros: great atmosphere, high quality organic, sustainable, etc. like whole foods, healthy.  The cons: pricey for the amount of food you get, sometime dishes are bland, non-alcoholic beverages are way way overpriced.      I had the turkey lasagna and it was absolutely delicious. But it's kind of weird to serve it a la carte. I had a tuna steak slider dish and the flavors were bland and just not working well together. This place is definitely trendy and the food seems to be good quality. What gets me is how much they charge for food and how mediocre-sized the portions are for many dishes. I would probably go more often if food was a little cheaper"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! High quality food combined with attentive, top-notch service. For starters, try the ginger butternut squash. Delicious. I'd also recommend the tuscan kale salad, roasted root vegetables and farro. For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is a must have!"}
{"text":"We went here while on a trip home to visit family.  Our foodie friends told us about this place so we made the drive from The QC to check it out.  We went on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4.  They have some unique refreshments and we opted for The Natural and the Hangover Rx.  Between the two, the Hangover Rx was better...tasty.  We had the Hummus for an appetizer and it was VERY good...some of the best I've had outside of Haji Baba.  The pita's didn't hold a cancle to hand-made ones from Haji Baba or other middle eastern places, but they were good and fresh.  For a salad we split the Chicken Chopped salad...fantastic. and portioned appropriately...everything was fresh.  My wife ordered the steak tacos and I had the Panang Curry for our entrees.  Both were delicious.  The panang was surprisingly spicy for a restaurant curry (without asking my desired heat level) but I like it like that so it was perfect for me.  I don't normally like brown rice, but couldn't tell the difference in my dish...it was very, very good.  The restaurant boasts about fresh, sustainable and organic foods and you can tell...all the other dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen appeared that way as well.  I would have given 5 stars, but the service was a little slow for what appeared like a normal night that wasn't too busy.  It took longer than normal for our entrees I felt, especially when appetizer and salad came out almost immediately.  If they could fine tune service, it would be an even better dining experience.  When we come back to AZ again and looking for a fresh place to go, I'd definitely consider True Food again...and would recommend it to anyone.  Sorry, no desserts on this trip to speak of...too full."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I visited for the very first time this past week and the food is outstanding. I ordered the Bison Burger and my friend had the Lasagna. Both were incredible and worth going back for.  We were seated promptly and the service was excellent. The waiter was also very knowledgeable about the dishes and made excellent recommendations for us. Total for the burger, lasagna, a mixed drink, beer and Sake was $55. Not too bad considering how great the food is."}
{"text":"The place is very trendy, its a very nice atmosphere, but the food I found it more on the low side, its healthy but lacks of flavor, too healthy perhaps."}
{"text":"So we visited this place, against my husbands wishes, since I had heard pretty good things about it. To sum it up, it seems a little over priced for what you get and even though it is healthy and organic we were left hungry and unimpressed. I would say the food is average and $16 for a bison burger is a bit ridiculous unless it tastes amazing.  Drinks were fresh but also expensive and I just feel like there are much better restaurants out there in that price range."}
{"text":"On rare occasion there is a restaurant that goes far beyond your expectations. This is one of them.  From the moment we entered, the waitstaff gave us their full attention.  We were seated right away, waited on promptly, and served a dinner that was absolutely delicious.  Everything presented was visually appealing, healthy and had well composed flavors and ingredients. The service was as good as one would expect at four star restaurant.  Who knew that health food could be so inspired!"}
{"text":"There's something amazing and beautiful about a place where you can go and know the food is not processed, frozen, or pesticide/GMO laden - a place where the food is not just good, it's amazing.  This place is True Food. Thank you for giving us this choice!!!"}
{"text":"From the lady at the door, to the hostess taking us to our table, to your server, to food runners, and to the manager..... Amazing! Overall great experience! Gotta get the HUMMUS! 5 stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love the look and open feel of this place!  Has been a favorite of ours to host birthday lunches for my girlfriends. It does get busy during peak hours so be prepared. I'm pretty sure you can make reservations if you have a larger group. Just not sure of the number. To get seated quicker, you can always opt for a community table or bar (this is my preference if there are just 2 of us). This is one of those places you can eat at and not feel guilty afterwards.  Everything is pretty healthy but still tasty.  When I was doing the 21 day Clean Program, this was one of the few places I could eat out at.    My go to item when I am trying to eat smart is the Organic Kale Salad.  I love the dressing.  I usually add chicken ($5.50 extra) or salmon ($10 extra). I will admit paying an extra $10 for the salmon is a bit extravagant considering it is still farm raised and not wild caught (they label it as responsibly raised). This is one dish I learned how to make at home because I can't really justify the price. My other favorite menu item was their Moroccan Chicken Salad Sandwich which they took off their menu. Was very bummed about that.  I guess I need to learn how to make that one at home too.  Love the Herb Hummus. We usually order some veggies with it and swap out the regular pitas for gluten free pitas. I actually think they taste even better. Their Vegetable Crudite is as tasty as it is pretty to look at. I have also tried their Steak Street Tacos and their Bison Burger which are good. If you ever order a sandwich/burger, you get your choice of a side.  I always do half and half of the kale salad and the sweet potato hash. My husband's favorite item on the menu is the Shaved Turkey Sandwich.  For dessert I like the Flourless Chocolate Cake and on the drink menu you can't beat the Skinny Margarita.  I also love their Green Iced Tea which they are always nice enough to top off and put in a to go cup for me when I am done with my meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the valley! The atmosphere is very comfortable, casual, and fresh! I love the décor and open patio. The staff is always very friendly and the food is always impressive. My favorite things on the menu are the Street Tacos and Butternut Squash Pizza. I highly recommend tying them! This restaurant never disappoints and is a great place to stop at after shopping in the Quarter."}
{"text":"Love, love, love True Food! Have been to the Scottsdale Quarter location dozens of times & have only been twice to the Biltmore location. Atmosphere is open, bright, clean, loudish. Service is always excellent! Gluten free pitas w/hummus (FAR BETTER THAN THE REGULAR PITAS) are to die for! Don't go here w/out ordering the gf PITAS!!!!!! Skinny margaritas made w/cucumber & basil are the bomb! Everything else is very good - always delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are a cow, sheep, or horse, you will love it!  If you are a human, you will need a dictionary to decipher what hippie vegetables are on your plate."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and the food is exceptional!  It is healthy, and tasty! I will be back! Plus, super friendly service!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing and gorgeous place to enjoy a meal you know is good for you! I eat 110% organic and it is very hard to find restaurants that cater to organic eaters like myself. The menu is vast and to my knowledge a bad dish has never been created here. Tru Food makes eating out fun! Friendly staff and amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and I can't wait to come back!  It was New Years day and the idea of a cocktail made my head spin so we stuck with their juice drinks...just awesome. The cucumber/honey lemonade was fantastic, as was the apple/carrot/ginger juice. I was trying to be extra healthy after a weekend of over-indulgence so I went with the Farmer's Market salad. It was far from any bland scraps of lettuce you may find many others places. The vegetables they used, the textures, and the taste combination made it a great and light meal.   Of course we all shared our dishes, which included pot stickers, sea bass with purple potatoes and cabbage, mushroom pizza, and tuna sliders with a kale salad. Everything tasted great and fresh. Maybe the building wasn't intended to be designed to resemble a greenhouse but it reminded me of being inside of one because the walls are all windows and the materials are all natural-looking. The kitchen is open and visible and there is a large bar that faces it.   It's a great place to go if you're looking for something healthy but not bland with a trendy but nice and casual environment."}
{"text":"We went here for book club.  This portion sizes are extremely small, especially for what you pay but, the food is good.  It is not a place I would seek out to go back to again but I also wouldn't avoid it.  Not the best place for a discussion group as it does get quite loud so it was hard for our group of women to hear people who were at the other end of the table."}
{"text":"I will continue to give this place five stars for so many reasons.  First, the menu is very creative, and offers a great variety of healthy food, with an Asian twist.  This time I had the shrimp curry, which had lots of fresh vegetables, and instead of a heavy cream curry, it was a much healthier broth curry.  We had the edamame dumplings again, which were as good as I remembered.  It was kind of cool to see Dr. Weil eating there last night.  It's good to know that he likes the place enough to dine there."}
{"text":"Food is actually good, but you get small portion sizes. That wouldn't be a problem if they charged you a proportional amount for the small size. However, they charge you as much as Cheesecake Factory does for a meal that can feed several small villages. We are talking $18-25 for a portion size that should be $9-12.   I realize that people will eat here anyway and probably pay those prices. I just don't think people realize how much they are paying for the food. As most Fox concepts go, eventually the food will become mediocre at best and ultimately this place will lose its luster."}
{"text":"My friend and I headed over to True Food for a Sunday lunch after hiking Piestewa Peak and this place hit the spot. I thought the food and fresh juices were very reasonably priced. Especially considering the beautiful decor and quality of the food.  Lovely for a spring afternoon and good company."}
{"text":"True Food was the most recent of my new lunch spots to try.  Very cool environment inside with kind of the \"green\" concept.  Everything, or atleast I think everything, is locally grown, organic type food.  You kinda have a healthy feeling in there.  I ordered the Sashimi Tuna salad which was fantastic.  They are very generous on the tuna as you get some with every bite until the end.  It is also filled with cucumbers, edamames, tomato, avacado, and ginger dressing.  I'm not sure if it was healthy but it felt healthy for some reason.     The staff was very friendly and the decor is pretty neat.  Its a very open space and I think they even have some community seating in the front.  I happen to sit at the bar where you could watch them make fresh \"Natural Refreshments\" as they call them.  As nice as everyone was they do have some kinks to work out as all new establishments do.  I ordered a hot green tea and the server was very excited to take my order.  About 3 minutes later she came back and said she didnt forget about the tea she was just waiting on a tea pot?  I was a lil confused?  Did they not order enough tea pots when they opened?  Couldnt she just make it and put it in some other glass?  I mean tea is just a tea bag and some hot water right?  I didnt suggest these ideas to her so i just patiently waited.  About 20 minutes later after i had finished my salad I said \"Do you have the tea?\" She was still waiting for a tea pot and replied with a smile, \"I didn't forget about you Im still waiting for the tea pots.  They are going through storage in the back and getting some cleaned up for you.\"  I thought to myself, \"okkkk\".  In the end, I did get my green tea.  However, I never got it in the pot.  She put it in a to go cup for me in which the lid didnt really fit.  Why she didnt do that to begin with so i could enjoy the tea with my meal was beyond me.  HAAA!!  Bottom line- Good food!  Everything i saw go by smelled and looked very good.  Just ask if they have tea pots BEFORE you order your hot tea.  Cool decor!  Oh! and definitly go to the bathroom.  Cool waterless urinals which they tell you saves 40,000 gallons of water a year and cool powerful eco-friendly hand dryers!"}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen has good and healthy food. It's definitely not a place to go if you want a some \"comfort\" -- let's say...French Fries with your low-fat Turkey burger.   I ordered a cup of Miso soup ($3) and hummus as my main course ($8). Both were fantastic. My husband ordered Chicken Sausage Bolagnese ($14), which he loved. For desert, we shared an apple-cranberry crisp with dairy-free Maple-flavored ice cream ($6). We were both pleasantly full and happy after our meal.   They have a series of specialty drinks which the waiter pitched to us fervently with words like \"you can't get this anywhere else in the world..\" Ross tried \"Andy's Elixer\"and enjoyed it, but I was not impressed and thought it was a waste of $5 bucks.   We would visit again, but I imagine this isn't someplace that would elicit an: \"I have a craving for True Foods Kitchen\" statement. from my husband or I."}
{"text":"My husband and I love True Foods. Their Turkey Burger is incredible and I love the sweet potato hash and kale salad. I have yet to try anything I did not love. It is a great way to go out and still eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Really delicious!  Tried the location in Santa Monica first and came back to the Scottsdale location based on that experience.  The Edamame Dumplings are excellent- so good!  Definitely recommend those as a starter.  At our table we had the spaghetti squash casserole, black cod, salmon and red chile shrimp.  Everything was delicious despite the fact that they were slammed on this particular evening.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night- but if you want good, healthy, fresh food relatively quickly then this is a great choice.  Beware- on a Saturday night the wait was almost 2 hours- luckily there is a lot of shopping nearby to kill time if you didn't have the forethought to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow, I have no clue what all they hype is about. The only reason I went to this place was because we hadnt been there and my parents wanted to check it out.  The concept of the restaurant was cool. I like all natural ingredients, fresh produce, nothing \"from a can\" concept and the open floor plan layout. All those are all great points.  The food was mediocre and the service was awful. The food was way over priced for it's quality. I ordered the ahi tuna which was a c grade tuna. No sushi grade or ahi for that matter. It was just standard raw tuna. The lettuce was not fresh at all, and everyone's portions where tiny.  Everyone walked out of there hungry. All the waiters suck really bad, and need some training.  I do not recommend this place to anyone. I will never go back to this place. :("}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that the food is really solid. It's hard to find a good vegan sandwich in Phoenix from a place that is not strictly vegan. Plus, I was impressed with the number of vegan options they have! I had the TLT and thoroughly enjoyed it. The bread was a little too toasted for my liking, but overall good.   The staff was overall friendly, they also gave off a snooty vibe. I probably didn't help my case by walking in sweaty from a mile long walk in the midday summer heat while wearing workout clothes and worn out Birkenstocks. But hey, a girl's gotta eat!    Also, they did have a few vegan dessert options as well, but they all looked like shit. Add a vegan brownie or cake on there. No one wants flan or plain vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Called my order in, was told food should be ready 10 minutes...more like 25 minutes. I really do not think my order was cooked until I walked into restaurant. Ordered Bison burger and Flourless cake; burger and sweet potato hash was barely warm to say it was just cooked and the cake was hard. Sweet tato hash was nothing to be desired. Drove from East Mesa to try this place and was disappointed. Two stars for seemingly professional service and thought bison was flavorful just wish it was hot."}
{"text":"So many good options. It was so good I went two nights in a row. The steelhead salmon is amazing. There are so many options for meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans. Great food amazing ingredients and super friendly staff. Sitting on the patio enjoying the view of the palm trees and lights is a perfect setting for a delicious meal!! Would eat here any time! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for those looking for a healthy meal with super-fresh, sustainable and organic-farmed ingredients in a great open atmosphere. This is especially the case for those with dietary restrictions (gluten free, vegetarian, vegan).  Ate lunch here & the menu was clearly marked with gluten free items and their server was really knowledgeable. For starters they were able to sub the pita bread in the herb hummus for some veggies and it was excellent! The drink list is great as well - after a 4 hour flight, I opted for the Hangover Rx - a tasty concoction of coconut water, pineapple, vanilla and orange juice - so good and invigorating.  Next was the toughest decision of the day - what to order? I LOVED that their menu featured a \"global\" cuisine Tons to choose from including salads, pizza, sandwiches (they have gluten free buns!), and even some solid entrees! I was starving so ordered the margherita pizza and was able to get it with a gluten free crust.  Food came out quickly and everything tasted excellent! The pizza is definitely for one person and was super fresh, perfectly crispy crust (but not dry like some GF crusts) and not oily at all topped with organic tomatoes and plenty of basil - so good!   Extensive wine, beer and cocktail list - they even have sake!   The space is huge and open with the indoors featuring great décor featuring reclaimed wood, tons of windows and a great yellow and green color palette. You can also see the open kitchen (which always gives me peace of mind). Outdoors there are a ton of lounge /couch areas to dine- I recommend sitting outdoors.  This is on my must-dine list when back in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, service and very knowledgeable about dietary restrictions so that you can sit back, relax, enjoy the open atmosphere and eat without any worries.  Would be AWESOME to have a location in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Just had their Chicken Sausage Pizza for dinner!  It was excellent, the chicken sausage had a fantastic flavor.  The hostess staff wasn't very friendly tonight, but they were pretty slammed, so I just skipped waiting and went to the bar.  Tried the ginger agave drink and didn't care for it much, but loved the chocolate cake with ice cream.  I could eat that every night!"}
{"text":"Best thing I order here for a meal is the bison burger. One of the best burgers if they cook it properly to what you order. That's the only thing keeping me from five stars.   The vegetable crudités is a great starter. Really fresh. They have a shrimp dish that is awesome for something different.   Also they offer a lot of fresh juices. The kale-aide is delicious and very refreshing. Try it if you never juice, it's a great starter."}
{"text":"I went to True Food Kitchen in the Scottsdale Quarter with Business Associates last Saturday.  I had an absolutely horrible experience.    The servers were not friendly, in fact, they were \"pushy\".  It appeared that they wanted to rush us out of the place when we had a large party.  If anything they should have been over accomodating to our party.  The staff was already rushing our dishes out to us and we had not even finished our salads and appetizers.  When the food did arrive it was not hot.  I ordered the trout which included brocolli and califlower.  I should have immediately sent my dish back but instead I \"caved in\" to the staff's desire to rush our table.    As it turns out this was a huge mistake.   I became violently ill by the time that I got home.   My Doctor indicated that I had contracted a severe bacterial infection which my Doctor thought in all likelihood was from \"undercooked\" fish or the brocolli or califlower not being properly handled.  My Doctor indicated from blood tests that the bacterial infection was definitely the result of food poisoning.  It is now Wednesday, 4 days after I was at True Food Kitchen and the bacterial infection is just now starting to clear.  True Food Kitchen has lost a customer for life.  Dr. Weill, you have a lot of work to do if you expect your trendy, upscale, organic restaurants to survive.   John"}
{"text":"I have a love/non love relationship with True Food.   As a former vegan, I loved it. As an omnivore looking for really superior animal and plant based ingredients, it's OK. My desires are gluten free, grain free usually, grass fed / wild caught, and organic. They match up somewhat on these but they're not perfect, in my opinion, but then again, I'm very picky.   The bison and beef steak are supposedly grass fed, yay, but I'm unclear on their cooking oils and salad dressing oils because I get mixed answers when I inquire. They have wonderful salads for the most part, but then again, their oils in the dressings are suspect.   Their salmon is not technically farmed but not really wild caught either. It's like a hybrid which I find frustrating. They pride themselves on using dairy that is hormone and antibiotic free but when I asked about the cream for the organic coffee which the coffee is wonderful, it's just conventional cream. I expect it to be organic from a place like this.   That all being said, the foods are usually very yummy. The desserts are great although I don't usually order them anymore. The service is almost always great. If they would source true wild caught fish and stick to organic olive oil for dressings, I'd be a much bigger fan and they'd get more of my business."}
{"text":"I was in phoenix for work, taking a break from a long day, and decided to walk around the mall when I came accross True Food Kitchen. The decor was really inviting and the place was packed so I thought i'd give it a try.   I sat at the bar which faces the kitchen, awesome entertainment if you're dining alone. I really enjoyed the food and the service was impeccable.  I really liked the Shrimp dumpling! The ahi tuna sliders were really good for a lighter option to burgers.  Do not get the squash ravioli though, I couldn't have more than 2 bites.  Looking forward to going back during my next visit!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and I was nervous about finding vegan restaurants in walking distance from my hotel. The hotel recommended True Food to satisfy my needs as well as my non-veg coworker. We went for dinner both nights. The food is fabulous and the service is supreme. Rachel T. waited on us and offered exceptional service. She made sure everything was prepared vegan and that we were happy with all of her recommendations. She was great and if I ever get to travel to phoenix again I will eat at True Food and ask for Rachel!"}
{"text":"First time I visited here I was alone and sat at the bar for lunch.  The street tacos were good, only wish they'd been a little warmer temperature wise.  I got the flour less chocolate cake for dessert and was in heaven!  The nicest part was that somebody picked up my check!    The second time was this last weekend and I was with my friend and my 2yr old niece.  The wait was an hour (surprising at 2:30pm) and when we finally got seated they were kind of snotty about bringing a high chair to the table.  Our food took a long time to come out, and my niece in her impatience decided to chuck her kids drink on the floor.  The staff were really sweet about it, but by the time our food came out I couldn't enjoy it because my niece was done sitting still, so I got to eat half my pita (pita bread was super yum!) and had my dessert packaged to go.  Their flour less chocolate cake is divine even to go!  Some of their staff are amazing and others are borderline rude.  Would not say it is kid friendly, but could have just been an off day for them and us!   Will make sure I'm with adults and have no time constraints next time I go."}
{"text":"Dine there for lunch and dinner  frequently and am never disappointed.  Recommend! If healthy eating is your thing, this is one place you can stick to your plan.  Vegan and Gluten-Free Options are available and in a variety of items.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We sat on the patio and our server Aaron was super friendly! He was very detailed on his descriptions when I asked about certain things on the menu. He also was able to recommend a lot of great options! I ended up going with his recommendation of the spring vegetable salad and I am so glad I did! We will be back to try more on the menu and hopefully have him again as our awesome server!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch there yesterday and felt that the menu had a lot to offer.  Everything looked very healthy too.  I have never had a bad experience at any of the Fox restaurants so I knew I'd like this one too.  One of the servers brought us a couple of different items to sample which was fun and he told a story about how the restaurant started.  Very fun!"}
{"text":"Very good. Felt full and not \"gross\". Only reason it didn't get 4 stars is because my meal wasn't my favorite. I got the teryacki chicken bowl and the rice was saturated in sauce. Just a little too much for me. Still very good."}
{"text":"This is a healthier restaurant concept based on the anti-inflammatory diet.  Not all of the dishes are healthy in a traditional sense of the word, but they all include ingredients  that are supposed to reduce inflammation (cause of disease) in the body.    The spaghetti squash casserole was really very good.  Two thumbs up by all at the table.  The kale pizza was good as well. The crust was especially tasty.  The kale -aid was also tasty at first.  Here are the issues that need to be resolved for me to want to return (or to try the one in Santa Monica):  Service was terrible!  Our server had time to give us a two minute spiel about the concept behind the restaurant, but he took over 10 minutes to bring us water back and then we waited another 5 or so for a different waiter to bring us the kale aid.  Fresh juice has enzymes (which was part of his spiel) but using the juicer they use, will die off in less than 6 minutes if not consumed.  Bummer.  It also was filled to the brim with ice.  First off, fresh juice does not need to be that cold.  Second, when it's 105 degrees outside, the ice is going to melt in just a few short minutes, causing the juice to be extremely watered down and rather tasteless.  Give me a smaller cup and less or no ice please!  (and the price! it's much cheaper per ounce to get juice at the whole foods juice bar!)  We specifically asked our server if the kale pizza had anything other than goat cheese on it and he said no.  It showed up with some other kind of melted cheese.  I asked what kind of cheese it was.  He told me it wasn't cheese.  I asked what it was if it wasn't cheese.  He said ricotta.  (oh god.)  I told him that ricotta was cheese and I asked if someone could walk me through the ingredients of the pizza so i could figure out if i could eat it.  5 or so minutes later a manager can by and told me that the pizza had ricotta, fontina, parmesan, and mozzarella (don't quote me on that).  Hey, I am just lactose sensitive, but imagine if it was a nut allergy or worse!  Bummer again.  They fired another pizza for us, but by the time it came out, we needed to leave and my son and hubs had pulled off a lot of the cheese from the first pizza and eaten it.    I wanted to really LOVE this place.  We are loyal customers, but the blend of bad service and under-trained staff make this not a safe bet for me.  I need to feel confident that when I ask a server a question that they will answer truthfully or have the initiative and pride in their job to find out the answer. Too bad.  I love me some whole food nutrition!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and atmosphere was nice.  Had the curry and it was a solid B.  Very good vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love, love this place! My family & I go all the time & have never had a bad meal! Service is good, drinks are wonderful, even the non-alcoholic ones! Edamame dumplings are a must! My only complaint would be the Kale Salad dressing is too lemony & strong. It's delicious healthy food!"}
{"text":"Got into town from SoCal last night with my mom and we decided to try something new. Overall the food was very good. I had the panang curry which was very flavorful and well balanced. My mom ordered the steak tacos. These were okay, a bit lacking in terms of flavor. For dessert we shared the apple cranberry crumble with a delicious maple ice cream. The two went lovely together and the different textures made for a wonderful experience.  Probably the worst part of our meal was the fact that we had to wait almost an hour for our main dishes. Hopefully this is only because the restaurant is still new and will improve as everyone gets acclimated. I really do like this restaurant's concept and the open kitchen reminds me of home. I would give it a 3.5 if I could. Hope our next visit is better."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and have enjoyed both the food and the service. Both times we sat at the bar and we treated like a regulars. When we returned for our second visit we we welcomed back, that was a nice feeling. You have to try the skinny margarita, THEY ARE THE BEST! So far everything we have tried is very good and it is worth the drive since we live in Glendale, it is a bit of a trek but well worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent SeaBass! Brent was such a great waiter, explained all the ingredients and was very attentive. I be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My husband and I found this place and loved it back when we were eating anything we wanted.  After finding out about some food allergies and health issues, what we can eat is much more limited - and True Food is one of few restaurants that can accommodate our needs.  Because of my extensive \"forbidden foods\" list, I order like Meg Ryan in \"When Harry Met Sally\" - substitute this for that, put this on the side, add that - yet the staff never treats me like the pain I know I'm being.  Instead, they politely take my order and get it right every time.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, fresh and can be low fat and calorie if you're conscientious while ordering.  That said I have ordered multiple salads, the watermelon salad is definitely the highlight!  The bison burger is divine, I ordered it on the gluten free bun, they use udi's brand which are poor in texture and flavor but when I mentioned it to the server the manager swing by and offered us a complimentary dessert which was unexpected and much appreciated.  I'll go back but skip the gluten free bun next time.  Worth a trip just for the atmosphere and cool vibe."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and healthy food.  The menu has something for everyone and can accommodate various food preferences, making it great for groups."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out and I'm so glad I did. I went with a few people so we all had different items and shared them. Everything was incredible. Each dish was flavorful and my fish was cooked to perfection., Who knew bok choy and kale could taste so good! They have a good variety of food on their menu so there is something to suit every taste. I'm always a supporter of using local produce and wholesome organic ingredients. Also they have really unique and delicious mixed drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Attentive service, good food, good vegetarian options. Might lack on vegan and gluten free options. Kids friendly, correctly priced. Very good place to go when you are there up-north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had the Butternut squash pizza and the beet bruschetta! Yumm! Wanted to lick the plate. Service was slow but food was amazing! I didn't even know I didn't have meat!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food. Great vegan options and the kale-aid was amazing!"}
{"text":"Our family favorite. We go there often. Great location and outdoor seating. Service is as good as the food. My favorite is panag curry. You can also have your dog on a leash right outside the patio area. They will bring in drink for your dog as well."}
{"text":"Cool place. Okay food. The chef needs to learn how to cut sashimi as we could barely find it on our plate because it was so thin, so I would skip that and stick with the bison burger. Location and restaurant layout was good. Everything else was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Awesome organic food with an upscale, modern vibe. Great list of non alcoholic beverages. Even better service. I wish there was a restaurant like this in Vancouver BC :("}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago for brunch. It rained that day and there were COCKROACHES!!!  We're giving it 2 stars because they tried to take care of us but it seemed as if it wasn't the first time they had that problem."}
{"text":"I enjoy a variety of things on the menu, and I like the approach to eating healthfully.  Unlike some of the other Fox restaurants, I don't think this one is overpriced.  Where else can you get quinoa salad?  I'm not a vegetarian, but I eat many of the vegetarian options because they're so tasty.  The \"TLT\" (a fake BLT) is amazingly good.  And, of course, the hummus is one of the more unique takes on that dish you'll find anywhere.  The wine list is spartan, but that is a sacrifice you'll have to make for their good, healthful options.  Last, I know it isn't their fault, but be prepared to be annoyed with the Biltmore's ridiculous parking system."}
{"text":"Love this place! Never disappoints, salads are fantastic!  Try the chicken chopped and corn/eggplant pizza."}
{"text":"Dr. Weil should come to L.A. with his restaurant sooner than later!  I had the ahi sliders which were super delicious and cooked to perfection.  The hummus and flax seed pita was amazingly fresh and light and something I'm craving right now.  Have the Medicine man elixir and feel immediately energized and enlivened.  A kale salad side is the perfect add on to the main dishes and lets me get in my daily vege requirements in one full swoop.  This is the best thing to happen to healthy dining I've seen in a while."}
{"text":"Love the True Foods in the Scottsdale Quarter and the Biltmore location as well. The food always tastes great! I love how they update their menu seasonally. One of my favorite dishes is the Seafood Cauldo. A delicious large portion soup that is a nutritious and plentiful meal. Check out True Foods if you haven't been there you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food,  atmosphere and service.  Ate here with my brother twice.  All organic healthy food.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly cheap for Biltmore area. Lunch is less than $10 and the plates are hearty. I ordered one of their salads and their full size was worth it. Their curry soup was awesome. The ginger drink was really refreshing.The ambiance is nice too. Prep cooks are prepping veggies, pastas and othe items in plain sight. Everything is cooked in an open kitchen. Very clean and organic environment/food. I am going back!"}
{"text":"Great place with nice patio. Friendly staff. Offers many healthy choices, and everything I have ordered has been delicous. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food and healthy ingredients. Truly top notch. I got the Steelhead Salmon and Beet Salad over Quinoa. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very nice place with good staff. I had the Turkey bolognese and flourless chocolate cake. Both tasted great but the portions are unnecessarily small. When i pay $14 for a bowl of pasta I want the bowl full. All people with a gluten intolerance are not dieting women. Some like me are 200lb gym-going men. Similarly the tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream was not enough to wash down the small chocolate cake cupcake. Come on guys, don't skimp on inexpensive ingredients."}
{"text":"I have nothing but GREAT things to say about this place! I have been to both locations in the Valley (Biltmore and the Scottsdale Quarter) and not only is the food mouth watering..the atmosphere is so great! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I do wish the portions were a little bigger though considering that this dishes aren't cheap....HUGE fan of their green tea horchata."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, me and my boyfriend are coming 3 times every week. Is not just that we love the place but the food is amazing and the best part is that everything is healthy and clean. The location is perfect because is in the middle of Scottsdale quarter mall Love this place, definitely one of my top 5!"}
{"text":"All our food was cold except the pizza. Been there probably 5 times and this was the worst ever. My wife and another couple went Sunday around 4pm. We all order something different and 3 out of 4 meals were cold except the pizza. Our meal was right at $70 not including tip. Even the kale salad that we always looked forward to was not the same. I don't mind spending the $$ as long as the service is good and also the food. Sorry guys but it will be a long time before we come back."}
{"text":"First time to a True Food, while on vacation in Scottsdale AZ, and we were fortunate to find this place. My fiancée is a vegan and it's difficult at times to find a place where we both have good options.   The miso soup and edamame dumplings were fantastic. Great drink menu as well. The only reason I'm giving four stars is because it's a bit pricey. We hope they expand this restaurant into California."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming her for many years and it pleases us every time. It's a healthy alternative that makes your mind and body feel fresh and satisfied. I often get the kale salad with chicken, and my daughter always tries a new non alcoholic drink. True foods is fully packed every time but they handle it well and we wait just enough to eat extra quickly. You can reserve and price is not bad for the quality you are getting. :)"}
{"text":"Meh. I've tried True Food Kitchen twice now and both times have been quite underwhelming. Not anything terrible, just bland, and boring. I had the panang curry with shrimp, and the boyfriend had the chicken sausage pizza. My curry was more like yellow curry with a lot less flavor. And the potatoes were kind of crunchy, too. Pizza was fine, nothing special.   The first time I went (for take out) I got the shaved turkey sandwich which was pretty much flavorless.  Even writing this review is making me feel flavorless and boring. Sorry guys.   I am really torn between 2 and 3 stars, because our server was so amicable, and our drinks were good (albeit reaaaally slow). But overall I have a much more 2-star feeling about this place. Meh."}
{"text":"We had a decent lunch here, but not good enough that I'll be back any time soon. For an app, we had something that was like a carmelized onion and goat cheese pizza which was very good.  For my entree, I had the butternut squash ravioli, and it tasted very \"earthy\".  The service was decent."}
{"text":"While walking in the Scottsdale Quarter area and looking for a place to eat a quick lunch, I stumbled upon this place and was intrigued by the concept and menu items. I ended up ordering the turkey lasagna which contained spinach, ricotta and organic tomatoes and baked and plated in a casserole dish which was nice surprise from the traditional presentation of how lasagna is done. The portion was just right and I did not feel that I had overeaten after leaving. Simple syrup was provided for my black ice tea which was a nice twist as they were out of sweeteners. I definitely would return should I ever be back in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The staff could not be nicer, extremely accommodating for special diets which is very helpful!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised the reviews for True Food aren't a little better. It's true that it's on the expensive side and there is a sales nature to the waiters, but if you want to eat some really amazing salads or a healthy lunch that won't leave you feeling weighed down, this is a great spot. Their salad with farm vegetables with manchego and the sashimi tuna salad are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"First, I was happy to just be away, ALONE, with my husband!  So right away the night started out positive.  We had done a little shopping at Last Chance and needed a bite to eat.  We are not that familiar with the Biltmore area so we just happened to pick True Food.  It looked busy (a good sign of a good place to eat), it looked healthy (got that from the name), and it appeared to be casual.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The service was just OK.  One funny thing happened, our waiter walked right into the glass door of the private room.  Don't worry, he wasn't hurt.  He brought us the wrong salad.  He took away my knife and brought me a fork replacement instead of a knife.  He did have one great recommendation....the hummas appetizer.  This was fantastic.  We did need extra pita bread.  We split the chopped greek salad with chicken.  It tasted great; however, the portion was crazy small for the $12 price.  For our entree we split (bad idea) the butternut squash raviolis.  We each got 2 raviolis.  The taste was just OK.  Our server highly recommended this dish to us.  Not sure why.    Over all the portion sizes are ridiculously small.  The table next to us agreed.  The LOVED their soup and apple crisp dessert but nothing else.    So if you go...get the hummas appetizer, soup and dessert and you may like it!    I did have a celebrity sighting while I was there!!!!  Big from Sex in the City was there having dinner with his wife."}
{"text":"Some of the best healthy food I've had! Place has a nice atmosphere in a great walking shopping plaza. Loved my quinoa burger, veggie appetizer and smoothie."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I adore, it is restaurants that provide fresh food. Not only is the food delicious but the fresh drinks are incredible. There is a happy and friendly atmosphere that really adds to the effect and really makes you feel welcome and feel good about eating there. If, of course, you find inside to be too noisy, there's always the option to go to sit out on the patio.   However, I do feel like the prices were a little steep, but then again there is always a higher price on fresh food simply down to the fact that it's cheaper to process food. Other than that, a truly fantastic place to eat with appealing food."}
{"text":"Husbands dinner was red chili shrimp. Shrimp was like rubber. Noodles were lumped together in a doughy mess. I had sea bass tacos and have spent the 24 on the floor by the toilet with food poisoning. Service was good, everything else was less than one star."}
{"text":"Good lord, that was a hell of a lot of veggies in one dinner!  Once or twice a month we go to TFK to visit with one of our friends who is a vegan. She normally goes over the top in ordering appetizers, and our last visit was no exception to that. We rolled in to find her sitting in front of a bowl of iced down fresh veggies, and I mean a mixing bowl, not a soup bowl. We ate the whole damn thing.   Followed that with the mushroom pizza. Damn good, no sauce, and tasty as can be!  I even went so far as to clean up my girlfriend's dinner of vegetarian Chinese dumplings and kale salad. It was delicious!  More and more I am thinking about giving up meat. Its going to be a hard thing as I have a deep addiction to meat products, but more and more places like TFK are changing my mind on the whole vegetarian thing."}
{"text":"Yummy!  The pizzas are delicious, especially the Roasted Eggplant, which I swear has bacon on it, but apparently it doesn't.  I feel so healthy eating here.  The Tuscan Kale Salad is delicious and incredibly good for you.  A glass of white wine (the 6-dollar one is good) works well with the food I've had here.  Some may find it a little pricey, but I think the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting.  Organic, fresh food always is a little more expensive, but well worth it for taste, your health, and supporting local agriculture."}
{"text":"It's actually true that everything is good here. Their dishes are delicious without feeling too heavy. Also love their variety of natural refreshers, especially the hot natural."}
{"text":"I would give their kale salad 5+ stars.  Its amazing that they were able to find a way to make kale irresistible.    The drink menu also looked great.  I had a really great green tea drink which I really enjoyed.    The reason for 4 stars?   My main dish, the green tea soba noodles, was pretty unimpressive.  Also the service was pretty bad.  They mean well but they just didn't have it together. Our food took forever to get out to us.  We would have to ask 3+ times to get water, our check, etc.  I will most definitely return here.  For the kale.  Yum."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while we were at the Quarter shopping. The waitress was super nice, asked about an allergies. We started with honey bee ginger bee and I absolutely loved it. Very sweet, but I just love ginger beer. Enjoyed the candied ginger accent too.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich and thought it was great.  Overall I thought it was kind of expensive but really enjoyed myself. I love the concept and I'd like to go back. The cocktails sound great and I'd love to have the ginger beer again."}
{"text":"Everything was great and our bartender Gina was fantastic.  I'll come back to add to this but had to comment on the squash desert as it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Our service was fantastic, but hard to overlook our burned gluten free pizzas. Manager on duty came over when our server noticed our distaste, but failed to introduce herself or resolve any issues. Frankly, disappointment after spending 24 dollars on 2 pizzas, not to mention drinks, salads, and dessert. Won't be coming back and certainly not recommending it to any of my friends or family. I wanted to love this place, but a little poor customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Love, love, love True Food. It is one of our favorites. You can't go wrong with the turkey bolognese, steak tacos and the Tuscan kale salad. Plenty of gluten free and veggie options and a great wine selection. So yummy."}
{"text":"We walked by True Food Kitchen a week before opening and it looked promising. We decided to try it one night after hitting the gym thinking it would be a healthy way to follow our workout. We also like most of the other restaurants in the Fox  Restaurant group and thought we couldn't go wrong.  The restaurant was crowded but there was no wait for patio seating when we arrived.   Our waitress did a very poor job explaining the menu. The Sandwiches come with a choice of sweet potato hash or a side salad. The only way we knew this was overhearing a conversion at the table next to us. The Ahi sliders no longer come on pumpernickel bread but on Hawaiian roles and there is no way to know this as the menu still says pumpernickel.   I decided to order the Grilled Wild Salmon sandwich with a side of sweet potato's. My fiancee ordered the Wild Ahi Sliders. During the wait for my meal the waitress said that my lemonade came with one free refil (also not listed on the menu). The food arrived and I was served the Grilled Salmon with Roasted Organic Vegetables off the Pastas & Entrees menu and not the sandwich that I ordered. A plate of cold cubed sweet potato's accompanied the entree. I immediately told the waitress that I ordered the sandwich and she argued with me that I ordered the entree. She finally relented and took the item back but left the cold sweet potatos. My fiancee's sliders were ok but were rather tasteless and lacked the wasabi advertised on the menu.  Ten minutes later my open faced sandwich arrived and on the same plate were more of the cold sweet potatos. The salmon was overcooked and dry. The avocado wasn't ripe and almost crunchy. The potatos were tasteless, dry, and cold.   When the bill came the waitress apologized for the error and said the two salmon dishes are causing a lot of ordering errors. She said she gets yelled at for the errors which explains why she initially insisted that I ordered the entree. She didn't charge for the sandwich but I did get charged $6 for the cold potato's when the menu lists them as $5. I figured she was having a rough night and just paid the bill.   This restaurant is really not up to the Fox Restaurant standards. The menu is riddled with inconsistencies and the food is bland and tasteless. We looked at the food on other patrons table and the other menu items didn't look any better.   This place would probably do better as a lunch place if they lowered their prices.   In the mean time, save your money and head to Bloom, Sauce, Olive & Ivy, or any of the other Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I love this place and wish they'd get their act together.  I picked up 2 salads there last night and had to throw both out because the greens were moldy and decaying (black spots and such). There was no way you could accidentally have missed how bad the greens looked!  It wasn't just the leafy greens; it was the broccoli that had black stems that looked like mold and the brown, mushy avocados as well.  (I have pictures and will try to figure out how to add them here.)  The manager was very nice when I called, but I don't find they ever do anything but give you a credit and continue in the same old way.  This isn't the first time I've had this happen this summer as I eat there quite a bit.  Please, True Food, clean up your kitchen so I can continue eating there.  I used to eat there several times a week besides the carry-outs, but guess I'm going to have to learn to cook and save some money (I don't really want to!)  One positive is that the people who work there are always wonderful, friendly, and very helpful.  I don't like to complain and usually just don't go back, BUT I REALLY LIKE THEIR FOOD WHEN IT'S FRESH AND IN GOOD SHAPE.  I want to go back.  Please check the quality of the greens and wash them as well.  UPDATE 10/3/2015 Just checked my credit card account.  Although I had purchased 2 salads that I had to throw out (and a pizza which was great), the management credited me for one salad and that's all.  When I think of all I've spent there in the last several years . . ."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Edamame dumplings. Chicken chopped. Solid. I could eat here everyday. I probably should, actually."}
{"text":"I always love going to hippy-dippy places that use organic ingredients and choose to fry free range animals.  (If you grew up in Boulder, Colorado, you might likely feel similarly.)  This is essentially the story behind True Food, though I don't believe anything is fried, per se.  Quite a few people at about 6 p.m. on a Sunday evening -- waited 20 minutes.  Ate the green tea soba noodles, quite satisfactory; my mom had the turkey burger and sweet potato hash, which she liked, while my aunt had a wild shrimp, onion and goat cheese pizza which apparently was okay.  Couple notes: the tables in the restaurant are situated quite closely together, which makes it prone to traffic jams (however I did see one guest in a wheelchair navigate relatively easily), and the space is a bit loud and according to my mother, \"the chairs don't accommodate one with an ample behind very well.\"  Oh Mom, that's the media telling you your behind is ample.  But perhaps places like this restaurant are trying to combat that.  True Food was pretty alright -- I loved that the hostess' station was covered in fake grass."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my Favorite healthy restaurants. They offer so many different foods that most restaurants don't offer. From the Bison Burger, to the Spaghetti Squash casserole and even the Kale salad. It is so simple yet o good. They offer fresh squeezed juices and great cocktails. The environment is very laid back and has a good vibe of healthy and happy people."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing concept, but poor wait staff. Expensive as heck for very very small portions. Like I said it's an amazing concept, concept meaning idea. The idea wasn't carried out to well though."}
{"text":"Came in with a group and shared 6 different dishes, every single dish and side were excellent. Awesome drinks, desert, even the coffee was good. Awesome!"}
{"text":"They allow you to choose half portions which was amazing since we wanted to try many things. Creative dishes with friendly and attentive staff. They're also willing to make alterations to a dish depending on any allergies or preferences."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to- hands down!  I went with a party of six and here is what was ordered:  Normally we don't order appetizers, but we were starving so we started with the local vegetable crudites.  This was so beautiful!  It was a HUGE bowl of just gorgeous raw veggies (bright green lettuce, purple carrots, large slices of crispy cucumbers, etc.) and two dips- tzatziki (not vegan) and black olive (vegan and the most delicious dip I have ever had).  Here are the entrees:   Me: I wanted to order the curry, but was disappointed to find out that the sauce had shrimp paste in it so I couldn't have it :(  So instead I ordered the Teriyaki brown rice bowl with tofu.  It was simple, yet delicious.  I would have liked to order something a little more exotic/adventurous, but when you are vegan sometimes your choices are limited.   Husband/Sister-in-law/Her boyfriend: It was highly recommended that the Spaghetti squash casserole be ordered, so three members of our party did just that.  My husband veganized his by excluding the mozzarella.  I stole a bite and it was wonderful!  Everyone who ordered this was very satisfied.    Father-in-law:  Shaved turkey sandwich with sweet potato hash.    Mother-in-law: Turkey bolognese.  Everyone raved about their meal and there was a lot of shared bites going around.  However, I had looked at the dessert menu previously and couldn't get my mind off the Strawberry rhubarb crisp with a side of ice cream.  This was the only vegan dessert on the menu, and if you've read any of my other posts you know that if there is vegan dessert offered, it's bound to be in my belly!    We ALL ordered this dessert and OMG I seriously can't stop raving/thinking about it.  I could eat this everyday.  It was so unbelievably delicious.  When I get home from Scottsdale (to Southern California) I am going back to just have this dessert.    This restaurant is a MUST TRY for herbivores and omnivores alike.  A great place to go with a large group!"}
{"text":"Yum yummy yum! The food is fresh and full of flavor. The freshly prepared juices were tasty and a refreshing change from usual soda or iced tea choices.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was a sort of fancy-relax. Dark but not too dark with splashes of bright colors and a well lit, visible kitchen.   The waitstaff and hosts were friendly and very helpful. They had quick service that didn't feel impersonal.   I will definitely be back to try more of their numerous vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The food is good, however, the service is iffy at best. I have been here twice and both times I asked for a salad that was literally lettuce, grilled chicken and oil and vinegar. I did not ask for them to charge me less than their comparable chicken salad.  Both times, my salad came out 2 separate times completely wrong. A total of 4 times it was wrong. Really?  The staff was dismissive at best.   For a restaurant that waxes poetic about \"true food\", eating clean, and understanding the needs of their guests, my visits proved otherwise. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My #1 favorite must restaurant in phx! Can't go wrong with the elixirs or the Tuscan kale. Dr. Weil knows how make u feel full in a good way!"}
{"text":"My biggest complainant is it is a bit expensive. average price for a plate of vegetables is $18. Don't get me wrong it taste great but come on."}
{"text":"This place deserves five stars for two reasons. First, it is commendable that a \"corporate\" restaurant makes this level of a commitment to serve numerous gluten free and vegetarian options. My SO has celiac and although many restaurants in the Phoenix area are trying harder to provide gluten free options, very view provide this extensive range of options or achieve this level of excellence.  Second, five stars is  deserved for the overall quality of all dishes on the menu.  Other thoughts: Sitting at the bar for dinner is a fun and casual approach to dining here. The people that comment on the small portion sizes are out of their minds. One can only assume they frequent places like Cheesecake Factory. Eat right and live longer!"}
{"text":"Quite a variety on menu, choices for vegetarians and everyone else.  Had spaghetti casserole because of favorable mentions on Yelp.  It was good but not as good as I'd expected.  My husband had a buffalo burger with sweet potato hash which was cooked just right.  Waiter was helpful quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is place serves absolutely the freshiest and Yummiest food... Kale Turkey Burger is so Yummy.... I also always order the Kale Drink....Its a bit pricey but thats okay by me..."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place since I had heard so many good things about it before coming so I was pretty disappointed since my experiences definitely were nothing to get overly excited about.   I went the first time with a friend who had the ahi sliders which I have to say were quite good. I had ordered one of their pizzas which was OK but pretty average. I just chalked this up to this restaurant not really being the best place to order pizza.   The next time I went, I thought, I'll get the ahi sliders since they were so tasty last time. Well, this time was completely the opposite. The tuna had a much fishier smell this time and the bun was all soggy. It seemed like the sandwich had been sitting out for awhile before I even got it. It was so bad I could only manage to eat half a slider. I was considering sending my order back but no one ever asked me if I liked my food. By the time someone had come by to check up on us, I had already resigned myself to the fact that I was going to have to eat a snack once I got home.  On a side note, the sliders came with sweet potato hash as a side. When I asked if I could substitute the side, I was told that I could only have the kale salad. This didn't really make sense to me since even though there were several other sides that were the same price as the sweet potato hash, I was told that these weren't available as substitutions. The worst part about it was I ended up getting the kale salad and it was so garlicky that I could hardly eat that either.  Too bad... I like the idea of healthy, fresh food but not at the expense of flavor and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Been 3 times in the past week and a half. Fresh ingredients, fresh taste, delicious flavors. I had the Mediterranean Chopped Salad - so, so yummy! The quinoa fills you up without being heavy. The Marcona almonds are such a unique addition. The salad dressing is so flavorful. Best salad I've had pretty much anywhere.  My husband had the Bison Burger with the Sweet Potato Hash and Kale sides. He said it may have been the best burger he's had. The sweet potato and kale sides were scrumptious. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is great! Quick service. Unique menu.  Large variety for vegans/veggies/carnies. The teriyaki quinoa is amazing! I had it with tofu and they char it just a little...its delish! The beet bruschetta is interesting...im not into beets at all and I liked it. The drink options are great too.the pressed apple soda is awesome... Different than just an apple Italian soda. Very fresh with great flavor. This place is on my top 5 list."}
{"text":"Kale, miso, shrimp dumplings... all good"}
{"text":"Awesome, healthy place to eat. Most things can be made gluten-free, if thats important to you. The staff are nice and friendly. Foods a bit overpriced to be sure, but it is high quality! The Bison Burger was FRIKKIN SWEET"}
{"text":"This review is written especially for other yelpers out there with food allergies:  I was so excited to try TFK because eating out is so challenging for me due to my multiple food allergies (gluten, soy, dairy, egg yolks, and black pepper being the most difficult to get around). I have to be so careful. What a treat to be able to eat out like \"normal\" people.  Bottom line: I was very pleased with my experience and they seemed to take my allergies seriously.  Please note: I am one of those people who had no idea I had any food alleriges (i.e., I don't know that I'm ingesting allergens b/c my symptoms are so subtle), so this review may not be helpful if you're very sensitive. Sometimes I wonder if I'm ingesting allergens despite my best efforts not to.  First, I emailed the company that runs the restaurant, to inquire about their gluten free food/ prep/staff awareness of cross contamination issues, and heard back from someone after about 2 weeks. The response wasn't very specific about their awareness of gf cross contamination/prep, so I soldiered on and asked for more specifics. I actually got an email from the chef at TFK the next day. He explained they use different utensils/pots, etc for GF food, and would be able to accommodate my multiple issues.  When I arrived at the restaurant, our server didn't bat an eye when I laid out my laundry list of allergies. She patiently went over some menu items with me that I might actually be able to eat, but I ended up coming up with my own dish for them to make, and server checked with chef to make sure they could do it for me. I had diver scallops (4) on a bed of mixed greens with some avocado slices and caramelized onions. It was great, though a tad salty (that's what I get for being limited in what spices I can eat!). For this dish I was charged $22, that was the only downside. They actually had some gluten free, soy free and vegan sorbets available, but none of the flavors really interested me.  Service was great--absolutely no complaints.  I think TFK was the only place in the Phoenix area with \"wholesome\" food that I found when searching online that had GF options on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go if you want an extremely healthy meal. I love the concept of eating according to the food pyramid. We were greeted right away and sat immediately.  My companion had dietary restrictions and our Waitress was so sweet about it and understanding. When the food was brought out her order was wrong. It was handled so professionally. They apologized and immediately corrected the mistake. She even got a little snack while she was waiting.  The steelhead trout was amazing. The bison burger was a tad dry but very tasty. We both enjoyed our Juby fresh juices. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous as usual & \" Blue eyed handsome silver fox \" made my day with an undeniable connection! Asked me if  \" I would miss him when he left \"   Here's a  yelp to re-connect, as you'll know who you are ;^)   vlwaloha@cs.com"}
{"text":"True Foods is our go to restaurant in North Scottsdale.  They offer great service, a bright and airy atmosphere, and really wonderful and fresh food.  Also they have creative and unique cocktails.  You can't go wrong on their menu, and they have actually influenced my tastes over time to eat more vegetables which they prepare so deliciously."}
{"text":"I love True Food. The mint drinks, the layout, and the menu. I also like the friendly staff and overall good feel of the place.   I was just there last week celebrating a career change with my mother and we got there at a high volume time. A table opened up quickly, but there is one thing I will never understand and that is why the bus boys or waiters, DON'T clean the WHOLE table. I watched the guy do a quick rub down and there were still lettuce pieces on the table... Why? In my mind I was thinking, \"Please wipe up the lettuce! The lettuce!\"  Sadly, no.  Also, his rag was so wet that I didn't want to put anything down so we asked our hostess for a second wipe down. The same guy walked back over to redo the table and said, \" You need another wipe down, huh?\" As if it was strange.  Oh well! But the mushroom pizza was amazing and my kale salad was exactly what I needed.  Love the place but don't like rag wet tables!"}
{"text":"Love True Food Kitchen (have been to the ones in LA and Houston as well). Food is consistent with the other locations - great quality ingredients, good portions, affordable pricing.   Personally, I felt the service was only ok. It felt staffed by teenagers who were keen but not very experienced. The hostess also had a bit of attitude. However the food made us forget everything else."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here earlier in the week with the family. The service was excellent, and everything was spotless. My only complaint is that I didn't care for any of the food. I ordered the Bison Burger, which came on a dry flax seed bun, with flavorless sweet potato hash. My fiancé ordered the Mediterranean Salad with no meat, and the portion was very small and not very filling. Her salad was $11, and my entree was $16. I understand the restaurant's concept and I think it's great, but I think there should be better options for those who don't want an extremely clean meal. A beef burger with some deep fried french fries would be preferred! All in all, a great option for clean eaters and those with dietary restrictions, but not for the rest of us who eat whatever we want!"}
{"text":"I just went in to buy a gift card and received the most rude service ever.  I have always wanted to try True Food Kitchen at the Biltmore but will definitely not based on this experience.  The man who helped me could barely muster out \"Can I help you\" and \"how much?\" for the gift card and definitely did not say 'how are you? \"  or an obvious \"thank you\".  I truly don't think he would be capable of setting a positive dining experience.  I actually bought less of a gift card then intended.  Too bad, I wish it were better."}
{"text":"I heard this was a chic place with little options for rough, unruly, mountain man like myself.  After much coxing, I gave it a whirl to my surprise i found a Bison Burger and a salmon plate.......both worthy plates for someone like me.  I ordered and ate both and found them to be tasty!  I did however get some weird looks until i took my coonskin hat off and hid it in my shirt."}
{"text":"Medicine man....here I come! Right at the center of the Biltmore Square, True Food Kitchen is delicious, fresh and healthy. Eating clean in every bite, can't say no to a delicious tasteful and healthy meal! Girls you won't regret it, boys don't be afraid. Just what the Dr. Ordered. Nice ambiance for a great book club discussion on a Sunday for brunch. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I love that no matter what I'm in the mood for, I can always find something fresh, flavorful, and outstanding at TFK.  I have their cookbook as well, and it's amazing!  Watermelon salad, bison umami burger, vegetable crudites, Kale-ade, edamame dumplings, honestly it's all delicious. They can take the most basic of dishes, and give it a simple twist that knocks it out of this world.  We always have very friendly servers and amazing food, not to mention creative, not-too-sweet cocktails.  One of my go-to places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for a girls night out a few months ago and was very impressed! The menu is quite varied, and I love that it boasts healthy options that change seasonally. The only thing better than the food was the service. Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name!) was quite patient and accommodating to a table of six picky women. He brought samples, gave his best recommendations, answered every question, dealt with splitting checks, and did it all with a smile. I particularly enjoyed the outside seating (we were there in April). Everyone loved their dish, from the quinoa burger, tacos, and lasagna to the delicious lemonades. It was a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back and try the strawberry rhubarb crisp if it's still on the menu!"}
{"text":"I'll be blunt:  True Food is my go-to place when I feel like I'm getting doughy, because the food feels healthy.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that with proper ordering you could make this place just as unhealthy as the average restaurant, but it's nice to have options that are not bad for you and also delicious.  Also the service I've had here has ranged from outstanding to average, never below that, and most of the time they're on the high side of that scale."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to True Food Kitchen tonight for the first time; I'd been wanting to try it since it opened and we finally had some time alone to give it a go. All I have to say is -- WOW!  The food is so unique and interesting at  TFK. All of the menu items are organic or locally grown (or at least locally sourced) and the menu was created with Dr. Andrew Weil. But this is not your father's hippie health food.  We shared a shrimp dumpling dish as an appetizer, which was delicious. For dinner my wife had a curry noodle with shrimp dish that was light and just a tad tangy from the curry. I'm usually not a curry person but this was just enough curry to add flavor without being overpowering.  I had a pizza with shrimp, caramelized onions, sweet red peppers and goat cheese. It was amazing...one of the best pizza dishes I've ever had. I'm a huge California Pizza Kitchen fan and I'd put this up against any of my favorites at CPK.  For dessert we shared an apple-cranberry crumble with non-dairy maple ice cream in top. It was sort of like a sweet granola with huge chunks of baked apples, soft cranberries and this amazing ice cream that was so good it was hard to believe it wasn't actually ice cream. Delicious.  We're definitely going back to True Food Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but the service is so bad that I will not be back. It felt they were graciously \"letting\" my dine there, ignoring me for a while before I got the first recognition and menu (maybe they were hoping I would go away on my own?) Throughout the meal not a comment, not a question whether I would like another juice when I finished the first one and then it took at least 10 minutes for them to figure out that I was actually done - I had to place my credit card on the receipt for them to get it. No question on how it was or whether I wanted a dessert menu. No thanks, there are plenty of restaurants with great food and great service. Do not need this condescending atmosphere. FYI, sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a handful of times and every time I have a good dinning experience.  However, last time I was there they were out of 5 of the juices that I ordered.  (Guess it wasn't my day)  Besides that the food was great and service was super.  Great atmosphere, great spacing and great concept.  Super happy to have this located right down the street!"}
{"text":"Sooo good!!! I love the Dr Weil themed menu and the seasonal and fresh foods! I enjoyed every bite of my spaghetti squash casserole and melon/mint soda! What a fun atmosphere - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very hit or miss. I like the food and love the concept (it's dr. andrew weil! he has an awesome beard! and makes healthy food! and stuff for origins!), but some of the portions are woefully small for the price. I have tried the flat breads, salads and wraps, and all have been healthy, tasty and super fresh. Also a great place if you are dining with someone who is vegetarian, vegan and/or gluten free as everything is clearly labeled. and, the lemonade with honey sounds weird, but it is really, really yummy. tart and sweet in a totally different sort of way.   Also, the decor is very interesting. It all appears to be sustainable/eco friendly and the herbs and edible grasses growing all around are appealing and really bring home the fresh, natural, healthy vibe. Hopefully this concept will catch on..."}
{"text":"Always fresh, always good....love this place!  It's probably not the right choice if you're expecting the typical restaurant menu with food that's heavy on the salt and/or sugar."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! Everything is delicious. I love the Vegetable Crudités with Tzatziki & Black Olive dips and the \"Inside Out\" Quinoa Burger with Hummus, Tzatziki, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Avocado & Feta. Yum!!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  We ordered dinner (3 courses).  The food tasted great. Wow it was good.  The next time I go I will eat before I go- The portions were to too small.  That is my only complaint."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times now. The service is solid and friendly, the food is wonderul (ask for the quinoa salad if not on the menu)...The cucumber margarita is my favorite drink.  It's about time restaurants have come around to offering Gluten free, vegan, and vegetarians option"}
{"text":"We ordered tsteak tacos, tuna tataki , chocolate cake, key lime pie, Prosecco and watermelon monitors.  All was decent.  Liked the tacos the best.  Service was decent as well for a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"I love this place. The setting is so beautiful amidst all the palms. Sitting outside is great day or night. Our server Jacqueline was particularly nice today. My favorite stop in The Quarter."}
{"text":"True food is love, true food is life. Everything I've tried is divine, yet so modern and nutritious. The Roasted Ingredient Salad  is my favorite thing off the menu but the Red Chili Shrimp, and Tuscan Kale Salad are good as well. For appetizers, the Vegetable Crudités is the way to go (black olive dip is drool worthy). As far as desserts go, the Flourless Chocolate Cake takes the cake (haha). For a nice night out without completely weighing you down and swearing to begin a cleanse or diet the next day, this is your place."}
{"text":"All the puzzle pieces  fit together. Great food, great service, and good atmosphere. I had the squash, sons had the chicken sausage pizza, and shriltaki  noodles, wife had teriyaki rice bowl. Chicken was a little dry on the pizza other than that everything else was good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Lots of options for all types of appetites.  We were in town last week from Chicago and based on the yelp reviews came here for dinner.  Cocktails were tasty and food was delicious.  Nice vibrant atmosphere too.  Service was good too."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent and if my rating was solely based on that I would have given True Food 5 stars.  BUT, after using the restroom, and witnessing my server cleaning the splash zone around the urinal, my rating went down to 2 stars. Even though I saw my server wash his hands, I was still grossed out. I know someone needs to clean the bathroom, but does it really have to be my server?!?!  Don't get me wrong, I was not mad at the staff, because I am sure they were just doing their job, but I really wish I did not have to see that.    I really love this place and always get good service and delicious food but I just don't appreciate my servers also cleaning the bathrooms and then handling my food.  I don't know if this is their policy, but unfortunately I have not been able to bring myself back there since then."}
{"text":"This was my first time at True Food and I was a little disappointed.  The combinations of drinks were inventive and tasty, not to mention colorful.  The meal was well presented and I didn't have to worry about where anything was from - the wait staff knew where the lettuce was from down to the pistachio nuts sprinkled on my salad.  While the food was healthy and very fresh, overall it lacked in flavor. I first ordered the spicy shrimp and Asian noodles. The texture of the tofu, mushrooms and shrimp was underwhelming. The flavor was below average. I sent it back and ordered the Turkey Pita in it's place which good. I ordered it without the grapes and yogurt but the sandwich was very fresh & flavorful. The ambience is open and light with outdoor seating. They even grow their own herbs and some of the greens. I would pay far more for food like this - even remotely advertised as organic - in some locations. I felt good about eating locally and healthy - for at least one night of my trip anyway. Overall a good experience. I would go back if I was on that side of town."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant. Always consistent with amazing food and wonderful service. I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I come to the Biltmore location quite often for many reasons. I have severe food allergies and True Food Kitchen is always so accommodating to all of my allergies. I can confidently say that True Food is the ONLY restaurant that I can fully depend on to make my food right every time. Not only is it geared perfectly to my allergies but it is absolutely delicious. The chefs definitely know what they're doing in the kitchen. Secondly, the service in all areas of True Food at the Biltmore are excellent. The greeters and the hosts at the door are always so welcoming. It's refreshing to walk into an establishment with such smiling faces. Additionally, Ari (the manager) greets us every time we are in there like we are family. She is always smiling and out on the floor helping every one out...seems like a really great manager. However, what we truly look forward to most is coming to visit ANDREW. With his quick wit, kind heart and superb service, it is always a treat. Andrew was our first server here, and from then on we were hooked! He was so accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu and the concept that True Food Kitchen prides itself on, we instantly felt at home. He is one of the best servers we have had the pleasure of being with!"}
{"text":"Though I was sad to learn Coffee Plantation was gone, Fox has done a great job with this new restaurant. Clean, fantastic foods with veg, began, and gluten free options that are great on taste! Service was outstanding and our first visit was memorable. Will be back on our next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I've eaten here multiple time, and have ended up with very mixed feelings about True Foods. I will clarify my rating to say that overall, this location is better than the one in the Scottsdale Quarter.   On one hand, I love the healthy concept, I love the look of the restaurant, and I love the menu choices. One of my favorite menu options is the Vegetable Crudite. I also love all of the salads.   On the other hand, the cooked food is just never prepared right. Last time we were there I had the salmon. I asked for it medium and it came well done and with no flavor. I had a similar problem when I ordered the sea bass and it came smothered in heavy umami sauce. Another great idea is the bison burger, but that came dry, overcooked and salty.   If you want to enjoy true foods order something that isn't cooked and you will, but otherwise you might find your visit disappointing."}
{"text":"A must eat!   Visited this restaurant for a late lunch after a recommendation from a friend...so glad we stopped by! The atmosphere was adorable; tables weren't too close together and chairs were very comfy. A very open view into the kitchen, which is always comforting.  Service was very friendly and helpful in answering questions and choosing a dish. I started with the green tea and lemonade drink, but the star is the food. I enjoyed the butternut squash pizza and was really hungry, so I ate the entire pizza, but still didn't feel TOO full. My friend had the tacos, which she also really enjoyed.  I can't wait to visit this restaurant in Denver!"}
{"text":"I love True Food Kitchen and highly recommend it to my family and friends.  That said, I was highly disappointed with the new curry dish--I was truly addicted to the old preparation.  PLEASE BRING IT BACK!"}
{"text":"I love love true foods. My most favorite dish is the autumn ingredient salad with grilled salmon. It's so good. I can eat that every day. My kids love the teriyaki chicken bowl and the kids grilled chicken with veggies and seasonal fruit. I always order the kale aid. So refreshing. Love that they can accommodate all food allergies."}
{"text":"Fresh healthy fun food.  The Kale-aid is rich and refreshing.  I recently had the lasagna. Tasty and the perfect portion but I'd definitely pair it with a side salad next time.   I've ate here about 5 times now and I've never been disappointed.  The healthy drink concoctions alone make this place worthy of visiting."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and lots of options but this place is totally overpriced like most health food restaurants which is why it only gets 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Talk about totally Fabby location!  Absolutly beautiful patio and gorgeous views all around.  Scottsdale Quarter is on it's way to being a Fabby Shopping distict which delights all the senses.    House Smoked Salmon & Pita Crackers was delicious  Edamame Dumplings were very interesting  The Hangover RX Elixer was FANTASTIC! {& just what I needed for a Saturday morning!}  Bison Burger not my choice, but hubby enjoyed the change  I was in love with my Panang Chicken Curry Bowl!  Y U Mmmmers !  The Hybrid Martini, with Belvedere & Hibiscus was too sweet for  my taste - hole the Hibiscus and more basil lemon next time :-)  The bottle of NZ Sav Blanc was a perfect pair with the curry!  Pomegranate Sorbet was refreshing  Chocolate Flourless Cake was good to share {x 3} - caramel sauce was too sweet, but again, really enjoyed the 3 spoonful's.  It was a beautiful brunch time on a  perfect Fall day in AZ !   Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ....."}
{"text":"Attended an amazing event in which Dr. Andrew Weil hosted and provided a wealth of fantastic information pertaining to diet, health and cooking.  I really hope something else along these lines might be presented again.    Luved all the samples of the new menu, which included smoothies, tofu breakfast wrap (surprisingly good!) pistachio loaf, yummy pancakes, and yummy granola & greek yogurt.    I appreciate that all their ingredients are upheld in very high standards, and they are being recognized all over, hence opening in other locations such as Scottsdale Quarter (will be much closer for me to visit) and in California."}
{"text":"Let's start with the food. Everyone enjoyed their vegetarian and non-vegetarian option. Have eaten there many times and the food quality is always delicious with many unique options for vegetarians.   Service was bizarre our last visit. First, our server offered to have our wine decanted and another person actually performed the service at our table. Then things turned south. Three of the four entrees arrived together but after telling several servers that we were waiting on our fourth did it show up at five to ten minutes later with no apologizes. We ordered another bottle of the same wine and it comes to the table already decanted without the original bottle. Really? I was speechless and again no accommodation was given. Should have been comped for something but just paid the bill and moved on. No manager came by to make amends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the valley.  Everything is fresh and delicous and perfectly portioned.  My recommendations are the TLT sandwich or the Turkey Bolognese."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I have been here for breakfast, brunch, and lunch and everything I have tried has been wonderful.  There are many vegetarian options to choose from."}
{"text":"True Food is a great spot for a tasty lunch or dinner, especially if you are very into healthy food. There are some drawbacks, and it can be a hit or miss with the service. I have been verbally attacked by a waiter for not leaving \"enough\" of a tip, But, the food is always good and fresh. But this isn't a place for a quick drop in, usually it's quite busy and can take a while."}
{"text":"Amazing options for the whole family! Their specialty drinks were fantastic (especially the pomegranate, lime and chia seed)! There was so much to choose from but my mother and I shared the tofu/shiitake lettuce cups, margarita pizza and a kale salad! they were all delicious. the prices aren't cheap but it's worth it! very cool atmosphere and super clean. Highly recommend stopping in even if it's just for a drink and small appetizer. Awesome shopping area surrounds it too(:"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of True Food, but the food has gone downhill.. safe to stick with the pizza. Although I will say, they have an egg white sandwich with turkey bacon on the weekends which is delicious.   Drinks, on the other hand.. amazing. They will juice anything you ask for. And the Prana martini is definitely one to try.  Overall...Totally overpriced. Service has never been that great. And it's too open and loud. Plus bathrooms are outside, which is just annoying if it's cold out."}
{"text":"We arrived at the True Food Kitchen at about 3pm. As soon as we entered we were greeted in a very warm and welcoming way. I loved the T-shirts the servers were wearing. They all had an inspiring message such as \"Shine On\" \"Honest\" \"Green Goddess\" \"Truth\". Those messages instantly brought a smile on my face.  The atmosphere was pleasant. The servers were speaking softly and with kindness. This is something I appreciate. The menu was a good mixture Omnivorous :) Vegetarian and Vegan. There is something for everyone. So if you are Vegan you can go there with your meat eating friends too. I liked the fact that it is not strictly vegan or vegetarian but that there is a healthy choice for everyone. The food was delicious.I particularly liked the Teriyaki Quinoa Vegan bowl and the Vegetarian Edamame dumplings with asian herbs and white truffle oil! Yum Yum!  A healthy and happy place to eat for ALL! I will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Clean, simple, healthy food with a good amount of variety on the menu. I love restaurants like this that prove healthy food doesn't need to be boring or bland. I got the turkey burger which was delicious, as was the kale salad and sweet potato hash. There was no shortage of food options that sounded tasty and quite a few choices for gluten-free and vegetarian diets. They also had a lot of really interesting looking (non-alcoholic) drinks and I kind of regret not trying one out--next time I suppose!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Phoenix and True Food Kitchen was across the street from my apartment. I went all the time and it is a fabulous restaurant! Now, whenever I come to visit, I make an effort to stop by and meet friends for dinner and drinks. Great food and booze options! In addition, I have a food allergy and every waiter I have interacted with has been knowledgeable about the menu and kitchen operations. Greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but head to the Quarter location for way better service.  Last Sunday, I roll through my girlfriend after a weekend seminar and we're starving.  1. There's a huge line out the door to get seated and they're at 30% capacity. 2. We get seated, order a drink and it takes over 15 minutes to get a beer. 3. Our waitress disappears, so we have to order from a random. 4. They bring me the Grass-Fed burger, ordered incorrectly. 5. I gave them the token to validate and they forget to do it. 6. No apologies, no 20% off, no \"hey, we messed up tonight.\"  Overall, a terrible experience and as big True Food fans, we were beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but the service was lacking. I understand that a Friday night can be busy, but we were in need of a flare to get our waitress to come to our table to take our order. The hostess was very nice. Our waitress was pleasant, but it took forever to place our order, get food and dessert, and finally get our check. I will return but most likely to get takeout. For the prices you pay here, the service has room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great location, fresh food and good service. It's a little on the pricey side, but you can also tell that you're getting a balanced, quality, mostly healthy meal. You get what you pay for. It can get pretty busy during peak times, so you may not get a seat on their nice patio, however the interior is nice and airy. Try the matcha horchata iced and always get the 1/2 and 1/2 side option (half sweet potato hash and half kale salad)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in all of Phoenix. But, I have a BIG problem.  The \"Andy's Favorite TLT\" sandwich is so damn good, I can't get to trying more things on the menu.   Great food, great atmosphere.  Best in class!"}
{"text":"Great place for a Healthy Lunch! If your in Scottsdale, you will enjoy the atmosphere and fresh food!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place when it first opened;  however, I'm a HUGE eater and like to get as much food as possible for my money;  I found the amount of food for the price was a bit off.    What finally sealed the deal was when my friends mentioned something about  ex-cons and anorexics;  combined with  the long annoying wait;  it was just so much easier to head east to new cool restaurants in Scottsdale.    I have to say my recent revisit after 2 years was well worth it.     Food is fresh and presentation is simple and organic.  I forgot how fun it is to go to a health-conscious restaurant.     It's certainly not a meat and potatoes place, and the clientele and staff still look like they need Ensure IV infusion, however, if you want  to eat light  and make yourself  feel like you're eating healthy for a change, this is your place.  Go early!"}
{"text":"Amazing organic (when possible) local food! Curry is a must!"}
{"text":"Been to the True Food in North Scottsdale and this one.  My choice for a last dinner would be a ribeye with everything else that goes with a great steak dinner so it's hard to believe I could give five stars to this place.  Had dinner with four others and we all shared.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.  Both restaurants had a great layout but we especially enjoyed the n. Scottsdale location.  Left satisfied but still felt like you could hike Camelback."}
{"text":"I hit the True Food Kitchen on 4th of July, because I received an email for a 25% off discount at a Fox restaurant. True Food is one of my favorites, so I called up my best friend and we headed over.   I highly recommend the tomato and watermelon salad. It's so light and refreshing. We also ordered the lemon tart. It was delicious as well.   Every time I hit this restaurant, I receive excellent service! The food and drinks are always beyond delicious as well."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences at both the Scottsdale and Biltmore locations.  I'm a regular and have been going for years. I really like how drinks are made with fresh ingredients. And you can't go wrong with anything salmon!"}
{"text":"I've been to True Food a bunch of times but I still can't make up my mind as to how much I like it.  The food is consistently good, kale salad is awesome, tacos, pizza, soup are all good and I love that they have interesting drink choices - I tried the sparkling iced tea the last time and it was great.  Service can be spotty, I even had one waiter sell me on a vegan sweet potato soup only to take a bite and find it had chicken - not good, not good at all, that's a big mistake - they were completely unapologetic about it and blamed the kitchen staff for the mix up.    My main gripe with this place is flies, yes flies.  Every time I've been here there are flies in the restaurant.  The last time I was here my husband looked at me and said, \"oh right that's why we don't come here more often, I forgot about the flies\".  All things considered, it's just OK."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  I came here with my sister that is a vegan.  My wife and I are not vegan but there was a delicious selection for all.  This is my second time coming here and I will definatelty return."}
{"text":"The service was great - I'll give it that, especially since they did individual checks for a group of 7 ladies which I know is always a pain.  However, I felt the food was way overpriced - $23 for 3 tiny street tacos, an iced tea and tip.  The tacos were pretty good but the meat was very rare for my taste, the beans that came as a side were blah.  I left hungry."}
{"text":"Overrated. I had a $17 bowl of ramen. Food was pretty bland and uninspiring. Not terrible, just not worth the prices. I had a smoothie also, which was also meh. The desert tasted like a cliff bar with some stuff on top. The appetizers were ok."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite and they are opening more locations around the country,  can't wait.  I thonk I'm in most locations at least once per year now.   The cucumber honey lemonade is delish add is the seafood special I had sea bass seared with umami sauce.  Service was a little slow but I thunk my server was in the weeds he was very nice the whole time and the manager helped. I think he should have let on he needed help a little sooner. I would go back several times for the food and juices regardless amy time I'm near a location. Where else can you get local source,  ?luten free, preservative free and catering to any dietary needs."}
{"text":"We were on a mission . . . to check out the space for a possible 18-guest dinner on a Saturday evening in March. We were excited as it was the most perfect day to enjoy the patio at True Food Kitchen. Apparently, everyone else had the same idea! What we didn't expect was that at 12:15 pm on a Friday afternoon, the wait for a table for two would be 40-45 minutes! Yikes! So we decided to not put our name down and try somewhere else . . . but before we left, we scoped out the building and patio. On the far end, the side with the really picturesque view of the mountains and the fountains (no streets), was a near \"lounge\" area with large comfy patio like chairs and low cocktail tables. I made a beeline to the hostess and asked if they were reserved or available . . . she said \"the table is a little low . . . \" We said, \"no worries.\" We had our seats and we were ecstatic!!!!   And our experience continued to get better the longer we lingered. The patio area is much more conducive to talking . . . inside, it is very loud, and it would be difficult to carry on leisurely lunch (or dinner) and good conversation. My friend commented how nice it is to go out to eat and feel like you are doing something healthy for yourself. That is the foundation of True Food Kitchen and we likey!!!!   The menu offers so many wonderful choices to nourish your body. Their refreshing nonalcoholic elixirs were calling my name, so I had the Green Arnie which was perfectly sweetened with honey. They also have a beautiful selection of hot teas not usually found in most restaurants, and they serve it with honey as well. (Not a Splenda in sight!)   For our entrees, my friend chose the Panang Curry with Tofu. I was skeptical (having visited Thailand with the real deal). It is a large portion filled with a plentiful amount of tofu and veggies. The tofu was cooked to perfection so that the fragrant and delicious sauce clung to it just so. Yes, I tasted it -- I couldn't help it -- my friend was inhaling it at a vigorous pace! I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole. It was delicioso. The squash and zucchini maintained a little of their crunchy vegetable texture, the tomato sauce was smooth and not too tangy, and it was just perfectly topped with just the right amount of slightly browned mozzarella cheese.   What I loved was that our server, while attentive, was not in the least bit smothering. On such a busy afternoon, she was gracious when we asked for more time to order; she offered my friend more hot water for her tea; and didn't rush us to leave and turn the space when we concluded our entrees . . . she gave us the opportunity to linger . . . and so we did.   No doubt that we will be back again and again. And I'm pretty sure my friend will be booking her 18-guest dinner there, too!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! I am a vegetarian and there are tons of options on the menu, even for vegan or gluten free diets. Everything is so fresh and delicious. We went with a group for brunch and not a single person left unsatisfied. You have to order the banana quinoa Johnny cakes or an omelet, they are divine. Even the juice/smoothie menu looked great.  The staff is quick and friendly and the food is even better! My favorite part is if you sit inside, you can see all of the food being prepped right in front of you. Quality ingredients and great taste/prices. Even if you aren't observing a special diet, I highly recommend True Food Kitchen for any meal of the day!"}
{"text":"Food was great staff pleasant.  I ordered the turkey burger and it was fantastic I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really different! I like this place for the atmosphere, quick and friendly service, and the healthy options they offer. It's convenient in the sense that it's a good place to stop and eat while you're shopping or for just getting a nice meal when you need a change from the regular. I think this is a great place to try out and see if you're in the mood for something more for your palate."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff! Expect line ups on the weekend but it is worth it. Try any of the chopped salads and the curry!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing evening at True Foods. Andrew our server took care of every need we had and Sean the manager gave us extra attention...so much fun and great great food. Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. Whenever my boyfriend takes me out and I get to choose, this is my go to place. And whenever a friend wants to meet for lunch or a dinner, I always suggest True Food.  The food is fresh, as well as the different drinks. I always feel good about what I eat because I know that the kitchen is using the best ingredients, and keeping the dishes light and healthy.   I recently ordered the trout and absolutely loved it. I also usually get the chicken chopped salad.   The best drink the The Natural (cold).  I have never had a bad experience with the service as well. They are friendly, knowledgeable, and want to give you the best time.  I HIGHLY recommend going!"}
{"text":"I eat at True Foods about 4-5 times a week. Compulsively. Deliciously. Fun, what a concept Scottsdale! Yee-haw! About 3 years ago my (now) fiancee, her daughter and I sat down for our first meal at TFK. A fellow named 'Ted' who later came to be a friend warmly greeted us and we had a few chuckles. Great meal. Well then I graduated to the very cool U-shaped counter where I have been a regular ever since, particularly on my solo date nights when my fiancee is out of town. As a military vet I had a couple pick up my check even on Veteran's Day. I have met several new friends there 'sitting around the counter.' The vibe and action is better than a reality TV show to watch from this vantage point. The people behind the bar are awesome, it's like the Dream Team: Aly, Sarah, Randon, Brandon, Jess. (Jess? She could have her own show, lol!) I mean any one of these 'servers' could run a restaraunt on their own, and I hope one day they will. And the managers are just as awesome and have become good friends: Curtis, Adele, Matt. They really MENTOR their people! ANYONE visiting from out of town this is the happening spot! Saddle up to the bar whether you drink or not. Since they don't have sasparilla I drink iced tea. Yeh OK, it IS passion fruit-tinged, which took some time getting used to for a ruffian like me, but now I crave the stuff! A great time all around!"}
{"text":"We visited True Food for a birthday celebration and are pretty upset after waiting more than an hour for our food with no apologies and not even a complimentary round of drinks or desserts to make up for the long waiting time. The food was ok, except for one entrée which was cold. Food portions were small and overpriced. Because of the long waiting time we missed an appointment. Overall a very unpleasant dining experience.  Edit: I got contacted by the owner after posting my review. He didn't apologize or offered me something as a compensation for my bad dining experience. He only asked for our location in the restaurant and our server. Amazing customer service..."}
{"text":"Walked in last nite around 630, sat at bar. Dining room was busy but bar quiet. Horrible service, dirty glassware. Rude bartender. Mushy albacore sashimi, coulda used a straw to eat it  Didn't order a entree , left"}
{"text":"If you are in to organic food or a vegetarian this will be your new spot."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat. Amazing food... And great customer service...I  eat here regularly because I love the food... But today was exceptional... I had an issue that had nothing to do with True Foods. I asked an associate for some help on how I could handle the issue. The manager came out and actually jumped through hoops to help us out. Wonderful place and great people working here."}
{"text":"Looking for a great dining experience come here!  It's not you're normal staple and the ingredients used are fresh and inviting.  I tried things I was a little hesitant to try but so glad I did!  All the food we ordered was fabulous!  Our waitress was very informative and extremely pleasant.  I would come here again if I'm traveling through."}
{"text":"I love this place, never thought I would originally when I checked out the menu. We have tried many items and haven't had anything we don't like. I have been to locations in Scottsdale, Houston and Chicago. The food and service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"4 of us arrived on a Friday night, and the place was hoppin'.  We were seated promptly after a 10 minute wait, and since it was Friday night, it was time for a beverage! I started out with a blood mary, and it was great!  Followed that up with a skinny margarita, which was tasty in my book :).  Appetizers: onion flatbread and dumplings.  The dumplings came in a great broth, but the onion flatbread was awesome! Really thin, almost cracker like crust!  Sides: Kale salad - my friend raved about this dish, but I thought it wasn't anything special.  It definitely looked and tasted healthy, interpret that how you will.  Entrees: grilled salmon -- this dish was really tasty! could have used a tad more seasoning, but it was perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed the arugula salad that accompanied it, and the terrific crunch from the pomegranate seeds.  Dessert: The four of us split the cobbler, which was topped with a non-dairy ice cream.  This was surprisingly not bad, especially the ice cream! Great textures.  Overall Food: Good \"healthy\" food, try the salmon and the onion flatbread.  A little pricey, but that's necessary for organic, farm-raised, etc.  The four of us + tip was $150 +.  Environment: it was LOUD, we almost were screaming at each other to be heard.  The decor is modern casual.  Service: Our waiter was fabulous, she definitely lives the Dr. Weil lifestyle."}
{"text":"Very good food. The kale salad is amazing! I don't think I have had something I didn't like here!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat well and eat healthy.  the food options are great and light but satisfying at the same time.  The Red Chili Shrimp is so good.  but the restaurant favorite seems to be the Spaghetti Squash Casserole. The drinks are good and have nice refreshing options like the acai pomegranate mojito."}
{"text":"The hunny and I stopped in here for dinner Saturday night around 8:30.  There was a 20 minute wait but it have us chance to scope out the nearby h&m and apple store.  The buzzers they give you work in the surrounding stores at Scottsdale Quarter!  We got a great booth/table combo so of course we both snuggled on the booth side!  Alyssa grabbed us cocktails (me acai rum drink??) and the half veggie crudités.  I love the tzatziki!  The drink was not my fav.  I had the spaghetti squash casserole which is my usual favorite at the biltmore location.  Same yummy saucy squash with melted mozzarella. My sweetie got the bison burger and offered to share- no thank you!  Not too much of a meat eater!  I did try a bite and did not hate it.  He loved the mushroom flavor but I was not a huge fan.  He ordered medium well which it was very well done.  He was still happy and are every bite.  The food here was a 4 star and the service from Alyssa was a 6 so it evens out!  A team member of hers took our card and quickly after Alyssa came back to say bye.  Such a nice down to earth person with attention to detail!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a healthy favorite that doesn't skimp on flavor, inspiration, and creativity!!  The veggie crudités is typically my starter if I dine in or take anyone who has never been.  The dipping sauces are yummy and fresh and the one is gluten free.    I usually opt for the turkey pita which is absolutely delicious.  House made pita and roasted turkey shredded with tomatoes grapes and a yummy yogurt sauce never disappoints.  You can either get roasted sweet potatoes or kale salad as a side which I usually get 1/2 and 1/2.  My favorite entree here for dinner is the squash casserole.  Yummy tender squash covered in a zesty marinade with freshly melted mozzarella is light but satisfying.  I love heart veggie dishes that satisfy more than even a steak or a burger.  Dessert wise I've tried the olive oil cake which is yummy but tiny!! It's a muffin size with about 7 berries.  I could eat 10 of those things.  For take out lunch everyone always gets the kale salad.  I personally really prefer the Mediterranean chopped salad with quinoa.  The dressing is light enough so the yummy pea shoots don't get soggy.  The Marcona almonds and feta are the perfect touch."}
{"text":"This is the place we go when we need to feel really good about our food. Natural ingredients, vegan, vegetarian, amazing drink concoctions (non-alcoholic), sinful deserts and, all of it \"good for you.\" Dr. Andrew Weil wins big with this one... haven't been to the Camelback location yet - I hear the Scottsdale one is bigger.  Get there early - they don't take reservations. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza, loved it. Very healthy fresh drinks"}
{"text":"True kitchen is my absoult favorite restaurant in Phoenix . The manager Ariana and her staff are incredible and very friendly ! I brought my from Portland in for lunch and we had a wonderful experience , the food was amazing as always , Arians stopped by our table and we had a fun conversation with her ,she is so friendly and welcoming  . we ordered the heirloom tomato pizza (recommended by our waiter I wish I could remember his name he was great , very  informative , funny and very friendly) charred cauliflower and the torched avacodo followed by the flourless chocolate cake and key lime pie ! The food is always so good and I'm always pleasantly surprised , I always try to have something new each visit . my friend and I both have dietary restrictions and finding restaurants we can go to can be very difficult which is one of the reasons I love True kitchen they meet my restricts and the food is always so good . big thank you to Ariana and her wonderful staff , thank you for giving my friend and I such a great experience!"}
{"text":"2 salads ordered, and nobody bothered to include the dressing. $30 bucks for chopped veggies. Yay!...However, manager called me to apologize and I certainly appreciate that effort to make things right."}
{"text":"Central location. Loved sitting outside under the heat lamps. Attentive servers that clearly stand behind the vision of the seasonal food the serve. I got lasagna - so good and a treat to find it gf."}
{"text":"We were here on vacation and this was an oasis in the desert. Fresh vegetables, creative flavors, and food for kids that actually had vegetables in it (that shouldn't be a wow, but can be when on vacation!). My wife had fish tacos, the kids the chicken teriyaki bowl, and I had the ancient grain bowl. We also shared the lettuce cup appetizer that had a nice flavor. Overall, a great meal. And on top of that our server, Natalee, was awesome. Super nice and very helpful; she helped make this a 5 star experience! (note for those with kids: if you sit outside there is a great space outside for kids to run. A real plus!)."}
{"text":"No other words but AMAZING. -the food -the service  - the menu  - the drinks  -great location"}
{"text":"Love the concept, the ethics, the philosophy, the decor...was hoping I'd love the food and service, too.  And luckily, I did!  Awesome, attentive service (Elyse), and simply phenomenal food.  We shared a crudite, edamamme dumplings (outrageous), and the delicious kale salad, and then I had the panang chicken curry over brown rice, which was rich, flavorful, and spicy.  My boyfriend said the cod was incredible, and he's picky about fish.  Dessert was the strawberry-rhubarb crisp (also outrageous), and a super light and refreshing lemon sorbet.  My one gripe was the coffee was lukewarm.  Other than that, the meal was perfection.  I am 7 months pregnant, so I was pleased to see that they offer several non-alcoholic drink concoctions.  I tried two, a cucumber refresher and a ginger-agave soda.  Both fantastic.    Prices are reasonable.  I NEED one of these in Milwaukee!!"}
{"text":"Great concept but the service was so slow and unresponsive that it made it hard to enjoy the food. Was surprised to be charged for a mere change in vegetable choice...bad form. Food was good, well seasoned, and nicer portions--not too big, not too small. Very nice outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"I am always judgemental about restaurants located within a mall.  I guess I am leary of it being just so-so.  True Food Kitchen definitely surpassed that!  Great selection of gluten free, vegan, and vegetarian dishes!  Well appointed restaurant, casual but classy. We had the dumplings in hoisin sauce.  Light and flavorful.  The quinoa asian salad had a mix of veggies and super fresh avocados.  We also had the mushrooms on toast.  Great earthy tasted from the mushrooms and well balanced.    Overall a win!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time this week after hearing about from several folks...   The lunch was $35 for two with only one drink inclusive of tip and you should not expect gargantuan portions...  What I liked: - Excellent, fresh food served in a healthy fashion - Reasonable portions - Great service even during the lunch rush  We tried the Ahi Sliders - nice wasabi and good crunch, the roasted asparagus - just rights and perfectly seasoned, The \"TLT\" - good sized sandwich, I recommend it with the avocado, and the Kale Salad - OK but it needed a little more zip  What I did not like:  - Really noisy, I can't recommned this place for a quiet lunch... it is pretty hard to carry on a conversation even when seated side by side"}
{"text":"I love this place, and every time I go I'm never disappointed. Last night I reserved the private dinning room for a group of my patients and our health/wellness meet-up group. I had a great time! The private dining room is nice because it's quite enough to have a conversation with the entire table. The downside is that it only holds 12 people.   I had the caramelized onion tart (loved it!), the farmers salad (wonderful spicy sesame dressing!) and the roasted veggies with farro (loved the farro!). And don't forget dessert, - loved the flour-less chocolate cake (dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness)  This place is awesome and everything on the menu is healthy and tasty!!"}
{"text":"everything on the menu is fresh and delicious- Prices are reasonable on the brunch/lunch menu, and the egg white burrito is delicious!! I recommend asking for half sweet potato hash and half kale on the side. The kale salad is amazing and does not come with the dish unless you ask."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place! The food is always delicious. Great atmosphere. Great service. Today my friend and I split the mushroom pizza and the kale salad. SOOOO good!!! I also had the antioxidant juice which was amazing. Love it."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the hummus as a appetizer and ancient grains bowl it was all good and like always great service"}
{"text":"Edamame dumplings---delicious  Caramelized onion tart---good Pan seared sea bass --- I really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts, I didn't really care for the purple potatoes it tasted dry and overcooked, the fish itself was cooked well Almond Olive Oil cake with greek yogurt---the combination of both of the ingredients did not seem to pair well with each other. I think had the almond olive oil cake been topped with anything else it would have been much better."}
{"text":"I was forever waiting at the Apple Store, so I decided to eat here.  Amazing food, great experience!!  Everyone of the employees had a smile on their face."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the area and some friends recommend True Foods knowing my hubby was GF. I wanted to give this place 5 stars but my meal was just okay. John got a spinach lasagna(GF) that was delicious! My red chili shrimp was more like a mediocre pad Thai - similar to what I get at Noodles and Co. Our waiter was awesome and helpful. They have lots of other delicious looking options, as well as some awesome natural beverages. My \"medicine man\" sparkling tea was pretty tasty. The outdoor seating was heated and comfortable. If you want a beautiful atmosphere and healthy food - this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Great atmosphere. Unique menu with plenty of great options for herbivores or carnivores."}
{"text":"Recently visited here and it was a great experience. Food was amazing and the service was impeccable at very affordable prices. Definitly will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"While I enjoy this restaurant, I just want to bring something to the attention of management. We have been here several times, always enjoying the salad with chicken, dates, cheese, apples, and a champagne vinaigrette. Always quite pleasant, until recently. Both today, as well as our previous visit a few weeks ago, the salad just was not up to par. First, I noticed they used a disproportionate amount of different ingredients, and it's never quite the same on every visit. Even if we both order the same salad, our 2 salads come out quite differently Sometimes you get more apples, and almost no dates, sometimes you get large chunks of cheese, no apples. Sometimes you can barely find the cheese. I think they need to make sure each salad is prepared consistently, with the same amount of chicken, apples, dates, cheese, etc.  It just seems like their focus is on other items, and not on making a quality salad.  You can do better."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and the draw is clearly the quality of the food. Service has been pretty good each time I've been there. They do a great job focusing on the food experience and use excellent ingredients. They homemade ice cream is worth stopping in for just a dessert stop."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, great service and a very healthy product.  Great concept from the FOX family of restaurants!  They seem to execute well with hiring friendly and competent employees that get behind their vision.  I thought the food was delisous!"}
{"text":"Table of 4 adults.... Spent $100 bucs and we all left hungry!!!  Super small portions. Sweet potato hash, bland and undercooked. Burger meat tasted good but was small. Tasted more bread than burger!!!  Wouldn't go back, would recommend paradise bakery or jimmy johns, subway over this place!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I love the place. It's gets really busy during lunch. Longer waits. Make sure you have more than an hour when you're going to eat at this place. It gets crowded. Good was great though! Def coming back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner Sunday night.  This was my first visit to True Food Kitchen.  Wow!  I'm sold.  It took me forever to decide what to order because so many of the items on the menu were appealing.  The beverage menu (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) was impressive.  Lots of fancy and healthful options.  I ended up with the turkey burger, kale salad and sweet potato hash.   Everything was tasty.  The restaurant draws the trendy, hip-cool crowd.  It was a little loud and had a long wait.  Fortunately, I by-passed that and took a seat at the bar.  I'm so glad I did.  I had the best service I've experienced in a long while.  The bartender who waited on me was AWESOME.  He could teach a class in how it should be done.  I'd return just to tip him again.  Thankfully, I loved my meal too."}
{"text":"Let's hear it for waiter BILL who served FOUR TABLES with courtesy, efficiency and attention!!! There was a mix up on our cocktails and he subtracted the total for them from the bill! Maitre D' Kelly was also excellent/gracious. FOOd??? Absolutely delicious!!!!! A tad noisy, not much atmosphere but do go for the food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, severs, food, location. Enough said.  Must try their edaname dumplings and their banana pudding."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant that I would frequent  often.    While I thought the food was good, the menu is very limiting for me.  I am much more of a meat and potato kind of guy.  We started out with appetizers which were all good.  For the main course, I had the only meat dish on the menu, The beef tacos.  They were very good.  The beans that came with them were outstanding.  My biggest complaint about true is that they do not offer equal/sweet-n-low for your coffee or tee.  They have natural sweetener which is not sweet.  The service was ok, not great.    Finally, if you are a vegetarian and into organic food, this is your place."}
{"text":"I am impressed with this place, love their flavors, you can actually enjoy veggies, makes a difference when using fresh grown & organic. Fox restaurants go all out in decor and Ambiance feels delightful, nothing better than eating and enjoying a space! So worth every $ can't wait to come back, wish they offer a 6-8 shots on their juices so I can try them all...I had the Kale Aid, was amazing! Loved the texture, very smooth & Tasty.  I'm not a fan of black coffee but can I just say Cafe Americano was a home run.... I enjoyed every zip of it. Final our Server Kim was amazingly attentive, she was super pleasant, honest as her shirt said Lol! Fun & easy to engage conversation. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"Desserts and apps are great. Great servers. The entrees are okay and it can be pricey. I'd go back for: the sauteed onion/fig tart, the almond oil cake and the vegan chocolate pudding. (Alcoholic) drinks are meh."}
{"text":"This is as close as I can get to a \"favorite\" restaurant.  It's fresh, delightfully flavorful, and the service is above average.  \"It's ALL good\"."}
{"text":"If you're willing to run out for lunch a little early, enjoy the lively patio atmosphere will dining on yummy vittles. A When-Harry-Met-Sally picky eater, I, um, grilled the waiter on seafood's sustainability and ingredient origin, and he was good-natured and knowledgeable. A perfect eatery for a casual date or girls' day out.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Decided to come base on reviews. In the area on business. Very very friendly staff. I ordered the summer seafood soup and the hangover elixir drink. Both were good. I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"When I fly to AZ for business I immediately go to True Food upon landing. It is hands down my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area. The Bison Burger, the chocolate dessert, the hummus, oh my! Maybe my obsession stems from having nothing like it here on the Main Line in PA? I have heard through credible sources that they are opening one up near KOP in 2016. To hold myself over until then, I made sure to go twice when I was in AZ this past December..."}
{"text":"I loved the food and the atmosphere!!  I ordered a Teriyaki Quinoa bowl with tofu.  It was so delicious!  The food had the right amount of teriyaki (meaning it wasn't drowning in sauce), with tons of veggies (broccoli, carrot, bokchoy, mushroom, avocado, sesame seeds).  Two others in my party ordered the Ancient Grains bowl, which they also loved.  the fourth person ordered Panang Curry, which she loved because it was definitely spicy.  We sat out on the covered patio, which extremely nice.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great concept, but menu options were a bit limited for my palate. Need a bit more creativity and variety. Liked the non-alcoholic drink options, but none of the desserts were calling my name. Servers were attentive and friendly, which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Really good juice. Good food. But Minus one star for farm raised steelhead from Scotland! Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at True Food Kitchen in Scottsdale for the first time last night.  We started off with skinny margaritas which was by far one of the best and creative margaritas I've ever had and perfect for a hot Arizona evening. The hummus appetizer was exceptional and when asked, the wait staff brought more pita.  I had the beef tacos which were OK but tended to be a little on the dry side.  The atmosphere was enjoyable and the decor charming.  I will definitely go back.  If I get a more tasty entree, I might just give True Food Kitchen 5 stars.  5/14/13 I recently went back for dinner and am now giving True Food Kitchen five stars.  The meal was fantastic and the cucumber lemonaide drink was out of this world. I want that recipe!"}
{"text":"This is a natural junkie's paradise.  Everything fresh, organic, non-gmo & most importantly, TASTY!  A bit on the expensive side but when is healthy food not?  Our server was very knowledgeable and personable.  I wish we had a place like this where we live."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here while on spring break. Excellent menu, including options for some very picky kids. I am not always healthy when eating out, so I thoroughly enjoyed eating well and healthy at the same time."}
{"text":"Great food and service had the vegetable Crudités  Was fabulous filling and Fresh came with two sauces to dip very filling and loved the honey lemonade  So many good healthy choices I will be a regular here... The Staff here is quick to make sure you are satisfied with your dining  experience here if something isn't right they will make it right immediately !"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a business trip and avoided going to TFK my first night because it was so crowded.  The second night it wasn't too busy so I went in.  After eating the food, I know why it was so busy the first night.  Great food and a friendly atmosphere.  I eat a gluten-free diet which in most places makes you feel like your selections are limited...not at TFK.  Excellent selection - my only problem was that I was only there for one night and didn't have enough room in my stomach to try all of the things I wanted.  Next time I am in Phoenix, I will be back...and will wait on line if I have to.  (Note:  went to Christopher's on the first night - what a waste.  Should have went to TFK both nights)"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my go-to spots, and still is however lately it's gone down hill a little.   The last few times I've been here I've either had really slow service, missing ingredients in my salad because of them running out or floaties in my water.   Food is still for the most part good but please keep this place up! Would be devastated if it continued down this path. Love True Food!"}
{"text":"I LIKE THIS PLACE.... nice for ladies lunch but menu begins to bore you if you go very often. Cute design concept. But lacks new excitement. Needs up do & pep talk!"}
{"text":"Seriously, BOMBASSFOOD!! Not really much else to say then if you're looking for a yummy/ healthy spot then this is the place..."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorites you never did even though I had a bad time at one of the other Fox Concepts  today"}
{"text":"Five stars is not enough for True Foods! This place is my FAVORITE restaurant, with a beautiful atmosphere, kind considerate staff who are cautious of food allergies and make True Foods the amazing place it is! I recently celebrated my birthday party yesterday here and our server- Richa did a phenomenal job! She took care of all 16 of us, kept our drinks refilled and was so kind and patient! It's so hard for me to not to eat here for every meal! Thank you True Foods for inspiring me to keep balance in every aspect of my life! Your food makes my soul and belly full and content!"}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Hash - Not a sweet potato fan, but thought I would give it a try.  It is very good.  Order it extra crispy and its like little nuggets of goodness.  Kale Salad - Who knew I would like kale?  It was very good.  Bison burger - Excellent.  The sauteed onions are great.  Grilled Shrimp Fresh Roll - Very good, great peanut sauce on the side.  Honey Lemonade - Awesome!  Someone else in the party had the Spaghetti squash casserole and said it was very good.  I've been twice now.  Got there at 11:00 both times and sat right away.  By the time I've left, its standing room only.  So go early."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I've eaten here a few times and my dishes have been hit or miss.  The delicious ones are the Edamame Dumplings (amazing!), Tofu Stir Fry and the Hummus and Pita Plate.  When I ordered the Seasonal Roasted Vegetable plate, all that came out were 3 different types of potatoes and some carrots.    The non-vegan options that my friends and family get are usually amazing and my favorite thing on the menu besides the dumplings is the Vegan Chocolate Pudding.    Also took away one star cuz it's overpriced (lots of upcharges, $5 for a glass of iced tea)."}
{"text":"Oy, stop trying so hard.   Cheesy uniforms, design, bathrooms all for some pho-eco wanabe globally conscious restaurant with mediocre food at Scottsdale prices. Nothing other than the wine and Kale salad were memorable. The Bass was really watery with no crispness to the outsides, the tuna special app was really boring and my mom's lasagna was equally unmentionable. All three glasses of wine i had were damn good; the Evolution, DXG, and one other i forget.   Really everything was far over priced and just not worth it.  Our server was however super knowledgeable but a little fawning.  I doubt i would come back save for some wine and a cheap salad otherwise i leave this to the Camelback Corridor housewives on trendy diets and health kicks.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=Jxmrw-IXVOHX3WgfL-r0Ng http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=24YjhsAUDhX4Jeh9pEUQzg http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=7SCnxk6-hBOpC_r1oNgo2Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA?select=IWd58vjnTO1LbcIeWKuJpA"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for the weekend and wanted to try something we don't have in Tucson! First of all, I would not be writing this yelp review if our server wasn't so incredible. We probably asked Rory 40 questions and he knew the answer to every single one. He was super personable and kept us entertained the whole time. We had the herb hummus to start and then we have the moroccan chicken and the brussels sprout and mushroom pizza! And finished with the flourless chocolate cake (10/10) with the vegan ice cream you couldn't even tell was vegan. 100% would go back again, and Rory made the experience for us for sure!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for kids! They had a kids' menu and the waiter even made special plates for my niece who wanted vegetables and dip. The waiter was also attentive and realized the kids would need food quickly so he brought over a dish of pita bread. Unfortunately, I didn't love the seasoning/spices of the roasted cauliflower appetizer or my seasonal ingredient salad, which is why this is only a 3 star review. I love the concept of the restaurant though and I'd be interested to go again if I see another location to try a different meal."}
{"text":"I was in town for business with some coworkers and we stumbled upon this place. The menu was super creative and the food was delicious, which is a big win for a healthier food environment. Our waitress was super bubbly and sweet and made it a great experience. For those of you who enjoy a drink with dinner: their red sangria was insane! it was the best sangria i have ever had.  I only wish we had more places like this in new york!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Based on the waiters recommendation I ordered the kale salad and the spaghetti squash casserole for dinner. I would highly recommend both.  The only negative is how loud it is inside...it made conversations a little challenging."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. A very healthy place to come to eat. The food is wonderful and very fresh. Nice and modern decor as well. The only down side is it is very expensive i think. But it is in the Biltmore so that ups the price. You can have your car valeted, or park in yourself in the nice cool parking Garage in the back. I opted for that.  It was started by Dr. Andrew Weil and the first time i went there with my friend Kris, he was sitting right next to us at a table.  It is a very nice place to go when you want to have a lovely relaxing lunch and really enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"By now you would think True Food would have their act together for holidays.  Reservation today,  ordered from their fixed menu.  Nearly an hour to get main dishes,  and 25% were wrong or cold.   The wait staff and manager were very responsive and apologetic.  The shit show   seems to be the kitchen.  Come on Sam Fox,  pay attention. Good ideas poorly executed still is a bad customer experience."}
{"text":"Although it is always so crowded, this is one of my favorite places.  Great atmosphere and very friendly staff, I always love my meal.  Sometimes a bit oily but very consistent and amazingly delicious for us picky eaters.  Great for people watching but not pretentious at all."}
{"text":"Great service, menu limited for carnivore types, ginger soda was excellent, the chicken curry was excellent as well. The teriyaki shrimp was not authentic teriyaki and some of the shrimp were undercooked. Mixed results overall. My Filipina wife rated it 2 stars, I rated it 4, hence the 3."}
{"text":"I love True Food! I get the same thing every time, but I always try what others get. I get the bison burger and it's so good. The Parmesan cheese and meat go so well together. You also get the choose of a yummy kale salad or hash! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox creation...Yummy, healthy, with an open-kitchen concept (meaning the staff are chopping veggies on giant counters in the dining room), and a varied menu (from mediterranean salad to spicy asian noodles). The problem with this place is...the price! Non-alcoholic drinks are like $6 each and they come in these narrow glasses full of ice. (I tried the \"no ice, please\" thing and they just give you less!\") For that price there should be a shot or free refills. Also, my fave is the Med. salad and I add chicken which runs me a full $20 and barely fills me up. For a big guy, there is no way that would be enough. Add a drink and it's like $30/person to eat in for a salad and lemonade! So the food is good but too pricey to be sustainable and I rarely go for this reason."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and had the sashimi tuna salad. It was fresh and tasty. I also ordered the miso soup which was actually quite good. Real chopped mushrooms and scallions and it wasn't too salty. It didn't taste like standard powdered miso that you would get at an average japanese restaurant. I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio. I'm not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants so it gets a 3 star rating out of me, but it's a nice place for a quick healthy meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. It is wonderful to enjoy food which you can actually taste the favors, and not have those flavored based on chemicals (as if often the case at many restaurants). I had the quinoa burger and it was best one I've had in my life (although truthfully probably only had 5 in my lifetime). Juice was exquisite and could taste the fresh fruit and vegetables.   Waitress was excellent during our visit. Friend ordered a beer, didn't suit his taste, and she offered to replace it for no cost.   Only downside is the place is busy. I tried to return the next day for lunch and the wait was more than 30 minutes, and we were starving so went to another restaurant."}
{"text":"Even if you aren't vegetarian or vegan, you will love this place! Their food is amazing, and the presentation is incredible : )"}
{"text":"Absolutely love TFK! Only problem is their absurd wait times (1-2 hours) if you can't get a reservation (they fill fast on weekends and especially around dinner time). Luckily, the TFK at Scottsdale Quarter is surrounded by many stores to go trough while you wait. The patio is dog friendly but unfortunately dogs have to stay on the ground and can't lay down on the cushioned benches (I suggest bringing a towel or blanket for your dog to lay on if the ground is hot). My waiters and waitresses are always kind and prompt and will offer a water glass for dogs."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Great food!  Wide variety for a variety of dietary preferences or considerations.  OMG...try the Chia Pudding!  I even took an extra one to go!  Outstanding.  I had the spaghetti squash casserole without cheese and it was great."}
{"text":"Buttersquash pizza, spaghetti squash spaghetti, and medicine man teas...we sat outside it was a bit chilly would've loved to have had one of those warmer things by us...our waiter was great...the rest of the menu looked tantalizing and healthy all in all We had fun!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! So good that I didn't take any pictures of the meals. We had a large party and multiple dishes all of which were excellent- we had the lettuce cups and the fresh vegetables with Tzatziki and olive dips. Many teriyaki and pad Thai bowls, salmon, pizza, turkey burger, steak tacos and a chicken salad."}
{"text":"Ture food is just so so good. There is nothing quite as great as food that tastes delicious and you feel good after eating. I need to stay away from food that inflame and true food is just the place for that. I love the crudite which is basically just blanched veggies with yummy dipping sauces. It was a little disappointing that the sauces that now come with it are oh so small where as they used to be much bigger. We also had the quinoia bowl with steak and it had some sort of delicious glazed sweet potatoes, and yes I will now crave that and need to drive to phoenix. Overall true food is  very yummy but in all reality is a bit overpriced for what it is but thats expected with sam fox restaurants right? You're mostly paying for the uber hipster staff and trendy environment?!"}
{"text":"Always good food and great salads.. Just feel refreshed and healthy after eating here.  You have to love the Chicken Chop Salad"}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen uses all those buzz words that reels in the health nuts. Sustainable, gluten free, references Dr Andrew Weil's anti-inflammatory diet,etc. I ordered the chicken chopped salad-$14 and medicine man antioxidant blast drink-$6. The salad was very good and fresh. The drink was ok not worth $6 to me. I guess it was better for than an alcoholic drink.  My husband ordered the sashimi tuna salad -$14. He said it was very good but wanted to stop by and get fast food later. My husband and I got a few laughs from the server and hostess. They kept referencing the Doctor that helped with the menu like we were supposed to know who he was. They were very nice and attentive though. Overall the food was good but overpriced and the portions  were  small. It's a great place if you are vegan, vegaterian or on a strict diet. Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and healthy food. I love the atmosphere too! The kids menu is great and the honey lemonade is delicious."}
{"text":"(Here's my disclaimer:  I usually think Fox restaurants are pretty meh...not bad and just good enough.  However, True Food is the exception.)  Ugh, last Sunday was a REAL whammy at work, so I told the woman we were going out for food and drinks and on me.  Thankfully, she picked a place that would have more than one item for me to eat.    Each time we visit True Food we're greeted promptly and by friendly staff. We've never experienced a wait longer than five or ten minutes and the atmosphere is nice and bright, especially considering what I used to be (anyone? Coffee Plantation?? Ugh..that bathroom always reeeeeked! I digress)   Anyway, on this particular stop I ordered the Spontaneous Happiness (a cocktail with St. Germain, lime, and ginger/vanilla infused sochu) and m'lady opted for the Apple Carrot and Ginger tonic  to start.  My bev was silky smooth and went down way too fast.  So, then we ordered a bottle of Moscato. What? I was in the mood for sweet drinks...I'm allowed to be frou frou once in a while.    For our appetizers, we ordered the Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce Cups (tofu, cashews, garlic and a gingery sauce) and the Local Vegetable Crudites (fresh veggies from McClendon's farm that came with tzatziki and olive tapenade...neither of which worked for us, so the server brought it with hummus and a champagne vinaigrette instead!! YUM!).  Then we moved on to the Tuscan Kale salad (kale, lemon vinaigrette, Parmesan, and breadcrumbs) sans cheese.  For entrees (I know, it was a feast) she ordered the Shirataki Noodles, and I ordered another Tuscan Kale....it's that good, peeps.    When dessert time came around, we decided on their chocolate pudding (vegan) that came topped with walnuts and pistachios.    Our server (I can't remember her name and I feel like a jerk about it) was rad, the food was perfect and the drinks were divine!"}
{"text":"Kathryn, my girlfriend, loves True Food kitchen and I am a skeptic of anything done by the FOX group especially when it aligns itself to a single philophers idea of eating well, in this case Dr. Weil. I am also a pretty critical person and enjoy critiquing most everything especially eatieries and restaurants.  One issue we have is that we are Vegans and while they do have a number of items listed as Vegan on the menu there are a few things that just seem silly. The first one is that they have no Salads listed as Vegan and the second is that they do not offer Vegan Mayo. The last time we mentioned the Mayo thing our server gave us a reason why they didnt but that we are welcome to bring our own in.  Today has been a fun day so I thought going to True Food would be a good treat for Kathryn and maybe distract me from other events occuring recently. Our server, Chris, has waited on us before and is always very nice. When we mentioned the Soy Mayo thing she offered to go talk to the chef and managers. When she returned the reply was that \"at some point we have to draw the line.\" To which I explained that by offering Vegan/Soy Mayo they would lower costs, increase shelf life, and even start substituting it with real Mayo without anyone noticing. She thought these were valid enough and again went to talk with the chef and managers. To which Kathryn and I exchanged glances and began eating our soup.  To our surprise our next visitor was none other than Michael Stebner the Executive Chef of the restaurant. We began a 10 minute conversation about their philosophy and methodology for creating the menu. He explained that they are not a health food restaurant but rather a restaurant with a health focus. He also pointed out that they are happy to modify anything on the menu to accomodate a number of eating requirements. This was really cool stuff.  He then went further and talked about his history as a chef and what he has seen work and not work from a practical perspective. This was a real conversation and I appreciate his engagement with us both. At no time was he demeaning to us and he never brushed a point of ours off. While I disagree with the philosophy of their menu I respect their methodology and see that they are interested in doing something more than just sell as much food as possible.  Overall this was a great experience and while it did not result in everything I wanted I am more than happy to refer anyone to eat here and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Vegans - tofu burrito, spring salad no cheese, tofu lettuce cups. Those are my faves  But everything is amazing try it all. I love this place. It's so fresh and dope and everyone who works at every location in the world is so fucking sweet."}
{"text":"Tru Food has yet to disappoint. I frequent this establishment as a place to get good food that leans on the healthy side.  Whenever I visit I have to get the salmon with quinoa and an arugula salad - the quinoa is perhaps the best I have ever had and I always crave it. The salmon is cooked a perfect medium rare and the arugula and beet side dish is a nice light side.  My most recent experience was a date for the wife and I. We got the lettuce wraps, the Asian salad, the chicken tandoori and the salmon. The lettuce wraps and salad were fantastic and I highly recommend both for a light start to a meal. The salmon was superb as usual, and the chicken was a generous portion with good flavor.  As usual, the staff was attentive, respectful and helpful - adding to the dining experience and not taking away from it.   The only downside was the dessert (the chocolate cake) - it was the first time I tried it and may be the last but it was a special treat for the evening.  Thanks Tru Food for another fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"First time here, and I'm so happy. My husband put it perfectly \"I don't feel bad about what I ate\" . We ordered the vegetable crudités, and it was nice for my kids to try new vegetables. Our table had the fish tacos, the chicken chopped salad, and the Mediterranean salad, also margherita pizza, everything was wonderful. Jessica, our server was so helpful. She answered all our questions with a smile. Thank you Jessica!"}
{"text":"Gluten free and vegan options are back.   Used to be me and my wife's favorite restaurant because of the kale pizza on gluten free crust. It was a great pizza and was vegan.  They no longer have this pizza or any vegan pizza options. We won't be returning until they again support vegans. Also, the prices are quite high for the quality of food. There are many other great option in the area."}
{"text":"Best sweet potatoes and kale salad I've EVER had! I have been trying to replicate the sweet potatoes at home and just haven't had any luck. Mine taste similar but turn mushy. This place is sort of pricey and the portions are small but we enjoyed it. I went with some friends and everyone seemed to like their food. My friends shared a turkey pita and it looked pretty big. My goat cheese pizza was actually just right. I left satisfied, not hungry, which seems to be a concern with other reviewers. My table ordered roasted veggies to share (which were delish) and I got The Hangover Cure to drink which was tasty as well.   Overall there aren't many complaints. It is sort of loud but a beautiful atmosphere. We did sit on the patio which was quiet and our server was great. Thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i thought this place would be amazing, given the amount of people were here but honestly the food was not great. I got the Grass Fed Burger and she got the Spicy Punang Curry. The curry had no flavor and the burger was undercooked. Not pleased with this place at all."}
{"text":"sadly, they took the wild sockeye salmon lox off the menu.. *sniff sniff*  (but the spaghetti squash casserole i tried was a great alternative!)"}
{"text":"This place rocks! They have the best food around not to mention the biltmore fashion park is there its very easy to eat then shop!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my recent experience at Phoenix's True Food Kitchen.  Got the Medicine Man natural refresher which has sea buckthorn, cranberry, pomegranate, blueberry, honey, black tea ($6).  It definitely was really refreshing and was not too sweet, I really liked it.  The Wild Caught Albacore Tataki was delicious, very fresh and light, a great choice on a hot summer night.  For my entree I had the Grilled Fish Tacos which were packed with a generous portion, definitely a very healthy take on fish tacos.  The fish was very meaty and tender.  Got to also taste the Moroccan Half Chicken which was delicious.  Loved the sauce and the chicken was just flavorful and juicy.  The Half Chicken is one of the heartier dishes on the menu and it tasted guilt-free and so tasty.  Would definitely have all of what I had ordered again in the future."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I've been here a number of times and still think it's the best place to eat in the Scottsdale Quarter. I usually get the Kale Salad with Chicken which hits the spot or the Turkey Lasagna which has a surprising amount of greens in it (gluten free). If you're looking for something quick try their juice bar (Juby True) on the side. My only complaint about this place is that the wait can be a little long at times since it is so popular. Other than that I highly recommend it as it's casual enough for a quick stop and trendy enough for a great date and drink."}
{"text":"OMG I'm gonna be sick!  Yeah... True, it's a kitchen, but not so sure on the \"food\" part.  The food was EXTREMELY bland and without flavor and in smallish portions.  Nothing that we had at our table was ever worth going back for.  This was a few months ago when we went, but we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give four stars but the service was not good. We've been here many times and had never experienced this. We were sitting on the patio on Sunday at 11 am and it was not crowded at all. It took forever for our server to find us and service us. Getting the check was such a hassle. I have almost forgotten what we ordered because of the poor service. Wait, the charred cauliflower starter was delicious as was the panang curry. The hummus with gluten free pita was delish, as usual. I'd just say, don't be in a hurry if you eat here."}
{"text":"Your chicken sausage pizza is so F***ing delicious. I haven't had the option of buying a lot from you guys but I look forward to it. Keep up the great service and great cooking."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  Chopped chicken salad with jicama was out of this world. The trout was top notch. The atmosphere was WAY TOO LOUD. Not relaxing at all. Hard to take. But the food and juice were fabo."}
{"text":"Amazing eccentric dishes with gluten free, vegetarian, options! Price is right and will certainly be back.  We were in town for one night, found this restaurant on Yelp with my family of 7, and walked out EXTREMELY satisfied. Will recommend to anyone in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but there's nothing special about this place...except for the ambience. The dishes are small and lack flavor. Just another overpriced, \"healthy\" restaurant. Was very disappointed in my experience here, and our waiter was not so great. Wish I had nicer things to say."}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place.  It is bright, airy and colorful...a warm welcoming environment.  And the decor matched the staff.  What wonderful customer service!  I was greeted very warmly.  I couldn't decide on a salad due to one of the ingredients it had that I typically don't like.  A second server went to get me a sample of said veggie and it turned out to be really good and fresh tasting!  My bartender explained to me that their produce is shipped fresh locally everyday.  I ordered the Farmer's Market Salad and the Kale-Aid.  The Salad was a little unexpected as the veggies are served tender, but it was tasty.  The Kale Aid was SO good!!!  I'm definitely coming back to dine in and luxuriate!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty tasty, though nothing special. I had a salad that I could have gotten at pretty much any contemporary american restaurant. My friend had a sandwich that he declared \"high end deli-ish.\" The appetizers were actually the star of our meal - some kind of seared ahi/sesame concoction and seafood potstickers. They seem to be relying a lot on the organic schtik, which really only works if the raw ingredients are used artfully. In this case I think they are missing the boat. The mock-tails were fun (but a lot of money for no hooch). Added gin to the 2nd one and was much more satisfied. This actually probably would have been a 4 star experience except the service just flat out sucked. Took 10 minutes for someone to bring waters and another 10 for the waiter to show up. I think they must have gotten their sections screwed up or something. Sadly it never really improved. They do get brownie points for seriously sprucing up the old Coffee Plant though. Nice atmosphere and gorgeous patio."}
{"text":"Ok ok what's not like about this place? I'm highly impressed with Andrew Weil's work, and this place seems like an exemplary example of his philosophy. Fresh, organic, local when possible plant centered menu is right up my alley! When we were seated, my daughter immediately read the info/propaganda sheet about the restaurant and squealed with delight because it meshed so well with our philosophy on food..... However, I'm not impressed when young PEOPLE (often called children or worse \"kids\" in our culture) are disrespected. The hostess put two real menus in front of my 13 year old daughter and me, and then she slapped the \"kids menu\" on the table in front of my 10 year old son without even really looking at him or asking if we wanted a child's menu. He and I were both insulted immediately. Unfortunately that feeling didn't improve. We normally don't even consider the child's menu because my children have been treated as \"people\" their entire lives, so they eat real food with real flavor like the rest of us!   Never the less after he slid around the table so he could look at my menu, we did look at both menus because their child's menu actually WASN'T filled with pasta, hot dogs, and chicken strips like most kid menus. It looked like a smaller version of the other menu... almost. For example, apparently children only eat cheese pizza?! Really? Dairy and crust alone with no veggies are anti-inflammatory? That's not what my research shows. How does one expect to start people on a healthy path of eating if we don't start right away. Shall we stick with the old \"four food groups\" concept when we are young and then magically develop a taste for vegetables once we're old enough to understand how healthy they are? That makes no sense! It's just stupid.... On that particular day, however my son had a cold and didn't have his normal appetite, so smaller portions of regular food was appealing to us. When the waiter arrived I asked about their \"kids\"menu. Shaun was nice enough --in an aloof and subtly condescending way. Just for the record I look like the old punk rocker that I am, but don't judge a person by his appearance these days. You don't know my income level or food/health knowledge and experience. You might be surprised. Anyway back to the menu! So I asked Shaun, \"what about your child menu, is it bland and tasteless like most?\" I told him we had raised our children eating the same food we eat, the same food your establishment is pushing, and he assured me that wasn't the case here. These were just smaller portions.    Onward to the show!! --The food. I started with a root and remedy drink and my daughter ordered the kale aid. Both were very good except for the typical over abundance of ice. I wish they had asked if we wanted ice, so we could have made our own choice, but like the kid menu, assumptions were the rule of the day not choice. We all shared the Tuscan kale salad and it was the highlight of the meal. Although vegans beware it is covered in cheese. The salad was fresh and had lots of garlic. I highly recommend it. For my main dish, I ordered the shrimp chili which cost extra to be gluten free. Why? I don't know. It's well documented that the hazards of gluten to the human intestinal wall lining are a likely suspect in inflammation. Seems like a no brainier for rice noodles to be standard. That being said, the chili was excellent. It was well spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. My daughter ordered the spaghetti squash and it was also good. As for my son, it was not his day.... insult followed insult! He ordered a chicken breast, peas and rice. His dish arrived early, so he was out of sinc with our meal. Furthermore, his food was bland and luke warm at best. Just as I feared, the assumption seems to be that young people, aka \"kids,\" can't take flavors so it better be plain. Yuck! We were in sensory heaven, and he got cold, bland chicken. He ate two bites of chicken and half the peas and rice which were also cold. He and I felt as if he was being treated as a second class person the entire time we were there. As for the dessert choices.... Blah! There are so many wonderfully good dairy free and even raw desserts that everybody likes and can eat. The only desserts here that we're gluten free and vegan were chia pudding and scoops of ice cream. Uhh coconut? and nut crusts? Why be so limited? We skipped dessert!   I may try the Scottsdale location because I want options that are of this quality, but we won't be back here. I wish we had just gone down the road to the Whole Foods which has a fantastic food selection! ...... Ahhhh but that's another review."}
{"text":"This place is about four minutes from my house, every time I go there it's super busy but they work hard to get everybody seated, usually I can find a seat at the bar. But the reason so busy is because they have great staff great food and everyone that works there seems to be super happy and loves their job!  Also nice cocktails."}
{"text":"I love 'em. The steelhead salmon A-mazing. Sometimes I just go for their tuna appetizer... so fresh and yummy. I live near the Biltmore to it's fast and close. Oh! And speaking of fast... you a=order and 5 mins later, you get you dish. Love the presentation of the food as well. Go! They're great!"}
{"text":"Still delicious as ever! The server was awesome, I wish I got her name! I had the red chili shrimp this time and once again, did not disappoint. I also tried some turkey lasagna that my dad ordered, and that was delicious as well. This restaurant is very consistent - great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food that is prepared and served in a clean and healthy environment, Ask the staff about what food is good and they will help you find their best entrees!"}
{"text":"I have been to True Food Kitchen twice. The ambiance is great. I love the little push carts of fresh herbs as you walk through the door. The smell of rosemary is intoxicating. The kitchen is open and so it can make for it being a little noisy. But nothing that is unbearable. You do get to see the staff handling the gorgeous fresh foods.  So a must have for me is the Cucumber Refresher drink. It is exactly what is states...refreshing. I tend to share a bit with my friends and both times they really like my drink. So much so the first time I gave my drink to my friend and I had her ginger drink that was OK. The first time I was there I ordered the Roasted Autumn Vegetables with Farro and Figs. It was alright nothing to write home about. The farro was great. Last week I had the Edamame Dumplings for an appetizer and the Miso Glazed Black Cod for an entree. These two dishes were right on.  I was scoping out the Cod on my first outing but did not get it. Go with your first instinct. The sauces on these dishes were amazing. They were light and flavorful. Both times my friends ordered the Teriayki Brown Rice/Veggie/Meat. Don't waste your time on this dish as you can get something very similar at Pei Wei or any other Asian place.   All in all I like True Food. They offer something different in a great location. They have good food and good service. I do have to say in the realm of restaurants that are going this route I would rather go to a smaller local place. It's just a choice I guess. But it is just something about the little places that is more exciting than a chain. I guess it is the feeling or intent in the preparation of the food."}
{"text":"My dinner was the size of a small tapas plate. Spaghetti squash casserole, you are considered an entree here but should be a $5 side. To me the food here is mediocre, small portioned, and lacking taste. You can cook healthy and still have food taste great. Each time we come here is a letdown, so I think we have had our last meal at TFK."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is the noise level.  It is difficult to have a conversation.  The food is wonderful.  We said we would share a salad to start and they brought it already split, with both of us getting quite a large amount.  I ordered the bison burger with all of the fixings on the side.  It was recommended medium and it was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato hash made it impossible to finish the whole burger. We had a 25% off coupon only good for the 4th of July.  Fox concepts sends them for most holidays when you sign up for their email...will try there new seafood Ola e on the next one!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and while the food was very good, the service was rushed and attention to detail was definitely lacking. Didn't live up to my expectation."}
{"text":"I am not a huge organic guy, nor do I have any dietary restrictions. So maybe I am not True Food's target audience. With that said, I have had organic and gluten-free fare that has been very tasty. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the food at TF. The dishes we ordered (chili shrimp and fish tacos) were bland and unimaginative. The setting inside was sleek and the open kitchen idea is novel. The service was slow and forgettable. And since it is organic and fresh ingredients, the prices are a bit higher. I would not refuse to go back to TF, but I certainly would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding.  Everything about this concept works.  The minute you walk in the door you instantly feel healthier.  From the apparel of the waitstaff to the food prep servers working out in the open, everything exudes fresh, inviting, warm, and good for you.  The elixirs are not to be missed.  Dig honeydew?  Then get the Hangover.  Jonesing for Cucumber?  Get the cucumber drink.  I opted for the Mediterranean chopped salad with grilled salmon.  What is not listed on the menu is you can order a 1/2 portion of anything on the menu (except a burger or the pizza).  So, I ordered a half portion of the salad.  Dee-licious.  My friend got the Tuscan Kale salad and it was fantastic.  We shared the herb hummus and my goodness, best hummus I've ever had.  Service was great.  Arrive early!  We got there at 11am for lunch and by 11:45am the place was packed with a line out the door!  The best part?  You can find the recipe for the Kale salad and the hummus on Dr. Weil's web site!  Love it.  Love it.  Love it."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant because it has a reasonable number of vegan options, and it was within easy walking distance from the hotel where I was staying.  I chose the teriyaki quinoa bowl for dinner and a vegan \"flan\" with berries for dessert. Both dishes were absolutely delicious! And I felt like I was eating real food, and getting real nutrition. The price is a little more than what I normally pay, but the quality of the food made it acceptable.  The only thing that would make this restaurant better in my eyes is if it was 100% vegan.  But I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Good portions of healthy options.  There's a lot of good food in Arizona, but there's only a limit as to how much one can indulge in enormous, hearty meals. This place is a good change of pace. Definitely felt refreshed rather than lethargic after having some healthy food here.  Kale Quacamole ($10) Big, crispy, and thin pita chips with a refreshing blend of quac.  Seasonal Ingredient Salad ($14 w/o add-ons) The roasted brussels sprouts and butternut squash had a good bite to them, added with some cauliflowers, and flavored with a citrous-flavored vinaigrette. Even without the extra protein, this was enough to fill me up for lunch.  Hangover Rx ($5): While this drink was refreshing, I wish I could taste more of the coconut water..  Overall, refreshing food and drinks."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a True Food here since I love the one in Fashion Valley as well. I had dinner with some vegetarian friends and this place was the perfect choice. Their green juice is great and we shared the hummus to start and I had the teriyaki rice bowl with tofu.  The food isn't amazing but is pretty good, and I love the selection of healthy dishes."}
{"text":"The two words I would use to describe the food at True Food Kitchen would be FRESH and FLAVORFUL! I probably will never be able to enjoy a vegetable from Safeway again after the amazing produce from True Food!   I don't even especially like veggies and the crudite plate was amazing.  I could go on and on about every dish, dessert, and drink that we ordered.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable.    The ambiance, service, and food make it a great place for a fun lunch with girl friends or a lunch meeting."}
{"text":"Nice to have a restaurant in the 'hood that's dedicated to serving locally sourced, seasonal, and healthy produce. But! Most of what I've tried is just eh--kinda bland. Healthy can be tasty and this place can be hit or miss. Props for converting me over to kale doe!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Vegetables are good for you!!!!  Raw ones not soaked in oil or boiled to mush!!! Do you like lululemon and telling people just how invigorating Bikram is ?than this is the place for you!   Yes lululemon is just a big corporate company now but you remember when they were new.  As far as pretentious goes, this place has got it down perfectly....you'd never even realize you were just served part of a produce aisle on a tres chic bamboo plate if you could tear your eyes off of how incredibly clever the other diners are.   You can go home feeling fresh and clean after lunch here.  The silliest interpretation of dining I've ever seen.  Seriously, just buy some carrot sticks and eat them in the park, except no one will notice and that is half the point."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible...called in to make reservations and was told they do not accept reservations. So I came to the restaurant in person to put my name on the list only to find it less than half full. I asked why I could not be seated at any of the 35 open tables and was told that they were reserved. When I explained that I was told they do not take reservations, an ogre like manager came over and rudely explained that they accept reservations online and that she would be happy to seat us in 1 hour and 15 minutes and that it was a mistake on their part to deny my reservations but that's just the way it is and I would have to deal with it."}
{"text":"I'm back :) How many updates am I going to write? Well, it depends on how many times I visit. I spent another evening at True Foods last night with a group of friends.   The service was just a hint slow but what do you expect with a big group? The food was good, everyone at the table mentioned several times how happy they were with their entree choice.   My boyfriend and I ordered our own dishes and then split so we could try two of the entrees. I got the steak tacos and he got the chicken. Both were really good.   What we didn't realize was that True Food actually allows you to order half portions for half price. We could have tried 4 different menu items had we known this. Oh well, next time... and there will be a next time!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Many choices for those looking for a very healthy meal. I had a Wonderful salad but my beer was warm. When it is 110 degrees outside beer should not be served warm!"}
{"text":"We came here because it had a dog-friendly patio and we had dogs with us.   We got the curry with quinoa, guacamole, and the veggies and dip. Overall, I wasn't wowed by anything, and I'm always of fan of eating healthy and yummy! While the veggies were fresh and crisp, the hummus dip was just ok. The quinoa has a pretty good kick to it, and, for me, it was verging on a little too spicy. The guacamole didn't seem like guacamole because it had grapefruit and (I believe) kale. It was interesting...not sure good or bad, ha."}
{"text":"There's a reason why my trips home from Seattle always end up starting here :) Great food that changes seasonally and awesome ambiance! Service is always excellent - it's a bit of a minor detail, but having water attentively refilled is so wonderful, especially during the summer!!"}
{"text":"The bombest food ever. Always blows my mind. And Seth is the bestttttttt. Will return on the reg just to see his sexy face"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's amazing every time I go. The vegetables are fresh and crunchy - and the dishes are super tasty! I can't wait to go back. My favorite is the shrimp noodle dish; one of their specialties."}
{"text":"Grilled Chicken salad w/medjool date, dried cranberry, jicama, apple, manchego, farro, marcona almonds,and champagne vinaigrette...Spectacular!  FYI:  For lunch, arrive early during tourist season."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday and it was jam packed but luckily there was room at the bar. Sit there if you don't mind the Sunday brunchers standing close next to you as you eat. I ordered the grass fed burger and it was cooked nicely, tasty and the portion was just right, not too much and not too little. Great ambiance, very clean/maintained and good service at the bar. If you have more time, sit outside on the patio and enjoy the people watching, it's beautiful people everywhere."}
{"text":"I came away from my meal (complete with cocktail + dessert) with no guilt. Local, fresh, tasty and healthy cuisine here. For the first round, order the fig tart! I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world. I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad. Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious, and while it was tasty, I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with friends last Friday.   Aside from being a bit hot outside, the experience was a pleasant one.  The staff and manager - Andrea - are extremely helpful and make you feel like a VIP.  *I LOVE the kale salad* - amazing!  Starters we had the edamame dumplings and the smoked salmon - delish!  I had the halibut - it was a touch dry and not my favorite.  Surprising - because halibut is typically my \"go to.\"   However, after tasting my boyfriend's Miso Glazed Black Cod - my palette was pleased!  I will definitely go back for that dish!  Actually - going there for lunch today to get my kale salad!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner there on a Saturday night.  Came right from the gym and workout clothes were completely acceptable attire.  Food was fresh and service was good.  Portions worked for me but for the guy with me, the trout dish was a bit too small.  Main problem was the noise level - I like the industrial look but I also like to have a conversation.  We sat at a communal table.  At first we were across from each other.   We had to change seats so we were next to each other and wouldn't need to shout.  Probably the outdoor seating would be better.   The server had asked if I wanted a glass for my beer or would I prefer to drink it from the bottle.  Tried the glass, but the shape just wouldn't let the beer be poured without getting a lot of foam.  Even the server couldn't pour it without the foam.  For a more positive experience, sit outside, drink beer from the bottle, and if small portions aren't for you, order something filling like lasagne."}
{"text":"If you like sub marginal food-True Food is the place to eat. I had the summer salad-I've tasted better salads at an airport concession stand. My husband had the halibut-chewy and dull tasting. My daughter was the only one that enjoyed her steak tacos-tasted the exact same at Blanco's.  Service was great but sitting on the patio was fine till the misters turned off. The temp.outside was a mere 100.  I would never recommend this restaurant, many great restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant! I always order the mediterranean chopped salad. I recently stopped adding the grilled chicken to it because I found it way too expensive. It's $11 for the salad but an additional $5.50 for the chicken on top. That's close to $17 and in my opinion that is too much for a salad. I will say though, it tastes just as good and is just as filling without the chicken.  A must here is the kale avocado dip appetizer. The homemade chips are amazing! I always have to ask for more chips because they only serve it with a couple of pieces. They never charge us extra when we ask for more though. There is huge chunks of grape fruit in the dip! So unexpected but insanely good!  Bf usually gets the street tacos or bison burger. He loves them.  The view from this location cant be beat! Love the palms at the Scottsdale Quarter. Make sure to sit outside :)"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service is pretty good.  Its a restaurant that definitely reminds you of LA, as it is very loud in there.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"My favorite fox restaurant. Had the edamame dumplings and red chili shrimp. Brother had the miso soup (a little salty for my taste) and turkey lasagna. The turkey lasagna was good but wouldn't be something i would get here but it's good. The red chili shrimp is the best noodle and shrimp in town with flavors that balance the whole dish! Yum."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! From their fresh cocktails to their food. I got the ancient bowl grain with tofu. It was really filling for me and very tasteful. My friend got the turkey burger with kale salad- both very tasty! I will be back indubitably."}
{"text":"Loving the new Spring menu.  The new seasonal ingredients salad is a great blend of flavors.  The poke bowl is a loaded with fresh, light ingredients with just a hint of umami to balance the flavors."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen provides proof that food-loving people can have a delicious meal that is also healthy. I've been to the Scottdsale Quarter and Biltmore locations. I prefer the restaurant at the Quarter because it has a much better design for \"bringing the outside in\". It's an open plan with plenty of patio seating.  As far as the food? I have several recommendations. The crudite appetizer is stunning. Raw veggies never looked so appealing. You get a huge bowl of beautiful vegetables along with two tasty dips. This appetizer is on my \"get every time you come here\" list.  Main courses provide a pretty good range, although folks that avoid most/all carbs are more limited. I like the bison burger, although I've only had it served on large leaf lettuce, not the bun. The spaghetti squash casserole is directly from Dr. Weil's healthy cook book. It's delicious, but it's also very easy to do at home. They do a reasonably good job with their fish dishes, although this isn't the first place I'd come if I was craving fish.  I've never had issues with service at either location. Even during the most crowded times, the staff and management have always worked hard to ensure a pleasant meal.   Here's the upshot: if you are eating healthily and want to try something different, this is a great place to visit. It's not cheap, but it certainly provides inspiration for creating healthy lifestyle choices at home."}
{"text":"Truly delicious, lightweight but high flavor, and well-priced food!  Try to go every day that I'm in town. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I was recommended Truefoods by a foodie friend of mine and decided to finally try it Sunday for brunch. I went along with another friend who likes to eat just as much as I. We were seated outside as requested in no more than 5 minutes at a 4-top, which is always a pleasant surprise. I started off with a Moscow mule. The waiter came back out and said they did not have ginger beer and said he could recreate it with fresh ginger and such. It was even better than expected. We split 3 entrees: spaghetti squash casserole, mushroom flatbread and shaved turkey. Everything was excellent. They even split the entrees up for us. Highly recommend coming here if you like good service and good eats."}
{"text":"While the concept of this establishment maybe a bit trendy, the execution is classic in every way. From the service to the food to the atmosphere, it is a restaurant that I truly enjoy being at..."}
{"text":"Used to really like this place and you cannot beat the atmosphere but last night was a bust. I was meeting a friend who had never been before and was so excited to go. I sat at the bar waiting for her and wanted to order a drink and appetizer. The bar tender was so beyond rude. When she finally greeted me after 5 minutes of talking with her friends while I was sitting there I could barely get out my drink order before she flew off. Even the lady next to me was like \"wow really\" when she finally came back with my drink I literally had to speak up just to order an appetizer.  When my friend got there she asked for a drink menu the bartender just replied \"you have it right there\" I flipped the menu over to show her.  Dinner was ok once we got out of the bar and our server was great. My chicken was over cooked and had a lot of fatty skin. I took about 5 bites because I was starving and was done.  Little disappointed but hopefully the menu changes up and you get someone nice behind the bar so"}
{"text":"I've traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat.   I only wish they had one in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"True Food has an interesting concept of including a \"superfood\" with every dish. I ordered a Penang curry, and I guess the superfood in it was coconut milk? I'm not sure. It comes with three protein choices: chicken, shrimp and tofu. I chose tofu, and was expectantly awaiting my side of brown rice only to see it nowhere in sight when the food arrived. Alas, the brown rice was drowning at the bottom of the bowl, soggy and soaked in curry sauce. That was really disappointing for me, because the idea of rice is so that you can modulate how salty you want each mouthful to be, but because every grain of rice was drenched in milky, creamy curry, that proved to be impossible. The taste is decent, although not quite spicy enough for my tastes, but if you ever order this, be sure to request for your rice on the side. I also ordered some shrimp dumplings, which was probably overcooked as the dumpling skin was gelatinous and gluey.  Service was bright and chirpy, but I guess coming from NYC, everyone else will seem angelic in comparison."}
{"text":"Wonderful place full of positive energy.  Never a bad meal here.   Scottsdale Quarter location  very busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food always.  I sometimes order with post net home dilevery.  I like the chili shrimp and hummus plate,   The dark chocolate flourless cake is supper rich for someone who craves dark chocolate."}
{"text":"Both times I ordered the yellow curry chicken. Both times it was great! It is a bit soupy, so I ask for extra brown rice to mix in. I have not ordered the specialty drinks yet, but likely will try one out since they look very refreshing and healthy."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant... Kale salad, chicken sausage pizza (gluten free crust is amazing), curry, shiratake mushroom dish- yum yum yum! The natural cold to drink... Half order of most apps- amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is a location specific review.  I've attempted to come to this location a couple occasions.  I live closer to the Biltmore location and love it.  The atmosphere and food is great.  So, I was happy that there is a location near my in laws (it's always exciting to be able to eat healthy and enjoy their company).  We went for father's day, it wasn't all that impressive and the service was pretty lackluster, but my meal was good.  I went again with my MIL a few weeks ago for a late lunch.  The place was swarming and our electronic notifier never went off.  We waited for about half an hour before I went in and asked if we were ever going to be seated.  And then I got attitude.  And the service was SO SLOW.  It wasn't particularly happy, friendly, or polite.  There is a vibe at this location and I don't like it.  I'll keep my Biltmore location thank you very much.  And will not be going back to this TFK again.  It's a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I AM GOING TO EXCLAIM THIS IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A TRUTH THAT ALL OF HUMANKIND SHOULD BE AWARE OF!! Fox Restaurant Concepts are PERFECT. Now, you should know, I don't say this about many places... Or people, or things.. But when it comes to Fox, one cannot go wrong.   True Food is just one of the many Fox Valley restaurants I completely adore. Craving Italian? Head to North Fattoria Italiana in Arcadia. Need your pizza fix at work? Sauce is definitely the place to be. Truffle fries and fine dining with a modern twist? Olive and Ivy. Super cool comfort food that will fill you up and make you want to frequent Downtown Phoenix.. every night? Arrogant Butcher. Gosh darn it, even the names of these hotspots are uber cool!  Sam Fox is simply a genius. His concepts are flawless, food is impeccable and staff? CONSISTENTLY the best service I ever receive at any establishment. Shout out to Brock and the accommodating/super-friendly staff who took care of me tonight at True Food @ the Quarter! I will be back... A lot.  What can I say Fox? You have stolen my heart.... And all the doggy-bag space in my refrigerator.  Thank you for the excellence. I refer you to everyone I know, and the keen attention-to-detail NEVER goes unappreciated...  FOX ON!"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Phoenix area in May, and my daughter took us to this restaurant. I loved the kale and avocado dip, and I let the server talk me into a drink, the Natural. Great food, and a shout out to the server for remaining professional in spite of my rolling my eyes every time she and my husband discussed turkey meatballs!"}
{"text":"Kale. Turkey Burger. Sweet Potatoes. Need I say more? I'm in love with this place. Awesome location, awesome food... the staff is extremely friendly and so is the management. I'm already planning my next trip back!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the higher-than-they-should-be prices, the food is great. The kale is out of this world. If True Food has done anything, it has encouraged me to cook and eat at home more :)"}
{"text":"In the past when we have eaten at the True Food Kitchen Phoenix location we have not noticed the negligence that we experienced this time at the Scottsdale Quarter True Food Kitchen. Many dissatisfactions at this Thursday night dinner hour.  It started out poor from the start. We asked how long the wait would be & the young, chaotic staff said 15 - 20 minutes - nope, it was a 45 minute wait - quite an inaccurate estimate. Once they texted us to tell us the table was ready, we waited another 5 minutes while the confused staff decided where we were going. Felt very disorganized - not cohesive. Maybe it was that the staff were all so young, but it seemed very chaotic at every interaction, like when we ordered the soup (it was a squash soup that night) and I had communicated I had special needs that night but received a spicy squash soup, which two of us returned not expecting this. Any question we asked, was answered with somewhat of an \"attitude of too much trouble\" -  the best way I can describe the server. It seemed like the staff didn't have proper training on how to interact with customers. Restaurant staff need to know how to cope with the busyness of a restaurant and not be acting hurried and rushed. Not welcoming. The best thing at our table turned out to be the mushroom pizza, ordered GF. But, when we got the bill there was not an extra $2.50 charge for the GF so we assumed that they had gotten that part of the order wrong too. If it had been someone who had severe allergies to gluten there could have been serious consequences. The best part of the evening was when we asked a bus boy where the bathroom was (outside and around a corner) and he  took the time to walk us out the door and point us in the right direction. Have no desire to support or frequent this location."}
{"text":"I must say....my favorite Sam Fox Concept by far!!!  Plus I'm an Andrew Weil, MD loyalist....have to mention two amazing stars on our Sunday brunch visit....Katharina and Amber. Keep being real...just like your amazing food!  Your smiles and warmth are a refreshing welcome in this self absorbed world!!!!  Kudos to you both and keep shining!"}
{"text":"Open kitchen, organic and local food, amazing drinks (I recommend \"spontaneous happiness\") & friendly staff. Sold!"}
{"text":"The food is OK. The service is very good. When i ate there we had mosquitos next to the table and over our head..like a lot of them!! :\"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love this place? Fantastic healthy food, great service, happy to customize menu offerings. And I love their fresh cocktails made with real juices and no fake stuff. Great for kids too. Expect a wait because it's always busy!"}
{"text":"First off we walk in and there are open tables everywhere but unfortunately for the young blond hostess the tables outside were dirty. Now it was a nice night out on a Friday and I felt like sitting outside which I requested. The hostess then scoffed, gave me a dirty look, and repeated that there where tables available inside and if we sat outside she would have to clean it first. We eventually got to sit outside...with an attitude. We apparently must have upset someone because we were neglected for about 15 minutes even though at that time the restaurant wasn't busy. When we did get service it to was with an attitude but the food was awesome. The edamame dumplings were seriously incredible. Now here is where it gets really bad...we gave a card to pay and when we received our receipt back the receipt read $54.00 but the copy we were to sign was charging us $68.00. Keep in mind we were a party of just 2 so the gratuity shouldn't have been added in.  When we pointed out the error no one seemed surprised or particular concerned that we were over charged. They corrected the issue but were so nonchalant about it that we walked away feeling like this was possibly a scam that the staff often tries to run that we were lucky enough to avoid. The moral of this review is to warn you to review your receipts carefully and if you don't want to wait on people you should get out of the service industry."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel good about what you eat. Everything is so creative and innovative. They have an ever changing menu. I have been going here for years, and over the seasons my favorite dishes have been the butternut squash pizza, the quinoa burger, yellowtail with ponzu, edamame dumplings."}
{"text":"The waiters are wonderful! Usually it's busy so try to call ahead and see if a reservation is available. Usually there is bar seating open. The honey lemonade was perfect. Just the right amount of honey and right amount of lemon. The best thing on the menu is the bison burger. It was cooked perfect and the sauce is delicious! I couldn't be more impressed with this place which is why I constantly come back!"}
{"text":"We eat here often.  I love the menu and portion sizes are, in my opinion, perfect.  The fish dishes are always good, and I dream about the hummus.  I'm also a huge fan of the spaghetti squash, which is hard to find anywhere else.  The skinny margarita makes the meal complete."}
{"text":"True Food is awesome. It's great to find a place that has really good HEALTHY food!! Have been here on many,many occasions and it's always been a great experience. The shrimp and goat cheese pizza is a favorite but I've really liked everything I've had here with one exception...the butternut squash ravioli, I could do without this dish. Service is friendly and helpful and I dig the patio when it's cool enough to sit outside. Sam Fox seems to know how to do it up right. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back.  Bison burger was lip smacking good, as well as the edamame dumplings.  Deeeeeelishhhhh"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food. It's always fresh and made from scratch. Salads are amazing. You can never get bored with their menu because they change it every season. In addition, their sparkling soda is so refreshing."}
{"text":"Loved the Kale salad. Kale is popular where I am from, but the person I brought along was staring at the dish, initially. When she ate it, she actually liked it. Love the presentation. Had a great sandwich as well, good  enough to share. Nice location as well"}
{"text":"Delicious food. You can taste the freshness! I've tried something new every time and loved every single thing! Their drinks are refreshing options also! Downside is the price, fairly expensive! Great food though."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing this gem. Overall, excellent food and excellent service. I'm really big on eating healthy and this place has healthy foods that taste absolutely delicious. (Please try the bison burger). The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because on one occasion the red chile shrimp came out missing an ingredient and tasted bad, although, it was taken off the bill. Secondly, I strolled in after the gym for a lunch time meal and they shut down food production for a kitchen malfunction. But in the scheme of things, I love true foods and its concept. They have really nailed delicious healthy food on the head and even my boyfriend who is a meat and potato kind of guy loves coming here anytime."}
{"text":"Chicken Curry was great. Service was great. Highly recommend the Kale salad that they serve."}
{"text":"Entrees are tasty. I love the PANANG CURRY curry most but you need to ask for extra curry to make it perfect. Then the SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE is great (careful they will try to lure you into adding chicken/protein that will be another $6 dollars added to it).  The drinks are suppose to be good but to me they are rip offs (yes. Half of the cup are ice so you are paying half cup of juice not full cup). When ordering starters,  make sure you ask about the quantity we had 4 people and order the 9 dollars ADAMAME dumpling and it was only 3 small miserable pieces and it taste just average (it was a rip off for $3 dollars each). I don't mind paying premium but this establishment feels like they are trying to rip you off in every possible way."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I had the goat cheese beet salad with steelhead salmon. Best sparkling tea ever. Yum! Perfect place to eat while you are shopping in the area."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat! Amazing healthy food and great drinks! My Favorite part was the fact that they have organic liquor! It was awesome. I would recommend this place to anyone! Family friendly but also fun to go out with friends!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for salads since we were at the Mall where this is located. Both of our salads were delicious and the service was excellent. Recommended.  Nice patio dining as well."}
{"text":"My wife ordered fish tocos and they made her sick not the first time we ate here but the first bad meal here"}
{"text":"I am by no means a vegetarian.  I like meat, cheese, and all around unhealthy stuff to eat.  With that in mind, I really enjoyed what I ate here, for breakfast.   My husband and I were hungry on a Saturday morning, and desperate to get away from the house. Naturally, we went to the Quarter. Naturally.   I take one look at the menu, and I almost run out the door screaming. Not my cup of tea.  But I decide to try something new for a change, and suck it up, choose a greek frittata. (A frittata is an open faced omelette) It had kalamata olives, feta, zucchini and tomatoes. It was awesome.   Unfortunately, that was the ONLY thing on the menu that I would eat. So unless I get a craving for a healthy breakfast again, I probably won't go back.  Perfect for health-conscience, hippie type people.  I'm from the mid-west. :)"}
{"text":"Food is great. Cocktails are delicious. The only downside is the cost of the restaurant. The portions are rather small for the price however the food quality is superb and you can always count on fresh and organic choices."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I HAVE to write a review. I'm so pleased with this establishment I'm still sitting at the table of the restraint writing about how amazing it is. Though it's \"expensive\" it's very reasonable. If you're feeling the need for healthy fresh, and good food... THIS IS THE PLACE!  (The waiters are also friendly and helpful.)"}
{"text":"I like that True Food is dependable. I've enjoyed everything I've tried here, and the service is great from the door. Stacey was our server last night, and was very helpful in suggesting things she liked and aided in our decisions for dinner. She was sincere and attentive, and not awkwardly crowding the table or trying to up sell us the whole night.  I love this Scottsdale Quarter location, with H&M right across the way it makes any wait for a table go by a lot faster. :) I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey all my Az peeps True Foods  has something for everyone . True foods won't disappoint with their organic fresh ingredients and bursting flavors in every bite your you sure to get a delight . Service great , prices affordable , atmosphere quant . Don't take my word for it experience it for yourself !"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I wanted to rate this restaurant 2.5 stars, but because that isn't an option, I am boosting it up to a 3 because my Husband said so (LOL). Here's the thing, the food is WAY overpriced for what you get and it isn't even extraordinary. Personally, I don't mind paying more if the food really blows me away, but after my second experience at True Food, I have come to the conclusion that the food isn't that special.   The fact of the matter is, I didn't even pay for my meals the two times I came here, we were with family that paid. At the end of the meal I kinda felt bad for the price tag my family was paying. Honestly, I like the concept. I try to eat healthy, and when you have to go out to dinner it can be hard sometimes, but eating healthy doesn't mean eating NOTHING. Last night I had the pan seared halibut and left just as hungry as I arrived. Don't get me wrong it was ok, but not $24 good. The hummus appetizer was very delicious, but nothing more than most humus's I've had at other cheaper restaurants. My Husband had the shrimp and noodle bowl and loved the broth and shrimp, but hated pretty much everything else in the bowl. All in all, I don't think I will be back, even though the service was good, the food portions were way too small for the high price tag. Just my two cents (and I will save those two cents for another restaurant)!"}
{"text":"In the nice new Scottsdale Quarter rests True Food Kitchen, which is part of a larger chain of restaurants. The concept is pretty cool; fresh, natural ingredients, open layout and unique menu options. The food was good, the dessert was good, but the service was slow and overly \"ooo...look at me, I'm cool\". Doesn't make any sense? Take a seat and you'll see what I mean.  Although the food is pretty delicious, True Food is on the border of being a bit pretentious with all the \"natural\" ingredients and what not. I've seen this type of food done much better at a lower price which much less snootiness. So, if you are OK with a bunch of snoot, then True Food is your place to go. Otherwise, stay with a non-chain restaurant."}
{"text":"KALE. KALE. KALE. who knew it could be so delicious? Had it in my salad and on my pizza. I love wood-fired pizza!  The spicy edamame was a nice way to start our meal. My girlfriend and I were STARVING after waiting 30 minutes for a table. We scarfed it down in minutes. Then we decided to just eat at the bar.   The martinis are SO fresh & creative. (but expensive!)   The kitchen is open so you can see your food being prepared.  No complaints about service."}
{"text":"The fresh albacore tuna salad has seasonal fresh veggies well dressed with generous amounts of avocados and delightful watermelon beets. My taste don't gravitate to salad but this will satisfy the pickiest of eaters.   Atmosphere: TFK's welcoming modern casual atmosphere fits the Scottsdale vibe. A open kitchen situated behind a spacious bar provides entertainment for foodie guests. I thought the combo of private tables (traditional seating)  and common table seating (strangers sit next to each other on a shared table) blended well with the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very green food indeed and good taste. It took us about 10 minutes to wait until got a table. I ordered a Panang Curry with chicken and my wife ordered a Farmer's Market, For the kid we ordered a collection of carrot, apple, grape and chicken. All the veggies looks fresh and they are really are.   Drinks we ordered the cucumber refresher and carrot apple ginger tonic, very soft and fresh, even my kid can take a sip.   Although we cannot take every meal like this (imagine a whole week of veggies? No ...), but it really feels good having a meal you don't need to count the calories."}
{"text":"Absoulety obsessed with this place!   This is now my 3rd time in one week!   Ryan the GM is so sweet and his passion for this restaurant is amazing!  The service is so fab and the food is delish!  The spaghetti squash casserole is so yummy I couldn't stop eating it after how full I was off of the apps which was the edamame dumplings and hummus !  If you haven't been you must go!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I really, really wanted to love this place. I mean, it's green, organic, environmentally friendly, they use local ingredients, organic and sustainable liquors, ... who couldn't love such a responsible corporate citizen. However, this visit fell short of my expectations.   My friend and I came here to enjoy dinner together. Seating was prompt. Drinks were ordered and arrived swiftly, at which point we ordered the entire meal (including an appetizer). We ordered the shrimp dumplings as our appetizer, I ordered the salmon open-faced sandwich, and he ordered a curry dish with shrimp. Much to our surprise, 10 minutes later, our entrées arrive. I asked the server where our appetizer was, he said he would go check. A minute later, our waitress shows up and says she FORGOT to put in the order for the dumplings. She had a pad and pen with which she was writing down the order, was she not listening? We still wanted them, and they were ordered. The manager promptly came to apologize for the error and corrected it. Other than this incident, service was pretty good.   My food was good, but not something that merits an \"excellent\" rating. I reserve \"rave reviews\" for food that is creative and tasty. The salmon was cooked well (under-seasoned, but nonetheless well done). My kale salad and sweet potato hash were de-lish! My friend said that he enjoyed the curry. Booze wise, I had the Fudo Myoo Sake which was quite tasty, and my friend had a cocktail with strawberry juice in it which was delicious. We were offered a dessert menu, but both of us were full. Price points were decent here with most entrées falling in the $13 - 14 range and appetizers in the $8-10 range. Wines and cocktails are also priced at a variety of points.   Overall TFK is a good mid-range restaurant with a good corporate social responsibility stance, and I liked it, but again, it's not something that I would rate \"excellent\".   And (drumroll) Grades:  Overall:    C   (the actual average would be a C+, however, I am                         doubling the impact of the service grade. Otherwise,                         no demerits taken)  Service:   C-   (the fact that the server forgot to write down our order                          is a major problem. Hopefully it's a once-in-a-great-while                         kind of incident. The only thing that salvaged the service                         grade to above a failure was the manager's quick action)  Food:       B-  (it's good, but nothing to write home about. Plus points                        for a well-executed sweet potato hash and kale salad)  Drinks:     B   (Tasty strawberry cocktail - which tasted a bit watery to                        me, but otherwise good. Sake was pretty good too)"}
{"text":"Unique menu full of fresh and healthy options. The apple carrot ginger tonic and edamame dumplings stood out as winners among what we ordered, but everything was delicious!  The vibe is great, too - lots of energy from within the restaurant and from the surrounding Scottsdale Quarter plaza area."}
{"text":"Open air restaurant. Love the layout of seeing the kitchen and big windows. Got the heirloom tomato pizza and it was amazing. The almond ricotta was really yummy and a great cheese substitution. The server was really friendly, kept checking in on us and gave me vegan suggestions she liked when I asked. I food came out pretty quickly. The pizza was messy to eat because nothing is really holding the toppings to the crust. So the tomatoes kept sliding off. The almond ricotta comes in mounds so you need to spread it out a bit (unless you like it really concentrated). The pizza dough and olive oil/herb blend they used were fantastic. Great flavor. I've been putting off coming here because wasn't sure about the vegan options I saw on the menu but really glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I didn't have much of an appetite so I just ordered the soup of the day, butternut squash. It was seasoned perfectly and tasted super fresh. I stole a little bit of my boyfriends kale salad which was phenomenal- probably one the best kale salads I've ever eaten. Friendly service as well. If we have enough time during our stay, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here MANY times and I've never been disappointed with the food or the service. Located in a nice shopping mall so there's lots to do when you're done with lunch or dinner. The food is always healthy, fresh and different."}
{"text":"This place is very good, their concept is definitely unique but be prepared to pay a little extra.  I had the coco pineapple concoction which was refreshing and complimented well with the ahi sandwich.  My wife had one of the salads and I failed to remember the name but it was delish. The turn off here is definitely the plastic surgery from the strange affluent population that calls this area of town, home.  Also one of my concerns when visiting the true food kitchen's (another one in biltmore area) is that the service is not up to par with the great food."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter area. Great options and atmosphere. The Natural drink (citrus, agave, ginger tea) is bomb"}
{"text":"Ordered the cucumber honey lemonade and it was very refreshing. Turkey burger was great! Sweet potato hash was pretty good, a little greasy. Husband had the tofu teriyaki bowl and he didn't think it was anything great, tofu was a little dried out. Son ordered the pizza, crust was really good. Mother in law ordered the spaghetti squash and loved it.  We would try this place again, a lot of good option to try."}
{"text":"Bottom Line Up Front: if you have more money than nutrition, this will balance you out. Pricey and pretentious, meh food and great service.  Background: I was in Phoenix to run the Ragnar 202 mile relay race and we met the team here the night before we ran. We're a fairly healthy and athletic bunch, so the concept seemed like a great match. Here is how the stars breakdown:  My first (obligatory) star is for the concept of fresh healthy food in a gorgeous atmosphere. The open dining area is beautiful, though maybe not the most practical. The kitchen opens fully into the dining/bar area with nary a sneeze guard between you and the chefs.  My second star is for the extremely efficient and polite service. With a table of ten people all asking for separate checks, our server was fast, polite and willing to do more than we should have expected.  What would it take to get my third star? Basic comforts. The night we were there, it was cold outside and the patio has lots of doors which made for a chilly dining experience every time the servers passed by. The restrooms are outside and around the building (like a gas station?) and the seating arrangement was oddly grouped around the table which crowded some and left others eating on the corner of the table.  Once we've made it comfortable, the fourth star could be had by increasing the value for my dollar. I had the bison burger, which was more bun than burger and with water my bill was $17 before tip. It's ridiculous to propose that you must spend a fortune to get basic, healthy food. Perhaps it was the mysterious \"umami\" sauce, which is mostly nutritional yeast, kind of a vegan cheese substitute, that jacked up the price. Why you would need vegan cheese on a bison burger is beyond me.  The elusive fifth star, I'm afraid, may be out of reach for a couple of reasons. Even if the comfort and value were addressed, the food was nothing noteworthy. After speaking to other runners, few of us found the flavor to be memorable. Additionally, the restaurant places more value in the aesthetics of health than the practice of eating well. Health is not something you buy, it's something you live. Healthy food is not expensive unless it's over processed, or over marketed.  If you are truly looking for healthy food, try a Farmer's Market. If your looking for the latest food trends regardless of health or cost, this may appeal to you."}
{"text":"We went here for a great sunday afternoon lunch with kids and grandparents. Our waiter was very attentive. Food was very well presented and tasted amazing.  I have also been here for an employee's birthday celebrations for more of the drinks and app's and have always been impressed with their healthy, fresh and well prepared options. I would return here for any type of eating occasion ;)"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here when I am in town.  Food is healthy and fresh."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place! If you're going for brunch on the weekend I highly recommend arriving around 11 or 11:15 as it gets packed. Great location in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter.  Every server we have had here has been so helpful and pleasant. Awesome spot if you are vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free. Their gluten-free pita is really good.  Menu has something for everyone. Open/modern restaurant with a lot of windows - super relaxed vibe. Great juices (a little pricey, but well worth it) -- I highly recommend their banana and date smoothie.  They also have a juice bar outside -- SO darn good. Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"My first time dining here for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The quacomole appetizer and the edammame dumplings were delishious perfect amount of chips to quac and it was a healthy sized portion (not a tiny scoop).   Now for the meals there was not much as far as what I was able to eat so I ended up ordering the turkey wrap eithout all the extras which ended up being to dry, but the waitress brought some taziki sauce which helped significantly. She side of sweet potato has was phenomenal to go with it. Between two appetizers and two meals is was more than the both of us could eat... so no worries on portion size here.   We were a little weaey having to sit outside in this heat but the misters were a saving grace and it was relatively comfortable. Would recommend to my friends and family, but would love a couple other options that are less healthy as strange as that may seem."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed every dish I've ordered ..been here at least 3 times (and once to the Scottsdale Quarter location) and have, each time, ordered something different (so many intriguing options I can't help it but want to try a new thing! PLUS, they change their menu items with a few staples that remain unchanged).    I've never tried their pizzas, but I can attest to their salads and sandwiches and entrees - the one that stands out the most is their Sashimi Tuna which was surprisingly filling (the fat of the fish and avocado) and not-surprisingly, very full of flavor and my favorite, ginger.  Their Steak Tacos were also fantastic and I love the cotija cheese they put on top and of course my other fave, avocado.  Their price point is competitive considering they serve premium ingredients and the food has never disappointed.  Also, servers are (cute enough), wearing matching capris and such and have always been friendly, down to earth, and prompt.  I enjoyed the outdoor patio that the Scottsdale Quarter location has better than the Biltmore's, but this place is still very enjoyable... I just hate the parking dilemma since it's so popular on a any night of the week."}
{"text":"Been here several times.. Always good food and the dessert is delicious as well. Their cucumber refresher drink is my favorite. A little pricy but still worth it."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out tonight... not having the highest hopes. I mean, come on, it is a \"healthy\" restaurant\". I was pleasantly surprised. The food is pretty amazing. I had a pizza and my friend had a rice bowl. They were both tasty and decent sizes. Not too big and not too small. We didnt have any drinks, appetizers, or desserts... but what we did eat was tasty. I will be going back in the near future."}
{"text":"I LOVE True Foods Kitchen! The staff is always so friendly and helpful!! Brandon and Megan Helped me yesterday and our whole table loved them.    I personally love the shaved turkey with sweet potato hash on the side but everything Ive had there is exceptional!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I wanted a nice and relaxing lunch and thought about doing some shopping and dining at the quarter in Scottsdale. We ended up here at tru foods and really liked the setting and had lunch on the patio and that was the highlight.  The meal was slow to arrive, service was slow, and the food was boring. I think the staff had to many of their famous elixir drinks that lulled the whole place into a catatonic state with no personality and it came across in the food.  Sam Fox let me down on this visit and with all the other options in his new neighborhood there is nothing that is going to pull me back into his joyless world of Tru Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"First time going to true food and have to say I am not impressed. We walk in the door and are seated quickly, however after sitting for 15 minutes I became confused as to why we hadn't been asked for a drink order or checked on etc.. never before have I had to ask a server to get service. Not happy I'm paying $50 for 2 people to eat when I have to ask for service."}
{"text":"If you place a priority on healthy clean eating, True Kitchen is your spot. I don't know that I have ever eaten at a restaurant with similar offerings.  If you are Vegan, you'll kill for True Kitchen. And if you prefer poultry, fish or other, they have that also. I had a Turkey sand which. It came on pita bread and included greens, onion, zucchini, a yogurt spread and succulent carved turkey in a smooth light broth. It was awesome!  Place The True Kitchen on your must visit list."}
{"text":"I have ate here twice and both times were great! The menu is very healthy but also tasty. You might be skeptical before you order but it's very filling and light. In other words, the food is great fuel for the rest of the day. I would recommend the teriyaki bowl, the wrap or the burger. The juices are great as well! It's just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3x. First time, I had the organic ricotta ravioli. Which was quite good, but oh so salty. Almost unbearably salty, and I am a salt-loving girl. I had a hard time finishing it.   The second time, I had a a pretty bland salad that doesnt even seem to be on the menu anymore. I wonder why.    Third time, I ordered steak tacos.   I keep coming back because I want to love it. As you can see though, I havent found something worth ordering twice yet. Bad sign after 3 visits.  I ordered my tacos well done and another server brought them out. They were medium-well which was totally fine with me and I was about to start eating them when our server suddenly appeared, said something about them not being well done, and stole the plate out from in front of me without even giving me half a second to make a decision, and then took it back to the kitchen. When it returned, the steak was kind of chewy.  I guess Im just used to the high quality meat we use at home? The beans that came with it were...just okay.  The honey lemonade was too sweet. I had about 1/3 of it and couldnt handle the rest.   My mom ordered a soup (not the miso) and it smelled great but tasted...flavorless. *SIGH*   I'll probably give them one last try before I call shenanigans on the whole joint."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, professionally served healthy food.  The TLT sandwich was amazing and the bowls were super filling .  We had the Medicine man and watermelon cooler."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is healthy and delicious.  I seriously could eat here everyday.  The Kale Salad is really good and the Turkey Wrap is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"Such a great place for tasty health food!!! I love their weekend brunch chicken sausage & kale scramble & jube true almond milk dark chocolate cold pressed coffee!!!   Other great items i've had are: the turkey burger, panang shrimp noodles, & the crudite."}
{"text":"Please indicate if the following points are True or False:  -   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUE  -   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUE  -   The cheerful restaurant décor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUE  -  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE   -   The menu's variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUE  -   It took your waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. TRUE  -   When the waiter finally arrived, he didn't welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil & Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE   -   Waiters at Applebee's have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE   -   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUE  -  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of \"Guess Who?\" - waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUE  -   At least 4 times (it occurred so frequently you stopped counting), a random waiter placed someone else's food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUE  -  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the $100+ bill including a bottle of wine. TRUE  -  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this \"simple\" meal yourselves. TRUE  -  A snail could have cooked and served your \"simple\" meal faster then the 3 painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUE  -  The restaurant's parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot - but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of \"Guess Who?\" and couldn't serve your \"simple\" meal in less than two hours - so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE   -   Although you liked the décor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you don't recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUE  Thank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!"}
{"text":"Here is what really gets me - THEY DON'T POST NUTRITIONAL CONTENT OF THEIR FOOD!!!  The claim is that \"we change our menu so often it would be impracticable\" but they DO NOT CHANGE THE MENU!  I have been going to this restaurant since it opened, the menu is virtually identical.  And my guess is that when they create new items, they probably figure out the nutritional content. So we have a supposed \"healthy\" restaurant that won't post nutritional information, what does that tell you?????  Shame shame shame on your true foods."}
{"text":"I am usually not an organic food person, but this may change my mind.  Great food and service.  Nice simple menu, but food quality is great, never knew kale could taste so good.  Also sampled the pizza's, and black cod.  The only drawback is that it is loud inside, so if you a looking for a quiet place, this may not be the place for you.  But, it still deserves 5 stars in my mind..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very satisfying. I always order the kale & avocado dip (ask for extra chips, they never give you enough) For my entrée I get the red chili shrimp. (Just the right amount of spice!) Finish with the flourless chocolate cake & vanilla ice cream. There is almost always a wait for a table no matter what day & time you go. Great selection of meals for kids. My toddler enjoys the mozzarella pizza. Have also tried the margherita pizza which is delicious & we love the honey lemonade too! Food is pretty expensive but oh so worth it!!! 5 stars- love this place!"}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying I've never been into trends, especially the most recent \"organic\" foods one (well, I guess recent since the 90s?). While I did feel like I was in an episode of Portlandia when I read the menu, I was delighted with the taste of all the food. The waitress asked if we had every been there before, and told us about how, well, how healthy everything is.   My coworker has been there multiple time, and suggest we start with the edamame dumplings. Very good! Were there worth $2 per dumpling...? I don't know. I guess your wallet decides that.   I had to ask what multiple ingredients were (vegenaise = vegan mayo; hehe!) but finally choose the TLT. Tempeh, by the way, is a compressed soy bean (I think?), smoked, that \"tastes like bacon.\" It was actually really good! I thought the TLT had turkey in it but about 1/2 way through I realized it was just the tempeh. Avocado was great too.  My TLT came with a couple of side options, and none sounded too appetizing (see: previous reviews. I like beer and fries, like every overweight American), but I've been on a health kick, so I went with the kale salad. It was actually very good- due to the grated parmesean and bread crumbs. Very \"kale-y\" still, but I guess kale is kale and there's only so much you can do to mask the healthy taste. The lemon dressing was good, but a bit too much actually and completely soaked my bread on my sammich that was sharing it's plate.   Everything else was generally good (service, decor) but I was surprised for such a busy place, they'd only have one sink in the bathroom. I had to wait for some chick to stop staring at herself (see: Scottsdale location) to wash my hands.   I think I'd go there again just for the TLT ($10)- everything else was out of my budget for a lunch. My coworker got the ravioli; 5 pieces for $15. I have to wait until I marry rich to enjoy those spoils."}
{"text":"Really good place to have lunch or dinner , place is well degisned and stuff are super nice and friendly I love the concept of the open kitchen and the bar area and high sitting as well to regular tables I ate the temp sandwich with sweet potatoes and it was really great Thank you very recommend"}
{"text":"I came for a business lunch and was impressed by their menu! This was my first time at the restaurant and I ordered the Summer Market Salad. At first glance I was a little hesitant but after giving it a shot it was great! I usually don't like blueberries with goat cheese but it blended really well and was not a sweet salad (I try to stay away from sweet salads).   My coworkers and I had the lemon tart with coconut for dessert -YUM!!   Both are a must!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali & heard about this spot! Awesome:) It's so much easier to eat super healthy, when the food tastes this good! We will come back whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"This place is pretty big! It's bright and modern. Check in with name and number while waiting to be seated and receive a text message when your table is ready. Service was very satisfactory. My particular waitress suggested a drink item and was very knowledgable on the menu. When she suggested her favorite menu item for lunch she was descriptive and happy to tell about it. Decent food portions; not too big. I ate every bite! Would be a great place for business meetings bcoz it's not very noisy a place. Casual vibe."}
{"text":"Awesome kale salad!  Spaghetti squash casserole was delicious!  Healthy vegetarian food!  Chicago - please open one now:)"}
{"text":"I will say this place gets packed really fast.  I met a friend for lunch this day.  We skipped on the appetizers and went straight for the meals.  I ordered the grass fed burger and a side of fries.  I will say the burger was really tasty and fresh.  The fries were really good too.  I have had a lot of burgers in my time and this is one of the best.  I am not sure if it was buffalo or beef.  I had a buffalo at a different true foods location too.  It was excellent.  This is on the top 3 list for burgers."}
{"text":"This is possibly my new favorite restaraunt.  It's healthy eating, but yet it taste so good.  The Lasagna is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"I went with others to have lunch here. It was a place I wouldn't have gone to by myself. Service was good, but like I said before it just wasn't the restaurant I would usually go to. Menu was all natural foods. It just was hard for me to pick something I would like to eat. I am open to trying other types of food. I did find something to eat and I have to say it was good but I don't think I will go back. Like I mention before It is just not my normal place to go to eat.  https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31350-d2105924-r422540049-True_Food_Kitchen-Scottsdale_Arizona.html#"}
{"text":"Wonderful food & wonderful experience overall. My husband & I truly enjoyed the ambience & mostly the food. Their mission is empowering! You are what you eat :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Great service and always fresh, exciting meal options. My friends ordered The Hangover RX and say it worked  we always come here when in AZ. It's worth the wait you will probably have!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place. I was a frequent visitor of their Santa Monica location in California. I've never ordered something that I didn't like.  This time around, I split their new Roasted Vegetable Board with my cousin. It was so good! Came with a green goddess dressing & hummus. Couldn't decide which was better.  We also split a quinoa burger (see photos). It was a great healthy choice. The kale on the side was so flavorful (maybe rubbed with lemon & garlic?) and the sweet potatoes were good.  AWESOME DRINKS: spontaneous happiness & cucumber citrus margarita   This is a great lunch spot and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved the salad & all the fresh food ! The tea was awesome & the service was excellent ! I would definitely tell friends to come here !"}
{"text":"First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Dr. Andrew Weil.  He is an advocate of eating whole, natural and organic foods whenever possible.  He doesn't have a 'diet' book, but he does advocate for eating in a way that our bodies our truly nourished.  I was soo excited to find out about True Food Kitchen.  I found the decor to be light and festive.  My dad found the colors reminded him of the 70's. lol. Our waiter was really nice and took the time to explain all of the teas available to my mom. He suggested we try the hummus, and since I'm a sucker for chickpeas, we ordered it. I'm totally going to start making my hummus with some jalepeno!  It was great, but a tad spicy for some.  We loved it.  I had the steak tacos with adzuki beans.  The beans were quite spicy and I only ate half, but they were delicious. The tacos were great and I could tell the meat was \"organic\" (duh, of course meat is organic people!) because of the distinct taste of meat not raised with added hormones.    One plus about this place is that people who have allergies to certain food products are absolutely able to eat here.  There are plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and dairy-free items on the menu. I will definitely be back.  My only problem is that I found it to be a bit expensive, but then again, I'm cheap. lol.  Plus:  I saw some dogs seated with owners at their side patio tables!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoy this place.  The people and service are always nice and the food is really good.  I was a bit standoffish as I had been told it was a bit more raw than it actually turned out to be but it was the best, with the freshest tasting ingredients I have ever had at a restaurant.  A bit pricey, yes. Always crowded yes. Good food yes."}
{"text":"Tasty, energizing food!  Liked this place enough to visit twice in one week. Right off the bat: Servers are extremely friendly and efficient. Also important to know, if you are very hungry, i would recommend ordering a few things.  That being said, the food tastes amazing and you will feel good eating it.   First trip: Ancient grains bowl with chicken. Not too filling but hit the spot and i could taste everything so well. Get it  Second trip: inside out Quinoa burger. Again very tasty but didn't fill me up. Should have ordered something else.   Overall: Definitely try his place! Only criticism, could get pricey to be full and satisfied.   Savor the flavors!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise. I was initially skeptical when my wife showed me the menu but thought what the heck...glad I did   Super fresh veggies interesting plates and flavor combinations. Superb \"squash\" pie for dessert.   Service was fine. Not intrusive but always there."}
{"text":"Went here again yesterday and was blown away again by the service and the food. The managers that work here are very professional, friendly, and know how to run a restaurant. Friendly bartenders and waiters/waitresses also. Even though the place is packed and everyone is so busy, they look like they're having fun and still take time to make customers feel special. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff with plenty of healthy options.   I got the casserole with a glass of wine. The casserole was okay, but was loaded with veggies which I liked. Excellent wine list with fair pricing."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here with my family. The food was delicious but what really made my visit was our server Chris. He was hands down the best server I've ever had. He was very patient and attentive. The BEST customer service ever! I wish every server was as awesome as he is! Awesome place and awesome staff! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to tell you how TRULY underwhelming this was, and for the price you pay for it, you're probably better off loading up on junk at the Whole Foods salad bar.   The folks who run True Food (and a handful of other non-related \"concept\" restaurants) are the kind of people I have a hard time taking seriously. If you believe so much in a product or a concept, I expect it to shine through your food and service. Instead, this was a streamlined operation with a perma-stoned spacey staff and the results were abysmal.   It's a shame that such a beautifully converted space (I can't believe this was that old Coffee Plantation) houses such mediocrity. I started my meal with the Tuscan kale salad. At first, I was very excited for this because it had been well over a year since I had seen any place in Arizona eve serve kale. The salad was simple- served with lemon juice, Parmesan, and bread crumbs, yet the lemon was so overpowering, it made the entire salad entirely too sour and bitter. The sea bass street tacos were a joke. Entirely overcooked and tasted way too fishy. Even the salsa and pickled onions couldn't mask the fishiness of this dish. The wild ahi sliders were fair-- perfectly seared, but lacked any depth of flavor. Thankfully, those didn't taste like it had been sitting out too long. We also got the sweet potato hash on the side...which was burnt on the bottom and tasted of smoke all the way through...I don't quite think they were meant to be that way though.  Got conned into ordering two juice infusion type things...not memorable at all. Opted out of dessert for all the obvious reasons.   The waitress bugged me so much. I don't know what hippie food co-op they dragged her out of, but if you're going to be a good waitress you probably should a) forget that you have tables and b) not look disgusted when your non-vegetarian customers order meat. The look on her face was more insulting to me than the meal itself, which is why I brought it down to two stars.   Care about selling customers your \"concept\" of quality, healthy foods?  Then SERVE quality, healthy foods."}
{"text":"This place explains why people do not eat healthy. I expected a certain health/environmental theme from restaurants like this.   For one: I was shocked they used plastic bottles for their juice, I mean aren't you trying to go for an environmental/healthy eating theme here?   Food/drink:  Order the shitake rock cod. Small portion, but very well executed. Sauce is light yet savory. Large pieces of shitake.  Roots Radical - A weird drink with a little too much spicy kick to it was stuck on my tongue. It later dried my tongue to the point where it start bleeding.   Service:  This is in a swanky shopping plaza....service better be good. And it was.   Environment:  The interior has a lot of open space. Exterior is well designed and feels like a fairly nice place to hang out in the outdoor seating area.   Price:  $26 for a small fish dish and $9 for a juice. After tax and tip I think I paid $44 or so, which is pretty pricey (to me at least).   Food: 4 Drink: 2 Service: 4 Environment: 4 Price: 1"}
{"text":"I met up with a friend today for an early dinner and some serious catch up.  This was my second time eating there and I wanted to sit  outside (while we still can!) to escape the noise.  We had a good meal...I ordered the shrimp dish and was warned by my server that it was \"very spicy\".  I'm a native so I am not intimidated by that at all.  It was yummy but distinctly non-spicy.  It came with noodles and I brought half home with the intention of doctoring it up for another meal.  My friend ordered street tacos and another enter.  She was hungry and said the tacos were good.  We had a gift card, so had dessert---a really strong, but tasty, lemon tart and a yummy frut crisp .  Our service was polite and they were tolerant of our very long visit.  I'msure the generous tip didn't hurt, either.  So, after my second visit, I am still not blown away by True Food   The menu has some variety but things like street tacos can literally be found everywhere.  I think I have an expectation that the food be healthy , unique, AND creative, especially for the price .  This is a really competitive food town.  The way for True Food to distinguish itself is to innovate and give the diner value .Once that happens, I bet more folks will place it in their regular rotation."}
{"text":"I am seriously in love with True Foods. I can't afford to go all the time because it's very pricey but the food is amazingly delicious and extremely healthy. They have awesome drinks. I always start with the vegetable crudite. It's a nice bowl of yummy vegetables served with two sauces. I had the albacore tataki which is good but cost about the same as my huge bowl of veggies. I have had a couple of their salads which of course are so delicious that I am drooling as I write this. My finance got the street tacos which he thoroughly devoured but after we left, he was still hungry so portions are small and the price is large. We had two desserts, I don't remember what they were called but his was a lemon bar or pie of some sort. He loved it and I had a berry cobbler with frozen greek yogurt. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Came with my dad who's an omni and we both got to enjoy a nice, fresh meal! For an appetizer we shared the kale guacamole and I think it's safe to say this is the one of the best guacs I've ever tasted! For a main, I ordered the T.L.T sandwich and for desert, my dad and I shared a slice of the vegan key lime pie! I've never had key lime pie before so this was pretty awesome to see that the one on the menu was vegan! Definitely recommend if you're vegan/vegetarian and want to find a place that's great to dine at with an omni or simply want to enjoy some great food!"}
{"text":"Ok.. you hummus people.... its awesome here.  Also the Kale salad was great...  Not a fan of the Turkey burger, came out cold but everything else was Great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I love the fact that they have indoor and outdoor seating. The staff is friendly and friendly. The food is absolutely wonderful. I have had almost everything on the menu and I do not have one bad thing to say about that.   However the downfall is, they do not take a reservation. At least for a party of four (4)."}
{"text":"The strawberry salad is delicious.  Always nice but it's very loud at times and if you are going for lunch plan to wait in line."}
{"text":"This is the first true food location I visited. I've been here several times and have yet to be disappointed with my food choices. This is a great location in the middle of Scottsdale quarter. There is almost always a 30-45 min wait so plan ahead. We usually come and put our name in and enjoy some shopping at the surrounding stores while waiting.   The offer a wide variety of food choices. All the items are the menu are created to be antioxidant meals.   My favorite meal item is the grass fed burger. The sauce and mushrooms add an amazing flavor.   My favorite dessert is the flourless chocolate cake but the banana chia pudding is really good too!"}
{"text":"I get it, the food is healthy and tasty. I personally think they sometimes try to hard with the menu. Finding anything 'normal' or simple can some times be a challenge. Overall the food is good and the atmosphere is great on a mild day. The place is usually crazy busy at lunch time so coming a little earlier may help to avoid the lunch rush."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place I finally tried it and was very impressed! Started with the lettuce wraps and they were great!  The Ahi sliders are good, but the Kale salad is amazing!  I have to get the recipe for it!  Do have the agree with the other post, the service is a little slow..."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection for a plant-based diet.  I had a salad that was great.  I would highly recommend if you like fresh food and has many organic options."}
{"text":"We experienced so many restaurants in Scottsdale over the holidays and I'm very grateful to have tried True Food Kitchen.  Good, very tasty and healthy food is were it's at and how it should be.  The service was perfect and the interior is beautiful.  FYI:  I found it by searching \"Vegan food\"."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner last night.  Friendly staff.  Good menu, however I was not impressed with the flavors.  I had the spaghetti squash casserole and it was bland.  I has a bite of the sea bass and it was cooked very well, however kind of flavorless.  Also, prices are very high for what you get.  Not worth it.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and service. A bit pricy for what you get during dinner but great lunch prices. I'm a big fan of Dr.Weil and his wellness teachings. The only thing that would make it better is if they'd take reservations."}
{"text":"We're already planning our next dinner at True Food. Well, actually we'd like to try the Happy Hour next!  We were kindly accommodated outside with our pup. We really appreciated TFK allowing us to have our dog outside, who fared well in the shade provided by the side of the building, the hanging canopies in the alleyway, the umbrella by our table, and the overhead misting.  Adam was our server and he was so genuine and his presence was truly a delight. He answered all of our questions concerning the menu and when we were stuck between dishes, he gave us recommendations that did not disappoint! As it was our first time here, he explained the philosophy and seasonal schedule of the restaurant to us, which is right up our alleys. A changing menu is awesome because it gives incentive to keep you coming back to try more.  We had guacamole as an appetizer which was fresh af on a hot September evening in the Valley. I ordered the chili noodles and my SO ordered some kind of grass-fed burger wrapped in lettuce. After we ate our meal, we didn't feel overly stuffed or uncomfortably filled with heavy food, as meals out often leave us feeling. We felt comfortable, light, and satiated, more than likely due to the fresh ingredients in our dinner. This really makes a difference in our dining experience, and is the main reason we're coming back to experience this place again in the near future."}
{"text":"As a mom of a kid with food allergies, I always have a hard time finding delicious food traveling. A few local friends recommend True Food and it was delicious! We went on a Saturday morning and I really loved how they open at 10am. My daughter had a yummy GF muffin. I mean yummy because it did not taste like cardboard. A lot of GF stuff taste like cardboard to me. And I was so happy that brunch had more choices than just egg related because my daughter is also allergic to eggs. I really enjoyed my farmed chopped chicken salad. Service was excellent. When I am in Scottsdale next time, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The lemonades are tasty. Very creative drink menu. The servers don't do well explaining the menu options. The hostess is really nice and attentive. However, when asked for water the server stands around the kitchen for a few minutes then goes to clean off some tables. Finally, when we cross his mind, he decides to bring water for our surprisingly spicy dishes. It's not like I had an urgent look in my eyes or anything. Also, the restaurant is very open so you know when the server blows you off. The food is pleasant, but I'll have to try something else on the menu to give an honest increase in stars. Maybe it's because we had Jewels bakery and cafe for breakfast that it didn't \"wow\" us."}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing. The food was phenomenal. Had a nice table outside which set the ambiance. We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer - fabulous, we should have ordered two for the three of us.  The curry dish was amazing. I can't stress how tasty it was! We asked for it spicy and it def had a kick. There was a lot too so that I was able to really indulge.  The quinoa burger was ok.  We also ordered a butternut squash pizza. This had a unique flavor but we really liked it. I found the spiced apple drink to be too spiced for me but many yelpers really love it. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Ancient grains salad and hummus were excellent! The food was delicious and refreshing. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Dr. Weil, so when I was looking for a place to go and found out through Yelp that he owns this restaurant, I had to try it out.  I was very happy with my experience.  The ambiance was cool, and the food my friends and I ordered all came out great.  I ordered their Kale salad, and it is pretty amazing.  I liked it so much that I looked it up online after and have been making my own version at home.  The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I have a bias up front because I'm a Dr. Weil groupie, so I got the fangirl goggles coming into this place. My expectations were actually exceeded, and am SO happy to discover this restaurant because they have a plethora of dairy free and egg free options which is awesome for someone like me with the allergies.  The decor is bright and energetic. Our service was fantastic. I loved how they display bins of fresh fruits.  Over at my food blog, you can see pictures of the dishes we ate: 2 appetizers and 2 dishes, the teriyaki tofu brown rice and Roasted Autumn Vegetables. My favorite was the Edamame dumplings: http://bit.ly/aeZmin  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I thought the pricing was a tad on the high side. I felt it was worth it, but this place is more of a treat than let's eat there twice a week kind of thing...at least for me."}
{"text":"A go-to brunch not to be missed especially when the fall weather permits friendly sunshiny days! Huevos rancheros $9 and Garden Scramble (I think it was $10) are my two favorites. Huevos rancheros is filled with the roasted chile, organic corn tortillas and yummy cotija cheese and a runny egg on top. Every bite served its purpose. Garden Scramble was equally delicious. Scrambled eggs with butternut squash, smoked onion, smoked Gouda, Swiss chard, broccoli. Squash slice of pie $7 with the tasty fall whip cream ended the brunch on a sweet note. Service was speedy and genuinely in good spirits. Can't wait for another outing here."}
{"text":"Great, healthy place to eat delicious food in Scottsdale.  I have come here a couple of times on business.  I had the Quinoa Salad and the Hangover Rx drink.  Our server Marco was super friendly and provides great service.  Out would recommend this place and definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but its trendy and way overrated.  I love Fox restaurants and organic/local food so expected I would adore this place.  What we got instead was overpriced, bland food. I can cook better at home.  I would not return. :("}
{"text":"Yet another GREAT Fox Restaurant Concept - actually probably my favorite of all of them!  My wife and I had dinner here on Valentine's Day with another couple.  They had an enticing prix fixe menu that we couldn't pass up.  The server was friendly, even though we were there right up until close, and the food was very good.  I had the Herb Hummus as an appetizer and the Steak Tacos for my entree.  The hummus was delicious.  The tacos were also very good - I would have them again - but they fell apart very easily, which was a bit of a turnoff.  More than anything, you have to appreciate a mainstream restaurant like True Food dedicating itself to using seasonal, locally grown, organic food as much as possible.  That alone will make me return for another meal soon!"}
{"text":"Prices up , quality down! They ruined the shaved turkey sandwich!!  I will not go back, period!!"}
{"text":"A Fox concepts restaurant group restaurant, I've eaten at this restaurant many times n enjoy the seasonal changes. Some things are better than others but overall this is a nice spot. It also has the best location in the Scottsdale quarters in my opinion, I love the patio in the back by the green grass mole hills and palm trees. Very Scottsdale! Great place to eat before or after a movie at Ipic.  My favorites on the menu are, the salads!! especially Tuscan kale and the hummus..."}
{"text":"Terrible does not fully capture the atrocious service and food this place dishes out. It's perfect for the snobs who pride themselves in how big the food bill and have rated this place so highly. Anyone with a shred of taste and pulse will never want to eat this bs dished out with bs ATTITUDE."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!! Yum yum!   Everything on the menu is delicious.  It's healthy and tasty.  I love the edamame pot stickers. I have been craving them since I ate there. I can't wait to go back. The atmosphere was also awesome!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Didn't realize they focus on an anti inflammatory diet. Definitely can taste the fresh and healthy foods. Great for brunch and has a fun California esque vibe! Coming back."}
{"text":"Great location, great views.  The patio is a great place to relax and visit with friends while people watching.   The palm tree lights in the courtyard give a soft, relaxing feeling.  Fun weekend night out!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Great selection and variety of food and the location is perfect because it's in the Biltmore and who doesn't love that place. They are also dog friendly on their patio. It is pricy so be prepared for that. Friendly service with great food, what more can you ask!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! One of my favorite restaurants. I have been there multiple times and never been disappointed. The restaurant itself is clean, bright and beautiful! The staff are kind and knowledgeable about the menu. And best of all is the food!! If you're a health nut you will be in heaven!! It's a pricer place, so I consider it a special occasion to eat here but very worth it! We always get the bison burger! It's mouthwatering. I also love the kale salad and the sweet potato hash. Their specialty drinks are super yummy and my body always feels so happy after I leave! Quality food!!! Thank you True Foods!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went out for a birthday dinner last night at true foods. It was a really excellent meal! The food was incredible, we tried the spaghetti squash, which was great, especially with some bison burger mixed in, and the turkey lasagna and the tacos, they were all fantastic. but the highlight of the meal was our server, Caroline. She made recommendations, smiled and laughed with us, made several substitutions to our orders, and just made the whole meal more enjoyable and memorable. She even suggested a better spot when we asked her to take our photo, to get in the beautiful view and lights. Can't wait to come back and try all the other great looking items on the menu."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.  Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.  Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.    Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.  My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more."}
{"text":"So I guess I'm the rare person who didn't think True Food was the best thing since sliced bread...I'll admit, I'm a pizza and wine, steak and potato kinda girl, and I like feeling full and satisfied after I pay for a meal...this did not happen here. The Husband and I were practically starving when we decided to go here. And since it was on our list of places to try, we thought, what better time. Without even looking at the menu really, (which is unlike us) we shot over there like we were racing other cars on the road. Here are the positives: The hummus was really good. Kindof reminded me of Olive and Ivy's, which I love. To drink I had the vanilla lemongrass sparkling tea which was so amazing. I could drink one everyday during the summertime. The Husband had the short rib, which was actually pretty tasty.  The not so positives: The portions are small. His short rib plate was kinda small and I knew he'd be hungry later. I had the steak tacos which I didn't enjoy because the steak was too charred so my whole taco tasted burned...that pretty much ruined it for me. The beans that came with it were ok, but kinda spicy...  Overall, I ate my burnt tasting tacos because I was starving...but I don't know if I would have liked them even if they weren't burned...outside of the burnt-ness, there weren't many other flavors going on. Husband said the leeks and carrots could've been cooked a little longer...but that's his personal preference.   While I appreciate the healthy aspect of this restaurant, it's just not my kindof place I guess. But I would definitely go back for the vanilla lemongrass tea!"}
{"text":"Went for my girlfriends sisters birthday. Pros: sustainable food. Hip settings. Good food. Cons: over priced. The spagetti squash caserole was miniscule. Cool drinks though.  Largest complaint was a cold draft that kept hitting us because they refused to keep the patio door closed.   Sort of it is I don't think ill go there again. But I do like their healthy food vibe."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced!  The outdoor seating is nice, and I really liked my cucumber lemonade (Cucumber Refresher), but everything else is just OK. I felt like I was eating at IKEA but waited on by somewhat condescending hipsters who were part of a brainwashed cult of 'healthy' but not real healthy, just some commercialized version of it. I just felt uncomfortable.  All the food looked nice, that's for sure. But I didn't really like the bison burger - I cant remember why, I guess it was pretty forgettable. The tacos were OK and the vegetable salad was OK.  So much hype though. It just feels so pretentious!! Am I missing something?   I've definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"Oh how I loved this place! I wish Tucson had one of these restaurants! Every dish we tried was so tasty! I love the ambiance of this location too - looking out at the fountain.  There are a lot of choice for vegans and vegetarians and they were willing to be accommodating to our requests.  The menu is eclectic for every one to enjoy!  Parking is not close, we parked in the garage and had a 5-6 minute walk but it is well worth it plus you can burn off the extra calories you just consumed! :-)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hummus I've ever tasted! The only thing I'll avoid is the honey lemonade with macha.  The food is exciting and very colorful"}
{"text":"Love their food!! As a vegetarian I don't have too many options in this town, and every time I go there the food is yummy, the service is great, they are always willing to modify a dish for me, and all the servers are very nice! Go eat there, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Sitting outside on the wraparound patio is the way to go.  There is plenty of space, and the seats feel like couches, so it is essentially like being in your living room with your own a private fire pit.  Then there is the menu, which is simple, yet intriguing, particularly due to the fact most of the ingredients are grown locally, some are grown on-site, and there are a number of nutrient dense items not commonly found on restaurant menus, i.e. quinoa, kale, etc..  I realized I couldn't try everything on the first visit, so I went with the Grilled Steelhead Salmon, came back later the same day for the Grass Fed Bison Burger, and then later visited their newly opened restaurant in Santa Monica, CA and had the Angus Steak Tacos with quinoa.  Equally important as the experience with the food was the experience with the service staff, which was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  There are still things on the menu I'd like to try, so I'll be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Even though it's in a mall, I'd still eat here as my sole destination. The open kitchen boasts a confidence that cannot be argued with. For lunch, I had the kale salad with salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. My wife had the quinoa salad. While I loved my lunch, I tasted hers and will have a hard time deciding which to order when I return, but the entire menu looks good."}
{"text":"Great food with tons of vegan and vegetarian options on the menu. Delicious mocktails!"}
{"text":"The food was very great quality. We ordered the lasagna and it was amazing. The lasagna was very flavorful, and smooth. The Moroccan chicken was great, and crispy.  The chicken farro salad was probably the best salad I've ever had, and it's champagne vinaigrette was to die for. We ordered a martini and asked for grand marnier, but the place didn't have any. The waiter went out of his way and went to another restaurant to get us grand marnier for the drink. That is amazing service!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food! Everything was incredibly fresh! I learned that I love kale which is quite exciting. :-) I ordered the bison burger which was delicious and my husband loved his shrimp curry! I only wish they would open a restaurant closer to where we live, but every time we visit our friend here, we will most definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"YUM! Vegan-friendly, paleo-friendly, allergen-friendly.. It was amazing. The menu includes all super local, fresh and mostly organic ingredients and everything is labeled. The wait staff is willing to accommodate for food allergies and were overall very warm and welcoming. We ate outside on the patio on the patio furniture and would go back in an instant!"}
{"text":"Obsessed.  Ambiance is great, service also great.  The menu freakin' rules my life.  The beverages are always fun, and delicious.  I had something with lemon and kale and it was so good.   Bison Burger is good, Salmon is good, Ahi appetizer is good... although I am guessing every option would be delicious.  Lot's of stuff for dietary weirdo's such as myself.  My normal boyfriend also loves it.  I haven't had dessert, but it looks divine.  I will re-visit often."}
{"text":"Quality quality quality! Its in the name and the food is delish! The menu is seasonal and the food is fresh. Oh and we ran into Pink here! No, not the color silly, the singer!!! It was awesome! They must be doing something right to get that kind of celebrity to come to eat here! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"absolutely amazing here. Fresh food that I can taste and know it was made well.   Unique drink and food options and an amazing, refreshing vibe throughout. THis is my favorite Sam Fox restaurant... and I like them all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've never had a bad meal here. Hands down my favorite lunch spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the True Food in Scottsdale on a Thursday a couple of weeks ago.  There is really nothing not to like here.  the restaurant itself is great looking and will be wonderful when the weather warms up as all the walls are glass doors.  I thought alcohol was well priced or least the wine was as you get glasses starting at $6.  we shared the lettuce cups as an appetizer and they were quite tasty although messy to eat as are all the dishes that use lettuce as a tortilla.  I had the puttanesca with a twist--no anchovies--instead with ahi tuna--it was quite tasty and was a right sized portion.  My sister in law had a tofu curry--that also was quite flavorful--even though I am not a fan of curry and can take or leave tofu.  head the chocolate cake for dessert which was just right.  I will definitely go back-all in all a pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Love True Food Kitchen! The menu is seasonal and delicious. I left feeling healthy and happy. The portions are a bit small.. or my appetite is to big lol. But I would highly recommend going. It's a perfect place to have a party or a special event. The atmosphere is lovely and fresh. Our waiter Trevor was awesome. He was so attentive and polite, my whole table left really impressed with his service."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of True Food Kitchens.  I've been to the one in Virginia,  San Diego and now here. What I love is I can great consistent food in different places. I came around 7 pm on a Saturday and it was packed and quite a wait but the tall tables had availability so I ate there. The edamame dumplings were delicious and my usual  kale salad with steelhead was awesome as well. We also got an order of hummus which I don't always like but this was really good. I'll be back when I'm in town again"}
{"text":"Super stoked on this spot. Creative healthy menu options, fun drinks, loved the decor, great energy, wonderful service by Marco. Seasonal menu, transparent kitchen (even the walk-in), integrity in their product. Wish there were more restaurants like this out there. Try the ancient grains bowl, the grilled avocado, and the sparkling wellness tea. Those were my favorites!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to find this restaurant in Phoenix! We like to eat 100% organic, and this place delivered excellent service, delicious food, and a really nice variety of dishes. The food was fresh and in season, and the servers were knowledgeable and very friendly. The parking is very easy and we were seated almost immediately. It would have been nice to have a little more intimacy, since the seating outside and inside is a fairly wide open floor plan. Also, since we are from NYC, we are used to the prices. However, I believe high quality food is worth the money. We felt great a long time after eating, not heavy or sleepy.  I'd highly suggest eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been to multiple locations and the food doesn't disappoint. Very consistent and service is great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! :) nice ambience, healthy food and friendly staff!  The place has this super clean and healthy vibe to it and when you eat your meal, you can very well tell it's healthy and fresh! I love the red chili noodles, which I think they call as pad-Thai now.  Perfect place for brunch or early evening!"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. Stay away. If you want to drop $70 on a kale salad hummus and iced tea do it."}
{"text":"Come on guys this place deserves a 1 star!!! service sucks !food sucks!! we paid $60 for two people and left not satified. Even my 100 year old grandma makes better food!!!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing and so was Hailey our server! My colleague and I ordered the edamame dumplings to start, which were amazing along with the skinny margaritas. I had the ancient greens and my colleague had the sausage pizza. Both cooked to perfection. I asked if the kale salad was good during our wait and she kindly brought me a small bowl to try! Super sweet. Overall, the best food and service I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Like the concept although somewhat contradictory. Food was over priced, service extremely underwhelming and beer/wine list poor and not even remotely local. The \"bar\" is laughable. Typical, pretentious, under-educated scene you would expect from a restaurant in a mall."}
{"text":"I love True Food's philosophy. It uses organic ingredients for necessary ingredients such as the dirty dozen and not for the clean 15 and so on. I love having nicer restaurants where I can go on nice dates or grab delicious drinks and I especially love being able to take my non-vegan friends here.   My favorites here are all the vegan options! That's the hummus (no cheese), lettuce cups, TLT, teriyaki brown rice bowl, and mushroom pizza without cheese (my vegetarian husband says it tastes better without the cheese anyway).  Drinks are all great, and the chia seed pudding is just the best! You can't go wrong with any of the options at True Food!"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch. I always start with the hummus, It is delicious and the pita wedges are fresh and you can tell they are made daily. For the entree, the turkey pita is my fav, and the Kale salad that accompanies the sandwich is a perfect compliment. The only drawback is the place is a bit loud and impersonal at lunch, not really ideal for intimate conversations or a business lunch. Overall it is a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I consider myself a pretty healthy eater but I was nervous when I read this menu. Thought wow is there anything on here my kids will eat and I'm starving need more than veggies. I ordered the street fare tacos 1 fish, 2 steak. The fish was ok but wow I loved the steak ones. The neat was perfectly cooked a medium rare, tender with just the right amount of veggies. I did say no cheese and sauces. I don't like my food flavors taken over with sauces. The corn tortillas tasted like sprouted corn not processed. The kids ordered chicken noodle soup and cheese pizza. The pizza looked great and they are every bite. The soup I would say noodles they just clumped together but the broth and chicken was on point. My husband said the chopped chicken salad and miso soup was yummy. The water is really good. Nice and clean and cold. We also ordered a lemonade it seemed to be sweetened with honey husband loved it. Best of all we felt good after we ate to go explore the museum district."}
{"text":"Their menu has so many excellent-sounding items, I had a very hard time deciding what to order. I gambled on one of their in-house juices (carrot-lemonade), and am so glad I did. I got the street tacos, and they were very tasty. I'm excited to see that they have locations in other cities; I'll be hunting them down to try more!"}
{"text":"True Foods, a name I'd heard seven million times before finally stopping in as a part of my \"AZ Healthfood Tour\", this was my first visit to the Phoenix location and this place had a lot of hype to live up to. Unfortunately my experience left a bad taste in my mouth. My experience started around 8 p.m. on a Thursday night, I was sat by the restroom by a young man that smelled terribly of B.O., myself and the young lady I was with spent quite a bit of time laughing about the \"V.I.P. restroom seat\" we got.....with a dining room full of open seating. We were on our way to a show and decided to have something we could split,as people who frequent the Scottsdale Quarter location, we decided to break our norm and try a Margherita pizza.... we'd come to regret this, as the pizza took much longer than it should have on a night as slow as this one, and when it did show up, it was burnt. Not even a passable \"well done\", just flat out burnt. When our waiter passed back by our table ten minutes later I called for him and let him know the pizza had \"missed its mark\" and was a little over done. He responds \"is it?\", now I smiled because it clearly  was not fit to feed to anything, let alone anyone. He takes the pizza and we are soon visited by a manager who let us know she would take care of it for us, and that she was sorry. Not long after our second attempt comes out, and its burnt.....again.... in their defense it wasn't as bad as the first one but was still not very pleasing. At this point its so bad its funny, so we order our favorite Banana and Coconut chia pudding and jasmine tea, which was exactly what we needed to sweeten our experience up a bit. We decided not to have the rest of the pizza and called it a night. All in all, its not the Scottsdale location, but that Chia Pudding is a highlight. Still a fan of the brand, just cant see myself coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I came here last spring while visiting my sister and her husband. I started off with a cucumber refresher. The name does it justice because it's very refreshing but a bit pricey so I only got one. For starters we had a bit of hummus that was actually very good and for entree we had spaghetti squash casserole and the teriyaki brown rice bowl with chicken. Both were very good. The service is pretty good too, it was a really big party and they were very accomodating.  The atmosphere is cool. The prices are a bit steep. The cucumber refresher was like $5 for a thin glass and the casserole was like $15 for a portion a bit bigger then a french onion crock bowl."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great place. The crunchy kale salad and spaghetti squash casserole are fantastic.   The best veggie food I have had in quite a while. Service was great:friendly and very helpful.  I don't understand some of the bad reviews. It was   3/4 full when we were there and service was fast and cheerful."}
{"text":"This place may be my very favorite restaurant in Phoenix! I've been here more times than I can count, and have LOVED everything I've ordered every single time. So many fresh, healthy options available, and they are so accommodating of vegetarian and vegan diets, BUT also have good options for carnivores (my huz is obsessed with their grass-fed burger). True Food Kitchen was a game-changer for me when I first tried their kale salad years ago. It was the kale gateway for me, and ever since, I have sung the praises to people who \"don't like kale\", that if they tried salad they would change their mind. I even found their recipe for the salad online, and have made it a million times at home since.... but I still keep coming back and ordering it here. I can't recommend True Food Kitchen enough... this is a happy place for me :)"}
{"text":"Why do they get 5 Stars you ask? Because they know how to feed you the right way. Put service and wait time aside, if we ate this way all day everyday, there would not be an epidemic of obesity, diabetes and clogged colon's here in America!  Yes their prices are high, they are always so packed it feels like your rubbing elbow's as you eat, BUT wat's most important is that their food is made of whole food ingredients, not canned, boxed, processed or pre made foods. They actually do it all right there in the dining room.  You will see them peeling fruits & vegetables right in front of you. It almost feels like we're all in the Kitchen.  What's good there? The Kayle salad W/Chicken, Kayle & mushroom pizza and the red curry chicken! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck! The portions were TINY and the food really wasn't all that good. My friend and I both agreed that we should've just gone to Paradise Bakery because at least then we wouldn't have gone hungry and saved money given what we spent at True Food. I know it's supposed to be \"healthy\" and such, but it doesn't mean it's supposed to be bland, boring, or otherwise a waste of my daily calorie count."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for work, and stopped here for dinner on the recommendation of a coworker.  A great recommendation it was!  I sat at the bar, and had excellent , fast, and friendly service.  I had the sea bass, and the honey lemonade, The sea bass fell apart in my mouth, it was flaky and the vegetables were perfect in flavoring and cooking consistency.  I savored every bite, and wished for a bigger glass of the lemonade.  The environment was cozy and clean and fresh.  I ate  my food as I just finished a hike, and was hungry.  I wanted more, but it was perfect, and I didn't really need more.  I think I'm going here every time I'm in Scottsdale now."}
{"text":"I stopped at True Food Kitchen with a girlfriend a few weeks ago in the Scottsdale Quarter.  We both started with a glass of wine and a generous portioned hummus appetizer. I then had a chicken salad and my girlfriend the tacos.  Everything was so deliciously organic and reasonably priced. I would definitely stop back for round two!"}
{"text":"Unique and familiar healthy options. I suggest the cucumber honey lemonade refresher, margarita pizza and strawberry rhubarb crisp. Friendly knowledgable staff in an open outdoor space."}
{"text":"This is one of my big favorites in the valley! Have been here a lot of times and will not get tired of coming back! =)  Refreshing and organic food, lovely ambiance...=) We fell in love with this place after our very first trip in their location in Biltmore. There was quite a wait but it was well worth it. If you are looking for a new refreshing taste with choices for vegan and gluten allergic people, this is the place to be! The concept does not stay away from making their food delicious while using the freshest and most organic ingredients. I love bragging this place both to our local and out-of-towner friends. I've tried a variety of what they have to offer in the menu but my favorites are the Tuscan Kale and Chicken Chopped Salad, all types of pizza esp the one with goat cheese and the spaghetti squash casserole which is very light and healthy! For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is just amazing! =) Service is fast and efficient. Pricing is fair plus they offer half order to some of the selection in the menu.   Great place for lunch and dinner! Will have to try their breakfast menu soon! =)"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot! Try the quinoa burger and the edamame dumplings! We visit every time we head to Phoenix/Scottsdale. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OK, this place is just a cool restaurant!  It has a very fun atmosphere that is laid-back and contemporary along with an \"I care about organic stuff\" attitude!   The food was very fresh and had lots of flavor!  I will be back to try more dishes.    Be sure to try their coffee which is some of the best I've had.  They make it especially unique by serving it to you in the Bodum double wall coffee cups."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen has me hooked!! The food here was delicious. I wish I had a True Food Kitchen back home in Chicago. The decor is modern, with a beautiful juice bar lined up with the most eye pleasing fruits and vegetables.  I had the mushroom miso soup with tofu, this was probably my favorite miso soup I ever had. The tofu teriyaki brown rice bowl tasted great. Tofu was made just right. The inside out quinoa burger is amazing, will be back just for that!  The service was wonderful, our server Brandon was awesome he did a fabulous job, very knowledgeable & informative about the menu & restaurant. Love the patio seating too."}
{"text":"I have eaten at both and love the one in the Quarter's atmosphere.  Surprised to see overweight wait staff in light of the healthy food served--Now they can get an education on nutrition and chase tables to become fit!  Most of the food served on the menu is stuff that I can purchase at Whole Foods and make on my own at home, however, the lasagna was awesome and a few other dishes that take time to create are worth indulging in.   I think Dr. Weil is Overrated and a hefty no-exercise pontificate, but it's a Fox Concept restaurant and I think they all about big business with lots of money. What are they doing about creating a greener environment?   I prefer to spread my earnings to independent small businesses. Too bad someone cannot succeed or create what you see in the organic and clean ingredient restaurants that are commonplace in California. Hmmm, I may just have a business plan after I finish paying the student loans..."}
{"text":"True Food has so much going for it - a well thought out menu, delicious flavor combinations, a killer kids' menu, and good service.    We've been many, many times, and have always enjoyed ourselves.  The Husband and I particularly like the menu coding system (vegetarian? gluten-free? you know EXACTLY what you can/can't order).  The mock-tails are deliciously refreshing... light, bright flavors that just taste good for you!  The Husband swears by the crudite appetizer... and even I, who doesn't always love the green things, really enjoyed it.  The curry dish is my personal fave, and the carne asada tacos are pretty darn good, too.  The kids' gluten-free pasta with red sauce, greens (kale??), and lots of cheese is enormous and totally worth the money.    A good stand-by place, especially when we're feeling like eatin' some healthy stuff :)"}
{"text":"The grapefruit martini was extra sweet, and the mint leaves were always getting sucked up. Meanwhile, the bartender appeared a little put off when I didn't want dinner from the menu, just a cocktail. Might try again, if I find myself in Scottsdale again..."}
{"text":"This is a tried and true place. Been many times over the years and it's always good. I actually love the vegetable crudités, essentially a giant bowl of delicious veggies and awesome dips. A little on the pricey side but not too bad."}
{"text":"The Food is incredible! Their Kale salad & Sweet Potatoes were delicious and I've never been a fan of either. I ordered the Inside Out Quinoa burger without the dairy, incredible taste, just awesome. They have gluten free options, vegan options, its a win win if you are health conscious."}
{"text":"This is a nice spot on the edge of a mall.  Headliner here is \"great food, but very very loud\" - so loud that you can't have a reasonable conversation over your meal.  I started with a drink - \"the natural\" - ginger, agave and soda.  This is a very refreshing drink.  I really wanted more, but it's a little expensive to have a lot of them.  We then moved on to an appetizer of caramalized onion tart, with smoked garlic, black fig & gorgonzola.  Again, very delicious, and definitely a keeper.  The main course was halibut street tacos, side of beans with cojita cheese and salsa.  These were just the right size for a lunch entree.    Everything has that organic thing going for it - fresh ingredients, well prepared.  If this place wasn't so loud, I would consider it for lunch every day I was in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and patio area. Its a great place to go to lunch with the girlfriends.  I like the whole concept of healthy organic foods. I wish more restaurants would incorporate this into their menu.  They have some really good juices and drinks. I feel like some of the items are a bit pricey. The salads are super fresh. The hummus was just okay... Would recommend as it is a great healthy concept."}
{"text":"Right in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter next to the movie theater and the kiddy splash pool. Place looks really cool with fresh herbs growing outside as you walk in and a big open kitchen you see once inside. The aroma of the food they are cooking is fantastic. I like the simplicity of the interior design as well as the cozy eating areas outside.  Ordered off the brunch menu today. Started with the Thai Shrimp Dumpling with Basil, Mint & Red Chili Sauce. The wife got the Breakfast Burrito with Egg, Turkey Sausage, Provolone, Anasazi Bean & Salsa. The daughter picked the Market Vegetable Scramble which was Sweet Potato Hash, Onion, Parmesan & Two Eggs. I ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken, Brown Rice, Potato, Broccoli, Ginger, Carrot, Mushroom & Coconut Shellfish Broth. Even tried out an Andy's Elixir drink with Sea Buckthorn, Agave Nectar & Soda.  We all generally agreed that the food lacked a level of flavor that could have been easily achieved with so many fresh items and the proper seasonings. With all the herbs growing around we expected more of them in the dishes. Would liked to have seen some Thai Basil in the Curry and maybe a little sprig of Mint in the drink, etc. The Eggs in the Burrito seemed a bit dry or overcooked and tasted chewy.  The service is very friendly and relatively quick. Our server looked like and sounded just like the guy in the movie Office Space but without the 37 pieces of flare. I told him that he was his twin double and he humorously giggled.  Very kid friendly. Bought the granddaughter in her stroller and they were most accommodating. They even hooked us up with some hot water to warm up her meal. Just wish it was a cup or a glass and not a bowl. Hmmm?  Lots of Gluten free Healthy items to pick from and several Vegan items if you wish. A little too Tready and way too much Spendy for this bad boy.  3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Yummy healthy food, consistently delicious! I never feel bad after eating here because I know I did something good for my body!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty!  Home grown vegetables and healthy.  The chicken curry is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place far exceeded my expectations! The food was incredible and so is the concept behind it! Spaghetti squash, pomegranate mojito, kids teriyaki and strawberry crumble...done for the night! I'm going to bed VERY happy. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this restaurant! So many great, healthy, options on the menu. We live almost 50 miles from this location in Queen Creek. We only wish they'd make one closer. We love bringing our little girl because in addition to their great kids menu, she can share our entrées and appetizers. Great drinks, dessert, and atmosphere. Bre was a wonderful server!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places when I'm in the mood to be healthy or just guilty because I ate horribly the day before.   During lunch hour, there is usually a wait so that's a bummer. On Saturdays, expect 25 min+ during lunch time.   We started with the cauliflower appetizer and both thought it was a good start. I've been on a cauliflower kick the past few months when we go out to eat so I thought it was good - not great.   I'm the type of person that likes a variety so that I can sample a bit of everything. So we shared the Grilled Chicken salad and the Spicy Noodle bowl with shrimp. The salad was refreshing and the farro gave it a nice texture. We enjoyed it and would order it again. The Spicy Noodle bowl is something I always order and I was a bit disappointed this time because the noodles seemed to be overcooked. Even though we had mushy noodles, it was still a great dish.   The weather is perfect right now to sit outdoors and people-watch so take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to begin. The ambience, the farm to table food, the menu itself, the well prepared food that comes to your table beautiful... just all amazing. Everything we ate rocked. Well done True foods, well done"}
{"text":"Traveling for work can be tough on the diet, but I know whenever I visit Gabi M in Phoenix there are healthy meals in store for me  And sure enough my first stop in Phoenix was oh so healthy True Foods.  We sat on their lovely heated patio (gotta love that in mid March) and enjoyed the veggie crudite appetizer.  They freeze the veggies to make them extra tasty...mmm.  There's all sorts of unique juice options on the menu and I opted for the Ginger Nojito, highly recommended by our waitress.  Liked it, a lot!  As for my main entrée it was a tough decision between the miso cod and the spaghetti squash casserole, but the squash was calling my way.  It was mixed with organic tomatoes, zucchini,  and lots of fresh mozzarella cheese. It was (almost) as tasty as a plate of spaghetti and definitely a lot healthier!  Rumor has it they may be opening other locations and I'm crossing my fingers one of those is in Chicago!"}
{"text":"You know, I have a bit of an issue with Fox restaurants in general.  They are all amazing to look at but the food is overpriced and frankly, mediocre.  True Kitchen lives up to the legacy. I'll certainly admit to being an avowed carnivore, I mean I'm the head cook on a competitive BBQ team-I love meat, but hey I will try anything. I went with a bunch of friends, it was one of their birthday dinners, and they are into the whole organic, vegetarian thing.  Perfect spot for them. The place is definitely cool with a great open atmosphere.  I tried their herb hummus for an appetizer which was okay, and the miso glazed black cod as an entree.  The cod was perfectly cooked, however the $22 price tag gets you a ~5 oz. portion with one baby bok choy and maybe two sliced mushrooms.  I didn't really get a big flavor impact either..."}
{"text":"I was a little worried when my friend suggested this place.  I knew it was \"healthy\" and thought it would be just salads and weird stuff. Ha ha However, it was very tasty and had a large selection of choices on the menu.  The onion tart was awesome; I had the mushroom pizza also excellent.  My friend had the pasta which was also good.   I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  I love their salads. Tried the farmers market salad today and it was so freshly and tasty, especially for summer!  I never feel guilty eating here - just wished it was closer!!"}
{"text":"We went to True Food on Camelback for lunch. My husband had the asparagusand smoked mozzarella pizza ($11) and I ordered the steak tacos ($14).  While the food was good, it lacked in flavor. I am sure the finest organic ingredients were used but the beans that accompanied my street tacos were probably the tastiest part of both meals.  For the price and the portion size I would not recommend the same things we ordered. It might be my fault for ordering the steak tacos at a \"shi-shi\" restaurant but to be fair at $14 I was expecting the best steak tacos I've ever had. I mean at least filet mignon quality meat. At best the meat was a crusty black-seared ribeye, which isn't bad but could easily be made at home.  Cheaper and tasty alternatives: Two Hippies Pizza Shack and America's Taco Shop, both not too far away."}
{"text":"Great place to eat....great food and service, however.....it was fairly comfortable when we sat down because the misters were on...then 1 person complained because the seat was wet when they sat down.....so the shut the misters off...no fans to move the air and then it just got claustrophobic...maybe they should have moved and let the other 50 people enjoy the misters...."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here it gets better! My favorite is the edamame dumplings as a appetizer! I wish it was a full course meal! The chicken chopped salad is really good too and the staff are wonderfully nice."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places in the valley. I have to say everything is as healthy as it gets. I love that they serve food based on the local market. If you are ever in town, and looking for a healthy and organic breakfast, lunch, or dinner this is the spot!! :)"}
{"text":"Service great, informative waiter. Food was amazing, tasty, healthy and unique. Atmosphere was also very good. Will definitely be going back if I can find one within close proximity to Philadelphia"}
{"text":"Today a friend and I went to True Foods for brunch.  The rancheros were dry and bland.  I had to ask for extra sauce.  My friend had the grilled chicken salad that she enjoyed.  I asked for a chicken salad to go, it was half the size as the salad served to my friend.  One brunch dish, two salads, two ice teas, $60!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to dine at True Food as part of Arizona Restaurant Week. We went during the week, so it was full, but not too busy. This restaurant had to be one of the best deals for all of Restaurant Week. In addition to the three courses, we also received a hummus appetizer for the table and each of us received one of their Natural Refreshers. The hummus plate was delish; the refresher was okay . . . I liked my wine better. =) Our server was very nice and super knowledgeable without being pushy.  There were four of us at the table and we each ordered something different so everyone could try as much as possible. I am so glad we did this! My appetizer was the Smoked Salmon, which was great with the wasabi peas. The Summer Chopped Salad was delicious and so large it could have been a meal! I did not order the Edamame Dumplings because the description did not sound interesting to me, however when I tried them I was surprised at all of the flavor from one dumpling.   On to the second course. The Gluten Free Spaghetti was good, as was the Tofu Curry. The Black Cod was all right too. My Steak Tacos, on the other hand, were fabulous! Steak was perfect; the beans that came with it were ok.  Dessert was the best! We tried four of them; my favorites (in order) were The Banana Chocolate Tart (very rich, must share), the Apple-Cranberry Crumble (the maple ice cream really makes the dish), the Lemon-Ginger Frozen Yogurt (sweet, tart, and cold), and the Lemon Olive Oil Cake (very light, fluffy, and delicious)!  Not sure how soon I will make it back as it is not an easy drive for me, however if someone else is planning an outing, I would love to go!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a colleague on Friday. Ordered their non alcoholic sparkling green tea, which is phenomenal! Also enjoyed the salmon kale salad. Everything was good, but for lunch the timing seemed off. We were waiting a bit for the check and for boxes etc. They were pretty busy so no harm no foul, but if you're in a hurry keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"AWESOME Food!  one of my fav places in Scottsdale.  I prefer the Biltmore location because the Quarter can be a bit too snooty / congested for me.  But both locations are great and highly recommended."}
{"text":"True Foods, love your concept - your food is pretty stellar too...however, I think you should consider either lowering your prices or bulking up your plates.  Regardless of the portion size and obesity issues in the U.S. you're healthy food isn't as filling as it should/could be.  I ordered the Tuscan Salad with chicken and my dining companion opted on ordering the edamame dumplings for our starter.  I enjoyed both of the items but didn't feel full (once again, I know it seems like I'd be a hefty gal after all my restaurant reviews and portion size issue but that's not the case!)  I'll end this review on a good note and say the latte that I had after my meal was incredibly, raw sugar cube and all.  Hope this helps with your decision to dine or dash, if you're feeling a lighter fare with meager portions this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I stopped coming here for months after they took the pan seared seabass off the menu.  Back in tonight.  Glad its back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Kale salad is amazing! One of my favorite for healthy dining!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time this mothers day. The server was knowledgeable, suggestive and friendly. The place is super clean. The food was great! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the portion sizes did not make up for the pricing."}
{"text":"Ok first off, with the demise of Soma and the fact that Green is in Tempe.....this place is a welcome sight, and I know I'll be back. The food is excellent. However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one \"Anazazi Beans\" and a drink called the \"Medicine Man\"? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means \"ancient enemy\" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.  I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for health-conscious, fresh food. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and the staff is so great. They're prompt, attentive, and helpful with the menu. The bison burger is a must do for the meat eaters, and the market salad for the vegetarians (or someone looking for a great green). Hummus and pitas are my go-to starter. You will NOT regret this. Worth the wait every time."}
{"text":"I really really liked True Food but they changed their menu and it's not as good anymore. I used to love coming here but now I may not come back due to the menu change. The service is always top notch though! Please bring back the Hangover Rx drink and other menu items!"}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS DIVINE. I seriously died and went to heaven. Can I eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day? I am a healthy foodie and this place meets all my needs. I get anxiety eating out because I always worry about food quality eating out but I know I am getting the best of the best and it tastes good too!"}
{"text":"Don't order take out. There portions are so small. I was really disappointed. My chicken was literally raw inside, the service was crap, they forgot my dressing. All I ordered was sides and a piece of grilled chicken. Simple enough...I thought. Stick to the other location till they get all there kinks worked out.   The Biltmore location is much more laid back and not nearly as trendy and wannabe hollywood.  The waitstaff is much more together and the portions are consistent. Im staying with that location."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm changing my review is for the best waiter ever. Seriously. I have never had service in Arizona as good as his. John is an amazing waiter who clearly takes pride in his work. This to me is hard to come by. When you get good service it just makes everything taste better :)  My mom and I are very picky eaters...no oils, no dairy, no wheat or gluten. He was very understanding and didn't make us feel like changing around the menu was a bother (it has to be). He was on top of everything. Anticipated every want or need.   If you eat here, ask to sit in Johns section. It will be a great experience!"}
{"text":"Of course, everyone was likely on their best behavior the night a friend and I tried True Food because Dr. Weil was sitting at the table next to us.  So the service we experienced could not have been better...and I love it when food is served \"complimentary.\"  Love it.  To tell you the truth, I do not remember the prices, I remember the food.  I loved that the meal and pairings choices were different, and I have never had better fish anywhere.  It was so wonderfully flavorful!  The restaurant is clean and sparse, yet beautiful, and not pretentious by any means.    I will return!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I usually avoid any restaurants that have gluten free or veggie friendly menus since I'm as true as a carnivore as you can get.  However, this place has absolutely amazing food, service, and drinks.  It's a relaxing atmosphere with fresh, healthy food that doesn't sacrifice flavor or appetite.  Both alcoholic drinks and nonalcoholic drinks are equally superb!"}
{"text":"Very clean food! Fun atmosphere. We sat outside but if you are inside you can see the whole kitchen! Which I find to be pleasantly comforting. Our table ordered the kale salad, delicious, fresh, great portion size!  We also had the dumplings with creamy edamame inside. Heavenly! We ordered the carrots cooked to perfection! I also tried their chipotle Bloody Mary... it's intense but midway through my drink I was sold! Finally we ordered the chocolate vegan cake with coconut ice cream cake. It  was out of this world! Clean and delicious comes to mind with this restaurant. Also this is a fox restaurant chain so if you work for any of their other restaurants you are eligible for a discount. I would definitely return when visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Really great food ad they cater to customers like me with dietary restrictions. I will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went here for a date night and I was blown away with how amazing this place is. It was our first time visiting the Scottsdale quarter. We were able to make a reservation online through open door. When we first arrived we were instantly greeted and sat within a few minutes. You can see the kitchen from inside the restaurant which I really liked and all of the fresh ingredients that they use. The waitress (Tiffany) was so friendly and attentive the whole time. I had the curry dish with chicken and shrimp and my husband ate the margarita pizza! They were both so delicious. I also tried the sangria cocktail and it was amazing! The food came out within ten minutes of ordering which never happens at any of the places that we eat lol. We will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about over FOX Restaurants to me they are just ok but my recent experience at True Foods was so bad by the end of the night I just had to laugh. First off the Hostess never even looked up to greet us. And when we told her how many in the party her reply was \"well dammit\" -really I though her job was to greet us not be a brat. It took 15min for us to be greeted at the table by the waiter. When our food came the bread was so hard that I could not even eat my sliders. Then I noticed a long black hair in my Sweet potato hash. I called over the waitress and showed it to her and explained that the bread was stale. Her response was \"what would you like me to do--bring you a new bun?\" I politely requested some Hash w/o hair and said I would just  eat the tuna  w/o bread. She took my plate and returned it with only ONE slider--I had only had a bit out of one! She jipped me! We paid left our food and got out of there.  If I'm going to pay this much for food I would rather go somewhere else. If you are looking for healthy food try Seasons 52. We went last week and it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Another good Fox Concept! Great to being your vegan or vegetarian friends along."}
{"text":"I won't give them Five Stars only because they kept forgetting my coffee and I was pretty much Hangry and hadn't had any coffee that day yet. But there food was FANTASTIC. A friend and I shared the salad that was the Autumn Salad? ( I forgot the name) Once we got the coffee (which was also delicious) I was in bliss. The place was pretty spacey and the staff was nice. We got the flourless chocolate cake and that was absolutely heavenly. I will for sure be going back"}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times and the reason I keep coming back is their bison burger. Other than that, I feel like everything else I've tried is pretty bland. They do have a cucumber drink and that's really good, but I feel like I can finish my drink in 10 seconds, half the glass is filled with ice. It does have a nice vibe though, feel like I'm in California."}
{"text":"I have avoided this place since it opened, because I was worried that it was too much of a scene.  I really just want to eat good food, and I don't care about who else is eating around me.  Anyway, I was wrong to avoid True Food.  I went for the first time last night, and it was terrific.  The food was great--not too fussy or freaky, but just yummy.  We had a mushroom pizza and soup.  We sat on the patio, which was very nice at this time of year.  But best of all was the service.  I don't usually gush over waiters, but ths group was terrific--attentive, kind, helpful, but not in-your-face.  Just great.  If you like green tea, the iced green tea here is a winner."}
{"text":"The menu changes with the season. I have food allergies and the wait staff is always helpful. The pizzas are great, the salads are transcendental. The lemon bars are amazing."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about True Foods a couple of months ago and it wasn't in their favor. I received a very nice email from them advising that my review was appreciated and while I didn't have a great experience, they would certainly like me to give their establishment another shot. After all, they pride their restaurant in great customer service and excellent food quality and they want their guest to return. I was provided a gift card to try it again and today was the day for me to see if my last experience was a fluke or if my experience was not uncommon.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly smile and immediate service. Already a better experience. I ordered the same thing as last time, grass-fed beef with no mayo nor bun and a kale salad without breadcrumbs. My food swiftly came out, but when I bit into the medium burger their was an abundance of char. Since I know that some restaurants like to char their burgers I asked the bartender if this was the way the burger was supposed to be cooked. It was cooked medium, as I asked, it was just charred on the outside. He immediately took my plate, apologized and advised he would get me a new dish. That was not my intention, but the proactivity and eagerness to please his customer was apparent. Within a short time a manager, named Desiree, approached me with my new order and graciously thanked me for my patience and apologized for how my previous burger came out. When I placed my cards on the table to pay the tab, I was brought a check without an amount due. Desiree again approached me thanking me for coming in.  I can tell you that my experience today was one that I will always remember, in a positive way. It's not about them taking care of the tab, it's 100% about the fact that my bartender took ownership without me asking for my burger being sent back, the manager apologizing for the mistake, my second meal tasting absolutely amazing, and having an optimal customer experience. I will be back and hope that others will read this review and give True Foods a try.  Well done, True Foods! Thank you for an amazing customer experience and a delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and got the following:   Butternut Squash pizza (smoked onion, organic kale, vegan almond ricotta, dried cranberry)  House-Made Chicken Sausage pizza (organic tomato, roasted fennel, scamorza)  Ancient Grains bowl (miso glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snow pea, grilled portobello, avocado, hemp seed)  Grass-Fed Burger (umami mushroom, caramelized onion, arugula, Parmesan, mayonnaise, flax seed bun) with side of Sweet Potato Hash   The Butternut Squash pizza was amazing - was very impressed by the vegan almond ricotta. House-Made Chicken was average, as was the burger and Sweet Potato Hash (bit dry). The bowl was mediocre and small on the portion side. Wish the glazed sweet potatoes were cooked a bit more. Overall, an okay experience. Maybe better if we dined in."}
{"text":"Yes...it's true, I found this place after devouring 8 Krispy Kremes over the weekend!  The visit was a detox! I searched for a place to dine where I would feel healthy and guilt-free after a weekend of indulgence, and I felt like I was dining with Bugs Bunny after I was served a heaping of fresh veggies...aka Crudités.  Then came the fresh fruit \"elixir\"...the Cucumber & Honey Lemonade...awwww  Oh, the Turkey Lasagna w/Spinach wasn't bad either.  The servers were friendly, and the atmosphere refreshing - like the drinks (non-alcoholic...this time) ;-)  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite places!  The service is awesome and all the waiters I've had have been cool and competent.  The food is creative and healthy, and they have a smart menu with a variety of great choices, vegan and otherwise.  I can't get enough of this place and will be returning often!"}
{"text":"This place really paid attention to details and flavor.  I would recommend the Bison short ribs and the brown rice teriyaki bowl.... DELICIOUS!!! Atmosphere- open and casual.  SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING!!!"}
{"text":"Been to True Food on several  occasions. The service is very good and people are friendly.   I appreciate healthy meals and their menu has a lot of good choices.  For a normal guy, the portions are pretty small.  So I always leave hungry.  I wouldn't mind ordering additional appetizers or entrees, but the prices are high for the portion sizes served.   It can be a little pretentious, but in general I enjoy the atmosphere.  Probably not go back."}
{"text":"I must say I loved the food. Just didn't like the after effects. went with a group of 4. all samples the shrimp dumplins, Edamame dumplins, tasted the sashimi salad, I ordered the Sea Bass Street tacos. All was tasty - Sea bass slightly over cooked. Service was weak at the start and ok at the end. The highlight was the Edamame dumplings...but I've got to tell you...I have paid for it ever since. 3 of the 4 people had stomach issues and it isn't pretty if you know what I mean. Now 24 hours after and I still am on the pot...healthy food certainly cleans you out."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place since I moved to Scottsdale. I love the location within Scottsdale Quarter. I went on a Friday around 5pm and there was no wait.  My husband had a gluten intolerance so we were pretty excited by their menu. Hubby ordered the turkey lasagna and it was a big portion and he liked it!  I ordered the winter salad that I liked, but I didn't love it. I prefer the version you can get a sauce down the street. We did order the honey lemonade which we sent back. Did not like that at all. I like honey,  but it was too much.  The kids cheese pizza was delicious and so was my grapefruit martini - both wins. I like True Kitchen and will go back."}
{"text":"Where do I start?!  The True Food Kitchen is superb. It all started with the fresh house made juice. I chose the \"Kale Aid\" .  I thought it was very hydrating and delicious all at the same time. At first look I thought it would be a vegetarian rest. but it's actually more of a \"anti-inflammatory\" restaurant where they focus on healthy dishes that do more good than harm on your body. A nutritionist by the name of Dr Weil is the founder. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. We sampled multiple dishes. One that I ordered was called \"Panang Curry\". If you like thai peanut sauce get this. Overall...great experience. Thanks Dr Weil!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox is a genius.  Period.  I have been to several Fox restaurants (Blanco, Culinary Dropout, Sauce, North, The Greene House, Zinburger) and not a single one has left me disappointed.  My boyfriend and I have eaten at True Food Kitchen at least a dozen times, and every time the food and service is outstanding.  I love the seasonal change of menu items, including the beverages. During the fall, they had a cinnamon grapefruit soda which was surprisingly delicious (I had never had cinnamon in a cold, bubbly beverage before), and most recently I had the strawberry rhubarb soda. The cucumber refresher is the best drink on the menu. It is exactly as it's name states: refreshing and so, so delicious.  We always get the herb hummus and the edamame dumplings for starters.  The hummus has a great flavor and is served with warm pita bread and a small blend of onion, cucumber, feta and black olives. The dumplings are nice and light, they make a perfect appetizer.  The pizzas are great, the chicken chopped salad and autumn ingredient salad are both delicious and have just the right amount of dressing.  My boyfriend has had the bison burger and thought it was alright.  I didn't try it, but the sweet potato hash that it came with was really good.  He has also had the rainbow trout and loved it.  More often than not, he orders the street tacos with steak and clears his plate within five minutes. The roasted chicken, turkey lasagna or spaghetti squash casserole are perfect if you're looking for some comfort food.    If you love this restaurant, I highly recommend picking up the True Food cookbook.  The hummus, chicken chopped salad and spaghetti squash casserole are just a few of the many recipes you can find in the book.    This is by far our favorite restaurant in the valley.  I only wish they would open one in Salt Lake City so we can get our fix once we move in a few months!"}
{"text":"VERY nice staff! Prices are reasonable for \"healthy\" food. Lots of options and alternatives. We went there for a celebration of friends and their medical school accomplishments and arrived about an hour before closing. Our waitress was very accommodating. We stayed till well passed closing and they folks were great about it. I have been to the one in Newport beach and had a similarly nice experience."}
{"text":"Had turkey burger with kale salad and sweet potato hash.   Turkey was moist and had tomato, onion, cheese, avocado, and a jalapeno sauce on it. The kale salad was also great. My sweet potato was a little salty for my taste, but honestly everything else was on point.   Service was quick and polite. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian and the bison burger is outstanding. Kale salad is very good as well."}
{"text":"True Food serves up some bougie, and supposedly healthy, options.  Their dishes look and taste great.  I really enjoyed my tuna sliders with sweet potato hash and kale. However, portions are small and you'll get hungry again sooner than you should for the price you pay. Know this going in and you won't be disappointed. Nice to see cooks prepping your fresh veggies out in the open.  Our server started off doing a good job, but then disappeared somewhere so we had to flag down other servers.   Overall, this was a good place to try one time but it won't be on my list of regulars."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I got the Mediterranean chicken pita and it was so delicious and healthy. I love having healthy options that also feel like comfort food. The service was great too, no complaints! I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place. I have taken so many people here and the response has been unanimous: cool atmosphere and AMAZING food. This place is great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Don't be surprised if you have to wait.  I love the natural refreshments like \"the natural,\" fresh ginger + agave + soda. I always get the harvest chopped salad because it is so yummy. i always try and push myself to order something other than the organic ricotta ravioli because i should try other dishes. But it's difficult!  The ravioli is scrumptious!  Like, lick the plate good.   My only complaint is the dessert. I had the flourless chocolate cake.  It tasted like burnt cake, and the chocolate used is the unsweetened chocolate so it was kind of bitter-tasting. May be some people's thing, but I wasn't into it. I've heard other desserts like the Banana Chocolate Tart is quite delicious, so don't let this one thing deter you from coming here.    Take a walk through the garden they have out front. The plants are labeled and it's nice to see what sorts of herbs they grow and use in the kitchen. This place is truly about fresh, natural, good-for-you ingredients. Do yourself a favor and come here!"}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix on Friday as part of a weekend road trip get away and decided to eat here as we had to make a stop at the Apple store in this mall. I've heard of true food kitchen but have never eaten at any of the locations. I would give the food here 4 stars, ambience about a two or three star because I'm not really into the pretentious mall dining scene. So let's talk about the food. They have terrific vegan options and the menu is highly based off of an anti-inflammatory diet. I ordered the TLT which is tempeh lettuce and tomato in which the tempeh is made to be like bacon. This sandwich was absolutely delicious! I got it with a side of kale salad which had a light citrusy dressing. Also had the cauliflower appetizer that had a creamy Harissa and tahini sauce. I'll definitely go to true food kitchen locations at other places, I know that there's some in orange county which I'm usually around that area every month or so."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant.  Every time I have walked by it, there are tons of people eating there.  Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is very trendy and so are the patrons.  The food is just NOT GOOD and the entrees are OVERPRICED!  I went for brunch this past Saturday. The market scramble was highly recommended by the waitress as being \"out of this world.\"  I took her recommendation, and what I was ultimately served was an egg with a couple pieces of zucchini and onion over undercooked chopped sweet potato \"Hash\".  There was no symphony of tastes, in fact \"bland\" and/or \"flavorless\" are quite  appropriate adjectives.  No one at the table finished all of their meals, and not because the portion size was too big.  Everyone had the same opinion of the food. It was a complete disappointment for the party of 3, and worse yet, the check with tip was over $50 (and no, we did not  order any alcoholic beverages--just 2 coffees and a diet Pepsi).  The food was not good.  I don't know what the allure of this place is.  Its my guess that some people want to see and be seen when they have lunch; I prefer to have a good meal that tastes good and  not  to feel like I am being robbed when it comes time  to pay the bill.  Next time I'm at the Scottsdale Quarter/Kierland, I'm going to P.F. Chang's for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is really over-hyped.  We had the edmame dumplings (not sure of the exact spelling !) for starters.  We got four bland flat dumplings filled with some paste and floating in soy I think.  It was really tasteless. Then I asked the server for his recommendation.  He asked us to go for the chicken chopped salad.  The salad was really ordinary. . Lots of cheese blocks..and it was 14$ !!!  I think this restaurant tries too hard to be like the 'hipster' places in san Francisco.  Disappointed !"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a meal! The food here is satisfying and filling. Can't go wrong with the Tuscan Kale, Sashimi Tuna, Roasted Chicken or the Spaghetti Squash. For dessert, try the Banana Chocolate Tart and the Apple Crisp with Pecan Maple ice cream. YUM!"}
{"text":"My friend and I got here about 1pm and it was BUSY. They told us the wait would be 40 minutes, but we actually waited 60 minutes before being seated. The people at the front apologized and tried to explain why it was such a long wait, but I didn't fault them. It was busy and a nice day. People probably wanted to sit for a while and enjoy their lunch!   My friend and I both ordered a cocktail. A pineapple drink and I ordered a cucumber citrus margarita. My drink was stronger than I thought it would be, but it was still refreshing and good.   We ordered the kale avocado dip to start. Boy, was that dip delicious!!! We both split the Mediterranean salad and the quinoa burger. Both dishes were delicious. The salad was refreshing and light. The burger was definitely filling. I loved the hummus on top of the burger. With the burger, they let you have half of the sides they offer. So, I got half kale salad and half sweet potato hash. The kale salad had a sweet flavor to it, you can taste the lemon. It was delicious. The sweet potato hash was definitely good. I ended up mixing the hash and kale together. Yum!!   For dessert, we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. OMG!! There was Carmel at the bottom of the cake and it was topped with vanilla ice cream. The flavors mixed extremely well together.   I enjoyed this place so much, I'm actually coming back for dinner tomorrow with my sister-in-law, so she can taste how amazing this place was! Also, I REALLY want to try their chia pudding!"}
{"text":"Great choices for all food lovers! Great way to introduce vegan and vegetarian options for the weary. Friendly service and nice dining on the patio."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time there for lunch. I had heard very good things about the food . My daughter and I had a guacamole & kale appetizer that was delicious. I ordered street fish(bass) tacos ,that were very good. A little on the plain side.  My daughter had a curry and brown rice dish she said was good. We had a lemon chia cake that was good but not very sweet. I'd like to try more of their entrees! Everything was very fresh.  Our waitress was excellent."}
{"text":"I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food. I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options, which is an odd (in a good way) feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out. I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices, but overall I really like this place and will come back. The atmosphere is great and service is attentive. I had:  - Herb hummus: Regular hummus dressed up with greek crudites (olives, cucumber, tomato, feta, etc) served with yummy soft pita bread. This is a great app to share. - Meditterean Salad: Like two meals in one. It was mostly quinoa and my only complaint is that it should come with with more lettuce/arugula or be relabeled as a Quinoa Salad. There were tons of yummy feta and marcona almonds which with the quinoa made a very filling meal. - Strawberry seasonal soda: Yum - fruity and spritzer and so refreshing! Kind of pricey at $4 with no refill, but so perfect for a warm summer day."}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong with this place especially if you have dietary restrictions. On my birthday I did a triathlon and came here with family after to celebrate. The service was exceptional and they brought out a complimentary vegan dessert. I would recommend the Teriyaki Bowl for a good nutritious lunch that keeps you energized through out the day.The management here knows how to keep customers happy/returning."}
{"text":"Great feel, good food best humus ever. A little on the pricey side but I will be back"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time yesterday.  I  loved the food and the environment!  This is the only real healthy food restaurant that I know of in Phoenix.  It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is got to be one of the most delicious places I have ever been to. The food is so fresh it's unbelievable!!! They just do such an amazing job with the food and the quality of food!! Absolute amazing!!! I will take my friends family and everybody I know to this place"}
{"text":"Three stars means A-OK, and that's exactly what this was.    Ambiance and service were spot on, as were menu choices.  But the food, for me, just didn't deliver.  Began with the carmelized onion tart and the hummus.  Both were good --and both made interesting by the addition of figs.  But neither were that interesting, or that big.  I hemmed and hawed over several nice vegetarian/vegan options and decided on the teriyaki tofu.  Big mistake, I think.  It tasted like soy and sesame, and veggies and rice.  All good things but all completely identical to most of my weeknight meals at home.  I sat there eating it wondering why I'd come to a restaurant to eat a fairly standard stir fry tofu.  I also didn't like the banana chocolate dessert.  Way too sweet!  So why the three stars?  Like I say, service and ambiance were perfect.  And I really liked the wine our server recommended --an organic red from Spain.  My mom and aunt loved their meals, and my mom's dessert --an apple and cranberry crumble, was heaven!  So I guess, truth be told, I'm blaming myself.   Dang, though, usually I nail it when it comes to ordering something that will satisfy me!"}
{"text":"this place has delicious options. ive never had something i dont like here. service is good too but one busy days the wait can be unreasonably long. i try to eat here when i know they are not too busy because of their location inside a mall, it does tend to attract a lot of people. the only thing i wish they would do was to make their portion sizes a bit bigger. i order a meal and salad everytime i come and finish it all only to feel somewhat satisfied. ive never left stuffed from this restaurant before which sometimes i wish i had for as delicious their food was. oh also! their drinks are delicious. and i dont mean the alcoholic kind. their juice concoctions are great. but again, the portion sizes are teeny tiny mojito style glasses. and they are also filled with ice cubes. i finish those delicious fuckers with only a few sips and im not a big gal. if i wanted to i could go through three of those per meal."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Everything was so fresh and clean!!!  Best green iced tea ever! I could eat here every single day. Healthy food and good cocktails what's not to like?!"}
{"text":"True Food is awesome! It inspires me to dissect their recipes and try to cook like this at home.   True food offers a variety of healthy, delicious choices. We started with the Summer Chopped Salad with a nice, light but flavorful vinaigrette dressing. It was a good mix of greens, snap peas, strawberries, walnuts, and goat cheese. It was a good-sized portion for a starter salad.   I opted for the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. I love it and saved the rest for lunch! My handsome dining partner tried the Natural Pan Roaster Chicken with asparagus, fennel, and farro. It was drizzled with a light sauce and was very tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.   So believe it or not, we had room for dessert and tried the Apple-Cranberry Crumble with dairy-free maple flavor ice cream. I should have skipped the salad and had two of these! We also tried the Lemon Cake with Strawberries and Greek Yogurt. That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert.   Other than the awesome food, the service was friendly and attentive. I love the decor as well. True Food Kitchen has an open floor plan (that never seems too loud) and a nice patio.   I would highly recommend! I've dined at True Food several times and have always left satisfied. On other visits, I've tried a variety of their cocktails and enjoyed them. The Teriyaki Brown Rice with Asian Veggies is also great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed the food here. I'm not even embarrassed to say we ate here 3 of the 5 nights we were in Scottsdale. It's so nice to have quality ingredients and healthy options prepared with so much flavor. We ate something different every night and both the service and the food never wavered. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would. Starting with impeccable service. Gina and Chris at the counter.  Supercool place. All fresh. Love the prep on the main floor. Menu has a wide variety of choices. Started with a fresh squeezed juice. Cucumber n lemon juice. Yum!  For my lunch as the recommendation came from Gina-the kale salad topped with steelhead trout. When told it tastes like salmon I was on board. Amazing. Perfectly served and the steelhead was grilled to perfection.  Next who can resist the dessert menu. Normally I do. But was swayed by Chris to choose the banana and chia pudding. It's topped with toasted almonds. To die for. Restaurant is bustling. Seating in and outside.  Can't wait to come back. See pics"}
{"text":"My sisters and brother came here on a Wednesday night. Our waiter was very friendly and explained the menu items in detail. The green tea arnie is delicious as well as the seasonal sparkling tea. The drinks are small but really good.  For appetizer we shared the hummus and pita plate and the tuna. The pita was so soft and delicious! They gave us free refills of pita which was awesome.   We got the curry, teriyaki bowl, chili shrimp with soba noodles, and a bison burger. The curry was not very spicy and was heavy on the coconut milk. The teriyaki bowl was very good as well as everything else! Amazing food all around for sure. The burger was very light and yummy.  For dessert we had the chocolate cake, strawberry rhubarb crumble, and the lemon pie. All were very good but the chocolate cake was extremely small. The others were a perfect size. The best was the coconut whipped cream on the lemon pie! So good!  Great service, great food, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Always great food here. We try to eat only organic and gluten free so True Foods caters to that! We are from out of town but always stop in here for quality tasty food."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the Biltmore.  The restaurant  was nice and clean  . Staff was friendly.  We tried their soup . It was very grainy . It had their  spicy noodles  with. Chicken.  It was a little  on the oily side but I did like the combination  of cashews  and vegetables.  They did leave off the periods. Portions  were a little  on the small size"}
{"text":"This was the one place we wanted to try while we were out here in AZ. My fiance is a Dr. Weil fan and he had eaten at this restaurant many moons ago. He has since raved about the Kale salad here. A few years down the road I finally had the opportunity of eating here myself.  We had lunch one day and dinner the following day. For lunch I had their Street Tacos with  grass fed beef. They were delicious. Perfect size and very filling. Alongside that I had the Kail-Aid. It was very refreshing and had a nice ginger taste that lingered after every sip. My fiance had the Kale salad and added the Grilled chicken. The chicken was to die for. I had never tasted grilled chicken like that before.   The following night we enjoyed dinner here. I had the Turkey lasagna and my fiance had the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  I LOVED my lasagna. It was hearty and rich, the flavors blended perfectly. I tried the Spaghetti Squash that was also mouth watering. It had a bit of a crunch to it, which I actually enjoyed. Again it was also very hearty and filling. We split a kale salad that complimented the rich flavors of our main entree.   Overall the food was absolutely fantastic here. The atmosphere is spot on. The service is perfect. I did not have a single complaint except that the prices are a bit high but you are paying for quality ingredients. Next time I want to try the breakfast menu. Can they please bring one to STL???"}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere and the food is delicious. They make sure to serve the best quality food that is raised in a humane and sustainable way. I really dig it."}
{"text":"If you like eating healthy, this place is a must. Delicious food, kind wait-staff, and fast service made my experience awesome!"}
{"text":"True Food is a true find in the heart of Scottsdale Quarter.  Great atmosphere, good service and delicious food.  A delight for all your senses. The draw for me was the organic, healthy menu options.  Trying to eat veggies, protein and low carb can be a challenge in any restaurant.  True Food made it easy. We enjoyed fresh juice at the center bar area while we waited a short fifteen minutes for our table.  I loved the Kale Aid juice.  A delight lay refreshing blend of kale, apple and celery. We were then escorted to a table where we ordered the crudite. An amazing assortment of romaine leaves, green beans, mini bell peppers, radishes, carrots, cauliflower and purple broccoli (a first for me, my new favorite veggie!) all served in a bowl of ice for fresh crispness.  The accompanying dips of kalamata olive and cucumber yogurt were perfect. Don't get me wrong, meat eaters and carb lovers will be as happy with the menu options as I was for the healthy selections.  My brother in law devoured the grass fed bison burger with a side of kale salad.  My sister and Dad loved the margherita pizza with fresh basil.   Mom ordered the seafood Caldo and raved about it.  Our waitress was happy to accommodate my request for substituting the sesame noodles made of pasta with the low carb shiritaki noodles in the red chile shrimp entree.  It was the best shrimp dish I've ever eaten.  With all the fresh veggies, I didn't miss the carbs at all. Foodies will not be disappointed in True Food."}
{"text":"I probably go to True Food way more often than I should. It's my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far! I've never ordered something from here and not liked it. It's vegan friendly, while still being appealing to those hearty meat eaters out there too!"}
{"text":"Food I terrific.  I especially enjoy the TLT!  The tempeh, lettuce, tomato & avocado sandwich is out of this world.  The teriyaki brown rice bowl is another favorite.  The staff are very knowledgeable about the menu and have been spot on in their recommendations to us.  The large restaurant allows for communal dining if you are feeling adventurous and want to meet new people.  otherwise, there are plenty of comfortable tables to enjoy a quiet meal alone.  The drinks are unique and seasonal.  And the best part is that they don't up-charge you for preparing healthy food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Great location in Scottsdale Quarter!! So much good food I have to try something new every time I go! They have the most amazing seasonal sodas  and other unique beverage creations. Their portions are good sized so you are not stuffed or overwhelmed with food. I have always had attentive servers and a great experience. Their outdoor patio has heaters too if you like to eat outdoors during the winter months. Great organic options to appeal to all food types!!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious, I am excited to go back and try more. My son really loved their pizza, and he never eats pizza. We enjoyed their selection of unique beverages, but the lemonade was too tart for my kids. Unfortunately, there was not anything on the dinner menu that interested my husband.   The wait staff was so very friendly. All of them had smiles on their faces and looked like they really enjoyed their jobs."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals so far while traveling in Phoenix! It's definitely a healthy option for those looking for that type of food. And I must say everything we tasted was super delicious!   The atmosphere was a nice site to see; open concept with lots of seating inside and out. I was told there a smaller room near the pack for small parties. But I just loved how open the space was with high ceilings. And the place always is busy! Luckily our dinner around 8 PM was too busy and got a seat right away. You can see into the kitchen and work area of the workers, which made it seem like a place you can learn cooking or you're on a cooking show!  For starters, a friend recommended the shiitake lettuce cups, and it was amazing! There was some spice to it, but we devoured the bowls. The mix was Shiitake mushrooms, jicama, sambal, cashews, and Thai basil -- served with an unlimited bowl of lettuce cups/leaves.  I ordered the lasagna bolognese -- fennel chicken sausage, mushrooms, spinach, lemon ricotta, herbs, and accompanied by marinara sauce. My food was gone in a flash -- another amazing dish. My friend ordered the Inside Out Quinoa burger which, instead of buns, used two dense quinoa patties.   It's a must try and see restaurant! Definitely worth the price and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We ordered four dishes and all of them were fantastic! Service was outstanding from start to finish. A must eat!"}
{"text":"Tonight's service was excellent. I would recommend getting table under Tony. He was really friendly compared to other servers at True Food Kitchen.  I have been to TFK a few times now. I always get the Organic Corn & Eggplant Pizza and Herb Hummus. Both great vegetarian dishes. Also, the Albacore Tataki is super delicious. My first time trying it and the best comparison I can think of would be ceviche.  Tried the Summer Seafood Bouillabaisse. It's French, but smells and taste like Indian."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there today and I have to say that we absolutely loved it! Great location and love the outdoor covered seating! Excellent food. The Thai Shrimp dumplings were a hit as were the Spicy Miso Edamame! The beautiful wife had a tasty sashimi tuna salad -- a bit plain but still good. I had the Spicy Red Chili Shrimp noodles! It was very tasty! So many wonderful things on the menu; all pretty healthy too! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, great with GF, and wonderful heated patio. One of my favorite places year round!"}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I took clients here for dinner one night, and I think we found it to be an enjoyable evening.  Everything tastes quite fresh. I had a very nice sushi appetizer, which was fashioned as more of a salad, and the ahi sliders. We had some cocktails before ordering wine, and the cucumber-clementine margarita is extremely refreshing in the warm, open-air atmosphere.  Two little drawbacks -- first, I think the ahi sliders needed a little bit more flavor. A little bit more wasabi aioli probably would've done the trick. Also, I thought that the portions were a little small. There were only two sliders, and I'm sure I could've made room for a third. But, on the plus side, the sweet potato hash was a really great sidedish.  Finished the evening with the almond olive oil cake with blackberries and yogurt, which was a great finale to a good, fresh-tasting dinner."}
{"text":"My visit to True Food was lovely.  As I approached the entrance one of the employees was picking fresh basil from the front herb-garden-flower-box thing, and as my friends and I entered I saw the open kitchen area where people were cutting up fresh carrots and other veggies.  The feeling of freshness was all around me with the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen, the easy, breezy, yoga-like attire of the staff, the high ceilings and the open windows.  Our waiter explained the restaurant concept and told us about the menu as well as Dr. Weil's philosophy for food and health.   I decided to try their specialty drink, the cucumber refresher, out of curiosity.  It was a cool refreshing glass of cucumber and honey lemonade.  My friends and I decided to share the hummus as an appetizer.  The hummus was delicious, although I would not dare to compare it to any authentic hummus/ pita plates.  The amount of pita served with it was a bit insufficient for the amount of hummus.  However, there was no problem getting more pita, the waiter graciously brought us more for no additional charge.   For my lunch entree, I ordered the sashimi tuna salad with avocado, cucumber, tomato, edamame & ginger, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was very light and fresh, as it sounds like it should be:)  The flavor of the ginger complemented the salad perfectly and the dressing did not over power the other flavors and textures.  My friends both seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  I left feeling good and ready to return soon.    And return soon I did, this time with my boyfriend in tow.  He eats a low glucose index diet and I was excited to take him to True Food because the food seemed so clean.  When we arrived this time the service was very similar to my first experience but as we spoke with the waiter and my boyfriend explained the low G.I. diet, the waiter seemed unfamiliar with this concept.  We asked him for some recommendations and he suggested the harvest chopped salad for him.  I ordered the wild ahi sliders with wasabi, radishes, cucumber on pumpernickel.  The sliders were fabulous!  They were flavorful, perfectly seasoned with the wasabi, and seared to near perfection.  My boyfriend's salad on the other hand, was less satisfactory.  For one, the waiter didn't really understand the low glucose diet when he recommended the salad, which was a lot like a Waldorf salad, containing sugary fruits and such.  Secondly, the salad was soaked with dressing, unlike the perfectly balanced sashimi salad that I had enjoyed there a week or so before.  The salad was so wet that the greens were lost in there!  I was very sad because I had such high hopes for his first True Food experience.  I would still recommend True Food because overall my experience was good, but perhaps next time we will order our salads with the dressing on the side......eeep!"}
{"text":"Always great food and wonderful friendly service. I love the turkey burger and the pizzas are fantastic."}
{"text":"Oh, Lord, do I wish this place was in Chicago!  They serve beautiful healthy, whole food dishes in a very stylish modern setting with an open kitchen.  There is truly something for everyone - vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores.  I had the TLT which is tehmpeh, lettuce and tomato with avocado on whole grain bread.  It was rich, delicious and flavorful.  The sweet potato hash was amazing.  We were lucky to get a table outside to dine under warm, blue Arizona skies.  The restaurant is beautiful, the food is healthy and amazing.  Please come to Chicago, and bring those blue skies with you."}
{"text":"Have been a couple of times and truly don't get the hype   The servings are exactly how other reviewers describe \"skimpy\". Ordered the humus, which is good, but this time I noticed how much smaller the portion had become. The street tacos were fair more veggie than meat. The chicken sausage pizza was terrible would never suggest anyone order that.  The service was friendly. I won't be going back for a long time as I thought in general it was rather expensive for the portion sizes. Not worth the hype"}
{"text":"This place is SOLID! They have options for everyone, thank god. I was nervous about going here because my girlfriend likes to pick places that are always light meals and I was STARVING.  The ambiance is calm and relaxing. We sat outside in the shade, because it was a nice sun shiny day.  I finally got a Kilt Lifter (Awesome Brew btw). My gf got two different loose leaf teas and loved them.   For food, I got the grassfed burger. Although, I was torn and almost got the turkey burger because the toppings were very appealing. It was DELICIOUS and definitely hit the burger spot I had been trying to fill.  We are so lucky to live down the street from this tester aunt as well as all of the Biltmore complex. I can't wait to try all of their food!"}
{"text":"This place seriously makes healthy eating delicious! If you think it sounds too healthy you just gotta check it out, trust me!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and better than excellent service.  Melonie at the bar was outstanding!  The sea bass was good not great, turkey burger and pudding were outstanding."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  The Chicken Salad was amazing.  Gluten free pizza with squash was amazing.  Chocolate pudding....well you know....delightful.  The pizza was ordered without onions and was prepared with onions.  They recooked the pizza quickly.  The manager stopped by the table to apologize and comped the pizza and a desert.  We didn't expect or want them to comp anything.  They went above and beyond.  Again, the food and service were top notch.  Eat here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the red chili shrimp meal (not the exact name) and  a cranberry refresher which was like Christmas in my mouth! Our server Randon was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. Offered the best choices and knew every single ingredient in all the plates we had! He was delightful and never let my drinks get low! #serveroftheyear"}
{"text":"Disappointing food surprised had higher hopes the set up looks promising great open kitchen and very nice atmosphere service very good but unimaginative food had a chopped salad very small for the price and not much to write home about the side of sweet potato hash everyone raved about mediocre at best the tofu teriyaki bowl OK but you can get this all over town 1/2 the price and better. I guess they will get the business because its Scottsdale and lots of people seemed to be there. I would say skip this place find Pita Jungle and get a much better meal for 1/2 the price, oh yeah for those 2 and 1/2 skimpy dishes and 2 lemonades also very average with tip $50. Not worth it I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the food and wine is decent. Daniel our server is fabulous - gracious, friendly, professional"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, and the service is always exceptional.  Today was no different.  Usually I have the TLT, but my daughter and I recently found that we are sensitive to wheat and soy, so this time we had the turkey burger on Gluten Free bun. It needed a little extra mayo since turkey tends to be a little dry anyway, but it was otherwise AWESOME.  Our server was so sweet about my crazy 2 year old and brought a pen and paper for her to color (thanks Meg!). I definitely recommend True Food. It's probably my favorite of all the FRC establishments.  Every time we come back to az to visit we make sure to stop in and this will continue as long as the quality stays consistent like this."}
{"text":"A great alternative to the highly-processed, unhealthy options out there. Glad that restaurants like this are getting attention as it helps raise awareness for the importance of healthy living."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken Brown Rice Bowl and Spicy Chile Shrimp Dish are phenomenal! Nice atmosphere. Creepy Manager who always hits on my friends and I. He should back off a little so we can enjoy our meal rather than intruding so much. He talks and talks and talks when all we want to do is visit amongst each other and not with him. He's very awkward. He used to Manage the Biltmore location in AZ but they moved him to SQ. Wish they hadn't to be honest. Other than him, the service and food is excellent. Wish I could give a 5 star rating but maybe the 3 star will make him improve his manners at his own restaurant. It's one thing to ask a customer if their food is fine but to basically pull up your own chair and flirt for half an hour or more is ridiculous. Oh well. Tasty food, wine and cocktails. Just took our order to-go today. There's a new juice bar that opened next to this location. Can't wait to try it out!"}
{"text":"I am going to keep this review simple.   If you are a health freak this place is as good as it gets. If you want to get greasy food and feel stuffed to the point that you need to wear elastic pants to the dinner table then this is not the place to go.   I ended up getting the burger and it was good but not great. At the end of the day I would not go again because when i eat out  i dont care if it is healthy. Also the vegetable platter for the appetizer is like rabbit food."}
{"text":"\"If veggies always tasted like this, I would have eaten all of my veggies as a kid\"  Everything about my experience was pretty fantastic. So let's break it down (1) ambiance - 4/5  (2) service  - 5/5 (3) food - 4/5  Ambiance -  This place is very welcoming and adds to the idea they want to be transparent and emphasize that everything is made with TLC. You can stand at the entrance and see through the whole restaurant. It's nice there are not a lot of obstructions from one table to the next to the kitchen to where the staff was rolling the silverware. The open windows allows the natural light to make this place very open as well. Why the 4.. well... the tables are so close together and it was hard to move and harder for the staff to ask us things or bring us our food without having to navigate the matrix.  Service -  Service was absolutely fantastic. I was there with a large group who did not all arrive at the same time. That did not stop the waiter from asking us did we need anything while we waited and then come back and ask that as our party straggled in. To add to that, I loved how the staff would just jump in and help our server regardless if that was their table or not. It ensured we did not have to wait and that the server could be more effecient and effective. For example, one of the staff persons, walked over and took a ton of menus from our server so that he could focus on us and not menus, holding, not dropping, and us.  Food -  The food was amazing. We started with the Vegetable crudites, Edamame dumpling, dumpling like things and hummus. The vegetable crudites blew me away. If veggies tasted that good ALL the time, I would probably eat more of them more often. I mean it was beautifully presented and extremely fresh. There were veggies on there I might not eat on a regular, but it may have changed by mind.  The other items were just okay. They didn't wow me. For a refresher I had the pomegranate limeade which was quite refreshing!  So the entrees - I had the trout and the kale salad. When I tell you this kale salad was plentiful and absolutely delicious.. I was speechless at how tasty this was. I am going to have to recreate this.. It was so simple but flavorful. The trout was meh.. It was cooked well but so salty that I could only eat half. I guess between the capers and the olives, and the sauce it was a bit overpowering.  I can't wait to get back there! Everyone was super friendly and it's nice that my food is made with TLC.. just like (or pretty close) to how I would make it at home."}
{"text":"I went here earlier this week on a work outing. The food and drinks were very fresh and tasted good! If they weren't so pricy I would definitely stop in here more often. I will probably visit again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing hummus! I'll come back just for that! Love the atmosphere. Love the freshness! We had to wait a long time, but staff was super friendly and took off our appetizer which was super nice. Had a lovely night"}
{"text":"That buffalo burger is tough to beat.  Their hummus was awesome too.  A little pricy but I keep going back."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our family vacation to Scottsdale and were pleasantly surprised with the food, service, ambiance and selection. Our picky 6 and 9 year old munched on fresh vegetables including snap peas, watermelon radishes and broccoli rap-ini. Then the devoured a delicious margarita pizza followed by a lemon tart and cloudless chocolate cake for dessert. Eating real food can taste good and the prices were not too outrageous. They also have a pretty great selection of fresh juices. I had the kale aid and found it to be ok. The kids had a juice as well but didn't enjoy it  - they prefer water anyway. We will definitely return before our vacation is over."}
{"text":"I'm Vegan and I was very happy with the choices here and the food was delicious! My daughter took me here on Mother's Day. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and was very impressed with the variety of gluten free options.  There were some very interesting choices but I opted for the spaghetti squash casserole.  The waiter offered additions and I was able to choose ingredients that suited my taste.    The dish was amazing!    My only suggestion is make a reservation. They are very busy at lunch time and we had the choice of a 25 minute wait or to sit outside at a shared high table."}
{"text":"I've been to the True Foods at Biltmore twice before, but both times it was a discount promotion.  This time my friends and I decided to come here to the Scottsdale location on a normal night.  While I like the layout of the restaurant and the concept, the prices were a little exorbitant for what you get.  The wait was crazy long, but I sort of expected that on a Friday night.  For a drink I got the Dos Cabezas Red Blend.  Good really good.  For the main course I got the roasted chicken, which was good, but basically just four small pieces with herbs.  For dessert, my girlfriend and I split the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream.  It was good, but super tiny.  In hindsight we should gotten one for each of us, but we didn't feel like waiting longer.  All totaled, I dropped about $35 at this place including tip just by myself.  I get that its healthy, its Andrew Wiel certified, and Sam Fox's restaurants charge you as much for the ambience as much as the food.  But I still left here pretty hungry.  My advice?  Go on a promo night like Valentine's Day or AZ Restaurant Week.  Prices are much more reasonable and you'll enjoy the experience far more knowing you didn't have to clean out a big chunk of your wallet to do so."}
{"text":"Yummy, healthy and worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Biltmore Mall True Foods usually has plenty of parking available. The food is awesome--particularly their seasonable vegetables, although it can be a tad salty. I would ask them to lightly salt if that's an option. Otherwise, everything is charred just right and the taste is wonderful. There are other favorite dishes like the grain bowls. True Foods does not have happy hour pricing, so that's another consideration but their Malbec was quite good. The service can be a tad slower given the freshness of the food and it's a very busy place. My servers have always been friendly and attentive. Indeed I would say their personalities are a primary cause for their four star rating--because they've been mostly fives."}
{"text":"Everything about TFK is awesome; from the vibe, to the drinks, to the food. This is one of the most unique concepts you will ever find. The food is very healthy, but so incredibly tasty. I recommend the Turkey Burger."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back. I like Sam Fox Restaurants, he does a good job usually, but service at this one is horrible. My husband dropped me off for movie night w my girlfriends. I was 45 minutes early so I told the hostess I wanted to grab a bite and a cocktail. I wanted to sit outside, there were over 15 spots open. She said, Noooo, those always get requested?!?! Really?! There were a lot of 2 sweaters with one person outside, I'm writing this while I am looking at them.  I didn't want to sit inside since I am going to be inside a movie theater for over two hours. Oh well, I guess they have enough customers that one less doesn't matter"}
{"text":"I enjoy going here.  Food is good and the waitstaff is always nice and friendly.  It can get a little loud during peak hours, but other than that, it is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I went to True Foods on their opening night and have eaten there at least a few times a month since their opening.  Their salmon is amazing and their salads are simply fabulous.  I love the organic wine selection as well.  If you enjoy sweet white wine the snoqalmie naked reisling is a must try.  The staff is always very sweet and attentive.  My only complaint is that I'd really love to see the butternut squash ravioli return to the menu when in season, it was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Delicious! My vegan friend had the tofu teriyaki and I had the veggie lasagna. The decor is modern and all the ingredients fresh. You can watch the cooks wash and cut your veggies from your table! A definite must try :)"}
{"text":"Great place for healthy food, esp vegetarian food. Service was great and it's a huge place so seating was quick. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"This was a case of the emperors new clothes to me.  Maybe I just don't get it and that's ok-maybe you will.  Very well run restaurant, service was excellent, place was packed for lunch on the Friday I went. Quality of the food was good.  I had the bison burger.  Being from Montana I've add bison before and this was just ok. It was a  little bland.  Came with like a sweet potato hash that was ok, definitely not memorable.  Had a cucumber cooler to drink. It was refreshing but for $5 and no refill, I would have rather had an alcoholic beverage but I don't think they serve alcohol.  Lunch was $23 plus a $5 tip.  Nearly a $30 lunch with little to show for it.  I should have followed other reviews advice and gone to Delux for a burger."}
{"text":"Delicious - this place kinda converted me.  I still eat meat sometimes but this place helped me not be judgemental"}
{"text":"Not a super healthy person, but enjoy this fresh take on a meal.  We especially love the burger and kale guacamole."}
{"text":"This place is average for me.  Not bad, but not good.  The food is fine.  Nothing stands out, but nothing tastes bad either.  I've been here twice and been underwhelmed each time.  This last time, I ordered the steak tacos and the strawberry chopped salad.  Both were good, although the steak tacos were fairly small and left me wanting more.  Moreover, for the prices that I paid, I was hoping for better.  I feel like I could have gotten the same or similar items at other restaurants that would have tasted much better and/or been less expensive.  If I was a vegetarian, vegan, or looking for gluten free items, then I am sure I would love True Food Kitchen.  As just a regular guy looking for a good night's dinner on a Saturday night, this restaurant fell short and was just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy.  Watermelon, goat cheese and heirloom tomato salad.  And a very helpful waiter that guided us through a culinary delight.  Dave Matthews Dreaming Tree chardonnay and mahi mahi tacos.  MMMMM."}
{"text":"Well, I'll start with the negatives. I found the place to be too noisy for my liking.   Yes, I was there during a busy lunch service with virtually every table in use.  But still the noise level was a bit much.  I think they could have tweaked the acoustics a bit.  Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple, fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees (please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, I just prefer veggie dishes). I would also like to see a selection of pure raw food entrees and by raw I don't mean just salads.  Okay, having said that, neither of these issues is a deal breaker nor will it keep me from returning.  Now for the positives; to start off I was told that I would have a five to ten minute wait for a table or I could elect to take a seat at the counter.  I elected to wait for a table and I'm glad I did.  The wait was only eight minutes, so bonus point #1 for keeping with your estimated wait time.  Bonus points # 2 thru 10 go to my server.  Honestly, I forgot his name but on my receipt it shows the server's name as Makyle so I'll assume that is correct.  Makyle was a breath of fresh air, the first thing he served up was a genuine welcoming smile. I can't stress enough how important that is in the restaurant business.  He seemed very happy to work at this restaurant and seemed to have a genuine passion for the place. He started by asking if I have ever been here before and if I knew anything about this restaurant.  When I told him I had never been here and only knew what little I had read. He asked if I wanted to know more and then told me the history and philosophy behind the place.  I found it very interesting and I was impressed by their affiliation with Dr. Andrew Weil and how the entire menu is centered on the principals of Dr. Weil's Anti-inflammatory food pyramid.  Makyle's service was absolutely first-rate.  Possibly the best service I have found in Phoenix other than at a mega-dollar establishment.  Despite being extremely busy he checked in on all of his tables in a timely fashion, kept the water glasses topped off and offered to get you anything you may have wanted like a second drink.  Décor: Bonus point # 11. The décor is very modern-urban-upscale and very appealing to the visual senses. As I mentioned in my opening, they could have done a better job on the acoustics.  Cleanliness: No bonus points. I found it overall clean but with some room for improvement. It looked like they missed a few spots when they cleaned off my table.  Nothing terrible, no sticky mess just not 100%.  So, what did I order and what did I think about it? I started with one of their natural refreshments.  I'm a big fan of fresh juicing and it was nice to see this offered on the menu.  I ordered the Cucumber Refresher and it was just that, very refreshing. Bonus points # 12 thru 14  For my entrée I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  This dish has spaghetti squash with organic tomato, zucchini and fresh mozzarella, and is served piping hot (bonus point # 15) in an individual casserole dish.  What can I say, it was to die for, it was perfect, the ingredients and seasoning achieved a perfect balance where you can taste every ingredient without anything overpowering any other taste (bonus points # 16 & 17).  Now I almost never eat cheese so I could have done with a little less cheese on top but even so it was not overpowering the dish. I was hungry and found the portion size just right. I'm glad it wasn't larger because it was so tasty that I would have consumed the whole thing. First rate and I will highly recommend this dish.  The experience was wonderful and I will return."}
{"text":"Another Fox restaurant using Dr. Weil's anti-inflammatory diet.  The salads are delicious! The pictures do not look like much, but they are packed full of flavor. I had the Tuscan kale with grilled chicken, it was simple but the zesty lemon vinaigrette was very satisfying.  I also had a taste of the Red Chili Shrimp and the Harvest salad. Both also very good and perfect portion.   It is a spacious airy restaurant. Large open doors, letting in a lot of natural light and fresh air . Wait wasn't long for a work day lunch. Service was on point.   The only complaint I had was the birds flying into the restaurant but there isn't anything to be done about that. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Colleen at true food was bright and bubbly! The perfect way to start a Saturday, my guests and I enjoyed excellent cocktails outside in the mist! Colleen blew me away by being careful to check which dishes were prepared with avocado, one of my guests had an allergy. She was upbeat and made our meal an unforgettable and enjoyable experience. We will definitely be back and hope to have her again!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki brown rice bowl was delicious! I got it with steak but they have chicken and tofu options also. This dish came with broccoli, snow peas, and avocado. The teriyaki sauce was perfect."}
{"text":"Part of the Fox restaurant group (foxrc.com). Although it has the feel of a chain, it is surprisingly unique. The food is excellent, organic and uses local ingredients when possible. Service was outstanding. So was the menu which changes regularly. Wine list is also excellent - all organic and sustainable. And they have a superb selection of \"natural refreshments\". I ordered the Panang curry and will order it again the next time. I'll certainly return."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant. Food was great! From the outset service was excellent and our server, Jessica was awesome. Answered all our questions politely and completely!  Well done!  A new favorite restaurant for us!"}
{"text":"This place was just delightful.  I have been here twice now and liked it both times.  To be honest, I can't remember what apps I've had there, but I do remember the turkey bolognese and it was excellent.  It was rich and satisfying without being overbearingly greasy or oily.    The organic honey lemonade is also very good.  It's just too bad that it cost 3 dollars for such a small amount.  GIVE ME MORE."}
{"text":"They seem to have a very swift, clean, organized way of pre-preparing the various foods that go into a salad or soup.  It was fun to watch.  They also take turns folding the silverware into napkins.  Food delicious.  I had the Chicken Chopped salad.  Loved it and ate every bite.  Bob had the Bison Burger.  He is a fan at least at this restaurant.  Vegan, gluten free etc is offered.  Very important to those who want to eat out and find themselves limited ini selection.  Good food for anyone."}
{"text":"As a solo diner, I had a great time at True Food Kitchen. I'm a fan of restaurants that service healthy and fresh foods. Sat at the open seating areas with the high boy chairs. Started out with the iced horchata matcha drink which was delicious. Love how the drink is made with almond milk. For the main entree, I had the fish special of the day - barramundi with vegetables. The fish was nicely cooked and was a nice portion with the quinoa and stir fry veggies. As with dessert, I ordered the rhubarb crisp with gelato. Unfortunately, they rain out of the gelato so they gave me pistachio sorbet instead. The sorbet was awesome even though it didn't match with the rhubarb crisp. Due to the mistake, they provided the dessert for free.   Service was great throughout the evening. The waitress always checked on me and always had a smile.  Too bad there isn't a restaurant like this back at home!"}
{"text":"The \"TLT\" is so delicious!!! Although it wasn't my first choice, I couldn't have been happier with the sandwich! OMGoodness!!!   I've never had Tempeh before (and quite frankly I didn't even know what it was, lol) but I decided to try something else and new... 'cause... why not?! But let me just tell you... it was like eating bacon!!! Wow! Something vegan that tastes like bacon?! Sign me up!!! I couldn't even tell it wasn't a BLT sandwich it was so yummy.   Now the sides -- the Kale salad was absolutely phenomenal! The lemony dressing gave it just the right amount of citrus-y umph to make it mouth-watering. And the sweet potato hash... sweet and yummy! (I would almost eat their sweet potato hash for dessert, lol). The pairings of the salad and sweet potato hash with the sandwich was perfection!   On to dessert... We ordered the lemon tart with strawberries and coconut cream whipped topping... WOW!!! The tart lemon flavor with the fresh strawberries and sweet coconut cream whipped topping gave it just the perfect balance of flavors. And I've never had coconut cream whipped topping -- I thought I was in heaven! :)   True Food Kitchen never disappoints and I suggest and recommend to try anything on the menu... It's all super healthy and absolutely delicious. This was my second visit to True Foods THIS WEEK and will definitely be back again... Sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday and never get tired of the food! I love the bright eyes juice, TLT sandwich with sweet potato hash and kale salad, ancient grains bowl, teriyaki bowl...I could go on and on! My toddlers love the food here too and I love that it's all healthy for them!"}
{"text":"Proper management techniques teach us to provide critical feedback by starting with the good stuff: in this case a lovely room and wonderful service - and moving to the not so good [frequently referred to as 'opportunities'.] In this case, it is what it is.  Great for the vegan/veg crowd and I described it to the lovely as eating grass. Another yelper did brilliantly to describe it as organic in a blah blah blah kind of way.   After sharing the trough of vegetable crudites, I had the panang curry which was a large portion - lots of veggies and about 5 shrimp - but it was flavorful and yummy, served piping hot. The friendy friends both had salmon with kale which looked interesting but not really flavorful. I get it. They love it.  And me? I know I need to eat more veggies but that's not why I go out to dinner - I want deliciousness. And this was good, not my wheel house but good.   And did someone here say there's real food for non vegetarians? If I brought the lovely here? Yah, no. We'd be marching down the sidewalk to Capital Grille. Don't fight it kids, it is what it is. And that's for a pretty focused audience.  Final props to waiter Adam - wonderful server, kind person and all around good sport."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it.   The whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both.   Lots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup.   Not here though!!!   Being a lesbian I have a lot of vegan/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty.   I cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here.   Here's what I got   The butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross.  My gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor.   I ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks.   The bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose.  The soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial.  Ok, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my visiting aunt. I thought it was convenient that instead of giving you one of those buzzing things to let you know that your table is ready, they take down your phone number so you can get a text instead. That enabled us to walk around while waiting for about 30 minutes. Standard for a busy place on a Friday night  We sat close to the bar and kitchen so it was loud since you could hear plates clanging and staff yelling orders. It's probably even louder since there are high ceilings and no barrier to the kitchen. If you don't like noise, you probably wouldn't like it here, but if you love good food you'll love it.  To drink I ordered the \"Cucumber refresher\" that was made of cucumber and honey lemonade and my aunt ordered a beer. Just as a note, they only serve bottled or can beer, nothing from a tap. To eat, I ordered the \"inside out\" quinoa burger and my aunt ordered the \"street\" tacos and we shared the \"caramelized onion tart\" appetizer. I loved the kale salad side that came with my quinoa burger, and I was pleasantly surprised that the quinoa burger was basically vegetables, hummus, and tzatziki, sandwiched in between two quinoa burger patties. Nice if you are watching your carbs or don't eat bread.   My aunt seemed to love the Anasazi beans side so much that she made me try it. They were smoky and flavorful. In the street tacos were avocado, cotija cheese, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, and grass fed steak. There was an option for sea bass but she chose steak instead.  Overall, I enjoyed this place. It was a bit loud but the food made up for it and the waiter was very attentive and kind without being anything but genuine. Always appreciated."}
{"text":"Good healthy eats where everything is organic.  But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive.  I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for.  It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater.  Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about $15 for only 2 small tacos."}
{"text":"Greattttttt lunch spot..   From out of town, ate here for lunch. Splendid food and service, nice atmosphere too. Try it. You'd like it.  We did"}
{"text":"We were very happy to stumble into TFK. The food is fresh, tasty, and mostly really good for you. All attributes we, as Bay Area dwellers, value in our meals.  The bison burger was absolutely delish. Juicy, perfectly topped. I am not sure why one reviewer thought there was too much cheese and another found it lacking in cheese. I must be like Goldilocks. I thought it was just right.  Kale salad as a side was tasty, but a bit heavy handed with the garlic. Hefty portion which even with my boy friend's help was too much.   Turkey bolognese was surprisingly good.  Sashimi was over sauced and over topped.  We both loved the natural juices/sodas. Maybe we are numb to high prices in and around San Francisco, but for $4, we thought we got our money's worth.  Service was friendly, efficient and professional. We think this is the perfect pre-movie spot!  I would definitely recommend TFK to anyone looking for a fresh healthy meal that doesn't leave you waddling out in a food coma. We are only in Scottsdale for a week, and intend to return to TFK to sample more of the menu. It is just that good!"}
{"text":"Will have to give it another shot, I suppose, but after my last new Fox Restaurant Concepts discovery (Flower Child), I was a bit disappointed with True Food.  Ordered the Bison burger - watercress and gruyere, I think, with an umami sauce - it was ok, but I think I'd rather have something closer to the Bison burger from \"Burger Bar\".  Got the split of the sides - kale salad and sweet potato hash - the sweet potato has was pretty good (basically cubed and fried sweet potato), not a fan of the kale salad (but no sure how much of that is just \"I'm not a big kale fan\"?)  Because it's a FRC, I'll give them another go or two before giving up"}
{"text":"Being out of town on a business trip, my co-workers and I were recommended to this place for lunch.  We got there just after noon and while fairly crowded, we were able to be seated quickly outside: we were a little apprehensive about eating outside, but the covered porch had misters surrounding the outside which kept it comfortable.  Our server, Michael, was very attentive and knew the menu backwards and forwards.  The five of us had a mixture from the margherita pizza, teriyaki chicken, turkey wrap, and chopped salad with chicken and it was all great. Our appetizers - the humus as well as dumplings - were a very nice start.  Get the honey lemonade as it was very good.  The food arrived fast, and we all liked how the food was prepared with an open kitchen the diners could see and appeared very clean.  The service was outstanding.  This was my first time to a True Food Kitchen and I'm ready to go back on my next trip to Phoenix or keep my fingers crossed one of these comes to the Houston area.  Give it a try as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite lunch spot. It is a great way to go out for lunch and still stay healthy. The vegetables and fruits are all extremely fresh. I usually start out with the Vegetable Crudites with tzaziki sauce. For the main course I get the Bison Burger protein style with no cheese and a side of fruit.   The staff are super friendly and attentive. I recommend this place to all my friends and make sure to take visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"The hummus is to die for. Best turkey burger I have ever had and their sweet potato hash makes an amazing side. Mix all of that with some loose leaf tea, great service and one of of the best patio areas and it makes for a great meal!"}
{"text":"As always just great food - with an improved wine list. If eating well were always so easy."}
{"text":"This is a great True Food location. I love the lasagna, the spaghetti squash casserole, the kale salad and I recently tried the chicken sausage pizza and it was AMAZING.  For drinks they have a great alcoholic and non-alcoholic list. I love the cranberry & orange kombucha or the medicine man.  This location on a nice day has great outdoor seating with misters and lots of seating, it's a little more quiet on the patio too. Inside there is a bar area if you want to sit and have a drink & food that way.  Book your table on Open Table, you will get seated faster.  Their restrooms are really cute too, they have a community sink to wash your hands in after.  Tons of shopping and other places to get distracted if you visit this location!"}
{"text":"Spending the night foot cruising through Kierland Commons & Scottsdale Quarters with my out of country family, we came upon this gem of a place.  We dropped in for a drink and enjoyed a healthy cauliflower appetizer.  Our server Jacob was thorough and proud of his work and explained the open viewing immaculate kitchen and healthy food faire. As a local, I will be back and bring my business meetings here."}
{"text":"Visited in 2013....this review got lost until now! Yikes & Yelp! I ordered the mushroom pizza on a GF crust. After the bounty of crudités we shared at the table.....3 out of 8 slices was plenty for a light meal! Lunch leftovers = score!  Waiter was very knowledgeable and excited about the menu, which was a nice change from the norm. Great, earthy iced tea but over-priced for something that costs about 26 cents to produce  :P"}
{"text":"The roasted eggplant pizza was great.  The kale drink is super tasty and even my husband liked it (not enough to order one for himself though).  If your looking for tasty, well thought out \"health food\" this is your place.  Unfortunately my less than crazy about health food husband didn't like his burger so I guess this place won't give you the best of both worlds.  I can see a return trip in my future."}
{"text":"I won't go back to this restaurant.  The food literally made me ill.  It is clean, the decor is good, and the service can't be faulted.  However, I spent all night in the bathroom losing the meal I had there.  How do I know their food caused it? I had a bowl of cereal that morning.  What I lost that was undigested was my meal from True Food's, a clear sign of food poisoning.  I had the teryaki tofu.  My neighbor had salmon and was fine.  I plan to call them tomorrow and notify them of what happened.    My general opinion of the place if I hadn't become ill.  It is a trendy place with an interesting menu. The service was good-I had no complaints.   It was clean and the deco handsome and low key.  I found it  disconcerting that neither of us could easily read the menu due to the dim lights.  I noticed the gentleman at the next table tipping his menu to catch more light while he was trying to read it.  How long it will stay a gathering place for the for the more socially inclined, I question.   Both of us thought for the most part the items on the menu were overpriced.  The restaurant is located at the Biltmore  so I expected the prices to be at least a bit high anyway and they were.     We did have to get a steak knife for my friend to be able to cut the bread her salmon was on. The restrooms were interesting with unique dryers that actually did a complete job of drying the hands.  Added 1/29-I decided to email Sam Fox instead of calling.  No reply as yet. 2/2-It is now the day after the Super Bowl and still no response.   That tells me something about the owner, Sam Fox, and his attitude. When I sent him a compliment on another of his restaurants, I got almost an immediate response.  Not this time!  5/27/09-never heard back.  Negative one star for this one."}
{"text":"The menu is always changing which makes it a unique experience every time you go! There are some vegan options and some meat options as well."}
{"text":"Went to True Foods Kitchen for dinner last night.  Had the Kale guacamole and grilled chicken salad.  The guacamole was exceptionally good and worth reviewing. It is one of the best gucamoles I've ever had.  The chicken salad on the other hand was nothing special. Sure, it was good.  But the whole time I was eating it I kept thinking \"I could've made this at home\".  The Green's tasted like they were from a Fresh Express bag and the vinaigrette tasted like the bottled variety.  I will order something different on my next visit.   Edited to Add Update as of 1/26/17: I visited True Foods Kitchen a second time on 1/23/17.  This time I ordered the steak tacos.  The tacos came with a bowl of beans.  I forgot the name of these beans as they were listed on the menu, but they were very similar to pinto beans.  I must say that on this visit, I was very impressed with how good everything I ordered tasted! The tacos were seriously very good!  I devoured them in less than 5 minutes feeling full from 2 adequate sized tacos.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the salsa was perfectly mild with the right amount of flavor.  My friend ordered the mushroom and brussels sprouts pizza and she, too was very satisfied with her meal.  She said she liked how light and airy the pizza crust was and how much flavor the white sauce had.  Overall, I think I will be coming back to True Food Kitchen in the future and getting more of their delicious steak tacos and beans.  It was truly an amazing meal.  I'm glad I gave this restaurant a second try!"}
{"text":"Went in the afternoon on a Sunday. It was busy inside and about a 30 min wait to be seated inside. It's noisy but the food is worth it. If you don't mind sitting at a bar like community table you can sit and eat right away.  Ancient grains with tofu was delicious. Our server was sweet and attentive without being annoying.  Marcus was a great server"}
{"text":"This is one of the few spots that I go to where after finishing my meal I don't feel bloated but not starving either. The food just tastes good and you kind of feel good about it after. They have a good variety so I think anyone can find something. My only gripe might be that on a few occasions the waiter/waitress assigned to us was slow in serving us but on average they usually get the job done."}
{"text":"We are usually big fans of the foodie flavors that come out of Fox Concepts, but felt this one fell a little short for us.  True Food Kitchen is the brain-child of Dr. Andrew Weil and Sam Fox. Their two-fold mission is that every dish served must not only be delicious but must also promote the diner's well-being. Our palates were somewhat uninspired by the offerings  True Foods is also showcasing proper proportions and the benefits of an anti-inflammatory food pyramid diet of Dr Weil. The only problem is the menu prices need to go on a diet too.  Everything is tasty, but a tad pricey  Our introduction might have also been tempered by the amateurish hostess station, which seemed more interested in having a conversation with a girlfriend friend who stopped by, rather then sitting the customers.  We watched in amusement until our turn came. LOL    Our server was a bit spacey too.  She was MIA for long stretches of time during our meal and was only bailed out by the other servers.  We tried the Spaghetti Squash (photo) with a \"protein\" of Chicken Sausage and the Teriyaki (photo) with a \"protein\" of chicken with brown rice. BTW, \"protein\" is True Kitchen's favorite add on noun.    As for our meal, we found the squash was overwhelmed by it's spaghetti sauce, which was mildly spicy which we liked.  Though we really enjoyed the chicken sausage \"protein\".  As for the the Teriyaki it was somewhat bland and overwhelmed by the brown rice.  Hard to believe.  We did enjoy the Pomegranate Limeaide (photo) and the Honey Ice Teas.  Expect to pay around $30 per person, including one non alcoholic drink.  Our return factor is less than twenty percent.  Sorry.  SITEREP: If you've been following along in the newspapers, Fox Restaurant Concepts made national headlines in February 2012, when PF Chang's acquired a 51 percent stake in True Foods after providing a initial $10 million in start up costs back in 2009.  http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/08/10/daily51.html http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/morning_call/2012/02/pf-changs-buying-majority-stake-in.html  They are showcasing a cookbook from Dr. Weil and chef Michael Stebner which includes more than 125 original recipes.  On the menu you will find Spring Salad with Aged Provolone, Curried Cauliflower Soup, Corn-Ricotta Ravioli, Spicy Shrimp and Asian Noodles, Bison Umami Burgers, Chocolate Icebox Tart, and Pomegranate Martini and much more.   They are hoping for a 50-restaurant rollout of the concept, over the next several years. The average 5,000 square feet True Foods space highlights the use of reclaimed wood and environmentally friendly materials, costing about $2.5 million and $3 million in each location. http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2012/03/09/pf-changs-backed-true-food-kitchen.html?page=all"}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh. The restaurant has a eco vibe and the waiter was nice. I had the cashew pad Thai with tofu and it was amazing. However with many restaurants the bills adds up and it could be a little more expensive then other places but it is worth for the good quality."}
{"text":"Love thisplace. Waitstaff seem like they love you if you have an allergy or intolerance. The menu kicks butt. I love kale but for some reason hate preparing it yet hardly anyone has it on their menu. Everything was perfect. It seems pretty busy, our service was great but I can see where it might be a good idea to go at an off time."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed that I have only ate here two times and I live in very close proximity of this restaurant. Ate here tonight and it was perfection.  The server was so genuine & amazing! Lettuce wraps were delish along with the inside out quinoa burger. I was so impressed with start to finish. This is on my new rotating list of places to eat."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the first time with a friend who recommended it as a place to get a delicious healthy meal.  Well, she wasnt wrong.  We ordered the cashew pad thai and the squash casserole.  Both dishes were delicious.  I would absolutely order both dishes again, especially the pad Thai.  My only complaint is that the portions are pretty small for the price.  There weren't really any carbs in the casserole dish (mostly squash and tomatoes), so would it have killed them to include a slice of bread?  In fact, they don't offer any kind of complimentary bread or anything when you first sit down.  I'm all for healthy eating, but it's the little touches that make me return to a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a place that you want to go to if you're looking for fresh clean food- not if you want a large meal.  I left satisfied but not full.  The prices are a bit steeper for the amount of food that you get- but you are paying for quality, not quantity.  I opted for a salad which hit the spot- but could have been a tad bigger.... as a result we definitely had room for dessert.  I recommend the apple crisp :)"}
{"text":"Truly an original experience. All the food was fresh and wonderful. The presentation was marvelous, the service was great. A little pricey at almost $25/per person with tip. I don't mind paying though...the rent in this cool place must be sky high! Definitely a place to experience!  PS...the Sweet Potato Hash is a must!  UPDATE: I didn't add my bill/tip right but they did (when I got the CC statement) it was $10 bucks lower! Honesty earned them the 5th star! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"Tried the Sashimi salad and fell in love. Love this place, so many options for veg-heads. Great wine list too!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night, and they were busy, which is always a good sign.  I had the sea bass and my husband has the salmon, both were excellent.  Quinoa had a savory flavor.   My sea bass itself could have used more sauce either on it, or on the side, as there wasn't enough.  Portions are small, and it's a pricey restaurant.  We had an onion tart as an appetizer, the fig complemented the onion's sweet/smokey flavor well, gave it balance.  I wasn't impressed with the dessert, a flour less chocolate cake.  Not very rich, and a bit dry."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The atmosphere, the food, the drinks - they hit it all!!  The space is gorgeous, which is no small fete in such gorgeous surroundings.  It's stands out in it's modern, urban, simplicity vibe.    I had the pleasure (and I do mean that) in eating at the bar, which gave me a complete window into the kitchen side as well as the diner side experience.  I watched fresh vegetable and fruit after vegetable and fruit be meticulously sliced, diced and rolled into an amazing delectable treat.  I also saw the bar tender mix up exotic and delicious looking cocktails.  I enjoyed a very nice wine by the glass, with the help of the most friendly bartender.  Oh yeah, the food.  It was amazing.  Fresh, just cooked and exactly what was promised and what I ordered.  I was stunned at how quickly the kitchen accommodated my request.  The food was most fulfilling and delicious.  I'm an out-of-towner, and this may be completely reflective of that, but the only very tiny aspect that left me uncomfortable was the pretentious nature of the patrons of this wonderful restaurant.  I guess that is par for the course when you have such an amazing gem on your hands but it was a bit of a turn-off for someone who completely appreciated the message of this restaurant.  This place is great and I highly recommend it!  No detail is left un-attended - the staff have covered it all.  Just be prepared to wait, all the while knowing that the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Very healthy and delicious food! The garden scramble with sausage was excellent. The sausage tasted homemade and non greasy. The scramble had butternut squash, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower,  Swiss chard and smoked Gouda. Absolutely delicious and guilt free! The honey and grapefruit mimosa and cranberry and pomagrante mimosa were a great complement to the main dish!"}
{"text":"The food really is true food!!!  The bison burger rocks along with the sweet potato hash!  Excellent drinks and desert."}
{"text":"I am a health nut and love everything that has the word organic, natural and true food on it.  This restaurant is another subsidiary from Fox restaurant concepts so I was not expecting much. The usual high prices and small portions are a must when talking about Fox restaurants however to my surprise the food was pretty good and I specifically loved the kale-ade. This place is usually pretty busy however it is definitely worth the wait.  I probably won't be back anytime soon but I'll be back someday."}
{"text":"Oh how I love True Food Kitchen!  I met a friend here for lunch today and had a great experience.  We both started with a pomegranate limeade and enjoyed the spaghetti squash casserole...yummy!  Great atmosphere, professional staff and healthy, but super tasty food!"}
{"text":"I loved it so much on a visit back to AZ for the week I dined 3 times... Every person that went with me enjoyed it's delectable fare.. Even the Midwest steak eaters & teenage boys... I think that says a lot... Every-time here  we ordered many things off the menu and shared... So many things I fell in love with on the menu... The Kale salad, and pizzas, green tea soba noodles, and the PITA (trying to figure out the recipe)... the raw fish of the day... of course the juices... everyone was ambrosial, yes I tried them all! All was prepared so delicately and with much culinary care.  This is the type of place you go when you want to eat healthy, and still feel it is gourmet, or you are trying to turn someone on to eating healthier...  Or you have mixed eaters, picky, vegan, veg, no wheat etc.  Once again Sam Fox & his team are brilliant. I was told it took 1.5 years to plan this place... there was so much that could not (would not) be compromised... I was rather impressed that they paid for the full liquor license only to cary one organic rum and vodka... They are taking a huge money loss by sticking to the philosophy...  Also with the demand that everything be fresh, the food cost must be frightening...   I hope people give this a try... it is the most delicious well done foodie health food I have ever had... and I dine around.   yum... I miss it already."}
{"text":"Last time I ate here I ordered chicken and Brussels sprouts and I got food poisoning :( used to love this place..."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to True Food Kitchen. The service was excellent and the food was...FRESH! I had the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad. It was scrumptious. The place was open, airy, and fun! I would definitely go back the next time I'm in the Scottsdale Quarter and bring friends too!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to this True Food location and again we were well taken care of by the staff and servers. We came twice with larger parties of peeps and the staff is more than capable to handle groups.  It does get a bit loud though which was the knock of 1 star.  I don't like having to feel like I'm yelling to my guests who are right across from me.   The food is excellent. Fresh, temperature appropriate, and delicious. Kids portions are very generous as are the adult portions. It would be easy to share a kid meal with your little one or have them share with you if your little person is a light eater.  We enjoyed the turkey lasagna, red chili shrimp, street tacos, turkey club wrap, salmon, and something else I forget...but it was also very delicious. My son enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake as well and it was delectable.   Can't wait to go back to True Food again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here Friday night for dinner with friends.  We had tried to make a reservation but they only allow reservations for 7 or more so since we were a party of five we decided to take our chances.  Our wait only ended up being about a 1/2 hour maybe more... that flew by as we were ordering drinks and talking amongst ourselves.  I chose the organic honey lemonade with a shot of their organic Square One vodka... very tasty:).  Others had the pomegranate sparkler and the Medicine Man with a shot of organic vodka.  The medicine man had Olivello Juice, Pomegranate Juice, Cranberry Juice, Black Tea, Soda Water& Muddled blueberries... I tasted this one and it was also very yummy.  The restaurant is very open, not very intimate but still very cool... they also have a nice patio which is were we were sat.  For apps we had the Edamame Dumplings and the Crudites... they both were really good but my favorite was the dumplings.  For dinner I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Mushrooms, Savoy Cabbage & Pistachios... it was 3 large ravioli's with a very tasty sauce.  It was a little sweet so if you don't like sweet entrees this might not be for you.  Michael had the Ahi Sliders which he said were really good.  Others had the Miso Glazed Black Cod and the Turkey Bolognese.  I tried both of these and I must say that I cannot wait to come back and try other items on their menu.  I think the best part is this place is not expensive at all!  We had cocktails, appetizers and entrees and it was about $30 per person... that includes the tip.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"True Food was very disappointing for lunch today.  I ordered the Mediterranean salad with salmon- fish was almost rancid and the salad was missing at least two of the listed ingredients.m Staff was nice about it, but obviously something (or someone) was wrong in the kitchen. I have eaten here many times but will probably not return ( at least for a while)."}
{"text":"I love finding great eateries like this while away from my home turf. The food is so fresh and tasty. I prefer organic food whenever possible and they offer it here. The restaurant is very popular and looks like a very hip place to be after work. I was here for lunch on a Saturday and it was full, made a reservation for my friends and I and were seated within 10 minutes. The noise level is in the high range here.  Food is fabulous. Prices a bit on the high side but worth it. Located in an upscale shopping center within a business district. Validated 2 hour parking in the nearby lot at this writing."}
{"text":"This place was enormously popular at lunch. We liked the charred cauliflower and the chicken sausage pizza. There is a juice bar attached or next-door to the restaurant and I think it is possible to order juices from them. One bit of advice I can offer: grab a seat at the bar or the community table if it is available rather than waiting 30 minutes for a private table to open."}
{"text":"If I ever get married I am going to make sure my wife and I eat at True Food at least 7 times a week. This will ensure that my wife maintains her incredible hotness while I get to eat flavorful food at least once a day. Win win."}
{"text":"I love the healthy options @ True Food kitchen. I am never disappointed  when I go with friends or for a work lunch."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness...delicious and good food!!!!  Great environment inside and outside.  Awesome servers.  The FOOD WAS SO FRESH and if possible organic and we had the Kale Salad; Quinoa Burger, Chocolate CAke and Chia Seed pudding for dessert with Grapefruit Martinis.   ALL YUMMY and would so go again and again.   WE ARE HOOKED....oh the sweet potatoe hash browns...beyond GOOD"}
{"text":"My Mom recommended this place - my oldest sister is a super health food nut and I've been on a new meatless journey - so she thought because they couldn't try it out last week (hello 1 1/2 hour wait) we would take it for a test spin. I really love the decor and the feel of this restaurant! The outdoor patio is very well set up with heaters and cute little sitting areas with fireplaces and fire pits.   Everything is very healthy, earth friendly and sustainably grown. I really liked the idea of it. I started off with the Cucumber Refresher drink and it was delicious. Their soup of the day was Miso which although it tasted a bit saltier than I would've liked I still think it was very tasty. We ordered the Herb Hummus for the table and were not disappointed. I had the sashimi tuna salad and I must say I felt a bit let down on this. The dressing was okay but not great, and I don't feel there was enough tuna or avocado given it's $14 price. Also I was hoping for something fancier than mostly iceberg lettuce given that there's no nutritional value in it. My Mom really enjoyed her Miso Alaskan Cod, her hubby seemed to enjoy the Bison Burger and I'm not too sure if my Dad and his wife enjoyed their Teriyaki Rice bowls - I guess I didn't hear any complaints so...? My fiance had the Panang Curry dish extra spicy and said it was good. Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs about having to get out by 7p to catch a couple of planes. We were too stuffed to try any of the desserts but they certainly sounded good.   I like the idea of this place but I'm not sure I was really sold on it. Perhaps it's a better drink and appetizer place - I almost fell over when I saw the bill: $175 for six. There were a fair amount of wine glass refills but still - ouch."}
{"text":"Good food but hella expensive. You can get a lot of the same dishes with bigger portions for lower prices at flowerchild"}
{"text":"Great place that's full of energy to get your full of healthy eats.  Come with a friend or a huge group as there's ample seating.  This part of town is always fun."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the center of the mall and was easy to find.  The signage was large and bright.  The inside of the restaurant was clean and appropriately lit. There was music playing in the background and a football game was playing on the television above the bar.  The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable.  My thoughts on the food:  Shrimp Dumplings The shrimp dumplings were visually appealing and served warm on a round white dish.  It was an appropriate serving for one or two guests. The dumplings tasted fresh and were served with a spicy soy sauce.  Inside the dumplings there was a mix comprised of shrimp, basil, mint and red chili.  The dumplings exceeded our expectations.  Red Chili Shrimp We ordered the red chili shrimp based on our server's recommendation and we were not disappointed. This dish was visually appealing and served hot with sesame noodles, gai lan, spinach and shiitake mushrooms. It was a generous serving that provided enough food for two guests and exceeded our expectations.  Turkey Lasagna This pasta dish contained spinach, ricotta cheese, organic tomatoes and ground turkey.  It was served hot, flavorful and the ingredients tasted fresh.  It was visually appealing and provided enough food for one guest.  Lemon Tart The lemon tart was thick, with a dense texture that was softened by the serving of cream on top of it. This dessert was served cold and was large enough for two guests to share.  It was artistically created and the taste exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for simply being so accommodating to my picky eating. Having been in Phoenix for the good part of a week, I was definitely feeling the grease from all the pizza, pasta, and heavy foods that this area offers. I happened upon True Food Kitchen because I wanted to visit a lululemon which was right next door, and the sales staff recommended this spot.  This is a casual but trendy eatery located in the even trendier Scottsdale Quarter shopping plaza. Amidst the plenty of high end stores, you will find a delicious and very reasonably priced eatery that serves mostly healthy and organic foods.   There are lots of gluten free options to choose from as well as vegetarian. You can't really go wrong. I actually asked them to give me a market scramble to go in a tortilla wrap (a.k.a. burrito) ... which clearly isn't on the menu. But the to-go staffer was super nice and definitely made it happen.  I thought their sweet potato hash was just ok ... maybe it's because I got it go to, but the wrap was WAY. AWESOME. I'd come back just for that! Definitely recommended in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My wife had the sea bass and I had the Moroccan chicken. Both very tasty and the serving sizes were reasonable, not obscenely large. Service was good, as was the wine. We will likely go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch there while out for a visit with family, and am a fan. The atmosphere is cozy, yet open and modern. Service is the friendliest I've experienced in a while. And the menu is on one page, drinks on the other, but there is much to choose from for any kind of eater or foodie. We decided to start things off with a charred cauliflower appetizer - vegan and totally delicious. Sorry, TFK, I am so cribbing this! My lunch companions ordered chicken and shrimp bowls/salads, I let our server talk me into their TLT sandwich with sweet potato hash on the side. Tempeh bacon and all the fixings, devoured to the last bit. So, so good! Add to this soft drinks made with fresh fruits and herbs, and a strong and aromatic soy cappuccino, and you have an enviable state of food happiness. We'll be sure to come back to this great find when we're in the area the next time."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing hope true food opens more restaurants   High quality food, trendy, yummy"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for unique and healthy eating options.  The place and location command higher prices.  The service is usually very good.  We will come back!"}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed True Food! Our sever, Desiree provided excellent customer service. She answered all our questions, gave great recommendations and was all around engaging. We sat on the patio 'c parking can get a little hectic at the Biltmore area, so plan accordingly. I had the grass fed burger w/ raw onions and no mayo w/ sweet potato hash in the side, perfect burger. My friend had the sausage pizza, I tried a slice and it was just as good. I will definitely be back to try some other menu selections."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent True Food Kitchen. We are there so often in fact that several waiters and waitresses recognize us and say hello when we stop in. We have been eating here since before we moved to Arizona. In fact, my wife and I ate lunch at True Food Kitchen the day before I proposed to her during a short conference here.   Fast forward to today and now we live in the area. We were only too happy to make this our regular go-to restaurant. It's hard to feel guilty about how much you eat or how delicious it is when you know that it's so healthy for you.   The pizza here is exceptionally good if you are into thinner crust and stronger flavors. My favorite entree is definitely the poke bowl. I never cared much for raw fish, but I can't get enough of the poke bowl. Also, the bourbon cocktail they make is consistently excellent.   For appetizers, we always get the lettuce wraps and sometimes get the kale guacamole as well. I highly recommend both. Every soup is good, it doesn't matter much which soup it is that day, but the chicken noodle soup was the best I've ever had. Unfortunately I've only ever seen it on the menu once!   The ambiance is nice, it is very easy to have conversations here. They often keep the doors open and allow the breeze to pass through, making it seem a bit like you are outdoors even when you aren't. With the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, the entire restaurant feels open and spacious."}
{"text":"If you are not into vegan this place is not for you.  Had the dumplings as an appetizer and regret that.  What came to our table was mush that looked like overcooked ravioli.  The taste was equally confusing.  I also got the burger thinking it would taste of something I am familiar and was very disappointed in the experience.   To add the food was cold and I still don't know what was on my plate next to my burger.    In an effort to wash the taste away I was able to find four peaks Scottish ale on tap and made it a liquid lunch.  The experience was very expensive and I'll not be back.  Not recommended despite the hipster appearance."}
{"text":"I have gone a few times but now its time to review! True Food is worth it for the drinks alone. They have really cool tonics and stuff-- if you feel like it you can defeat the purpose by adding some booze! ;-) The food is great because it is healthy and they use all natural ingredients to flavor the food with way out there combinations, but it is not a fusion type restaurant. Here is to your health! Try this place out."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it all but settled on the crudite platter, turkey lasagne and street tacos.   Everything was beyond fresh.   I have never been so blown away by a plate of vegetables.   It was beautifully done and ridiculously sweet and fresh.   The lasagne was rich but not heavy tasting.   The tacos had a good flavor and the beans on the side were tasty.   Hoping this chain comes my way to Chicago."}
{"text":"For a \"healthy\" restaurant chioice, this is a pretty good restaurant. Locally sourced, organic, non-GMO, etc., etc., and full of really great flavor. The Moroccan chicken tasted like I stepped back into Casa Blanca. The Teriyaki chicken had great teriyaki flavor in the chicken and through the quinoa. The spring salad was also very good. I expect a somewhat bland meal but came away with food that was full of flavor and well spiced."}
{"text":"Starting with the good first: The atmosphere was very nice. It was a little louder than I anticipated for a nicer place but completely ok. I loved the decor and the general idea of the place. The staff were nice...a bit too eager to have us like the place but they were nice.  Their juices were also good.  The bad: the vegan and vegetarian options were pretty bland. They used a lot of sauces to compensate for the lack of flavor in the food. I think part of the beauty of vegetarian, especially vegan plates is letting the natural food speak for itself. You can find better options around town. However, this place is nice for a group of vegans/vegetarians to go to as it offers more options on one menu rather than hitting up a regular restaurant and everyone has to order the same thing since it's the only available option on their menu.  Would I go again? Once in a blue moon and only if I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Scottsdale quarter location  I loved it, the service the food, I had the poke bowl The cauliflower and the stew, DELICIOUS I have been to the Biltmore location and have never been disappointed. I am so glad I have this choice close to my home! Great service good food and Wonderful location."}
{"text":"My first complaint is that I think the name is too similar to Real Food Daily in West Hollywood and I am always confusing the two names. Secondly, while I liked the food, I thought it was overpriced for what we got. Started off with the hummus, split an order of the curried cauliflower soup and veg. caesar salad and then had the green tea soba noodles with added tofu. Everything was very good; I really liked sitting on the outdoor patio with the exception of other diners dogs getting loose and trying to say \"hello\" to me while I ate. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!  My vegan sister is in town, so this was a great excuse to try True Food for the first time.  I love the vibe, the open kitchen, the decor, and the abundance of fruits and vegetables for your viewing pleasure!  As a vegetarian, it's so refreshing to go to a restaurant and have lots of CHOICES!  And healthy ones at that!  I started with the Cucumber Lemonade, which was the perfect combination.  My husband got the Green Arnie (green tea and lemonade), again, delicious.  A little pricey, but that's okay.  My sister tried the Hangover Cure, which was too much coconut for me but she loved it.    We started with the hummus, and in my experience it can be a little bland but this was flavorful.  I loved the addition of tomatoes, feta, cucumber and olives.  We also ordered the Kale salad to share - and let me tell you - I would eat this everyday if I could!!!  Tasty!  For my main dish I had the Tomato and Olive Oil pizza, which was surprisingly flavorful despite being kind of boring.  I could have gone for more basil, but that's just me.  It did hit the spot though.  Others enjoyed the steak tacos and the spaghetti squash.    Let me tell you, we were all part of the \"clean plate club\" and had a great time trying each others dishes.  It feels so good to eat this way.  When my husband saw the initial portions, he thought he'd leave still hungry.  Come to find out - he was happily satisfied.  We'll be back for lunch in the near future!"}
{"text":"Moved to Scottsdale recently and am here for dinner at least 2 times a week. The Steelhead Salmon Dish is the best!"}
{"text":"Always great food and service, and you everything is always fresh and healthy. There specialty drinks are always fun and their miso soup is killer"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness you can't go wrong in a place like this it's got the most amazing healthy calculated menu with choices for all kinds of leaders who are looking to have the most natural possible outcome on the plate! From the earth to your plate with as few changes as possible!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy True Food!  What is great is that there is truely something for everyone:  the tried and true Vegan, and the \"gotta have meat\" lover.  The atmosphere is friendly and modern, and the food is yummy.  I really enjoy the TLT as you get that salty crunchy bacon taste without the guilt.  Their signature sweet potato side is awesome, but so is the kale salad - get a bit of both.  Also have enjoyed the torched avocado, and my friend liked the teriyaki quinoa.  I was not all that keen on the wild mushroom pizza - too much cheese, too little mushrooms.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  A great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great service and food! The teriyaki bowl (with chicken) is outstanding As well as the chicken fennel pizza.Our waitress, Allison, was awesome and knew all about the menu. Its refreshing to have someone take that extra step!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't review this restaurant the last time I went.  Love it!  Great ambiance, Great service, Great/Quality food and decent prices.  We shared the gluten free wild mushroom pizza and the spaghetti squash casserole.  The pizza was AMAZING.  I didn't even care that it was a gluten free crust.  I would have been happy to just share that for a light meal.  The casserole was recommended from the waiter.  It was okay.  Reminded me of eggplant parm without the eggplant... lol.  I enjoyed it but wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Huge increase in vegetarian/vegan foods here over the past year. Very nice staff, great atmosphere, tasty food, what else could you want!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, and there was a wide range of cuisines on the menu, but my putanesca wasn't anything special.  I was most appreciative of the non-alcoholic beverage selection, and opted for the Nojito.  It was not as good as the mojitos I remember from pre-pregnancy, but at least it wasn't plain water.  Service was fine, though the whole atmosphere was a tad pretentious, imo."}
{"text":"A very nice place to get a healthy meal, lunch or dinner! There are some very exotic and drink concoctions on the menu as well as some unbelievably tasty, healthy options. I love the harvest salad with a nice piece of salmon for a filling, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"If the gym is a place you visit on a regular basis then you already know food is everything. I've recently discovered their salads, with a fresh piece of blackened fish and a hydrating drink with chia seeds and the amount of energy is unreal! I love the Biltmore location as a recent transplant and will continue to hit this place before a workout. Otherwise lots of great food selections and an upscale, healthy crowd which, if important to you, will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"I can tell I'm getting old.  I go to restaurants for the food not because it is the thing to do.  I met some friends at the True Foods because they heard good things.  A lot of beautiful people were eating there.  Looked like a beautiful people convention Some of the beauty was natural but much of it was surgically enhanced.   Everyone ordered a $4 juice soda mix that was OK but small and not (IMHO)  worth $4.  Everyone got there meal at a different time (10 minutes between the first and the last) and that was a bit awkward. My wife had the kale salad and I had the fish taco's.  Wife thought the salad was OK but expensive for what she got.   I got 3 fish tacos and each one consisted of a nugget sized piece of fish on a small and dry (it broke apart when you tried to bend it making it hard to eat) corn tortillas that with some fresh veggie garnish on it.   I tasted OK but I love fish taco's and I can say these are the worst I have ever had.     It appears the food is fresh, they use great ingredients, and it is a good place to see and be seen.  But after paying $52 for a couple of small drinks some chopped kale with a little bit of dressing and a couple of other things, 3 fish nuggets on dry tortillas, and a couple of cups of coffee, and marginal service I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Refreshing to find a health-conscious restaurant with friendly, knowledgeable staff and beautiful ambiance. (Highly recommend Cheryl as a waitress!)"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for date night and decided to chance the drive without a reservation. I was glad we made the decision, the wait was only going to be 20 minutes (on a Friday night) but was got seated right away by sitting at the high top tables. The food did take quite a while to be served but I had the lasagna bolognese and the flavor was amazing!  They had several option for my wife with gluten free and dairy dietary restrictions and were very accommodating. I was still slightly hungry after the meal and splitting the flourless chocolate cake desert with my wife but the food was still great."}
{"text":"This place is very interesting and there is nothing else like it in the Phoenix area.  Though I am not some health nut, vegan, vegetarian, or allergic to gluten; I found this restaurant to be very good.  The decor is very unique and trendy with an open kitchen and prep stations so you can see just how \"fresh\" your food is.  The hostess was friendly and it took about 10 minutes for our party of 3 to be seated on this busy Thursday night.  All 3 of us shared the Harvest Chopped Salad.  It was very tasty and served all of us quite nicely.  I would definitely order this salad again.  Our entrees (natural half chicken, sustainable salmon, and spaghetti squash spaghetti) were all very tasty and reasonably priced.  I would order any of the 3 again.  We did not order dessert this visit, but I would recommend the maple ice cream thing.  I had that last time and it was very good.  I think they make all the desserts from scratch because it took forever.  Anyway, the waiter was friendly and the food, drinks and refills were delivered rather quickly.  I would definitely dine here again because the food is excellent, reasonably priced, friendly service, and most importantly....makes me feel hip, trendy and healthy!"}
{"text":"Why is this place so amazing?! Seriously though, I can't get enough (my wallet can though). I love trying their different seasonal drinks, I haven't been let down yet! They have a really awesome kids menu which is always a plus since my toddler is usually our dining companion. They are extremely accommodating to food allergies. I can't seem to bring myself to get anything other than their kale salad but my husband has had their vegan squash pizza & he loved it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really great place for healthier (but probably not all that healthy) fare. The environment is airy, comfortable and pleasant. The crowd is a mixture of first dates, tourists and \"beautiful people\".  The food is very well presented and obviously made with fresh ingredients by caring hands."}
{"text":"Went here 3 weeks ago. Clean environment, food was ok, I tried their TLT, it wasn't bad but not that great also. I rate it 2 stars because of customer service. Hostess was glaring at me when I was looking at the menu while waiting for our table. When I noticed her stare, I handed her the menu. She then instructed us to follow her to our table with a sigh, gave me back the same menu I handed her, then left without saying a word when we were seated. We had a condescending waiter. Felt like we were being rushed to order. The worst thing he did was cleaning our table and my friend wasn't done eating. Didn't bother to ask if we were finished with our meal. Staff made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable, so we were happy to leave ASAP. I will still recommend true foods kitchen to anyone but not at this location."}
{"text":"Ordered the Panang Shrimp Bowl... wow!  Such beautiful flavors and texture.  Mildly spicy.  You will need a spoon for this one and I promise... you will Not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good spot in the Biltmore Fashion mall. Great fresh juices, interesting and healthy menu choices, good wines, friendly staff. A busy spot. Good spot for an informal dinner for personal or business purposes."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to complain about with this place! Service with a smile & delicious fresh food. Price about $25-30 per person is comparable to any nice place (esp in this area). I'm not sure about the issues with portion sizes, I had the roasted chicken and it was plenty. Also had the pomegranate sorbet - soooo good."}
{"text":"I keep going back for the \"inside out quinoa burger\" and get their amazing kale salad as my side. Servers are always friendly. Downside is the wait time at popular times (I'm not the only one that enjoys the food)."}
{"text":"Great organic food and cocktails. Amazing service, Brad was the absolute best waiter. Very knowledgeable, gave great recommendations and was overall wonderful at this job. Love True Foods!!"}
{"text":"i had the chicken salad and although it was delicious it was tiny and i was not fully satisfied. Will still come back."}
{"text":"Please don't go here!!!! Cause I want the place just for myself!  Food, ambiance, service- nothing lacking....I love this location! Having been to True Foods in 4 different cities, I can say that this location is one of the best. Keep at it folks!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing a bunch of two star reviews from my friends, I was hesitant about going, but I'm glad I finally did.    From start to finish, the service was friendly.  The hostesses were chatty (but not too much) and super nice, and my waiter was polite, checked in on my, had good recommendations, etc.  The food and drink? Ridiculously pricey. Yes. Tasty though? Also yes.  I had the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza, a combo I wouldn't have thought of putting on a pizza, yet it was delicious.  The Nojito to drink? It was ok, but not really worth $4, especially with no refills.  I loved that they had the menu marked vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. That is always much appreciated.    The atmosphere was nice, although my chair wasn't super comfy. Bathrooms were nicely designed, but not cleaned while I was in them.  I did love that you could see all the food being prepared in an open environment.  I won't be back until we're ready for a fancy date night, but I'll definitely be bringing my partner here to try some of the delicious options!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Locally sourced sustainable food. Yeah, yeah I know it is kind of tree huggin'. Well my friend after eating this place I'm hugging away now. We are in town with family and decided over pizza to come here. I destroyed the bison burger and I got the side Mediterranean salad which was littered with olives and feta cheese mmm good!!! The folks at my table had the salmon which was a little dry however slide some sauce on it and it was totally edible. The curry rice with shrimp was amazing. We had to take some home with us and the bowl may have been licked because you don't want the sauce to go to waste. I cannot wait to try this place in Santa Monica CA. The pricing wasn't so bad; however, the wait sucked. I guess when it's the trendy thing you gotta wait for a table once in a while. Lookn forward to our next trip. Our server was Randon and was so passionate  about the menu. He was a pleasure to have help us with our dining experience. The pricing is spot on to what I would expect and we all left with our bellies full; the portions are plenty for all."}
{"text":"Coup De Tart is the best deal. I have never seen so many vegetables!  Also the Spaghetti Squash Casserole (VEG GF) organic tomato, caramelized onion, zucchini, fresh mozzarella  Without the cheese this is pretty darn close to vegan:)"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time during Restaurant Week with a friend and was not disappointed. I look forward to going back and bringing my husband. My friend cannot eat gluten and says that this is one of her favorite restaurant since there are so many options for her. When we arrived at 6 pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away. The service was great, and our server was very friendly.   We ordered the turkey bolo, which was delicious. I had the summer salad and my friend had the hummus for our first courses. They were tasty. Seems like a great concept for a restaurant and I can't wait to try out some of the drink specials and other dishes next time."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchens seem to be popping up everywhere lately, and I finally made my way to one with a large group of colleagues for a group lunch. This location has a bright, airy layout - an impressive accomplishment considering the 115 degree summer heat.   The menu is varied, but pretty pricey - a cheaper lunch will set you back $15-$20, while a more ambitious one could easily rack up $30 if you're adding a beverage and ordering, say, the Poke Bowl. For the Turkey Burger + Kale Salad ($14) I ordered, it was a reasonable deal considering the size of the burger. Fries would have rounded it out, but fries are not on Dr. Weil's recommended foods list (sweet potato hash, however, is).   Everyone seemed to be pretty happy with what they ordered, and everything from the pizzas to the grain bowls looked fresh, healthy, and hearty. I loved the overall vibe of the place, and would definitely come back to explore the menu. Service was also friendly and attentive, even for a large group.   The only thing knocking a star off for me are the prices, but if that's no problem for you, check TFK out ASAP!"}
{"text":"I eat at True Food pretty frequently. I've had their chicken chopped salad more times that I can count! They also have great seasonal pizzas - right now it's butternut squash, yum! They have some interesting and tasty breakfast dishes too. The service is usually good, and they are happy to accommodate most special requests. The reason for the 4 stars is because there is often a long wait to get in!"}
{"text":"Truly, as good as it gets! The food is so fresh and so delish! I'm a gal who likes to eat but eventually I decided to try True Food Kitchen and boy am I glad I did. I ordered the quinoa burger (though there is no meat in it) and it was to DIE FOR!!!!!! I left feeling happy and not that \"OH MY GOD, why did I eat that meal\" kind of feeling.  It gets busy so get there early or go on an off time, especially if you don't like to wait.   The restaurant in itself is JUST SO BEAUTIFUL!  Ask for the server Brandon if you go!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Dr. Weil, and my mom took me to True Foods on the way to the airport (I'm from San Francisco). I had Ahi Sliders and my sister got Spaghetti Squash Lasagna. We split a Kale Salad. Everything was amazing!!!! and so good for you! The waitress told us the Lasagna was only like 150 calories for the whole thing. (i think its thing on the menu). They also list which foods are gluten free!!! I went back again last time I was in AZ. I heard one opened up in Scottsdale, and I'll be going t that one next!"}
{"text":"My daughter and i order the spring salad and asked no cheese the other day. We were very suprised and disappointed when saw the no chees salad.... We paid the same price but got less foods. Vegs are soo cheap why not add more green when u customers  could not tolerable cheese.. For the Resturant like this, can u do better next time."}
{"text":"Good food, although portions are small for the price. The street tacos were very good but not enough for dinner. Could use some fizzy beverages that don't cost a fortune ($4.00 for watermelon water?). Nice setting and great outdoor patio with misters. Love coming here."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The outdoor seating is great. The food is clean and very healthy. They have so many options!  I had the ginger agave soda water drink that was great to start off the night. The hostess recommended the hummus plate that came out very quickly. The pita was warm and the hummus was loaded with fresh herbs and veggies. The waitress was very helpful but having gone solo for this outing I was pretty full from the hummus and opted for their chicken chopped salad. It was GREAT!!!!!  It was a very large salad for just one having just had the hummus. The service was fast and very friendly. They are all very knowledgable of the menu and nutritional details.  It's the kind of place that makes you want to eat clean!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Patio has misters which are awesome.   Ordered the cauliflower as an app and it was my favorite part of the meal. They season it so perfect and I'm not even a girl who really enjoys cauliflower!   I had the ancient grain bowl with chicken as my meal and it was good but it had just a little too much of the miso sauce for my liking. It seemed a bit smothered.   It was a busy lunch hour and the service was ok. It took a while to get our business partner his drink after he was a little late due to traffic."}
{"text":"So I forgot my lunch and needed something quick. Options were burgers, burgers, or something similar to burgers. I discovered the take out window at True Food. I asked the very nice server what shake she would recommend to replace lunch. Voila a wonderful tasting protein shake was in my hand in minutes. Yea it hit the spot and filled the void. I will definitely return for a true sit down lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to both True Food Kitchens .. I love both of them. Although I think this one may be my favorite. You are greeted warmly. They have a rockin patio and this time of year it's perfect to hang out on with a glass of one of their organic wines. I like the fact that everything is fresh and it's organic. The staff is good at explaining portion sizes and the menu if you just don't get the concept. This particular day, I had spaghetti squash casserole . Loved it. We had a plate of hummus and pita and each of us had a wine. I don't find it anymore pricier than any other lunch place in Kierland Commons. If you do, well McDonalds is always around the corner somewhere, right?? I love a option like this, when you have a celiac or gluten allergic individual in your group:-)"}
{"text":"LOVE it.. great concept by Dr. Weil & awesome Sam Fox.. clean good food.. organic, veg, and vegan..yet meat on the menu too.. everyone will be happy.. The waiter was a man of intellect on the menu and the concept..as it should be! Had the hummus...some of the best Ive had.. warm pita .. yum. I had the harvest salad.. with butternut squash.. seasonal and fresh from local farms.. Ive nothing to say in negative about True Food.. its just awesome!"}
{"text":"A very unique approach to New Food, the idea to \"prep\" the food in the front of the dining room is quite smart and helps add to the image of \"True\"food. This Fox guy is quite good, but the dollars are more than the bite.    I love the kale approach and fun new healthy ingredient are in the lime light. I would need a few visits to give a more complete review. From what I hear Pei Wei has put some Kung Pow in this group and we may see more in the coming!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda embarrassed to admit this, but I ate here 3 times in 3 days.  Yes, you read that right.  The first day I stopped in for lunch.  I went with the kale salad and spaghetti squash casserole (plus chicken).  It was SO good - perfect flavor, perfect portion.    The next day I stopped in for dinner.  This time, I went with the kale salad and the turkey burger (with no bun).  Delicious, just delicious.  Probably the best turkey burger I've ever had.   They talked me into the squash pie for dessert.   It was incredible.  Try it.  The next day I stopped in for lunch.  Got the kale salad with chicken.  That kale salad is something special.    Oh yeah, get the iced green tea.  It is the most refreshing drink imaginable.    Between TFK and amazing weather, I'm so sad to be leaving Scottsdale tomorrow."}
{"text":"My dream restaurant!  I wish we had one here in MI.  I'm fortunate to get to visit my mom in Scottsdale many times a year and always forget to review the places we dine when I'm there. So, here is one VERY deserving review.  The menu makes you want to try everything.  On my many visits I've had fish tacos, spaghetti squash, kale salad, veg crudites, shiitake lettuce cups.  ALL so clean, fresh and delicious. From what I understand most of the food is local and bought from sustainable sources and it reflects in the finished product.  They offer such a fun variety of drinks and many different healthy concoctions for those that don't want to imbibe.  The service is top-notch and I have never had even one remotely bad experience with the staff!    My mom is lucky enough to live near The Quarter and gets to go here often.  She even carrys-out at least once a wk.  JEALOUS!"}
{"text":"True food.. Can't go wrong everything is amazing! From the freshly squeeze juices to the very fresh soups and salad.  It is the Best place to eat while you wait at Apple Store"}
{"text":"A very meh experience. The food was just ok, turkey burger needed some oomph, couldn't taste the jalapeño concoction supposedly on top - the server couldn't hear me ask for anything it was so loud, and my mom couldn't hear anything we were saying. We were sat at a community table and a man at the other end of the table kept using foul language in front of our child, so inappropriate. Very expensive for what you get. It was nice to be eating healthy."}
{"text":"As soon as you sit down - you can only help but feel healthy. They get a big thumbs up for interior decor and A+ on the service - very attentive from the door welcome to the check. I am trying to low-carb these days (post holiday!) so I ventured straight to the salad section - although I did notice the pizzas, sandwiches and lighter fare on the menu. I will definitely be back to try other menu items. I can only say that Fox Restaurants can never steer me in the wrong direction it seems - CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Old Fashioned. This is awesome. A piece of Wisconsin in Phoenix at a health food restaurant. I was shocked. The old fashioned was wonderful. So good I had two. Let's say I am comfortable. I hope the nutritious food will counteract the whiskey."}
{"text":"What I wouldn't give to live near a True Food. My PHX friends have often told me of this place but I finally skipped my other regular places and headed to Dr. Wiels place. I was on a gluten free food trial and saw the mushroom pizza on the menu which can be made gluten free.  I sat at the bar even though the patio was very inviting. The bar was awesome and I felt like it was my mother ship! I could see all the fresh fruit, veggies and juices. The bartender was sending out all sorts of things from beer and wine to delicious looking cocktails.  I ordered a gluten free cider and the pizza and it might just be the best pizza I've ever had. I made myself only eat half so I could finish it on the drive back to Tucson- that didn't pan out so well. I think I made it to chandler bf I had to finish it! Generally the prices are high but you're getting delicious great quality good for you food!"}
{"text":"Where to even begin with tonight's dinner experience... first off I've always been a fan of true foods from their food to their service; however tonight was one of the best dining experiences I've had pretty much anywhere and we owe it to our server, Lourian. Saying he was phenomenal is an understatement. One of my girl friends and I wanted to stop for a bite, we are both in the service industry and we're just so pleased with everything. His recommendations and menu knowledge was extensive and on point not to mention how adorable and personable he was. Long story short we will be back to see him for sure. Who ever made that hire good job!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant! PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place 4 stars for brunch.  I had the fruit parfait, which was phenomenal and a smoothie--strawberry/banana/etc.  The service initially was spot on, but as the meal progressed and after we got our bill the waitress literally disappeared, not sure if she got off her shift??? I would def recommend this place for brunch!  Nice ambiance and cool how the food prep is out for everyone to see!"}
{"text":"Definitely alot better than what I was expecting. This is one of the few places that I've eaten at, Phoenix or elsewhere, where the decor and set-up reflect the cuisine. For instance, you can see the food being prepared outside of the kitchen and it's all fresh (at least I think it is). It's fresh, it's honest, and it's got nothing to hide. They specialize in foods that are organic as well as several vegetarian friendly dishes (not too sure about vegan though). True Food Kitchen is about as healthy and tasty as food can get in the Valley. There are alot of negative stereotypes with health/vegetarian cuisine. In the back of the layman's mind, he thinks he's going to get horse food. I think that sometimes and I eat vegetarian on a regular basis. Well, be prepared for True Food to destroy those labels.  I ordered the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza and my friend got the chicken one. Both were delicious and tasted, oddly enough, very clean. I don't really know how else to describe it. Fresh equals a clean taste. Anyway, the food is to be experienced and it's well worth it. The portions aren't huge, but that's the point.  One thing I will so however is that you can tell that the people that are die-hards about this place are also from the area (PV/Biltmore). I kinda have a hard time telling if they actually enjoy the food or if they see it as being a very LA type of spot in Phoenix, thus sorta giving themselves points simply because it's trendy. What I'm trying to get to is that I really enjoyed my experience here I really do believe that there is something for everyone (vegetarian/carnivore) here. Just don't expect it to be Madonna's \"Like A Virgin\" in a culinary incarnation that the yuppies tell you. Go there with no expectations and you will have an awesome exprience."}
{"text":"Bland ...overpriced...mediocre and all this so-called anti-inflammatory food gave me the worst indigestion and constipation that I've had in years. We live in a world of expert marketers and Lemmings."}
{"text":"My fam & I are big fans... My mum is obsessed w/the Turkey Burger (opts for wrapped in lettuce & well done) w/the spicy Sambal... I like their Roasted Veggie Platter as well as the Tofu Breakfast Burrito.  I've tried the Edamame dumplings & the Crudites, both tasty.  Cute kids menu also.  We go 2-3 times a month, usually to the Biltimore location as is usually a wait at the Quarter one."}
{"text":"I'm a long time veggie/vegan food snob, and a dining-service snob, frequenting veggie restaurants in Manhattan, Chicago, and Phoenix/Scottsdale.  The veggie/vegan fare isn't world class--nothing is in the Phoenix--but it's the best for the (Phoenix) area.  It's the service that puts it over the top and garners my five stars.  Dan S. writes \"Service lacked any genuine hospitality.\"  Dan... are we talking about the same restaurant?  I've never seen anyone at True Food Scottsdale be anything other than great, if not fantastic.  Maybe I haven't been here for enough rush hours?  Not sure.  Located in the Scottsdale Quarter mall also makes for appealing environment.  The outdoor area makes for wonderful al fresco experience, especially on the east side, next to the courtyard next to the fountains."}
{"text":"Have been to True Foods at the Quarter multiple times, but this was the best experience and food so far. Our server Elizabeth was beyond helpful and gave great suggestions. She informed us of the option to do \"half\" servings of many things on the menu! It allowed us to order more variety and try out different dishes. She recommended the Medicine Man to drink and was an excellent sparkling pomegranate and cranberry soda.  I started with half of the grilled chicken chopped salad. It is a sweet and light salad. We ordered the herb hummus to split and our server also brought us some fresh vegetables to enjoy with the hummus.  For dinner, our server recommended the fresh fish of the day, which was a flaky sea bass. It was served with green beans and antioxidant-rich purple potatoes. Asked for the sauce on the side, but ended up loving it. Loved this dish.  For dessert, our table shared the flourless chocolate cake and the strawberry rhubarb crisp. The chocolate cake was a chewy, and reminded me more of a muffin than a cake. It was okay, but nothing special. The strawberry rhubarb crisp was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream on top was amazing! It's a must try!  Elizabeth made this dining experience memorable and great! Will be back and hopefully seated at her table again!"}
{"text":"I love love love eating here!! I usually get the red chili shrimp; it's so tasty! I've gone home and recreated their Tuscan kale salad (I make this regularly now) and their sweet potato hash because it's so good! I've also had their seared tuna wrap and the spaghetti squash casserole and both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"We travel a lot and eating healthy and good used to be so hard to do in the US. We are so glad we found True Food all over the country. Great and healthy food."}
{"text":"Everything about food and service at True Food is amazing. The crudites (croo-de-tay) (order the large one to start) is epic and is a must see appetizer. True Food + Scottsdale Q = best night out"}
{"text":"I WANT TO EAT HERE EVERYDAY.  Please come to Minneapolis?  Otherwise, I guess I'm fine taking frequent vacations to Arizona too.  True Foods uses tons of delicious and healthy veggies, meats, and spices.  Where else can one go to get a humongous bowl of fresh veggies (this was a hilarious amount of veggies!), a spaghetti squash entree, or a kale house salad?  My companions said their bloody mary's were to die for (hello freshly squeezed tomato juice!).  I opted for a local brew, and they also had a variety of fun non-alcoholic drinks with fresh fruit juices.  We split a variety of different plates, which was a fun way to explore their delicious menu. I cannot wait to come back here, and see what they have in store for the next season!"}
{"text":"No more than two weeks after my virginal visit to True Food Kitchen in Walnut Creek, I found myself looking for a healthy dinner in the Biltmore Fashion Park shopping center in Phoenix, and lo and behold, here was another True Food Kitchen. Little did I know this was the original one founded by alternative medicine guru Andrew Weil who based the menu on an \"anti-inflammatory food pyramid'. I don't know what the hell that means but that high-falutin' approach translates into a heavily vegetarian/vegan menu which was fine by me. I played it safe the first time by ordering Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon and Spaghetti Squash Casserole (no cheese please) and was quite satisfied (review: http://bit.ly/2zOmRJs).  This time I felt a bit more audacious and first ordered the $9 Edamame Dumplings, which were surprisingly savory since they contained just dashi, white truffle oil, and Asian herbs to go along with the smashed soybeans. The meltably tasty wrappers helped add to the satisfaction of the rather soupy dish (photo: http://bit.ly/2yQGY9H). To complete my dinner, I went with the $10 Shiitake Lettuce Cups. The filling was, well, filling as it combined tofu, jicama, sambal, Thai basil, and cashew into a substantial mound of flavor easily scoopable (photo: http://bit.ly/2hiRds1). I just thought it rather odd that they presented long Romaine lettuce leaves as the wrappers as they aren't naturally grabble and cuppable like good ol' deconstructed iceberg wedges (photo: http://bit.ly/2AzWKmt).  It was still tasty, but I misjudged the ratio of filling to lettuce leaf and had too much filling left. Not a bad problem because it was good all by itself, almost like a moo shu pork without the pork. Frankly all the dishes sound good here. Healthy too with a bit of an Asian accent on a lot of them like Teriyaki Quinoa and Spicy Panang Curry. The salads looked appetizing as they passed by, especially the $14 one that featured seasonal ingredients like asparagus and broccolini. The place was pretty packed for a weeknight with fit and aspiring-to-be-fit Phoenicians. No matter what end of the food pyramid I was eating, I just like what Dr. Weil has attempted to do here since the menu combines healthy and tasty in a refreshing way.  FOOD - 4 stars...tasty and healthy on the same plate is always a good thing AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious if a bit loud, even the counter allows for elbow room SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive considering the flow of diners coming in and out TOTAL - 4 stars...truly true food indeed"}
{"text":"Very hip popular place to go and have a healthy meal...... Personally I don't see what all the hype is about, the food was just Meh, and grossly overpriced for the portion size. The watermelon bubbly drink was pretty good, and others enjoyed their drinks as well. Overall it was ok, but not somewhere I could see going again as the food was just mediocre, and the noise level was too high to even have a conversation.  If your vegan, or gluten free it's a good option..... Just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Was in phx for 3 days and ate dinner here 2x.  everything was delicious and healthy,.  edame dumplings and the turkey lasanga is amazing. Will always stop by a true kitchen restaurant whenever i am near one."}
{"text":"Love this place, never get sick of it and they change the menu but always keep the best things.  The atmosphere is great if you can sit outside.  The only negative is the wait can be long for lunch during weekdays so avoid 11:30-1 if possible!"}
{"text":"I love their food, especially the vegetable crudite. The staff are most often very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Attention Buffalo Burger Fans! True Food is in it to win it! Ridiculously juicy, plump, fresh and full of flavor. This was the last place in the world I would expect to get a high quality bison burger. Great drinks, great sides, good atmosphere and full of energy. Don't plan on getting in right away around lunch time. Little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in True Food Kitchen for a quick bite to eat with 2 kids. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole (I love spaghetti squash) and the kids ordered teriyaki chicken bowl and ravioli. I really liked my spaghetti squash - just right portion size and very tasty. The kids teriyaki bowl with quinoa was excellent!! The ravioli was a bit small portion-wise, and wasn't as appealing as the teriyaki, but still good.  The service was fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly - which we appreciated since we were on a tight schedule. We were here at 4pm though, so there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Nice atmosphere, and the patio was lovely (although we didn't sit out there because it was August). The bill was $30, which seems a bit steep considering I didn't have anything but water. I guess that's what you pay in Scottsdale Quarter for fresh, organic food though. Still, it just seems a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. The food was fresh and delicious and the atmosphere was very nice. I met up with old friends and we were able to enjoy great conversation despite the restaurant being very busy. The exterior of the restaurant is also purely magical. It's in an outdoor shopping center, and the restaurant is surrounded by beautiful palm trees with twinkling lights. I took away one star because our server took our drink order, but then forgot to bring us our drinks. We barely noticed because were talking so much. The manager removed our first drink order from the bill without us asking, which is sort of unheard of. Great customer service, really friendly people, and yummy food!"}
{"text":"I love True Food every time I visit.  The food is simple and covers the full range for all types of diets.  Every time I visit Scottsdale I make sure to eat here."}
{"text":"Good for the health nut. Have Vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. I love love love the cucumber martini!  Red Chili Shrimp but I swap the shrimp out for chicken... delicious choice if you like spicy noodles.  Sausage pizza is yummy and the shaved turkey is to die for!  My husband is in love with the kale salad side too!  Kale-aid is delicious if you are looking for healthy and non alcoholic."}
{"text":"It has the best chips served with guacamole! Salad was good but chicken was barely even there. Hence the three stars. Otherwise good food and drinks with a place to hangout in dinner."}
{"text":"TF is the best. They having fabulous service, healthy options, tasty food and the portions are perfect. I was so conflicted on what to eat, because they all sound great. To help me make my selection, she brought me tasters! I've been to TF in Newport Beach and now in Phoenix has become a favorite as well. If you're reading this...just do it - you'll love it!"}
{"text":"True Food indeed! The mixed reviews are telling so I am going to rate this purely from my experience last night. I started out with the hamachi and pomegranate sashimi. Wow, the combination was mouth watering after I ate my first piece. Who would have thought pomegranate with hamachi?   I ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp. The dish involved more than just that of which it had perfectly cooked vegetables that brought out the flavor. I was pleasantly satisfied with the texture of the crispy vegetables and the soft rice noodles with a hit of curry. It was one of those dishes where in the beginning you question \"I can't really taste anything\" but then you take a couple more bites and it comes together. You start understanding why the combination of the celery, chards, cilantro with this type of curry and . . . okay I am just going to stop. It's one dish and it did it for me. We also ordered the caramelized onion tart with Gorgonzola and figs. I was not impressed and would recommend trying a different appetizer because there were many appetizers that sounded delicious .   They also offered all these creative healthy juices, which I want to try next time. Overall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress seemed to be very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in making our choices. This is obvious but I have to give True Food credit for creating yummy dishes using mostly organic, flax, and gluten free. The decor was very open, airy, and Frank Lloyd Wrightish."}
{"text":"We had heard the True Food was a great place to eat, so decided to try it out on a Friday night. We sat at a high top table near another family. As we searched over our menu, the time kept ticking and no server came to our table to ask for our drink order. At least 10 minutes passed, and finally my husband went over and asked the hostess to send someone over. I ordered water with lemon, it came without and was lukewarm with no ice. We ordered our food and it all tasted okay, but neither my husband and I were impressed with portion sizes and high prices. His tacos were teeny and he could hardly pick them up without the tortillas breaking. The spaghetti squash casserole was tasty but I was still hungry after. We were not impressed and probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Great service.....but mediocre food. The kale juice was a rip-off...diluted and glass full with ice. The humus dip was too sour with lemon....and the buffalo burger was salty!"}
{"text":"Recently we were in town and went here for brunch. Literally everything we had was delicious. From the beginning to end both food and service was top notch. I had a mimosa as well as some veggie and eggs (can't remember the name). My husband had the breakfast sandwich, and that was bomb as well. The location is great as well since we were able to let our friends' toddler wander around afterwards. Would love to try it again when we visit again!"}
{"text":"Visited with a friend to catch up on some long overdue girl talk.  This is NOT the place to do it - could hardly hear her across the table, but heard the conversation next to me all too clear - the aucostics in this place are awful and honestly even though the meals were great (overpriced but tasty) I will not be returning until it's warm enough to eat outdoors so you are not competing with the ceiling - odd to not return to restaurant due to noise level but it really was that bad."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed - bring some patience. The food is very fresh and fantastic. I have tried several dishes and none of them disappoint me."}
{"text":"Open concept where everything happens in front of you. Somewhat annoying techo beat music. The usual non recognizable songs that all sound the same. Small portions. We ordered a starter plate consisting of a few broccoli sprigs, a half dozen romaine leaves, white carrots some cauliflower on a huge bed of ice. Not rice, ice. At $13, don't try to break down the cost of what it is. It's a bucks worth of veggies for $13. I had Salmon for $23. Small portions again. We also had chicken and spaghetti squash. 3 drinks, Total $100. Everything was tasty, but as a non vegetarian, only the people who love to get by on 500 calories a day will fawn and splurge over this venue. Won't go back. The same food for half the price would get me a second look."}
{"text":"Delicious dinner.  Left feeling healthy not bloated and stayed on my food plan. Love the edamame dumplings and cucumber lemonade!"}
{"text":"Another one of the fabulous culinary masterpieces of Fox Restaurants. Went here for dinner on a Thursday night with the BF. The 25 minute wait for a table was well worth it, even though we had scoped out the neighboring competition. The concept is inspiring and the food options excite my taste buds. I am willing to pay a little extra for healthy, sustainable foods- it's the San Fran in me.  We started with the sashimi tuna salad. Loaded with fresh veggies, generous amount of tuna mixed with a light and zesty ginger dressing.   Our main dish was the spaghetti squash casserole which they split for us half with chicken and half without for me, the quasi-sporadic vegetarian.  For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was delightful. Although, I should have ordered my own to avoid the vulture-like antics as we both inhaled every scrumptious morsel. My learned sophistication reminded me that licking the plate is unacceptable.   Bottom-line: I would come back for the atmosphere, service and ostensible bio-dynamic food!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed brunch at True Food when I was here on Sunday with a chicken sausage vegetable omelette.  This is a great place for people with dietary restrictions.  I really enjoyed brunch way more than the dinner menu, but I will need to re-visit to update my decision.    This place is a little more pricey but they stress the idea of a seasonal menu that nourishes your mind, body and spirit. Can't ask for more if it is all fresh food, they truly know how to be innovative with all healthy ingredients.  Also, try one of the fresh drinks, they are all super delicious.  Both drinks that my friend and I ordered, we both loved.  I had the Hangover RX (although I didn't need a hangover remedy).  True Food is in a great location in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  Indoor seating is nice, a little overcrowded, but outdoor patio is a great - of course in a cooler climate.  But it is relaxing if you get the chance, the misters are out.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned at first as multiple wait staff wizzed by me as I sat at the bar for lunch but I was greeted within a few minutes and my nice waitperson asked me for my drink order and then took my lunch order I had the quinoa burger with a delicious kale salad  both were fab"}
{"text":"I love True Food Kitchen!  Took my cousin for her 1st experience and she asked to go back again the next day.  Both of us have dietary restrictions and the waiters never get frustrated with our requests.  Super healthy menu, never leave feeling guilty."}
{"text":"Just an update on this restaurant for my second trip to the Phoenix area. I'm still avoiding the healthy drinks on the menu. But the food is just too good that I'm updating my review to 5 stars. The Harvest salad is just as I remembered it and is still the best salad I've ever eaten. This time we had the Chicken Sausage pizza, which was pretty good, but I'm always impressed with the crust. This meal we had fish: the Black Cod in a miso broth was so sweet and tender. And the Arctic Char (seasonal) was cooked perfectly with a great kale salad on the side. And the service was very friendly and expeditious as usual."}
{"text":"How do I even start?????? I am a meat, fries, and coke type gal. This place is clean eating. NO sodas! No fries! I order the grass fed burger, it was almost great, the bus was hard. I ordered the flourless chocolate cake, it was surprisingly very very good. My friends liked what they ordered. The inside is really nice looking and the staff was very friendly. They have outside seating. Our waiter was pretty amazing, he surprised me by going next door and getting me a coke! That's service my friends. Check out my photos!"}
{"text":"Just don't get the concept and pricing.  None of the food really jumps out at me.  But others seem to disagree as it's always packed at lunch with youngish affluent types.  Had the turkey burger today.  Tasty enough but poorly constructed or conceived.  Too many sliding parts.  Bun got soggy too and sandwich basically fell apart before I could finish it.  That Plus patty and contents kept sliding out of the bun.  $14.  Smh.  Ate here at wife's request.  Wouldn't return if it was up to me."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu of the highest quality foods in the world.  Can't wait until they come to Seattle."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and amazing service! Tons of healthy and vegan/vegetarian options. The salads are fresh and diverse and the example dumplings were as amazing."}
{"text":"In our quest for health and to decrease our expanding waistlines, my friends and I agreed to try True Food Kitchen for our monthly get-together.  We were seated promptly in a corner booth on the patio. I loved the ambiance, as we were looking for a super casual environment and this place didn't disappoint.   Our server was personable and very knowledgable about the menu.  The inside out quinoa burger was delicious and filling. However,  my favorite part of my meal was the kale salad, which was one of my two sides. It was appropriately dressed in a lemon vinaigrette that complimented, not overpowered the kale. The sweet potato hash was delicious as well, although I'm not sure what exactly made it a \"hash\".  I can attest to the fact that one of my friends' ordered the panang curry and it smelled delicious. I don't even like curry!  Another friend ordered the steak street tacos. She really liked them. My friend that ordered the salmon was thoroughly impressed with it which made me a little sad I didn't order it!  One Person in our party ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. It looked amazing!! Covered in cheese and tomato sauce. Actually, there was so much cheese I question how healthy that particular meal actually is!  All in all it was a great experience and I am anxious to return!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time eating here. I was so amazing at the many wonderful choices... gluten free, vegan and grass fed meat. We got the grass fed steak tacos and the salmon curry. I had to hold myself back from licking the bowl it was SO delicious! The servers were courteous and attentive, very prompt and friendly...  I highly recommend this place... I could eat here everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy food! I am all about eating healthy and cutting out pesticides and this place fits the bill. Their food is fresh and delicious and they have a wide range of foods to fit many different diet choices. I will definitely come back. The only drawback is the vegetarian options are a little more expensive then most other places."}
{"text":"True Foods delivered again. We had an awful experience at The Mission a few nights and our group came back to True Food for lunch. We had an even better experience than last time. Jared, our server, made excellent recommendations and treated us so kindly and always with a smile. We had a problem with our soup and the manager came out, apologized sincerely, and another lady came out to apologize when our meal was taking a little longer to come out. The food was fantastic, and the chocolate cake dessert was mind blowing! Thank you so much, True Food. We loved the welcome and the food so much that we came back the next day to the same level of service from Mackenzie. I feel like the manager, Mark, really sets the awesome tone for this restaurant, as he touched our table with every visit and was out on the floor helping his staff every time we were there. He even read me my Facebook notifications off the phone I left there (like an idiot) when I called to check if they had it, haha! I cannot wait until they're in Bellevue, WA!  My favorite nibbles from True Food Kitchen during my week there were: The Mediterranean Quinoa Salad (refreshing!), the Tataki (drool), the Hangover Rx drink (only if you like coconut water, though!), the Seabass (drool), the spicy shrimp (drool), the matcha horchata (mega-drool), and the flourless chocolate cake (save. room. for. this.). As a Seattle-ite, I've got to give them props--their seafood is spot on!  Thanks guys. You'll see me again soon :)"}
{"text":"Apparently something is healthy if you can put the words \"organic,\" \"Wild,\" or \"Natural\" in front of each main ingredient.  At least this is what True Food Kitchen would have you believe.  Naturally I went here with a good friend of mine for lunch. We had a short wait to sit on the patio. We started with the hummus appetizer. I was not impressed at all, granted I am a hummus snob (Go Sabra!). The Pita slices could have used a nice grilling, and the veggies were pedestrian.   For my meal I had the Ahi tuna sliders. It came with a sweet potato hash. The sliders were small and the ahi was a bit overdone for my tastes, the wasabi mayo covered the overdone nature of the Ahi. This is where I again question this healthy nature, copious amounts of mayo is not healthy when compared with the option of properly seared ahi. The sweet Potato hash was acceptable. The meal left me hungry however.  The Organic Service was sub par, and the exposed tattoos and odd hair colors of the wait staff seemed unbecoming of a place with prices this high.   Given a choice of Fox restaurant concepts this is not my first."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as was the service! I ordered a bowl without protein and my server brought out the food with protein. I didn't mind, but I ordered without simply based on price. They were apologetic and brought me a to-go meal how I originally ordered it and did not charge me for the added protein. They were so sweet and always checked up on how we were doing. I will definitely come here every time im in the area!"}
{"text":"Contrary to my idiotic notion when I first walked in, this is not a vegan restaurant, you can happily be a meat lover and eat here.   Between the delectable drinks and th Grass Fed Bison Burger, I was feeling overall very happy. I couldn't get enough of the mayo/aoili concoction on the burger. But the best part of  the meal was when the waitress asked if I wanted the Kale salad or the sweet potato hash browns, she let me have both after I stared at her for far too long trying to decide whether I should be healthy or not. WOAH! Why don't more places suggest both sides?!  I would say that the sweet potato hash browns were cut too small, so they burnt. Other than that, the meal was phenomenal and I should have been going there every night. I definitely didn't have enough Acai Blueberry Mojitos and Watermelon Roses to curb my craving."}
{"text":"Spaghetti squash and add chicken!! I hate squash of any sort but the guy next to me ordered it and it smelled tasty. I dont regret ordering it.. amazing!!!! The service is attentive and the menu is large enough that you have many options. I will give this Sam Fox restaurant five stars"}
{"text":"There are very few places that I eat where the food is better than what I can cook at home. Including Fleming Steakhouse where my husband wanted to go for his birthday, and our bill was over $200.  I just ate at True Food Kitchen and had to kill guacamole and the grass fed beef burger and that was the best meal I have had in years. Absolutely delicious. You will not be sorry if you eat here. It seems like a vegetable kind of place but it actually has very good meat selections.  I've never had a grass-fed burger that tasted good, and the one I ate today was absolutely delicious. It's going to be hard to not want to go there all the time. And I also got the food to go so I didn't even eat it Fresh Off The Grill I didn't eat it for about 20 minutes after I picked it up. That says a lot."}
{"text":"Great great restaurant, the ahi slider is amazingly done, and you got to try the cucumber refresher, it really does reshen you up.  Although, i have heard from alot of people saying that it's not a \"healthy food place\" because none of their dishes are uder 500 calaries.  If thats what you are looking for, then i suggest you stay home and chew on carrot stickes.  I think the food here has a great refreshing appeal, and paired pefectly with their juices.  Definitely not the type of food thats gonna send you to the hospital with a heartattach."}
{"text":"I had been to this location once before, liked the concept, and decided to bring a friend to try it out yesterday.  Let's start off with what I liked: The Honeydew seasonal soda was refreshing and not too sweet.   The Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce cups had good flavor and texture, despite being extremely messy.  Now for the rest of our experience: Firstly I should make it clear that I am not picky.  If I am hungry, I will eat anything. We ordered the Sea Bass Fish Tacos and the \"TLT\"(tempeh bacon BLT) sandwich to split.  The tacos were not good.  The fish was soggy and had almost no texture or flavor.  So much so that myself and my friend, though we arrived very hungry, didn't even attempt to finish them.  The sandwich was ok, and the sweet potato mash that came on the side was completely undercooked, still crunchy.  Overall, a \"meh\" meal. I'm not one to penny pinch when it comes to a meal.  But to pay $15 for an entree that I didn't even want to finish sucked.  Now on to the service.  I get it, TFK is a busy place.  Being in the service industry myself, I am generally very understanding and patient.  Our server never even refilled our waters, or asked if we might want another soda (I did).  She was also way too touchy-feely.  After we finally received our check, I requested that she take my part out of  two 20s, and put the other half on my friends card.  Ten minutes later, she arrived to tell me that she was very busy and it \" wasn't worth it to her to give me change for the second twenty\", and that I could just keep the tip.    Now I don't know if she made the assumption that my tip wouldn't be worth her time because of my age, apparel, what have you.  But it felt like a huge slap in the face, considering that I was going to tip her my normal 40% despite getting shoddy service and not enjoying my meal.  I've never been treated like that, and I would never treat someone that way.   It's been made very clear to me by that server that True Foods Kitchen doesn't need my business.  So guys, you got your wish.  I won't ever be back and I'll make sure to let my friends know why."}
{"text":"True Foods is an excellent spot to indulge in a savory and flavorful meal but also be health conscious about it. Their menu is based on non-inflammatory and healthy foods, yet every dish is carefully crafted to provide a unique taste. I recently got the grilled chicken salad, which was light and delicious. It has a nice crunch with the apples in it, and the chicken was very savory. My sister got the vegan TLT sandwich. The sandwich comes with one side, and it shockingly tastes like BLT.   Overall, the service was excellent from the lovely host, who greeted us in the entrance, to the waiter who served us. Always a favorite spot to go to!"}
{"text":"So disappointed!  I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while, being on a very restrictive diet (low FODMAP).  I asked if the spaghetti squash casserole had any onions, garlic or sugar.  The waitress checked for me and said it had onions and garlic in the sauce, but they could omit the onions.  I asked how much garlic they used and she was unable to give me an answer.  I asked if I could have the sauce on the side and she said sure.  My friend ordered the same dish without the modifications and hers was a good portion with melted cheese on top.  Mine was a small bowl of the squash (probably about 1.5 cups) with sauce on the side.  No cheese.  We had a limited amount of time, so I started eating my squash.  I tried the sauce, but it had way too much garlic.  When I was about half way through my \"meal\", the waitress checked on us and I mentioned the forgotten cheese.  She left and when I was about two bites from finishing my squash, she presented a small bowl of shredded cheese.  So I paid $13 for a small bowl of squash."}
{"text":"Best spaghetti squash casserole I have ever had. I felt like I was having real Italian lasagna. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"First time and we did it right. Tried many of the menu options.  I liked that the honey cucumber lemonade wasn't too sweet.  The guacamole was interesting as it included grapefruit.  My favorite of the four salads were the Tuscan kale salad and the the chicken salad.  Teriyaki quinoa bowl was tasty and flavorful. I really liked the the margarita pizza was very light and thin.  They lost a star for the customer service. I wish the waitress would've been more friendly and engaging, but it was obvious she just wanted to go home.  If I go back I would definitely get the chicken salad again along with the margarita pizza.  For dessert, the flan was definitely the best. Followed by the awesome flourless chocolate cake and the fresh key lime pie."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! It is healthy, local and seasonal! Based off a True Food cookbook which is found on Amazon. I have eaten at the restaurant a few times when I am in town. I have also bought the cookbook which every dish I have made is fantastic! These people know what they are doing with healthy, gourmet food!!!"}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian Grass fed beef burger.  What?  Yes it was!  It was fed grass, so I'm eating vegetarian.  Oh the technicality!!!  Yeah...yeah...I heard yah.  I'm a living grave for dead beasts...but it sure was juicy!  My sister was better and had the Salmon with kelp noodle salad.  That was also very good. So good, I found the kelp noodles at Whole Foods and replicated the super easy recipe.  My other sister also did better than me and had the Turkey Burger.  She liked enjoyed it as well.    I wasn't too crazy about their desserts...not much choices.  The banana mesquite crust tart was just okay.  But the organic coffee was worth the price."}
{"text":"Good food , lots of vegetarian option. Fresh juice and refreshing cocktails. Attending staff. I hope they will open in Maryland ."}
{"text":"I had the turkey burger and it was amazing! I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING here is delicious.  I have never been disappointed in any of it.  It also is really nice to be next to everyone preparing the fresh food for you.  The service is very friendly, and usually pretty quick for a sit-down restaurant.  There are options for vegetarians, vegans, and the omnivorous.  If you get a chance, try the Medicine Man- an amazing rush of antioxidants that will make you feel wonderful for the rest of the day!  I cannot say enough great things about this place.  Just GO."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for work and being a vegetarian, decided to check this place out. The food is amazing! I wish they had one in NYC. My favorite dish was the edamame dumplings! We also tried the roasted seasonal vegetable board, which was colorful and fun to taste, the herb hummus, and the spaghetti squash casserole. Everything I tried was delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. How do they make healthy food so delicious!  Good thing this restaurant isn't close to my house or I would run up quite a bill eating out."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to True Food at the Biltmore location. It was nothing short of spectacular. From the service, to the drinks, the food, the atmosphere- everything was truly phenomenal!   Our server, Desirée, made everything so enjoyable. From an incredible introduction to the restaurant, to great drink suggestions, and even better food options.   I have to commend the manager, Ari, as well- she came over and made sure everything was flawless. Service was incredible, and we all truly enjoyed the environment and the evening as a whole. I wholeheartedly recommend True Food Biltmore to anyone who is looking for a fun, fresh, and healthy culinary experience. Keep doing what you're doing Desiree and Ari! I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"In the Kierland area in Scottsdale there are a ton of restaurants, most of them amazing, and I've always gravitated toward The California inspired style of the Green House restaurant in Kierland shopping center. With my parents though while visiting from NYC, we decided to try something different, and though the menu can be a little scary if you are not used to healthy eating ( it SCREAMS Healthnut & trendy), we like to eat healthy so we tried it and were quite pleased all around.  Though the wait was 30 minutes, possibly closer to 40, they have a ton of outdoor seating for you to wait and rest and you can get a cocktail or a smoothie while you wait, though we were fine just waiting... The place is humongous has amazing indoor space with high ceilings, is not crowded and you do not feel stuffed in and the staff is there with a huge smiles and really working to make your experience great.   Luckily we were sat in a great booth in the middle of the restaurant - tons of people watching and a very comfortable seat. The menu is a little all over the place - you don't really know what you want in my opinion, because they have these amazing salads, healthy pizzas and then on the other hand edamame dumplings and tofu cashew lettuce wraps... It was almost Asian influence in some sections and not in others but I digress...   The salads are very specific to your taste and though the chopped chicken salad sounded great I am not a huge cranberry, date, fig person so that's three whole ingredients I would not like and the other salads were very specific as well with the ingredients... The salad did look amazing though!!!  My mom had the mushroom asparagus pizza and it was really nicely done, almost a flatbread, a little greasy but it is what it is.  And then there was the Seabass... I couldn't in my mind justify waiting 40 minutes for a $13 salad - if I was going to try this new restaurant, I am visiting from New York, it's going to be something special on their menu so the Seabass was calling my name and I went with my gut and everyone at the table was jealous.    The sustainable Seabass came with asparagus spears, sugar snap peas, roasted mushrooms and was placed on top of a quinoa like grain with a light lemon emulsion... It was not too creamy, or two saucy - it was fantastic!  My stomach is growling as I think about it now.  Everyone was satisfied with their meals though they did covet mine a bit and for good reason - the taste & the balance of flavors, the perfectly cooked Seabass - I could not have asked for a better lunch.  Did I mention the Seabass was out of this world?  If I was here for longer this trip we would definitely go back - but it is on my list for next Thanksgiving... I am very interested to see what their brunch is like."}
{"text":"Nice ambience with both in doors and outdoors seatings. Mist makers keep outside seating area to be pleasant on hot AZ days. I ordered Medicine Man (Sea Buckthorn, Pomegranate, Cranberry,Honey, Black Tea & Soda) and was anticipating it to be more sweet but came out tasting more like cranberry juice minus the sugar. It was good to taste nevertheless. Ordered humus which comes with sliced cucumbers and cherry tomato as well as thin sliced pita bread (crunchier approaching bruschetta quality). For main course I had Moroccan half chicken which comes on top of chick peas and spinach. It had drizzle of fig puree. So had bit of sweet taste to it.It was unique taste combination. Usually I get teriyaki bowl which has shiitake, carrots and brown rice with shrimp but decided to try something new. It was worth it. I would try that again. There fish tacos are also very good. Overall great food and service..."}
{"text":"We are visiting on business to Phoenix for the first time. We can't stop coming back to True Food Kitchen. The service, the food, the vibe = all incredible! Organic, fresh, light, delic!!! Go visit Nate at the the bar. (It's where we sit every time.) He will take GREAT care of you. #true #honest #greengoddess Thanks, Nate!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options. Good for people watching. Ginger Ale made to order. Mediterranean Chicken salad was good yet pricey"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants. I've been coming for years now and it is always on point. Tonight I was blown away again and figured I'd finally write this review. We started off with the edamame dumplings (as we always do) and then we tried the Roasted Artichoke pizza which is a vegan pizza. Let me tell you, it was delicious. The almond ricotta is phenomenal. Even my boyfriend who isn't huge and on vegan food, especially faux cheese, wanted to get another one to go! Everything else on their menu is delicious. Other favorites are Red Chili Noodles, Spaghetti Squash Casserole, Kale Salad, and my boyfriend loves the turkey burger. I always crave this place and I hope they continue to thrive."}
{"text":"This place use to be amazing but, I feel like it slightly went down hill.  I still love the concept though and some of their unique dishes/drinks."}
{"text":"Food was really flavorful and not overly greasy.  We did takeout.  It was fast and easy.  The only issue was finding the place.  They need more signage on the major roads to show how to get there.  My wife and I are pretty choosy about eating out because of some health challenges.  My wife is gluten intolerant, has allergies to cooking oils and a bunch of other things.  True Food was very accommodating AND the food tasted great.  Great place to go if you want something tasty and healthy."}
{"text":"Loved this place. So difficult to find vegan/vegetarian places when we travel but True Food had a great selection of everything for all types of eaters. Food was awesome, service was fantastic, will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, food was quality and had excellent flavor. The only problem was the price, you have to pay extra for meat."}
{"text":"With my new vegetarian diet, I can no longer get the turkey bolognese that I had previously raved about.  I ended up here last week and decided on the tofu curry and it was totally a win.  I barely even missed the previously favorite meat dish!  Everything from my previous review still applies."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food and atmosphere but in the 3 times I have been to this location, the service has been terrible. I waited 45 minutes for a salad and another 20 minutes to get my credit card back after I paid as I watched my waiter serve other guests."}
{"text":"Love it, the food is great, the seating, the servers, quality of food is really fresh and light, they don't have anything that is greasy, their lasagna, I'm not a lasagna person if not made by my wife, but this True Foods lasagna is fabulous.   Love this place."}
{"text":"A couple of beers, a chicken sausage pizza and an order of spaghetti squash...what a great lunch in a posh location.  A much needed escape from a really hot summer day.  Our very helpful server  went through the entire food pyramid, and told us about Dr. Weil's quest to serve tasty healthy foods while utilizing his pyramid.  Truthfully, healthy was just a bonus and hopefully helped to fight off the negative effects of the two beers I downed however I did think that the food was really fresh and full of flavor.  So much so, that I find myself driving around my home town of Oahu wishing we had one of these restaurants here.  The decor lends itself to a mod industrial green vibe with tan wooden floors, metal chairs white stone counters and pot lights you might see in a 1930's meat packing plant.  Very chic, and very Scottsdale.  Apparently they have a good breakfast and dinner menu as well.  I'll make sure to come back next time I'm in town.  In the mean time, I'll just keep hoping one comes to Honolulu."}
{"text":"So I had no idea about this place before I showed up, other than it's my Phoenix based friend's *favorite* place and she's willing to drive an hour to get to it.   I love healthy eating, and was intrigued by the lunch menu, which ranged from really different salads (I live in the mountains - kale & lemon is decidedly exotic).  The plates that came out all looked so appetizing, and slightly higher end cuisine than the health food I'm accustomed to seeing.    My friend is a kale addict, so we had the kale salad and the kale & roast garlic pizza.  The salad was terrific, much better than my lame attempts at taming raw lacinato kale.  Our server must have been new (or frazzled) for we never received the 'Andrew Weil' card about the philosophy of the place.  The only reason I figured out he was involved was when I saw him sitting not 10 feet from me at a booth across the aisle, chatting amiably with his table mates, in a white apron.   Phoenix celebrity sighting!  Overall I really liked the concept of the place, and while one lunch there doesn't give me a full picture, it, more than anything else I experienced in this city, would encourage me to come back to the desert.  For someone who loathes temperatures above 70 degrees, that should be considered high praise."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. However, the food was drenched in oil and really left both my husband and I uninterested in returning. We were so hoping to love this place because as vegans, there are so few healthy restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"I used to love true food, but lately the quality has been terrible. Nothing tastes fresh, items are overcooked, dry, tasteless. It has been highly disappointing. I used to go here all the time, and now any time someone suggests it I decline and suggest somewhere else. I hope they fix whatever is going on."}
{"text":"Healthy options for both vegetarians and meat eaters. I love their non alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"It is weird that I do not have a review for True Food Kitchen, seeing as I know I wrote one for their fabulous bison burger I inhaled ( hmm I mean ate slowly) over a year ago. I was just here again last week literally days before my lovely friend Melissa had her beautiful baby girl Isla! We had a chance to catch up while she enjoyed a huge bowl of Panang Chicken curry and I once again snarfed down a bison burger with half kale and half sweet potatoes ( I will admit I only ate half my burger and took the rest home to enjoy the next day). I swear if you have not enjoyed a bison burger from True Food Kitchen, your a really missing out. It is a lean cut of meat and it was cooked medium rare. Topped off with some onions and a little mayo on a Parmesan flax seed bun and washed down with Pomegranate limeade sweet baby Jesus I was in heaven! Ok now that I have made myself hungry once again, scoot your booty on over and check out their menu. It is healthy and good for you so that in itself lets you know that you are already winning before you place order!"}
{"text":"Great food...great service...and they even brought out a little birthday surprise!!! You get the best feeling when you leave here because of the things we're stuffing inside of us!!! I would recommend this place to anyone even to the nay sayers...you have to try this place and you will be turned!!!! We will be back as always !"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with this place! Good atmosphere good service and quality food! I'm a picky eater and had lots of questions and the wait staff was great! I could taste the freshness of the veggie appetizer that was suggested To us! Will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Bison Burger was great, I highly recommend it. Also got the hash side which was excellent. I was in a huge rush and they got me my food in 10 minutes. The ingredients clearly are a good combination, maybe it's just brilliant branding, but it tasted healthier... Cool building too!"}
{"text":"$22.95 for your deliciousness? SIGN ME UP. Can I get frequent diner points or even a fast pass so I can get seated sooner?   Every time I go... you do not fail me. Amazing service, stellar food (hey, I'm vegetarian... it's yummy!) and a fun, dynamic atmosphere.  When we went the other day, it was Saturday night and we were seated right away which impressed me.   If able to be seated outside... you should. The people watching alone is priceless. And while I am not one of \"those\" pretty people, I think that is what I appreciate about here--I can come in my bermuda shorts, flip flops and polo without shame.  Our waiter the other day was hilarious and didn't rush us to complete our meal despite the extensive pile up outside. And while yea, it's a Fox restaurant, I don't care. They offer classy vegetarian (no, I don't eat fish) dishes not found elsewhere. For me, this matters."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended eating here. I was not disappointed.  Cool fun atmosphere,  friendly service,  creative menu. The food was very good.   I look forward to eating here again the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is not my type of restaurant; one that touts a medically proven diet and has a funky new decor. I was afraid this was a big box restaurant and I'm still not sure that it isn't. The drink I got was very good, a cucumber lemonade that wasn't too sweet. The turkey burger was OK, not much flavor, but the sweet potato hash was really tasty. I had a bite of my friend's kale salad which surprisingly masked the bitter taste of kale. The price was what I expected, but I would be reluctant to return in the near future."}
{"text":"We spent 3 nights in Scottsdale, and we found ourselves here 2 of those 3 nights! Oh my gosh, what a fantastic spot wit diverse options, especially if you like a healthy twist on your meals. Not to mention, it is located in the Scottsdale shopping quarter and the ambiance is gorgeous with their glass walls and brightly lit palm trees on the perimeter.  The lighting in the evening is mostly dim, and just really adorable. People were here for anything to everything from work dinners to dates to family dinners out. We came here straight from the airport on our first night and were dressed veryyy casually and didn't feel like we didn't belong in this lovely restaurant in a fairly upscale area. The waiters and waitresses were kind and extremely helpful. We all had difficult times deciding what we wanted to order from the multiple mouth watering options, and they helped!   I had been sick with a terrible cough and a half present voice. I had the adaptogenic tea both nights and it was AMAZINGLY soothing, and just really, really tasty. It had a hint of lime and ginger - exactly what I needed both times on chilly nights.  The first night I ordered Moroccan chicken and it was some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had. Not to mention, it had pureed figs on top and was in a chickpeas sauce. So flavorful and amazing! I cleaned my plate. The second night I had cashew Pad Thai which was also excellent. Im always wary of how non-Asian places do Pad Thai, and while this was also a fusion entrée, it was still fairly true to the flavor of the noodles. I'd say it was the vegetables that were a little more nontraditional with it, but still amazing. The cashews instead of peanuts were also a great twist!  For dessert we had the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream both nights --- it was SO GOOD. It was rich and cocoa-packed, and probably the size of a cupcake in case you're wondering. It is good for one dessert-loving person or to be shared between two people.   We also tried the squash pie, which as strange as it sounds, was great. If you like pumpkin pie, you'll love this as well! Its maybe a little bit sweeter than pumpkin pie, but same consistency.   Overall, I highly recommend True Food Kitchen!! There is something here for everyone! Also very vegan or vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I'll agree that the fairly unique menu at True Food is what will draw folks in and the decor is beautiful, but the sales nature of the service and the talk up of menu items is enough to make me pause before I think about heading back. I enjoyed the ahi sliders but didn't feel like I couldn't get them somewhere else for less money and less pushy service.  That said, I think people need to give True Food a try and decide for themselves. It's a beautiful restaurant and having a place that serves healthy, albeit somewhat pricey, food is important in our fast food nation. On the plus side, the Natural Refreshment drinks are delicious. Especially the Cucumber Refresher. But at $4, I wouldn't mind a free refill. I may not head back while the memory of my not truly terrible, but not terrific experience is fresh, but I'll give it some time and reconsider."}
{"text":"I come here about every other month, and it's always simply perfect.  Presentation, food quality, and the cooking itself are all simply perfect.  I've never had a meal that's less than awesome.  They have some really creative combinations that give you unexpected tastes along with a very well balanced meal.  Service is always good, and the patio is great for most of the years since it's well shaded.  It's far from cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"I went to True Food Kitchen this weekend expecting to eat healthy dishes with little taste... luckily I was disappointed! The food here is AMAZING!    We started with a sampling of appetizers:   There's the chicken sausage pizza- one of the better chicken pizzas I've had in a long time. They have CPK beat! The tomato fennel sauce was tangy and the chicken was very flavorful.   Next was the edamame dumpling appetizer. The edamame paste inside was good, but the sauce they were served in was so 'delish', it made this appetizer superb!   Mealtime: My sister and I split two dishes, the Panang curry and the Red Chili Shrimp. Actually, the kitchen split it for us (score!) since neither of us could decide between the two dishes. As a Curry lover, I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the curry was. It had just the right amount of Zing in it, was creamy and overall delicious. I think I have a new favorite dish! While the red chili shrimp was tasty, it was less bold (and memorable) than the curry.   For someone who dragged her feet thinking of eating at a 'healthy food restaurant'- I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful inside and out, with out a doubt it caught my attention. Now I'm a meat guy but wanted to treat my girl who prefers veggies and healthy over my steaks and bbq. This place popped up and let me tell you, ITS AMAZING. I got the vegetarian squash lasagna and I'm hooked, the flavor, the texture and I'm feeling full from it. If you haven't tried this place, you definitely need to. Yum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not a good place for a vegan, or anyone that enjoys a relaxing atmosphere to have a meal. The selection is slim and what is offered is salty, bland and lifeless. This is a place that people either love or hate and let's just say I didn't love it.  You could get a vegan pizza at whole foods for cheaper and it's so much better than any of the food here. The waiter also took a long time to serve us and I didn't even go at a busy time it was 3pm on a Sunday.  This is one restaurant I will never be going back to."}
{"text":"Loved all the vegan options and that the servers were attentive to my allergies! Speedy and friendly service was notable, and the atmosphere is super awesome with wood tables, plants, and open sight lines into the kitchen!  We got the vegan chioggia beet bruschetta appetizer and we loved the texture and refreshing flavors! I tried the ancient grains bowl for my entree and the mister had the grass-fed burger. Both tasted good, but weren't too extraordinarily. The vegan coconut flan and key lime pie were both decent too!  Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum.  Humus- unbelievable. Mojito - best ever. Salmon- delicious.  Steak tacos- I die ( gotta say that like Rachel Zoe) Apple cranberry crumble dessert with maple ice cream - I'm stuffed. Best yet? You walk away patting yourself on the back for being a good boy/girl and eating a healthy ( but certainly yummilicious) meal.  Mom would be proud."}
{"text":"Tried a number of dishes- Chicken Salad, Spicy Panang, Ancient Grains, and the Red Chili Noodles. The concurrence of our group of 4 was Meh! Why would we ever go back to this overpriced, under qualitied place? It's not that they were all bad- they were just kind of blah. Not a lot of flavor in the salad, Ancient Grains was tiny and looked like what it was, a mish-mash of a random assortment of stuff, none of which really wowed us. All in all a disappointment, although the restaurant looked cool. If you are looking far a place that looks good and don't care about the food, this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Shout out to the late night crew at TFK in the Biltmore! I came in for a last minute birthday on the 17th of January and was pleasantly greeted by management. She was a delightful and gave excellent recommendations on what to try and really enhanced our experience. The service was incredible and the food was on point! Thank you for making it a special night, you know I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Elif A. dragged me up to Scottsdale for lunch recently.  The atmosphere is great- very open and relaxed. We ordered a salad and the organic tomato and roasted vegetable vegan pizza (we un-veganized it with cheese) and split both. Very tasty and very filling.  The service was friendly. Even though they were busy, they were really on top of it. I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is inviting. The staff is always super friendly. I highly recommend the kale salad with chicken its delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. I've been to one in San Diego and it was just as good. Although, I do have to admit that our server at this location looked a little worn out. I could tell that she was tired and ready to get the hell outa there.   We were sat right away a week from today on the patio. Upon being sat we noticed that they were nearing closing time. I ordered the medicine man drink and we started with a vegetable crudites but substituted the hummus. The server forgot to sub it but it was remedied right away.   I did, however, love my medicine man drink.   To follow I got the chicken chopped salad. It definitely was an amazing salad. I loved the sweetness of the dates along with the sharp flavor of the champagne vinaigrette.  Nearing the end of our dinner we were offered dessert. Normally one would wait until the guest is all finished but we weren't too bothered. We were full anyways! haha. I thought it was a nice gesture of the server to offer us free food and drink that was going to be thrown out anyways. I love how they try not to waste!"}
{"text":"Much to my surprise I enjoyed my lunch today.  The company of a couple girlfriends didn't hurt.  I had the turkey burger with a side of a 1/2 kale salad and 1/2 sweet potato hash.  Everything was very flavorful and filling.  Typically I find the portions small here but the burger definitely filled me up. I would not have a drink as they are greatly overpriced $4 for a lemonade."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan options - loved the TLT sandwich with a simple, flavorful kale salad on the side. Service was fast and friendly and the overall vibe was just the right amount of low-keyness. That's a word, right?"}
{"text":"The place is absolutely delicious! I started off with Kale drink! Loved the ginger in it. Then we ordered the guacamole with pita chips , really good! Ended it with the Mediterranean Salad and that hit the spot. I left full but without the heavy feeling. I will be back to try other stuff in the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food, thoughtfully conceived and prepared, nicely presented. Delicious nonalcoholic cocktails. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decent ambiance.  I had the turkey lasagna, and it was pretty good, but a bit on the small side.  No draft beers.  Service was good, not over the top good, but good.  I just don't feel that there is anything about the place that pulls me back.  It's just..okay."}
{"text":"Daughter and husband took my wife and myself here for dinner. Really enjoyed the night with local beers and very good healthy food. Surprised how great tasting the organic and locally grown food was prepared. will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"The continued demise of the shaved turkey pita......  Today I made the mistake again of ordering the shaved turkey pita for takeout.  The pita was different. It was not soft as it should be. It was hard and ripped when it was folded. They no longer include grapes which were a nice touch. The sauce is different....bad different. The tomatoes are now slices not the tasty little cherry tomatoes. The cucumbers used to be thin slices and now are chunks. BUMMER. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. My bad. Will now search elsewhere. I really hope TFK gets it together because the concept is great, they've just missed the execution one too many times."}
{"text":"Admittedly I was looking for something with a bit more 'local flavor' on my quick work trip to Scottsdale, but my group was craving True Foods, and it did not disappoint. With temps upwards of 90 degrees, it was the perfect combo of light, refreshing, an satisfying.   We tried many apps which were all great - edamame dumplings, beet bruschetta, guac and chips. My entree was one of the grain bowls + steelhead salmon. I thought everything was tasty and flavorful. Also, our waitress was delightful.   Highly recommend for a casual, relaxing and healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I absolutely love this place and their food. However, I witnessed something yesterday during my late lunch with a friend that I found repulsive. I walked into the men's room as one of the cooks (shorter guy with a beard) was finishing at the urinal, when he finished, he walked out without washing his hands! Out of the corner of my eye a second cook who was in the stall walked out of the stall and also did not wash his hands! Gross! I pointed it out to our waiter and he said he would say something to the one person whom I was able to recognize and I opted to not have him say anything (for obvious reasons). The waiter offered that they have a hand washing station near the kitchen and the gentlemen probably washed their hands there....I'm not buying it. I know I may be somewhat of a germaphobe but that is inexcusable for a chef who is making salads and things which are not cooked to do something like this...furthermore, it is a major health code violation! Lavese sus manos amigos!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy food, cooked and prepared well.  Rude bartending staff and less than jovial atmosphere.  Definitely catering to the pretentious crowd.  If that is your gig this will be a five star for you.  If you want super healthy food and can tolerate that crap it will be a 3 or 4.  If you just don't have time for it.. well you get this review. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Cute waiters and delicious, healthy food.....what could be better?  The only thing I didn't like was the wait the fact that my chicken salad sandwich was small for 12 dollars.  Otherwise, everything tasted delicious and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Love love love. I was shocked to hear there was a 30 min wait on a Tuesday night but was lucky enough to find a bar spot. The bar was incredible, staff were all helping one another, fresh made juice was delicious and incredible fresh vegan food topped the cake. Would recommend the edamame dumplings. Yummers"}
{"text":"Took mom here for a late birthday lunch, but was a little skeptical since a few people have told me the food was not very good. When we got to the restaurant, we entered across from the hostess booth, so we walked across the inside of the restaurant. Very nice layout, bright colors, and you could see everything that was going on in the kitchen. Very impressive. The only thing that was a little off was the hostess station. There was no real order, and a lot of people were just standing around. I flagged down the hostess, who didn't know if she was supposed to be seating people or if someone else was. We opted for the patio since we could be seated right away.  Our server was amazing, and he reminded me a lot of our friend in Portland. He knew the menu in and out, and also new the portion size of the street tacos probably wouldn't fill up my boyfriend. Just an over all great server.  The food was amazing also. We started off with the hummus, worth it. Very flavorful and the texture was not watery or smooth. Loved it. We also got the specialty drinks, a little pricey, but also very good. When our food came out, it was again, all very delicious.   All in all, we most likely would come again. The prices are a little high, ($90 for 4 people, no alcohol) but since the food is made healthy and also packs a flavor punch, I guess it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love the food!! If it wasn't for the lunch wait time, this place would have 5 stars from me, however every time I go for lunch the place is half empty and 2 hostesses are always looking  frazzled. Go for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. On point with refilling drinks. Menu seemed simple and even kinda boring, but boy do the dishes taste fresh, flavorful, light, and delish. Small portion sizes, and nice variety of natural drinks, got the blood orange w soda water."}
{"text":"This restaurant has healthy food with lots of flavor. It has a very unique menu. I go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"The food is creative and delicious. If you like going out to eat and want something that's not completely unhealthy I'd go here. You can tell they use fresh ingredients and don't cook with an overload of oil. All the staff here has been friendly each time I've been there. Went tonight and had the TLT & shiitake lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"I wish this were in every major city.  Organic, local, and options for gluten-free.  Nothing disappointed anyone in either party I was with- yes I went back the next day I loved it so much! Prices are very reasonable for the quality of foods.  Waitstaff are very knowledgeable.  Atmosphere is very laid back."}
{"text":"This place is a home-run to win the world series! The menu is unique and robust. Everything I had was perfect. The kale salad and sashimi were perfect. Great setting and interior. They have fresh nutrient rich juices, too! Wish I could eat here regularly and will make it a point to eat at True Food whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. The chia pudding and coffee are good, but the food is subpar for the cost. Almost everything has soy in it, and if it doesn't have soy it has wheat... Not truly allergen friendly or healthy. My servers have always been nice... But when I tried to be more casual (and respectful of their seating areas) and sit out at the large table with my coffee the staff was nothing but noisy and inconsiderate! It was so rude! They weren't courteous to my area of the table, or any acknowledgment that I was even there. Their noise and activity forced me to move. Absolutely unacceptable.  Talked to the manager and she came over for about two seconds, after the kind hostess reseated me. No real apology and she was half walking away pretty much saying \"just sit here it's fine\" but not any apologies for what happened or offer to make my experience better."}
{"text":"The Quinoa burger was exceptional.  Although it looks small, it's quite dense and filling.  I only ate have and saved the other half for later, which tasted even better.  You can op for either kale salad or sweet potato has or both and I would definitely chose both.  Fast and friendly service.  They will cut you off after 4 beers in one hour....not speaking from personal experience thought."}
{"text":"Was in town for business. Decided to check out a highly recommended restaurant. The service was incredible. The waitress was so accommodating. Absolutely love the open concept.  Will definitely be adding this to the list of recommendations."}
{"text":"I haven't been on a juice cleanse, and I don't shop at Whole Foods, so I might not be the target audience here.  That being said, I can't get enough of True Food Kitchen.  It's so relaxing to sit at the bar and watch the busy kitchen filled with fresh fruits and vegetables.    I had a really hard time ordering since the menu is super varied and everything sounds delicious.  I love how they have many yummy vegetarian and vegan options but still offer plenty of meat dishes.    I was here on a cold, rainy day, so I had the miso soup ($4) to start.  The generous chunks of wild mushrooms were fun to slurp up. There were snow pea slivers in the soup, which was unconventional but added a great crunch and freshness.  I also ordered the kale crunch salad ($12).  The many ingredients (watercress, cabbage, grapefruit, avocado, pickled radish, almonds) were all perfectly proportioned and carefully arranged.  Dressing always makes or breaks the salad for me, and this chili vinaigrette was absolutely a winner.  I only wish that the portion was a little bit bigger.  I like a huge bowl of chopped salad, and I know that if I had only ordered the salad I definitely would have left hungry.  I also tasted the chicken curry with brown rice, which was bursting with coconut milk flavor.  Unlike the salad, that portion is big enough to take half home for later!  I'm always a little skeptical when people from Arizona compare Arizona to its trendy neighbor California.  However, True Food Kitchen made me a believer.  This might be the best chain restaurant I've ever been to.  Come to the East Coast please!"}
{"text":"Uhhhh - wow. Give me some time to write this up the right way. OMG. To start outstanding!"}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants in Scottsdale - large portions - most meals are enough for two! organic flavorful healthy food that is delicious - I couldn't ask for more! And the drinks- non alcoholic list is delish... definitely a place to check out. Cool atmosphere too. I keep going back to the vegan version of the BLT (I think it's called TLT?) yummy!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my top three favorite places to eat in Phoenix!  The yellow curry is the best I have had!  It is fresh and creamy with a good amount of spice.  You must try the lettuce wraps- they are meatless and taste better than P.F. Changs lettuce wraps (my meat-loving husband agrees!).  My husband also craves the steak from here as well.  The drink called the Medicine Man is so refreshing and leaves your body feeling wonderful.  This place may not be for your steak and potatoes type of person but if you want wholesome, natural, tasty food then please do yourself a favor and try True Food Kitchen.  Remember to get your parking token validated.  Menu selections barely ever change but the items they have are keepers."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with the family last night.  Ordered the kale guacamole and roasted cauliflower for starters... they were delicious!  The kids meals are also so good (healthy and tasty... no icky boxed mac n cheese with fries!) Everything was amazing with great atmosphere and service!  Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, I would like to personally thank True Food for ending my streak of 2 and 3 star restaurants.  As a foodie I have been pretty disappointed lately!!!  Not the case for True Food!   I finally got to eat here (my husband isn't as excited about healthy food as I am), but we had family visiting who have dietary restrictions so we all decided to try this place together.   The wait was very long.  It was a holiday but I hear that is common here.  When finally seated, we had very attentive service by Greg from start to finish.  It was quite loud inside, I think next time I will try to sit on the spacious and yet adorable patio.   The food was outstanding.  Quality over quantity, my friends.  Not that the portions are tiny but you are definitely getting your money out of the amazing blend of flavors.  Everything is made from scratch.  I had the ancient grains bowl and it seriously is one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Everyone was pleased!!! We also splurged on a couple desserts which were out of this world.  The strawberry rhubarb crisp as well as the lemon tart-both highly recommended! I can't wait to return!!!!!!!!!!  Oh and my husband can't either! :)"}
{"text":"Are you one of the following?: dirty hippie, hipster, organic gardener, whole foods frequenter, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-free, summertime winter hat wearer? Then this place is for you. My friend who was with me also said that the attractiveness of the clientele was above average, but he is from Tucson.  They are awesome with any allergy or strange dietary request. The food is all locally sourced blah blah blah.   Very smelly hippie atmosphere, girls with dreadlocks and socks with sandals.   I had the pizza with the eggplant and bri. I loved it. I also had some kind of carrot tasting smoothie, it was alright but nothing to write home about. Apparently my organs will now function better due to that one drink...  My friends had the lasagna, gluten free of course and they loved it. My mom had the fish tacos and she eats them everywhere she goes. She raved about the flavor.  Overall this restaurant is good food-wise but a little too \"I drive a Prius why don't you, environment destroyer??!!\" For my tastes."}
{"text":"The Nojito's are fantastic!  I find mojitos a bit too sweet but the nojitos never are.  I had the salmon sandwich with the kale salad and the sweet potato hash.  I've had the salmon before (fresh, thick, tender) and the kale salad (the kale is cooked but far from limp and comes sprinkled with what appears to be parmesan cheese and bread crumbs). Today, I also had the sweet potato hash (sweet potato and caramelized onions - yum!) and that plus the nojito are reason enough to go.  My friend had a chicken salad and a medicine man drink.  He wasn't wowed by the salad which consisted of your basic salad with chicken but he said he'd try the place again.   The place is pricey though.  The sandwich was around $15, and the nojito might have run $5?   Went at 12:30 on a weekday and the place was packed.  We had to wait about 15 minutes.  It's easier to get in right away at dinner."}
{"text":"Herb hummus, Street Tacos, Chopped salad w/chicken, & Tabbouleh Salad all delicious!  If I had to make s suggestion it would be to spice up the fish in the tacos with a little more flavor, but they were perfectly cooked, flaky and moist.  The hummus appetizer is a generous portion; enough for 4-6 people."}
{"text":"Met with a friend I hadn't seen in 15 years.  She was working in Scottsdale for the week so I met her at True Food Kitchen.  We had such a great experience.  I have special dietary needs and the staff didn't hesitate when I asked specific questions about what was in the food and how it was prepared.    We split the VEGETABLE CRUDITÉS which were nice, fresh crisp raw veggies with dipping sauce (friend said sauce was good).  I ordered the turkey burger (no bun or cheese) and a side of the sweet potato hash.  The turkey burger was cooked to perfection.  A little salty for my taste, but for others it's probably just right.  I loved that it was put together without a bunch of fillers.  Really tasty.  The sweet potato hash was very good!  I was looking forward to this treat and it didn't disappoint.  Thank you True Food Kitchen for making our reunion such a positive one!"}
{"text":"Vegan and Vegetarian friendly, just be warned you will wait for a table during business lunch hour.  We learned to eat early to get a table, once we did that, service is awesome and the food is great.  Lots of different items for the diner to enjoy.  I've had the fish tacos a couple of times and they are great!"}
{"text":"Went here for din din when a friend was in town. I had dined at the Baltimore location  and enjoyed their food so I was eager to check out a different dish.When we arrived the hostess greeted us with a friendly smile and asked if we would like to sit out on the heated patio or inside. Being natives of Arizona, we of course opted for the heated patio because this time of year is the reason why snowbirds and transplants come to Arizona.   She lead us out to a corner table that had two sides surrounded by a short wall topped with grass which was a nice touch. This location has the patio pretty much in the center of a courtyard so the mild privacy was a plus because I tend to spill things on myself when I eat, cause I'm that classy. Anyhoo, the temperature of the heaters was heavenly! Not too hot, but enough to keep us thin-blooded Arizonians warm.  Service was okay. The waiter was nice but never offered to refill our beverages. I had the Cucumber Refresher to drink. This concoction is a combo of cucumber and honey lemonade, pretty refreshing so I probably would have ordered a second one if the waiter would have asked, which would have cause the bill to go up, increasing his tip, but whatevs. Also to note, there was quite  a selection of alcoholic drinks on the menu that are not so great for the liver, but healthy for ones social life.   For my entree I ordered the Red chili shrimp which was amazingly delicious! It consisted of sesame noodles, gai lan (that's fancy talk for broccoli), red spinach, and shiitake mushrooms. It had the right amount of spice and I couldn't scarf it down fast enough, dropping only four noodles into my lap (you were warned earlier). Some items can be a little pricey but you are getting quality ingredients. I will definitively be back."}
{"text":"Reasonable menu, decent service and nice food.  Bit sterile environment, not really friendly and healthy, more mass market roll them in and out. Also a bit odd with kitchen staff pre preparing meals right in the middle of everybody.  But can't complain as food was good as was service, first time I've been to a True Food Kitchen and would go back."}
{"text":"Fresh real food, great service and food arrived in a timely manner! Edamame gyozas, grapefruit avocado guac, and seasonal ingredient salad were absolutely perfect. All paired nicely with a ginger margarita! They'll even split entrees in half if you're sharing with a friend. I left very satisfied and would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Went for Easter dinner.  Great atmosphere, super service, fun drinks and yummy healthy eats.  Explore the drink menu...both alcoholic and non.  Two patio areas to dine al fresco.  Sweet potato hash was awesome as was spiced chicken.  A new favorite for me!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and always amazing food!! We had a friend visiting out of town and he wanted a pizza. They customized his pizza and also found a Sprite for him because he was not into healthy veggie or fruit juices. We had our usual Kale Aid drink and also tried the hummus Greek salad with gluten free pita bread with fresh cucumbers and olives. Sat outside on the patio which was a nice area for conversation and great weather!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Just OK. No one at our $140+ table of three raved about anything. Have had fresher salads from Whole Foods. As other reviewers have noted, much of this place is nothing more than a giant picture window for the Scottsdale look-at-me crowd. Including the hostess, et al. If you like the trendy look of the moment, go. If you want to enjoy a True Meal, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I could eat the kale salad every day. Refreshing and light but also filling. Turkey pits is excellent too."}
{"text":"Love the food but it's ruined by how POORLY managed this place is!!!!!! They Quoted us 30-40min wait and 2 hours later we're still waiting. Sadly we won't back."}
{"text":"After many visits to the TFK at Biltmore, I decided to check out the new establishment at Scottsdale Quarter. My friend and I went to this location a couple Saturday's ago for lunch. When we arrived we were told it would be about a 25 minute wait to be seated outside. We were given a little buzzer and stood outside for perhaps 10 minutes before it went off. What a pleasant surprise!   Upon being seated a super nice gentleman introduced himself as our waiter. He explained the days specials and was very attentive and courteous throughout the entire meal. Better yet, he kept our water glasses filled consistently.  We started with the lettuce cups which sadly weren't as good as we remembered them being at the Biltmore TFK. And unfortunately my friend felt her steak tacos were just as lackluster as the lettuce cups. Again, a disappointment as they weren't what she was expecting since the ones she had at the Biltmore location were \"amazing.\"   I enjoyed the Panang Curry with chicken and asked that they include zucchini and red peppers as well. As usually is the case, the meal was FABULOUS. Just as I remembered it being from my last visit to the Biltmore location.   In regard to the ambiance of this location, I would say I prefer it much more than the Biltmore location. The outside seating area is so wonderful and roomy. There just seems to be a different, more relaxed vibe at this location. And I especially love that the restrooms are on the outside of the restaurant...as are the sinks! (although they still have sinks in the bathroom for those who prefer to wash up before leaving the facilities)   Overall, I will indeed be back--next time with the hubby for a delicious lunch and some shopping!"}
{"text":"Once again, my favorite restaurant didn't not disappoint. From the moment my friend and I walked in the doors, we were greeted with authentic smiles and genuine hospitality. Once seated a wonderful waiter checked in with us to take our drink order. In a matter of minutes he was back to take our food order. Prompt, courteous, helpful, service is what I have become accustomed to receiving at TFK.  Our orders consisted of: shitaki and lettuce tofu cups (delish and fresh!), caramelized onion tart (sounds much better than it really is), harvest chopped salad (an absolute FAV which I order almost every visit!), street tacos (my friends go to staple food here) and the roasted chicken (absolutely gives the panang curry a run for its money!!   Honestly, the roasted chicken was SO incredibly phenomenal, I wish I would have gotten an order to go! Since I didn't...they may find me at dinner there again tomorrow--since this is the only time this meal is served.  Bottom line...this place keeps getting better and better!  As a side note--we heard from a reliable source this evening that the menu will be undergoing some changes in the coming months. I can only imagine the delectable meals that await us!"}
{"text":"Um can you say unbelievably amazing, not to mention I am so bummed they don't have one of these back home, (I'm from Minnesota.)  Came to this delicious restaurant while visiting a girlfriend in the Phoenix area. I wish I hadn't; only because it's all I think about! Started with a Bloody Mary--best one I've had. You can taste the fresh-ness, like they literally made the tomato juice there themselves.  We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer. So fresh and light. A great starter to a meal, as it was not too large/heavy.. We ordered three meals to share/taste: spaghetti squash, autumn salad, and turkey burger with sweet potato hash. The favorite by far was the spaghetti squash as our conversation revolved around the question of HOW to make this! The food is excellent. The service was \"okay.\" Our server was somewhat nonexistent. Fortunately for her, the food makes up for that here. Yes, coming from a server veteran herself, I did just say that the service can be poor if the food is this delicious. I will be returning on my next visit to Phoenix. Until then, can you PLEASE OPEN ONE IN MINNEAPOLIS?!?"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a great experience. The wait staff and hostesses were nice and informative. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and provided us with helpful suggestions and options regarding drinks and entrees. She also provided me with background information about the restaurant. The bar was also able to make a great Moscow Mule, a beverage not regularly on the menu. My friend got the fish tacos and I got the grilled chicken salad. We also got he kale guacamole which was not bad at all. The kale wasn't overpowering which I liked. It's a good place to go to if you are looking for a clean eating option. The flourless chocolate cake was delicious too. Very rich."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  For an organic restaurant the staff had no clue...couldn't even answer simple questions about the ingredients.  I have never rejected a bottle of wine untile the waitress tried to serve us a corked bottle of wine...she seemed suprised that we would not accept the bottle...  If you want to eat in a real locally sourced/organic restaurant try Quiessence."}
{"text":"We love True Food Kitchen!  We had two errors on our order today and our server did not return to the table for at least 15 min after we received the food. That was a bummer, but good still.  You will fall in love."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and environment! Great choice for vegetarians and vegans! A tad on the pricey side, this place will satisfy the trendy person inside who wants good food and great service. My server was knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. In short: eat here!"}
{"text":"Very great food overall great quality, but absolutely worst service I have ever experienced. It took my server 20 minutes to get us out drinks and then she was no where to be found for us to order our food. We had to tell another waiter what we needed and even then the whole process took 20 more minutes and we were at true foods for an hour an a half. Absolute worse service"}
{"text":"I've been to True Food a couple of times now and both times were very pleasant experiences. The first time, I was sick so I got a juice to try and feel better. It may or may not have actually helped, but it was very tasty. I also got the heirloom tomato pizza, which was delicious. The second time, I went on a Friday night. Date night and all that. We got the roasted cauliflower app which was so good. As my entree, i got the ancient grains bowl. It consists of miso glazed sweet potatoes, charred tofu, quinoa, caramelized onions, mushrooms, and snap peas. So delicious! It's filling, but not in the way that makes you want to die. We decided to get the vegan key lime pie for dessert and omg. It was perfect! The manager was super awesome as well."}
{"text":"The best Tuscan kale salad, great customer service, yummy desserts every season and great appetizers. No guilty here, just a happy and healthy yummy"}
{"text":"PLEASE open one in Chandler/Gilbert area next!  We love the concept, the service and the amazing food.  Very rarely near the Biltmore or Kierland - we would love to make this a regular spot on our side of town."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful. Perfect for a date. The Scottsdale Quarter is lit well and has beautiful landscaping at night. The restaurant itself is relaxing as the doors were open and the weather was just perfect.   Our waitress was very nice and helpful in recommending dishes for us.   Food was great. The hummus appetizer was very delicious. The Bison burger was healthy and had great side items. And the new strawberry salad was light but filling.   Overall a great experience for us! We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I'd only ever been to True Foods in California, so I was surprised to see one in the land of chimichangas. When I usually eat out, I generally choose inflammatory, non-local, synthetic foods, so eating lunch here was a departure from normal. Truthfully, my friend chose it because it was 10ft away from our breakfast at Frost. As usual, the restaurant is open and spacious, filled with green plants, and adorned with wooden tables. Although it was near lunch time, the place was nearly empty. We were seated immediately and our server was quite attentive.  The menu is diverse with cuisines from around the world using all local foods. I had the chicken chopped salad which was just like the salads I pack for lunch except more delicious. My salad made me want to be better. I think True Food changed my life because now I want to add manchego cheese to everything. This is where I imagine hosting future power lunches."}
{"text":"Stop changing the menu!  This used to be my favorite restaurant.  As a vegan, they had multiple options that I was willing to pay more for and wait on weekend nights for.  Since I started eating there, I think they have changed the menu 4-5 times.  Seasonal food doesn't excite me.  Consistency does.  I loved the BBQ tofu wrap.  It was my favorite meal...gone.  Kale cheeseless pizza...gone.  Apple crisp with maple ice cream....gone.  All that is really left for me is an uninspired teriyaki bowl that I can duplicate elsewhere.  The service is great.  The staff is friendly.  The pricing is a little high, but I was willing to pay it for many vegan choices.  I have a couple of gift cards left and I will likely be done after that.  5 star food (before the changes).  5 star service- GREAT servers!  3 star pricing. Zero stars for inconsistency with menu items.  I'm between a 2 and 3 on this one, but since I was served a lemon tart that I was told was vegan and found out later it isn't, I'm leaving a 2.  If you keep the menu consistent, we likely wouldn't have had this problem.  What if I had a dairy allergy?"}
{"text":"People who routinely make healthy lifestyle choices eat here.  I don't make healthy lifestyle choices, but I figure if I hang out in places where there are people that do, their shit might rub off on me. I call this health by association.  TFK has a good beer offering with an organic porter that tastes heavenly. I washed it down with a bowl of seafood caldo. The soup was also delicious, with nice chunks of shrimp and sea bass swimming around in it. Five stars for the soup, beer and my attentive server.  Minus two stars for the cute little hostess, who upon seeing me was quick to conclude I wouldn't even qualify as butt-acne on Jennifer Grey's ass and promptly whisked me into a corner booth.  Yes, they put baby's butt-acne double in the corner.  What a little biatch."}
{"text":"We had family brunch here recently, and everything we ordered was delicious!  Lots of patrons, but the staff had a good handle on getting the tables turned over.  Lots of vegetarian, gluten free, and healthy dining options.  Many dishes could be made vegan as well."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I wasn't sure who was running this place because everything is phenomenal. I asked to speak with the GM and this lovely sweet woman, Jessica, came over. Not only was she smiley and friendly, but had super positive energy. The food and staff was incredible, but Jessica was the icing on the cake! Thank you for making, what was an unbelievable experience, even more amazing! The food was out of this world fresh and delicious. Definitely start with the vegetable crudités!! The Thai grapefruit martini is so refreshing!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Sorry to leave this but service was average at best.  Sat at the counter. It was a Sunday afternoon, not crowded.  She brought my drink and it was \"dripping\" on counter, my clothes. When she came back, I asked for a napkin which she did not provide. After 5 min, I asked another server for a napkin which she gave me right away. First server eventually came back and had a napkin for me. No \"sorry\" or anything. The whole experience turned me off. Maybe they were changing shifts but I say they could up their customer service/friendliness.   They seem to do more socializing with each other than the guests. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great spot to have a nice, tasty bite and conversation.  Big bay windows that bring in the breeze from outside as well as the chatter of passer byers if you like to people watch.  I had hummus and a chicken salad, both fresh and delicious.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Entering True Food Kitchen is to enter Dr. Weil's anti-inflammatory food pyramid, now made available through a restaurant setting.  Ample vegetables, whole grains, and just straightforward \"good for you food\", is at the heart of True Food Kitchen's philosophy.   Their Scottsdale Quarter location is open and airy, with two entry-ways, along with indoor and outdoor seating.  Outside misters are available for hot days and for those colder nights in the Arizona winter, fire pits to keep warm.  Their menu boasts everything that is good for your stomach and general well-being for your body.  Salads, sandwiches, and various entrees will keep your options open as you select the right true and good food for you.  There are also many options for vegetarian and gluten-free diets.  Their Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl ($12.00-$16.00) with your choice of tofu, chicken, or shrimp is a combination of ingredients made just for teriyaki sauce.  It is the perfect portion of Asian vegetables, brown rice cooked just right and for my serving - chicken slices glazed with teriyaki sauce.   If you want to go a step further, you can share one of their various pizza offerings. Their Chicken Sausage Pizza ($12.00), complete with tomatoes, fennel and fontina.  Theirs is a thin crust, so it is easy to more than one originally planned.    True Food Kitchen dares to be different and succeeds.  This is all in the efforts of providing us a better alternative to feed our bodies.  Day to day we get caught up with \"standards,\" it is good to step aside and give your body some good food, food that was truly made to sustain your body healthily."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't written this yet. Had a great meal here with my family when they were visiting from the east coast. There was a bit of a wait but we occupied our time at the nearby shops.  Very unique and delicious menu. We each had different things and all enjoyed our meals.  The staff were wonderful. The outside seating was great. My family can't wait to come back to town to come here again."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but not for the amount we paid.  Their drinks are spectacular, however the entire menu is very overpriced.  I had a mixed cauliflower and veggie plate which cost $ 13.00. (Winter Ingredient Salad)  $ 13 dollars for veggies?  Come on.  I was starviing when I left.  If you want a pricy meal over at The Quarter, skip this place and visit Tanzy up by the i pic theater.  More bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Have been going here since it began.  We had a real problems tonight.  The veggie appetizer was 1/2 normal size.  We were told that they are having kitchen problems.  The kale salad is great but the salmon we ordered on the top was raw.  The service was wanting.  It took 15 minutes for a Latte to arrive even though the place was half empty.  To top it off my granddaughter did not want the salmon by the time it was offered and the waitress brought a piece of cake which was good.  When I questioned the bill because they charged us for the salmon I told the server it should have been removed from the bill.    Why didn't a manager come by to ask?   Seems like the restaurant needs a manager who sees to it that a repeat patrons are properly treated.  Our waitress (6 weeks on the job) was surprised when I refused to pay for the dish.  I was charged for the salad.  We don't mi d paying for quality.  A manager never appeared.    I have never experienced anything like that in a Fox Concept Restaurant before.  They are usually on the ball - but now a favorite place is in decline.  What a shame.    We like this place and would like to come back, but this needs a fix.  Hopefully Sam will make that happen."}
{"text":"The place has nice ambiance but is a little overpriced. The food is american style with little twists. Lots of vegeterian options and gluten free ones."}
{"text":"Loved the outdoor patio seating, the humus and Thai chili shrimp appetizers were really good, the street tacos were good and the apple crisp was excellent to be a \"healthy\" version of it.  The drinks were so/so.  I am debating between 4 and 5 stars, I am giving this 4.5 :)"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot due to its close proximity to my work! I enjoy the atmosphere of its not too busy- if it's busy it's too noisy for my taste. The patio is nice and it's quieter out there. The food is usually delicious, but it has missed the mark on some occasions. That happens. The staff is always very nice and eager to make things right if they mess up your order which is very nice. I enjoy the Tuscan Kale Salad and cucumber lemonade!! Other things are yummy as well! I recommend it at off hours so it's a pleasant quiet experience!!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar! Omg, banana chocolate tart was orgasmic! And, I felt slightly less guilty since it was \"healthy\". Miso cod was excellent, too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine. Super nice and friendly staff. Food is always fresh, with the exception of one time I visited.. I ordered the steelhead, (I almost always get this dish), and I'm pretty sure it was microwaved or reheated, which is why I gave 4 stars. It tasted terrible but i was too hungry to send it back. They're normally good about serving fresh food so that was a bit disappointing but overall, amazing place.  If you're a clean eater like myself you'll love it here. The ambience inside is calming and the patio is nice in the day with the misters. They also have Juby True juices! Which I love. Try one, you'll love them too. I treat myself to lunch here almost every Saturday afternoon and I intend to continue to."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday. We beat the lunch rush by getting there at 11:30. By 12, there was a wait for a table. I was kinda scared of the menu because I typically eat 'bland with bland and a side of bland'. I ordered the turkey pita (not sure the official name) with a side kale salad. I skipped out of the provolone, which made the sandwich a little dry, but it was still really yummy. The kale salad was a big surprise....I liked it alot and had never tried kale before! My sister ordered the terriaki tofu. Her only complaint was that there wasn't enough actual tofu in her dish. I will definitely go back. Next time, I want to try one of their yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Like the scene.  Food is good and as advertised fresh and healthy.  Drinks are unique and juice based which means healthier.  But pricy but like he rest of the world claiming organic and fresh there's a premium so expect it."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 3 stars simply because it is True Food Kitchen and I love the brand. I have visited this location several times but my normal spot is the location in Newport Beach, CA. This location is just always so incredibly loud. It's hard to go to lunch with friends just to have to scream over one another. Even the hostess has to get close to you to even hear how many people are in your party. The food is always great (no complaint there) but even when you sit outside the furniture isn't that comfortable and you're having to sit outside to escape the noise on the inside."}
{"text":"Hit or miss with food...  The drinks can be the same way.  The turkey burger is excellent, the ahi tuna sliders are great!  Service is decent, the crowd is mixed.  Certainly a bit overpriced at 50$ for lunch for 2."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots. My wife loves, loves, loves the Fish Tacos! I generally order breakfast, and the Breakfast Sandwich is one of my go tos! We come here once or twice a month and it is in our rotation of can't miss places, especially when we have guests!"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch today on their one month anniversary of opening.  The restaurant was packed with Christmas revelers and shoppers, so we chose to sit at the bar with no wait.    I love the look of this place, it reminds me of so many restaurants back home (San Francisco) with clean, open, bright styling, lots of color and natural materials (e.g. organic paperweights - limes, lemons and tangerines to hold down your check and change).  The focus is on healthy and fresh.  Not so much slow food or organic per se, but in the same vein with real ingredients prepared simply with any eye toward health.  For example, when you order your turkey sandwich you get a choice of soup or KALE salad!  They have no red meat on the menu, lots of chicken, turkey and fish - perfect.    Today my hubby and I shared the special soup (Chicken sausage, white bean and kale), the edamame and truffle dumplings and the white shrimp soba.  All were very tasty on this unusually rainy day in Scottsdale.  Our waitress was slammed but was sweet and did her best to be prompt and attentive.  The prices are not ridiculous, but not exactly cheap - but that goes with the territory here in N Scottsdale.  I'll definitely go again in nicer weather and also explore all the great new sops opening in the SQ including a real, at least semi-independent (i.e. not Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf) coffee house (WOW!!!).  I think it is called International Coffee Press or similar.    All in all a super addition to my work 'hood."}
{"text":"My daughter contracted food poisoning from this restaurant. We will no longer eat here."}
{"text":"I adore this place...fresh doesnt describe the food. Loved the wines! I would definately recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a fox lover and it's no different with true food. I could eat here everyday and feel good doing it. Bought the kids almond butter and banana and strawberry sandwich and he loved it.  Friend had the kale-aid which is his go to and would recommend to every mountain hiker in the valley.  Next up was the kale and avocado dip which has yet to disappoint. Can't find it anywhere else. Not too filling and a perfect start to lunch. I had the turkey rice bowl which is a clean combo to give you energy throughout the day.   I had the Spontaneous Happiness drink and sipped it in on the patio as we finished our meal when the rhubarb crisp that the server suggested. Our server was attentive but let us do our thing and the place was visibly clean in all aspects."}
{"text":"I go all the time. Sit at the oversized bar top because you get personalized service from the bartenders and you have plenty of room to setup and do work or read or just enjoy the food and lunches. Everything is catered to a meal style that is anti inflammatory. You'd think that means you would lose on flavor but it's not true. I haven't had a dish that I dislike. I went with the seasonal salad and a bison burger cooked to order.  They have a vast array of drinks and wines that are healthy and flavorful. Erich the manager always stops by and says hi and makes me feel at home. Good place, tell your friends.  Also park In the lot out front, they validate."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good the food tasted in what I assumed would be a crunchy granola type of dining.   Very fresh,  very broad , excellent service.   Touch expensive but still I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Thank you (management) Mathew @TrueFoods, Scottsdale Quarter, for hosting my Birthday Girl, Mums, and treating her and I to a fabulous culinary explosion! All gratis, all healthy and delish. We had a lovely time tasting the ginormous menu. What a treat! Happy Birthday Month LuLuLuv... and today is my Grandmas Birthday too! So nice to celebrate them both in such a very special way. Our waitress 'Richa', was superb and adored. We will be asking for her in the future. True Foods @ SQ made right of a previous unfortunate situation that had occurred, and went out of their way to make up for it accordingly. I'm not only humbled but appreciative of the gesture. The food is and has always been amazing."}
{"text":"Few places get my highest rating and recommendation - True Food tops that list.  Without doubt, this is my favorite place to dine.  Perfect for business meetings, a place to take guests or just enjoy a relaxing, tasty foody adventure. The seasonal menu keeps it interesting and inspires a healthy lifestyle.  The ambiance just adds to the experience.   As far as service goes, it has always been impeccable, friendly and professional.   Try the fish dish!"}
{"text":"So sorry to have to write this review as I am a big fan of True Food Kitchen. We have been dining with them for years -  since the first one opened on Camelback.  Second time in a month that my \"stand by\" favorites have come up short.  About a month ago I was at dinner with my family and ordered the Red Chili Shrimp.  It was watered down, no flavor and over cooked. This dish is usually delicious and flavorful.  I have ordered it over a dozen times.  Last week I brought my friends from Anchorage to lunch.  I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole one of my other favorites.  It came out over-cooked on the top and mushy within. I really couldn't believe it.  Highly disappointed.   Not sure what is going on at this specific location.  It went from a 5 star ranking on my list down to a 1 star."}
{"text":"Here on a business trip, and went to dinner with several colleagues.  Was expecting amazing (on the basis of Yelp reviews) but nearly went for a two-star rating.  The place is pretty noisy which made conversation a challenge, and the decor, while sort of hipster (stolen from a previous review) reminded me of a university cafeteria in Sweden.  Maybe the patio would have felt a bit more sophisticated, but it was too chilly on this November evening.  Hummus was fine.  Salad with pomegranate seeds was sort of yummy, (but certainly wouldn't have made Meg Ryan erupt is glorious exclamation) and the pizza was just a tiny bit north of bland.  ALWAYS excited about a truly gourmet pizza, but this one wasn't even close.    Timing has a lot to do with these things, but there are loads of interesting restaurants in the neighborhood.  Don't know that I would choose this one again, even under the guise of eating healthy."}
{"text":"Delicious, delightfully healthy menu items.    Food: 5 stars.  Value: 3 stars (smallish portions for highish prices, great ingredients).  If you're super hungry, you might not get entirely full.  Try the Spaghetti Squash, which has wonderful tomatoey flavor and very nice, firm consistency.    The Ahi Tuna Sliders are just excellent - beautiful fish, a touch of wasabi mayo (or something similar), sprouts - not always on the menu, but often still available.  For sides, I love both the Sweet Potato Hash and the Kale Salad.  They'll give you half of each so you don't have to choose, (yummy when mixed together, too).    The Red Chili Shrimp is a really well-made dish - lots of flavor, great ingredients/ texture and bit of spicy kick.  Their fresh drinks (eg cucumber refresher) are super well made and very refreshing, but overly spendy, in my opinion.    Overall, a favorite for us!  The atmosphere is beautiful - very open, modern but warm, with a beautiful patio.  The service has been consistently pretty good (from large parties to dinner for two or three)."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy food and great service in a bright, open space.  The servings aren't large and the prices are high for the portion size, but everything is interesting, genuinely healthy and delicious.  Love this place!  I've come here for breakfast in smaller and larger groups (2-6) and the service is always on point.  The market scramble is lovely (not heavy with oil like a lot of breakfasts, yet quite filling), as are the Quinoa Johnny Cakes (they just taste like fluffy, delicious pancakes - get the yogurt on the side to make sure you like it as a topping).  The also have wonderful lunch/dinner options! A few favorites include the shitake tofu lettuce wraps (wow! flavor) and the new seared spicy tuna wrap (my friend tasted it and said, \"Woah!  I didn't know tuna could be this good!\"), the red chili shrimp and the spaghetti squash casserole (this one is a little smaller, so get an appetizer if you're hungry).  The regular drinks, like the Cucumber Refresher, are absolutely delicious, but the Juby True juices are quite hit-or-miss, according to a few juice-loving friends."}
{"text":"This place always has friendly service but the wait time is always awful.   I really like their chicken chopped salad. Last time I ventured here, I tried the hangover RX juice drink and liked it. No sugar, just good ol' juice!   Things I like about this place besides the salad, is the friendly service I have always received. People working here seem to be happy which makes the dining experience even better!   I also like the fact while I am waiting to be seated, (which averages about 30 minutes each time I come here) I am able to go to shops close by and do a little retail therapy.  Note for people who like things salty and super sweet, you wont like it here. Their food is actually healthy and lacks all the nasty sodium!"}
{"text":"We moved to Arizona from Portland and when we miss the Portland vibe we go here. It's Portland \"disneyfied\". Clean, friendly, organized with all the hipster musts. The food is wonderful. My favorite is the spicy panang curry, nice heat yet fresh and light. Also the honey lemonade is great, as are there speciality beverages. I've always had good customer service, but it's very busy most of the time so I recommend making reservations."}
{"text":"I have had meals in 4 or five True Food locations and remain amazed at the consistently great food and service at these restos!  Get some!!"}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot when I'm looking for something on the lighter, healthier side.  The chicken chopped salad is an item I CRAVE at least every couple of weeks.  I go frequently with my husband and we used to split a salad and entree (some notables are the Panang Curry, Teriyaki bowl, Street Tacos, Shaved Turkey Pita, and the Caramelized Onion tart) - UNTIL we found out you can order half portions of most of the salads and entrees!  It's fabulous!  I am usually there to try to get my week off to a healthy start, but occasionally we have gone on Saturdays during the day after shopping at the Biltmore.  Nothing beats their patio and the Skinny Cucumber Citrus Margarita!  Beyond the food, the service is always excellent- the waiters are friendly and knowledgable.  Just a great experience all the way around."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my friends and personally I feel it's only okay, not wow.  Yes, I know it has a lot of positive reviews but for me I felt the food was kind of bland each time I went.  There weren't enough flavors popping in my mouth.  I felt I needed spices or something to give it a kick.  It was like eating with dulled tastebuds each time I went.  Although for others they may like that, but for me I love spices, I love flavor and fire, food with passion and heat, not boring.  Their drinks I wish my taste buds were dulled, because they were just icky for their alcoholic beverages.  Their non-alcoholic beverages were fine but a mixed drink I wouldn't recommend.  But I'm not one to complain at the restaurant so I decided to keep my beverage and drink it anyway when a friend called the waiter over herself and let them know I wasn't happy with my drink, they quickly removed it from the bill which was nice.  But then the bill arrived, over $100 for two people.  Each time I've been there I haven't seen that bill be below $50 and it's not like two people can eat that much.  For $100 I'd expect a mouth watering meal that blows my mind, not something so boring and bland I feel like I purchased it from a QT gas station.  Like I said it's not the same for everyone. I still have coworkers that go here often and just rave about the place.  Unfortunately I'm not one of them.  It's okay, but not for me."}
{"text":"My wife loved it. I thought it was mediocre but I don't care for these kinds of eateries. Not into organic, vegan, gluten free chow.  If you like what is apparently uber healthy, tasty chow, then this place is probably for you."}
{"text":"Hip. Romantic. Cool.  I've been to True Foods in SoCal, but coming to this location has been the best experience so far. My date and I came in around 7:30PM during the week and it was filled up pretty nicely. We were greeted at the door by the hostess and she was very sweet and cheerful. We asked to be seated outside and were seated immediately. Only a few minutes go by and we're already being greeted by our server who was so nice and upbeat, and funny! He got us water and asked us if we had ever been there before and recommended some of his faves.  I ordered the Kale & Avocado Dip that has pink grapefruit in it and the Medicine Man Refresher. My date ordered the Seared Tuna Wrap and the Hangover Rx (except he wasn't hungover)(I don't think...). When the server was telling us about the Seared Tuna Wrap, he was going over the Seared Fish and ended up getting his words backwards and called my date Seared... instead of Sir :) So for the rest of the night my date was Seared, instead of Sir. He was fun!  We got our meals out pretty quickly, and everything was so delicious! His (my date's) dish came with Quinoa that wasn't too saucy or over-abundant, it was JUST right. The tuna tasted fresh. I highly recommend trying out the Kale & Avocado dip though, it comes with chips but you can eat this dish with or without them and it's still great! (Although with the chips it makes it that much more wonderful.) The ambiance of the restaurant was very chill and hip, and the patio was a great place to relax and enjoy the weather - well, since it wasn't hot out!  We will return again, healthy fooood!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and the focus on fresh and mostly organic foods. I so appreciate a restaurant that adjusts its menu with the seasons. I'm vegan so those are the only dishes I've tried. The cauliflower appetizer is my absolute favorite. I've just ordered two of those as my meal on several occasions. The vegan pizzas are really yummy and filling. Really enjoy the vegan almond ricotta. The drinks and tonics are very tasty and refreshing. The hummus is great but not your average hummus- I'm guessing they don't use much tahini. The only reason I'm holding out on that fifth star is because of the consistent inconsistency of the food and service- but mainly the food. On more than a handful of visits the cauliflower appetizer is a different size or lacking a staple ingredient like dates or sauce. Still I do love this place so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"We eat here very I me we are in Scottsdale. Something yummy and healthy for everyone n the menu!"}
{"text":"If you are on a diet, looking for healthy food, or just want some great food True Food Kitchen is the spot.  Everything there is scratch made and fresh.  The restaurant its self is very modern and open which I love.  Their menu constantly changes which is good because that means there menu is changing with the seasons of the food so the food is fresh.  When I go there I always start of with a Kale Aid drink.  The Kale Aid is kale, ginger, apple, celery, cucumber, lemon, tastes very refreshing.  Then the must go to is Ancient Grains Bowl with Chicken.  The bowl consists of miso glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snow pea, grilled portobello, avocado, hemp seed.  This bowl is packed with flavor and it doesnt look much but it will fill you up (That is the hemp seed).  With the Anchient Grains Bowl I recommend getting the Charred Cauliflower which consists of harissa tahini, medjool date, dill, mint, pistachio.  It really is a great pairing to the Ancient Grains Bowl.  This place has it all for everyone unless you are just looking for a dirty cheat meal then this is not the place  but still a great place to have a healthy hearty meal.  The restaurant is very pricey though so watch out the bill will shot up quick.  The food is always fresh and made from scratch so that is why it is expensive.  Good clean food is always pricey.  So, all in all this is not a False Kitchen everything you hear about this place is TRUE!  BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"Definitely my kind a restaurant. Very fresh organic  food. The veggies are just full of nutrients and taste wonderful. Everything is made fresh. The juices are squeezed right there. You feel so good when you leave and all the food taste wonderful. All the employees just go out of their way to make sure your experience is wonderful."}
{"text":"WOW a place where I can eat what I've been putting on my face all this time.  Dr. Weil's magic potions.  His anti-flammatory diet is great if you're inflamed...I'm not, but I like the hummus and veggies for 8 bucks.  The sweet lady that calls me sweetie when I come in is surprising but I love someone that can be THAT happy at work...brings me back to an episode of Spongebob where Squidword was afraid to NOT smile or human resource aka a big fish that beat the crap out of you...would take you in the back and 'chat'.  I hope that's not the case here but you get what I mean about the creepy happiness.  I recommend this place when guests ask me where to go  because it feels local but it's not. I like that I can say it's locally inspired.  You definitely won't feel bad eating here, but you may just run into MoJo next door to balance it out."}
{"text":"About a week ago, my office team and I went for dinner to enjoy some out of office, get to know each other dinner conversation. I had never been to TFK and wasn't sure what to expect. When we decided on appetizers, we did: lettuce wraps, hummus, and the onion tart. They were ALL fantastic.  For my entrees. I ordered seared ahi sliders with my sides being: sweet potato hash and kale salad. It was all very fresh and the kale salad was the best I have ever had.  The atmosphere is a bit loud, but the fun thing is being able to see the farm fresh produce and herb stations being worked in front of you and that they have the best selection of foods from Vegan, Organic. Vegetarian, and carnivores.   All in all, we had a great time, great food, great drinks, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the decor, love the healthy-food concept.   I had a pizza and my friend had ravioli. We split the shrimp dumplings. (see attached photos). Dinner tasted fresh.   Prices were a little high for the portion size. I wouldn't put it on my favorites list, but I would gladly go with friends again."}
{"text":"I came in here for a quick bite the other day. The food is good, but the prices are just too ridiculous. A cup of vegan lentil soup is $7. That's just crazy. The entire bowl probably cost a little bit of change to make, and the bowl size was small and not even filled completely. As much as I like the food, and even though I have the money, I just can't justify spending $7 on a small portion of lentil soup. It didn't even come with a piece of bread or some other like carb. I finished it in less than 5 minutes.  Whatevs.  I could understand if it was mind blowing food, but I can cook food that is comparable."}
{"text":"Good, quality and healthy food. Portions are small so if you're a big eater, eat something before or plan on ordering more than one item. Decent amount of vegetarian and vegan options if that's your thing. This location is smack dab in the middle of Scottsdale Quarter and it sits in a visibly pleasing location. would consider returning in the future."}
{"text":"100 times better than the True Foods here in Fashion Valley. Service went ABOVE and beyond, I wish I knew the name of our server for a shout out... she was AMAZING! She was such a great help she really knew her stuff and made great recommendations (a healthy brunette with beautiful blue eyes) and way on top of her game. The drinks came out slow but I am sure that was not her fault.   I had the scallops and they were SO DAMN GOOD and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish! All of our party of 12 seemed very happy with their meals. I tasted the curry and it was very good. We had a great crudette appetizer with a beautiful and delicious variety of veggies and hummus and pita. Everything was fantastic. I have to say I was not very excited when the boss wanted to go here because I have been to the fashion valley one a couple of times and was not impressed with any meal or beverage.   This location changed my mind about True Foods. It's just the fashion valley one that sucks."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the concept. Great food.  I go to this place at least two or three times a month, usually if not for any other reason then to get a Medicine Man, they make me feel good.  Was recently there with a few buddies, and we enjoyed the Shrimp Dumplings the Curry Bowl tofu and the turkey Pita, everything here is always delicious and the service is top notch, the staff is very friendly and very informative.  I highly suggest if you like healthy food to try this place out it is definitely worth it. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is because I do feel it is a bit pricey. But I guess you get what you pay for more like 4 & half stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch before a movie at the iPic this weekend.  They were pretty busy, but we were able to get a table outside immediately.  I had peeked at the menu ahead of time and was glad to see a number of vegan options in addition to gluten free and vegetarian.  The restaurant boasts an open kitchen where you see a dozen prep cooks working hard on a ton a fresh produce.  The brunch menu (wknds 10am - 4pm) has an awesome variety of breakfast, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pizzas, sides and starters.  They have fresh juice and lemonade concoctions in addition to a healthy cocktail and wine list. (I took a few pics of the menu for drink ideas at home!)  I ordered the Mediterranean chopped salad, sans cheese to make it vegan. My taste buds were delighted with my selection!  I forgot to ask the server what the greens were in my salad... they were the tops/greens of something, but I couldn't figure it out by taste. Whatever it was, it perfectly complimented the almonds, quinoa, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, green beans and tomato-herb vinaigrette.  I do lots of quinoa salads and this was a great one.   My boyfriend was a big fan of the chicken sausage pizza with fennel and fontina. Neither of us had room (or time) for dessert... Next time I go, I'm aiming to have their Kale-Aid juice as a dessert: Juiced kale, apple, cucumber, celery, lemon and ginger. Sounds so refreshing!!"}
{"text":"So after being told they do not serve soda, I did not even think about asking for katchup ;)  Ok I will be honest I am not the healthiest eater so this would not have been my 1st choice but I had the grass fed burger and it was realy good, I did switch the carmelized onions with raw, just a person preference.  This is our last day in Phoenix for this vist, I can truly say that I have not had a bad dinning experience, love being able to eat out side in April, can't do this in Milwaukee until June or July."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen indeed serves the most true and delicious foods in their beautiful open kitchen.   The restaurant is simply picturesque and is how I would love my future kitchen to look like. It's new country chic, first page worthy of a true food recipe book, and perfectly complements their healthy menu items.   We started off with a couple of cocktails: \"Acai & Apricot\" and \"Cherry Bourbon Sour\". The thing about their fresh juices and cocktails is that you won't regret it with whatever you decide on. They're all amazing! However, this time we visited, the Cherry Bourbon Sour was a bit too sour without any tint of cherry bourbon so we told the server and the restaurant manager personally remade the drink himself and also brought the \"Ginger Margarita\" for us to try as if he read my mind! Needless to say, their service is excellent and they try their utmost best to serve high quality food and drinks.   My husband ordered the \"Grass-Fed Bison Burger\", which was the size of the moon and very tasty. It comes with a side of kale or sweet potatoes or you could ask for a little bit of both! Then I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and I must say, ever since I tried their Panang Curry, I can't get it anywhere else. Their Panang Curry is very well-balanced with fresh vegetables and filled with so much flavor that will rock. your. world.   I haven't tried their brunch so I'll be visiting again soon for that!!"}
{"text":"I was kinda hesitant about going to a vegan restaurant but was VERY pleasantly surprised. The food is amazing. The turkey wrap was tasty. The vegetables before dinner were very tasty and really enjoyable. The atmosphere rocks and the staff are very attentive. I wanted a light lunch and got exactly that. Tasty and filling (and I'm a big guy and like food). They even have some beer if you're up for one. Drop in and enjoy an apple soda too. This is place is definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Damn. Why can't something this organic and upscale-casual with cheap prices exist in LA?   Whoever invented this place is an ambiance genius. The place has natural lighting, a natural menu, and a full bar with natural juices.   The bison burger was $16 and succulent, delicious, and all those other nice verbs. It came with a hefty side of kale salad. (They give you the option of kale, sweet potato hash, or a little bit of both!) The manager came over to my table and even brought organic ketchup.   My friend ordered the salad with squash, brocolli, cauliflower, etc....It was filling and everything else good with the world.   LETS ADDRESS THE DESSERTS:  The banana pudding with chia seeds and coconut flakes was something else.... a little like a bite of heaven.   If they brought a franchise like this to LA, there is no way they would fail!"}
{"text":"It's so refreshing to see a local restauranteur give Phoenicians more vegetarian and vegan options when dining out, and thanks to Sam Fox of Fox Restaurant Concepts, True Food Kitchen hooks veggies like me up in a trendy setting. Everything on the menu is clearly outlined if it's vegetarian or vegan, so people with all types of diets will be happy.  The Biltmore Fashion Park restaurant even looks healthy, with a bright green motif and servers donning bright green capri pants-not the most fashionable get-up, but it mos def drives the point home that the eatery is going for a healthy, green vibe.  And, like Fox's others restaurants, this one has an open kitchen, though here, the kitchen/prep area seemed to take up more than half the restaurant, which I thought was pretty odd.  The crowd of diners was varied. There were plenty of 20-somethings, a ton of middle-aged folks and even families with babies mixed in.  While the atmosphere was slightly above average, the food was excellent. I started with a bowl of mushroom-filled miso soup ($6), which was vegan and chock full of shrooms, scallions and tofu. I loved it!  I paired my meal with a Cucumber Refresher ($4), a cucumber-infused honey lemonade. It was sweet, refreshing and didn't make me feel guilty about drinking it.  For my entree, I ordered a ricotta ravioli ($13), which was covered in a pesto sauce, more mushrooms and red peppers. It was an interesting twist on traditional tomato sauce-covered pasta, and it really filled me up.  For me, I'll definitely be going back to try more tasty meat-free bites."}
{"text":"I'd give the seabass entree a 3.5 stars based on the fact that I am used to living in cities with fresh seafood.  For Scottsdale standards, rating may be higher.  If you really love fresh seabass, you won't get satisfaction here but it's a decent plate.  The pom pom pop smoothie was very good.  I would give it 4 stars.  It's slightly sweet which is perfect for me.  Places like jamba juice make everything super sweet and I can never drink any of their stuff.  This place has a nice ambiance and outdoor seating is very nice when the weather is beautiful.  Update: I got a bad headache after eating the fish.  I felt good prior to coming here.  I remembered that the fish smelled a little fishy.  I should have returned it."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to their customer service.. yes the food is healthy and tastes amazing. not sure anymore that it's worth it tho. For thanksgiving i pre preordered a pie which they took mu credit card over the phone to charge.. well long story short it was a huge huge headache. They ended up having me pay also when I picked it up, should have checked my account that I had already been charged even tho they said I hadn't, when I called to get it corrected I noticed I had a third charge for which hey explained to me as an accidental charge of a slice of pie. Seriously?! Three charges for one purchase? I contacted customer service at their main office and never heard back, can't say I will continue supporting them after this whole ordeal and lack of service to make up for their mistakes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! So healthy and great service. Wish AZ would have more places like this."}
{"text":"overpriced fusion food and i know we are all just paying for their rent.  It was obviously a nice place to go on dates because when we were there that one night, there were about 6 couples around us.  So it's a nice place to go to for a clean, quiet meal. Since the portions arent big, there's plenty of room for dessert.  The drinks are nice and refreshing though."}
{"text":"This restaurant lives up to its name. They are really true to their concept here. I've dined at the Camelback True Food several times and so when I learned that the new True Food Kitchen was opening at Scottsdale Quarter, I couldn't wait to check it out! A couple visits later and I can rightfully say...Fox, you've done it again!   Believe it or not, I actually like this True Food better than the original location. The vibe is a lot cooler and more \"natural.\" I really feel healthier when I walk in. With the garden out back (or is it the front?) and the airiness and open feel, for a brief moment I feel like I'm on the countryside near a stream rather than in the middle of fashionista central.   Yes, it's the same exact menu as the other location and maybe because newer always tastes better, but I taste a different for the better in this menu! Everything has a bit more flavor and that's saying a lot because the flavor at the original location is pretty darn good! The hummus here is my favorite starter dish. They add olives and the pita bread is soft and chewy. One of my favorite go-to lunch items here is the Turkey pita sandwich. YUM. It's just as good if not better as I expected. In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of either the hash or the kale salad. The hash has also been kind of blah and the kale salad tasted like I was eating a leaf. But, here...I like both! I don't know what they did, but the hash has much more seasoning and taste. I had the sweet potato hash so that might have something to do with it. And the Kale salad wasn't quite so leafy.   As for the sides aka drinks and dessert, my favorite drink there is the Medicine Man. It takes a pretty spectacular non-alcoholic drink for me to pay $6, but if there's any drink that lives up to par, it's the Medicine Man. I could probably drink 11 of them, but I hold back. As for dessert, I normally don't opt for dessert at True Food because there's something anti-climatic about it there, but when I do splurge, the Carmel brownie is the way to go.   So welcome to the corridor True Food! You've made it just a little tastier here!"}
{"text":"I love coming here-the food, atmosphere, drinks...they also have a juice/smoothie bar on the north side of the building.  I'd recommend a kale side salad that they have, that was my favorite.   The restaurant is very open and bright in the daytime; I am unsure if they have misters or close the windows in the summer because of the heat.  Out service has been good the few times we've gone here.  Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Spaghetti squash casserole. So delicious! I've never had anything like it. It was the whole reason I went! The drinks my friend and I ordered were great too. Such great flavors. We did have to wait almost an hour for our food because I think our ticket got lost but the manager was nice about it. Service was great too and took his time explaining the menu. The place was packed and that's also a sign you know it's bomb!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the time spent there. Foods great and everyone is very friendly. Very good value for money."}
{"text":"Carry out order.  Quick service and polite staff. Ordered salmon; quinoa and arugula & beet salad.  Delicious."}
{"text":"My niece absolutely LOVES the restaurant. We sent here for her 18th bday. I had the Sangria which was oh so delish. And the street tacos. We ordered the steak and bass. Both were good but the bass (fish) we the BEST!!!!so yummy."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town with a party of 3, vegan, gluten-free, and standard American diet. True Foods has an innovative menu that had all of us happy with our food choices. The service and cleanliness of the restaurant was also 5 star! It was so delicious we ate here two nights in a row. I'm so happy they have another location in Boca Raton Florida, only 45 minuets from me. I cannot wait to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, love this place because everything is so healthy and natural, their freshly squeezed kale juice is amazing, and really love their quinoa salad, this place is a bit too loud and pricy but quality is really good, oh and their fish tacos are really good too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the truth !! We need a restaurant in every part of the valley delicious, fresh just a great relaxig atmosphere with reasonable prices... Ican'twaittoreturn#"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the valley! There pizzas are amazing as well as their bowls, apps and drinks. They change they're menu seasonally to give the freshest ingredients!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. We got the raw veggie crudité and charred cauliflower to start. So delicious, I could have been satisfied with just this as a meal. Then we shared a ancient grain bowl with steak. It was really really good and just hit the spot. Chia seed coconut flan for dessert was pretty good and was a good finish to the meal. This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, we will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Just as great at the first time!  We had the tofu lettuce wraps and the chicken terriyaki rice bowl.    Everything was super good and they even gave me a refill on my Arnold Palmer to go!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was sub par. Took forever to get our drinks & I think they had to go pick the veggies before we got our app. Clean atmosphere and great location. I will go back and give them another shot."}
{"text":"Gawd I love this place. I always have such good service and enjoy the seasonal menus they put out. The atmosphere is beautiful and comfortable. I take health conscious doctors (since some don't care about their health) and speakers out to this place and it's always been well received. I don't do grains so when I requested their teriyaki bowl to be made with spaghetti squash, they were happy to accommodate. As much as I wanted dessert, I had to pass... but next time, it's on!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"clean\" & fresh food, you should check this place out. This visit was my first time at True Food Kitchen. TFK is on a whole different playing field when it comes to dining out.  I had the sesame noodle dish, don't expect it to be like panda express' chow mein. The noodle dish was not greasy and I didn't feel guilty/ heavy after eating it.   The BF ordered the turkey sandwich with 1/2 & 1/2 of the offered sides, sweet potato & kale salad. I had a taste of each of the three items and they were all delicious. Next time, I'm ordering something from the sandwich column.  We also got their flour-less chocolate cake togo & ate it for breakfast the next morning w/our coffee. Yum.  I wish they had more options for fresh squeezed juices, but you'll see us back again at True Food's!  Hopefully they open one in San Francisco-CA or better yet, San Jose-CA."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, but the portions are kind of small. I had the ricotta ravioli and it was great. Really, tastefully fresh ingredients. I thought there was slightly excessive use of oil in the dish, but I am not a big fan of oil so I can't fault them for it. Overall a great experience! Sitting outside is lovely in October!"}
{"text":"first time here and i was impressed! my friend and i were promptly greeted and seated and given a run-down of the menu items and how each item was selected by Dr. Weil (i'm a huge fan of the anti-inflammatory diet).   we started with the hummus and were even brought a few pieces of extra pita since my friend is twice my size. the hummus was smooth and creamy and came topped with a little salad of cucumber, tomato, and olives.   i ordered the red chili shrimp. was told it was hot, but it wasn't too bad, so i asked for a side of their homemade \"siracha\" sauce. the noodles were soft but not soggy. the tidbits of greens and the shrimp were a delicious combination. i couldn't help but to wolf the whole thing down in a matter of minutes. my friend said his curry dish was fantastic and even placed a to-go order of the same for his wife.   very reasonably priced for middle class budget. friendly service and a beautiful dining area."}
{"text":"I was estatic  to try this place out. A new organic/vegetarin/vegan/ HEALTHY restaurant in Phoenix is this girls dream come true!  First of all, I loved the decor and ambiance. Put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and I love it!  I had the harvest salad to start and I must say I want to go back every day just for this. Goat cheese, apples, walnuts, butternut squash and pomegrant-lious! I had the teriayki tofu for my main course. I wasn't as impressed. Teriyaki sauce is not my favorite but I was really craving the tofu, which was good tofu. You can actually substitute tofu for the meat in alot of the dishes, so I really liked that. The drinks are definitely not the focal point of this place, as I did not care for the rye vodka they had (their only vodka).  I will definitely be back again and again...."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant with admirable aspirations that fail due to the mass marketing mentality inherent in chain organizations.  ANTI-INFLAMMATORY food.  It's a bold claim and untrue.  It's the main reason for the two-star rating.  When you walk in, the receptionist greets you with the corporate tag line that the menu is anti-inflammatory.  It's also stated on the menu and on the chain's main website.  This is just branding and what they'd like you to think they're doing, even though it's untrue.  What is anti-inflammatory?  With all of the celiac, crohn's, ibs, sibo, MS, ALS, ADD and \"spectrum\" disorders on the rise, it's imperative for some to eat this way to function.  Generally, an anti-inflammatory diet is grain, dairy, sugar, additive and soy free.  But it's also BEAN free.  You can call it Atkins, paleo, GAPS, fodmaps, SCD, Whole 30 diet... Many names for essentially the same thing.  But you won't get it here.  Where True Food fails: uh most of the above.  The menu is filed with grains, dairy, sugar and beans.  My salad, the Summer Ingredient Salad, which costs $13, had a full CUP of garbanzo beans and raisins on it.  Check the menu.  These two ingredients weren't listed on this salad.  I happen to be on an actual anti-inflammatory diet and had to pick them out as I ate.  Missing was the broccolini, mint and there were maybe 6 pistachios on it and those three things *were* listed on the menu.  The other reason I knocked this down to a 2 was the tap water they serve at the table, which has a taste of mold in it.  I have a very sensitive sense of taste and the water in our carafe definitely tasted like mold.  I've never been wrong when I've, for example, tasted things like mold, msg, rogue ingredients in food and water.  It's sometimes a curse to have such an acute sense of taste, but mostly a blessing.  I've always ended up being right.  Anyway, True Food Kitchen needs to install reverse osmosis or clean whatever filtration system they do have so they don't serve up any more inflammatory agents like mold in their restaurant than they already are."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Instead of getting a table, my girl and I sat at the bar, tried all the special drinks the bartenders suggested to us, and had some amazingly delicious food to boot! Can't wait to try the Chicago location."}
{"text":"If you want quality food and atmosphere, this is the place. I love the one in Scottsdale quarter. It looks like heaven specially at night when all the lights are shining in the fountain area. I feel like home in true food."}
{"text":"First time going in and the food was amazing! The hostesses were so sweet. Our server, Dylan, was so sweet and knowledgeable of the menu. Rory, who ran food to us, made it a point to ensure that all our food was to our liking. There was so many yummy vegetarian and vegan options. I could live off of the edamame dumplings! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! The house chicken sausage pizza  is possibly the best pizza I've ever eaten! Also, the manager, Arianna was very accommodating. Great service great food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed until around 8:30 but was definitely worth the wait. The food was wonderful, I had the pad Thai. The appetizers are definitely worth a try. The edamame dumplings were great. Definitely wish there were more restaurants around like this, also the atmosphere was incredible, we sat outside and just really enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  You will feel so healthy after you have eaten here. Lots of vegan and gluten-free items on the menu, if you're into that sort of thing. My family isn't vegetarian, but they have organic meats too... win, win for all!  Awesome fresh squeezed juices.  GREAT sweet potato hash and kale salad. Yum. Loved the vinegar dressing on that salad.  We all tried some new things and liked it.   Waitress was very upbeat and friendly, putting up with my 9-year old daughter's incessant questions and conversation. :)  She gave us info about travel to Sedona or the Grand Canyon and welcomed us spring breakers to her town warmly.  We would definitely recommend this restaurant and go back next time we are in town. Had about a 30 minute wait, so we ventured into the Nike store across from it, and the Buckle for some good shopping. Great shopping area too and good people watching. Sat outside in the open air... lovely!"}
{"text":"This is a great healthy option that is so very tasty you won't miss eating like a greasy glutton (which is what I usually do). A highlight was the hangover drink. It was so very good. We had the edamame dumplings with had a smooth texture on the inside and was in a nice broth with some savory smoky flavors. I recommend them for sure to start. We also had the kale guacamole which was delicious and will satisfy even those who hate kale. The chips they come with are nice and crunchy with a good sturdiness to pick up a lot of guacamole in one go. For entree, we got the grilled chicken salad and the pan roasted chicken, both were excellent! I plan on becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for two reasons, they have a good menu selection and it's super close to where I live! The prices are a little steep, but sometimes it's worth it ... depending on the wait staff and how well they make the food. It's a hit or miss on the service and/or the food. There's one manager there who is awesome and responsive should there ever be an issue. And for the most part the server is friendly. The food is about 50% correct and delicious. It's still worth coming here and gambling it though, because when the food is done correctly it's DELICIOUS and when you get a good server, it makes for an excellent experience. I don't recommend take-out ... that's the worse service EVER."}
{"text":"I made special arrangements for my better half's birthday celebration. Since his work was taking place in the Scottsdale area for the birthday week, I decided to have a bunch of friends come up for dinner. True Foods had been recommended and I'd even tasted the homemade version of the infamous kale salad. Also if you haven't heard of Dr. Weil, miracle worker and life guru to many humans, but he sadly no longer feeds my pets (his kind of petfood is now extinct), you just have, now go subscribe to his hourly email list. (Ok, don't do that)  We arrived, table was procured successfully, drinks were ordered. In our tradition of sharing when the drinks arrived everyone got a sip or so going clock wise around the table.  We received starter plates, two of which had a bit of Schmutz on them. Yikes, that was fixed. Then drinks Me: Thai grapefruit martini - first glass dirty...We alerted the manager to now the third unclean dish and they immediately remade it. This drink goes down way easy and received the table's favorite award. Lady friend: Cucumber-citrus skinny margarita Lady friend's other half: Ginger margarita Birthday boy: Spontaneous happiness  The drinks were excellent, the starters were the crudite and the salmon dip and more than enough for four hungry eaters. My lady friend ordered the miso soup, which is not the traditional pale sushi restaurant variety, but instead a shiitake mushroom based clear nut bown broth with a very different flavor profile. Very enjoyable.  Salads: Kale, which is amazing so straightforwardly simple, but quite complex in flavors.  Watermelon and tomato salad, also simple, but very well done.  Entrees: 2 Miso glazed black cod, 1 Seabass and 1 Panang curry, which had a nice creamy coconut curry with quite a bit of spice/heat to it.  The black cod made me most happy, which was fortunate since it was on my plate.  Dessert was comped because a birthday celebration and one of my drinks was also comped due to the initial dirty dishes.  Overall it was fantastic and the people were really looking out for us."}
{"text":"I had the Ginger Margarita... Strong flavor and good palate cleanser. The edamame dumplings with truffle oil, and the Poki bowl for the main course. I enjoy the meal and the atmosphere a lot."}
{"text":"I had the beef tacos that were 3 inches in diameter which made eating in hand impossible.  The $14 veggie bowl had no more than $2 worth of edibles.   A glass of wine was underpoured.   Service was good but there's not much on the menu for me to return.  Overpriced and interior noise was annoying."}
{"text":"This was the best food I've ever had. Ever. I save my five stars for stellar restaurants only and this one? IS the definition of stellar.   I'm vegan and often eat with my boyfriend who is not vegan nor vegetarian. This place allowed us to both eat straight off the menu with no modification which is AWESOME.   Our waiter, Adam, was helpful, knowledgeable, and absolutely a valuable resource when it came for my boyfriend to choose between the steak tacos or the lasagna.   I got the ancient grains bowl and couldn't be more happy. I am so full and so happy. This place has a CUTE earthy vibe and reminds me a lot of Nashville. I adore it, and will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Here is a rare but deserving compliment for an establishment....FIVE STARS....that's right this establishment at the Scottsdale Quarters is top notch. I decided to go there and have lunch today....and I have to tell you it was fantastic. I had the Turkey Burger....which may be the best I have ever had.....was fired grilled with lettuce....tomato...provolone cheese...avocado...on a Flax seed Bun. I had a Kale salad and sweet potato hash as my side dishes....no French Fries people....not that kind of restaurant....LOL....(sorry).   Now True Food simply means they use locally organic and locally grown products....everything is light but doesn't lack any flavor....and trust me it DOESN'T....everything taste great. The have tons of gluten-free items on the menu....and the honey lemonade I had was simply delicious and refreshing. You get one free refill on that and unlimited refills on Black and Green Tea....if your a Tea fan. If you decide to visit this locale ask for Brock...he was outstanding....and I made sure his manger who's name is Kelli (hope I am not spelling it wrong) knew that he did a great job.   My water glass never got empty....he refilled my lemonade without me even asking....and he checked on us frequently to make sure we didn't want for anything....needless to say he got a nice tip. I could go on and on...but just go for yourself and remember to Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!"}
{"text":"NOMNOMNOM.  I have been here about 4 or 5 times and it never disappoints.  Yes it is a bit pricey, because, sadly, you do pay more n this country to eat healthy food.  But this place does it right with local fresh ingredients and sustainable items.  Their menu changes seasonally and I am happy to say that the summer menu is as good as the winter one was.    We started with a glass of Tangent Pinot Grigio, which was perfect and was served in an ice bucket at our table side.  My buddy and I shared the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad and WOW.  Best and most interesting salad I have had in Phoenix, and I go out every night I am in Phoenix, which means three nights a week for the last year and a half.  My bud ordered the salmon, which she liked alot but still prefers the preparation they do in the winter months.  That didn't stop her from scarfing the whole thing down, though.  I had the halibut with Asian mushroom and eggplant.  The halibut was perfectly prepared and worth the $26 price tag (I told you it is pricey).  I loved the eggplant, the squash, and the sauce, but am not a fan of the mushrooms, which were too tough to cut and a bit of a disappointment.  I am still a bigger fan of the pan seared trout that I had last time I was here, and that is what I will get next time.  I am usually not a fresh water fish eater, but the preparation here is divine and I still dream about that darn fish.    My partner in crime insisted on ordering the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and the one bite I allowed myself was to die for.  It was swimming in warm caramel and topped with very rich vanilla ice cream.  DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE.  Truly fabulous."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise, I had to dragged to a \"healthy\" eating experience by my boss.  All I could picture was tofu and bean sprouts, was I mistaken.  There was such a wide selection of dishes and they have real taste.  I would recommend this place to those \"meat & french fry\" types.  The staff can get a little carried awayed explaining the dishes but I is nice to know what you are eating."}
{"text":"My sister and I finally got to get some quality time here when we were on our recent \"where won't the carnivore go eat out week\".  We went early on a Tuesday and were glad we did because before we left it was full to the brim.  Although the space is wide open, sound is kept to a minimum so even when they are overflowing you can still have a conversation.  The food is has been covered but let me add in my vote for the inside out burger, which is a flavor explosion of tangy, tart, spicy, and sweet in one crunchy bite.  Because the \"bun\" is actually the quinoa patties, it is a fork and knife event and pure bliss.  Dinner ended with a shared portion of the squash pie which comes with a side of the cocunut whipped cream and let's just say they should just sell big bowls of that cream.  It is light and airy just like the fatty traditional whipped cream but it has a delicacy that is not in it's heavy counterpart and the subtle infusion of the cococnut... well let's just say I could eat my way out of a bathtub full of the stuff.  I completely agree with Matthew K on his callout on the liquor. It seems very odd to me that you can shot up your smoothies considering their \"healthy style\" but who am I to argue with the anti-inflamatory king, Dr. W?  But that said, the wait staff was so extraordinarily friendly and attentive in a non-creepy (i.e., please go away) sort of way that I quickly lost traction on that rant.  Luckily after giving the menu a full once over, we decided the carnivore would be satisfied with the choices, so we will definately be back for some more of the kale salad goodness. :)"}
{"text":"5 stars, no question! The quality was incredible. Ever bite you are reminded of what food should taste like - natural and healthy, leaving you energized and feeling great. I had the grass fed burger with sweet potatoes and kale salad. I usually hate Kale, but the lemon juices and seasonings made it super tasty! The rest of the day I felt good and wasn't tired.   I walked through the kitchen and they have people peeling carrots, washing lettuce, cutting squash, etc.   I'll definitely be back and sharing this with my friends and family."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant to go to! So many gluten free and dairy free options. Their salmon is cooked to perfection and their charred cauliflower is to die for... not to mention their desserts... the squash pie is to die for...would never know it's gluten free and dairy free!! Sadly it's only seasonal...but I look forward to it every season :)"}
{"text":"This place is healthy and very tasty.  However, the menu is spotty which is why I'm only giving 3 stars.  Sometimes the words, healthy and tasty do not go together.  However, True Food has figured out the secret ingredients to a few entrees!  (They just need to work on a few others).  They have many entrees that are good for you, along with gluten free items.  We have friends that visit us from out of town that are \"health nuts\", and this is the only place they want to dine.  I'm healthy, but not on their level so I guess this says a lot.  I really like the grass-fed bison burger.  (Gluten-free bun upon request).  They also have a # of salads, fish, and chicken dishes.  The only reason I don't give it 4-5 stars is that the salads are mainly lettuce/greens with little other ingredients described on the menu description.  Also, their teriyaki brown rice bowl didn't taste very good.  I see a lot of potential at True Food Kitchen.  Hopefully, they can make a few changes to their menu to be even better."}
{"text":"Good food, but not much of it for the price.  Trendy Scottsdale restaurant.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, quick, and efficient. The noise level precludes serious business discussions. The food is good and they present a unique variety of unusual choices; however, I am allergic to MSG and I reacted to something in the Herb Spiced Hummus - why do restaurants still use that . . . ?"}
{"text":"I have been here 10+ times and have been satisfied each time.  I love, love the alcohol free drinks and am anxiously waiting for the blood red oranges to come back into season!  I especially like the salads, particularly the Mediterranean with grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Always a hit, my bad experiences here have been very limited, almost always leave a happy customer. So I returned to True Foods a couple days ago after having not dined there in about a year or two and I think this last visit was my favorite! There is so much variety here, healthy food and the vegetarian options are bountiful. I noticed that the menu was a little different since the last time I'd been there, but they still had my faves so I was happy! It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night, but luckily I was able to get a seat right away. The server there was super nice and attentive to us. I absolutely love pizza, and I get the mushroom pizza almost every time I come here. However, I decided to change things up this time and went for the butternut squash pizza, and I am sure glad I did. I love both of the pizzas, but I think I prefer the butternut squash pizza. The walnuts definitely make it infinitely better, so good! Plus the fresh arugula on top is a nice touch. The spaghetti squash here it good too, but a bit pricier. I still have yet to try a Juby true juice, for sure on my list of things to try. Gives me reason to come back!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come here while in toqn for business.   It's so refreshing to find a restaurant catered to vegetarian and gluten free patrons and taste like home style meals.  The kale salad was tasty as was the turkey lasagna...but beware of the garlic use. I'm sensitive to garlic and both my plates were loaded.   The service waa great and our waiter (his name was either Todd or Tyler) knew the menu and sold my significant other on meals to dessert...and he was right on.    The ambiance is relaxing and inviting,  and you can watch the staff take good care at making sure all plates and silerware are clean.  I can't wait to come back on my next visit to try the inside out quinoa burger."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I had the Farmers salad and they were very accommodating to my requests to change the salad a bit.  Nice choices of organic wines as well.  I had the Chardonnay and it was yummy.  I went by myself to read a book and the server was respectful of the alone time I was there for.  I will definitely go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"A guilt free go-to spot.   Relaxed atmosphere and food thats filling but doesnt weigh u down.    Edamame dumplings are awesome.  The roasted turkey wrap, T.L.T., Margherita pizza, House made chicken sausage pizza, and teriyaki quinoa bowl are ones i know wont disappoint."}
{"text":"Salty salty salty. But almost vegan. We walked in at 5pm on a Sunday which was today and we're seated immediately. Those who came at 515pm had a half hour wait. The whole world walked in! We got our drinks at 515pm but our food took forever. The manager came over and apologized for the long wait. By then, I was more concerned about the other customers as they started to look around the room and were getting impatient....like on the edge. We had the bruschetta, chicken sausage pizza and kale salad. All average and salty. Btw, this restaurant is supposed carry the Dr Weil brand who is a health food guru."}
{"text":"Updating my review only to say that the crudite is amazing.  For 11 dollars I know some people will gripe that you are getting raw vegetables, but you have to understand it is a giant, artfully constructed ice cold bowl of fresh, organic vegetables served with tzatziki and olive tapenade for dipping.  Even as cheap as I am, I will lovingly order the crudite appetizer now.  Oh and top it off with some edamame dumplings if you are feeling indulgent."}
{"text":"Great food great people!  I walked in and was immediately greeted and seated where Adam told me about True Food Kitchen and it was nice to hear about what they had to offer. Adam explained that their menu changes every couple months depending on what the local farmers had in season. He gave me a few minutes to look over the menu while he brought me my water. I tried the hangover RX (I wasn't hungover but it had coconut water my favorite) it was delicious and refreshing. For my entree I ordered the squash casserole which was delicious! I did not know what to expect or if I would get full with just veggies, but let me tell you I did not want it to end. The cheese the sauce the squash everything had a perfect taste. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate caramel cake which was amazing as well! It came with ice cream and that was just as delicious.   I can't wait to return to continue trying their many foods :)"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Lovely ambiance and classy restaurant. Had the most amazing food. The menu was great and it included gluten free dishes. I had the most yummy gluten free squash spaghetti w shrimp. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The menu has a little something for everyone and the kitchen is amenable to customization. I enjoy the fresh, local ingredients and the seasonal changes.  A nice selection of wines, coupled with organic cocktails and fresh juices are available.  Of course, the biggest draw is Dr. Weil's partnership, although if you've read his books there are some selections counter to his recommendations.  The inside is loud (and dark at night), but there is also outdoor seating that is much calmer."}
{"text":"Overpriced, tiny portions. Whiskey sour was good and the lasagne was alright. Decent atmosphere. I'm pretty sure the waiter had a fake accent."}
{"text":"Fresh, wonderful, sustainable food sourced. The menu changes from spring to fall. The wait staff was wonderful and attentive.  The chicken sausage pizza is a must, and the bison burger is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life! I ordered it medium rare which most people would order medium, but I am a bison lover and eat carpaccio very often, so a little pink doesn't scare me. It was melting in my mouth.  We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and I must say, delish!!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved the healthy fare but CUM-BUY-AH!  This place is uber-spendy for what you get.  We fed three people lunch for about $90.  Food and service is great and you should expect to pay when you eat in the Scottsdale Quarter, but for that kind of $$$ I'd rather eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Eating out, does not get any better than this. Coming here, feels as good as doing yoga. Love so many delightful items on the menu. All food cooked with love and bliss. Colorful fresh in season garden veggies... a must try fav place, that also serves up a very tasty burger. Andrew W. Author of 5 weeks to optimal health, along with many other health books opened this I think. Huge fan of his works, so yes, I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a great fan of this place for some time now. Until my last experience earlier this evening I would have given them 4 stars. However, based on my carryout experience today it is obvious that their hubris is based on in store dining.  45 minutes to fulfill a 2 item order is unacceptable anywhere in the planet. And for the attitude of the staff: OMG hubris at its best.  This is a great place for good food but service is deplorable."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light, quick lunch and clink of glasses to celebrate closing on our new home. We clearly made it after any lunch rush - if they had one. Very sparsely occupied with patrons. It took longer than acceptable to get water and then even longer to get our celebratory glass of white wine. Was wondering if it would be time for dinner before we got our lunch. The food we ordered was very good and our server was delightful - just too much waiting."}
{"text":"My husband and I both loved this restaurant. I am vegan, he eats everything, and we both found dishes that we loved. In addition, we found out that there was a TFK in Chicago where we live...so we will be adding that to our rotation. We got the Quinoa Inside Out \"Burger\", the Chicken Sausage and Fennel Pizza and the Teriyaki Quinoa Bowl. Each one was perfect. We also got the iced black and iced green tea. I highly recommend this restaurant in whatever city you are close to."}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful server.  Really tasty food. Tonight we shared ( they split it all willingly and no up charge). Miso soup, bison burger And vegetable salad. Perfect texture, flavor a and attentive service"}
{"text":"True, it is food.  What kind and how it taste?  Well let's break it.  We ordered the Shrimp Spring Rolls to start.  It was bland, but with the sauce it had some kick. Next up, the Kale salad...mmmm kale with a splash of lemon - the fairest of them all!  I'll pass on the poison apples - it's not good for my health. Finally, we ordered the Turkey Bolognese. It was undercooked pasta with ground turkey....huh. Overall, I thought I could have made all this at home and probably taste the same, and I'm no Chef.  Service was good, everyone seemed relaxed and I wasn't sure if I should have busted out my Yoga mat with this crowd (Namaste) - Ambience was loud and very green. Almost too pretentious - \"We're green and healthy, eat this food, it's like hugging a polar bear.\" Don't get me wrong I'm all for the environment, but I like Pandas better haha - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I love when I find a place that is vegan friendly but still has non-vegan items. I 100% recommend True Food to everybody."}
{"text":"Not starting out so well, I told the hostess how many in our party and she didn't bother to write it down. Thank goodness I waited around because a man came in right after that and she put him in the computer before us. I pointed it out and she just gave me a snooty little smile and didn't acknowledge that we would be going first. One gets towed so tired of \"Scottsdale \" people who work at restaurants and give their customers an attitude. Hopefully the evening gets better."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen did not live up to the hype I was expecting after ready so many good Yelp reviews...  It was A-OK at best for this Fox Restaurant.     We arrived for lunch and the True Food Kitchen was very busy so we opted to sit on the patio in 109 degree weather.  We were shaded and they have misters, so we were relatively comfortable.    Restaurant ~ there has plenty said already about this place on Yelp and the pics are a slide show for you to enjoy.  It's a nice looking restaurant both inside and out.  The decor and color schemes are nicely done.  I did not care for the flow since there are really two main entrances, one on the north side and one of the south side.  We entered the north side and stood in front of the bar area for a while until one of the bartenders informed us we had to go to the other side of the bar to see a hostess for seating.  Service ~ This was one of the more disappointments during our lunch. We were off to a bit of a rough start but that really didn't matter, it was the service we received throughout our dinning experience.  It started off great with placing our order and receiving our drinks but after we received our meal... our server must have checked out.  We tried to stop a few other passing by servers however they they too seemed disinterested in their customers as if they were all having a bad day.   We did not see our server again until we were ready for our bill.    Food ~ I ordered the grass fed Bison burger, which had shiitake mushrooms and onions, mayo, parmesan cheese on a flax bun. It was supposed to be an Unami burger but it was more of a Tsunami burger.  The parmesan cheese was too much for this well cooked and seasoned bison burger.  It over powered the taste so I had to remove it.  I ordered the sweet potato hash as my side, which was good for the first few bites but then it became somewhat blah...  We also order the shaved turkey sandwich but they were out of shaved turkey.  It was 11:30am...   So we opted for the turkey burger with a side of kale salad.  The turkey burger came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, provolone cheese, and mayo on a flax bun.  The burger was cooked very well but could have assembled better.  They placed the tomato's on top of the not so ripe avocados which were on top of the lettuce.  This made the burger like a pin ball machine, with every bite out shoots a chunk of avocado.  Bite  ~ ping, out shoots a chunk onto her blouse.  Another bite ~ pang, out shoots another chunk and it bounces onto the table.  They should consider making an avocado aioli spread for this burger.  The kale salad was also good for the first few bites then it tasted blah.  Since this was our first visit to the True Food Kitchen I raised this review up to 3 stars.  I am hesitant but will consider going back for another try in hope the service and quality of food is better.  I will be sure to select something different on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had an unbelievably delicious AND healthy meal tonight at True Food Kitchen: SUSTAINABLE STEELHEAD* Smoked Onion Tabbouleh, Arugula, Golden Beet & Cilantro Pumpkin Seed Pesto. I'm new to eating healthy and cooking healthy. I'd love to get the recipe for this meal...are you listening True Foods?   I like scrumptious or spicy food over bland. The lemon whatever they tossed the arugula in was unexpectedly yummy and addicting. The trout was moist, delicious and pretty! :-) The tabbouleh was plentiful and made me full by the time I finished scooping up every morsel. I'm now officially glad there's a True Foods closer by at the Biltmore.   The first time I went to a True Foods, I had a salad that looked like they just arranged all the prettiest raw veggies from the farmer's market they could find and crammed them into a bowl. It looked like art but it also felt like I was just eating from the produce section. It was boring. It had no taste. But I care more about healthy eating now than I did that first visit.   If other items on their menu are this tasty, True Foods and I are going to become close.   I recommend restaurants to my high end matchmaking clients all the time. I like that you can go for a walk after dinner and hold hands window shopping or go for an after dinner drink at one of the many nice places at both TF locales... Biltmore Fashion Park and Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Like most of Sam Fox's establishments True Food is consistent. I came here a few days ago to meet some friends for a late lunch and it was surprisingly busy for the time of day. We waited about 20 minutes of the 30 we were quoted. Nice. Service was quick and friendly, I ordered the Scratch Bloody Mary and it was just ok. Pretty basic garnish and didn't have much flavor. For food I ended up with the Garden Scramble with sausage and avocado. The added avocado portion was pretty small with just a couple pieces. I'm glad I also added the sausage because it was kind of bland otherwise. I found myself breaking up the sausage to get some on each bite. There was supposed to be smoked gouda but that was nowhere to be seen (or tasted). I got a cup of chicken noodle soup and it was pretty forgettable. These types of places appeal to the masses but if you want top notch, unique food then this isn't your place."}
{"text":"We go there with the family quite often. The food is good and healthy but not outstanding. In AZ you can not BYO wine, so many of the restaurants that do serve wine will be dinged.  Food: 3 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4 Wine: 3 Parking: 3 Value: 3"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes, yes, yes.   So fresh and flavorful and delicious and modern and healthy (mostly) and varied and spicy, sweet, crunchy... Seriously. So good.   We sat at the bar. Always sit at the bar.   It's not on the menu, but one of the bartenders (I wish I remembered his name!) makes a damn good spicy Bloody Mary. And it's not Sunday Brunch without a Bloody Mary.   I had the Spicy Shrimp noodle something or other. It was awesome. The broth was spicy, there were a lot of shrimp and vegetables and the noodles were the perfect texture.   I had the hardest time picking what I wanted because everything on the menu sounds and looks awesome. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and really loved everything about this place.  Great location in Scottsdale for shopping and dining. Nice ambiance, casual and clean. Friendly servers, and most of all really good food and drink.  We arrived around 11:30am hoping to beat some lunch crowds but they were almost full. We took a patio seat, and was just perfect. Warm Friday in January. By the time we left, this place was totally packed.  I started my lunch with hangover drink. No, I didn't have hangover, I was just tired from work related stress and my friend suggested to have this coconut drink with pineapple and vanilla. It was in fact refreshing, my body really needed to be hydrated.  We shared caramelized onion tart. Really enjoyed the garlic and black figs. It was light, crisp, right amount of portion size to split as a lunch appetizer.  I ordered butternut squash pizza for my lunch. They use fresh ingredients and butternut squash and arugula went together really well. I actually like butternut squash, and this was the first thing that jumped into my eyes. Although I saw something else I thought I might enjoy, but I had to try... I ate a half of it and took the rest home to save a room for desert.  Flourless chocolate cake with caramel. Caramel is at the bottom of the chocolate cake. Be sure to dig all the way and enjoy ice cream, chocolate cake and caramel all together. Espresso was the perfect compliment to the chocolate cake.   I enjoyed leisurely lunch that afternoon, all vegetable lunch was so light, it was just perfect."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is perfect- eating healthy food designed by Dr Weil, a foremost physician dealing in true Hippocratic medicine (food). The dishes are indeed healthy and very delicious most of the time. This particular location had some inconsistencies with their food preparation that left me unimpressed. The server was strange and intense which didn't help. My five star review is for how the manager handled our gripes. Ryan, the manager, took care of us very well and was able to assure us of fantastic future visits. My husband and I love this restaurant and hope the next time we're out in Arizona, they live up to their usual reputation of great healthy food. Thanks Ryan!!"}
{"text":"Went there for a light dinner the other evening.   I had the smoked turkey wrap and the daily soup.   My companion had the poke bowl.   I must admit, when I go out, I don't usually aim for the \"healthy\" type of food but once in a while, it's a good idea.     The wrap has an assortment of items:   cucumber, avocado, tomato, hummus.   The smoked turkey was tasty, not that rolled turkey sort of disgusting item.   Adding the crunch of the cucumber gave it a delightful texture.   I love avocado; therefore, can't go wrong with that; the tomato gave it color, and there was just enough hummus to give it a \"dressing\" sort of taste and flavor.  Very tasty.   I'd get it again.  I can't remember the soup of the day.  It was a cream sort of soup with a bit of spice to give it a pop.    It would be good just as a meal if it was larger.     My companion had the poke bowl.   I didn't taste it but was told it was good.  I would go again if I was in the mood to eat healthy.   Since I try to eat healthy at home, going out I want something I don't normally cook.  Sarah was our server.   Quite pleasant, professional and competent."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with friends and family, and the food is always amazing. They have great seasonal selections, as well as a variety of dishes for vegetarians, as I am one. My boyfriend who is the complete opposite has also found meals here that he loves, and he's always wanting to go back for more. The atmosphere is fantastic as well as the servers. You can tell they really want to be there and they truly care about their customers' experiences. I applaud the management at this restaurant because it does not look like an easy place to manage. Keep up the fantastic work guys, it is definitely paying off!"}
{"text":"Bison burger and kale were amazing.  Parking a bit difficult.  Service excellent."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the Apple, Carrot Ginger Tonic, Andy's Favorite TLT (tempeh, lettuce and tomato) and the Banana Chocolate Tart. Everything was great but oh wow that Banana Chocolate Tart from True Food Kitchen is pure bliss the flavor profile is simply divine."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. I would way rather go to Pita Jungle, or Federal, or pretty much anywhere..."}
{"text":"Beautifully located in Scottsdale Quarters. Great for a mom lunch right by the splash pad or date nights. Food and drinks were amazing. Relaxing outside dining and service always very personable.   Have ordered sandwiches, pizza, and spaghetti squash. All entrees were delicious and the best part HEALTHY! Kids menu had a good selection but portions are limited. Highly recommend True Food especially for gluten free eaters."}
{"text":"Always delicious and healthy! Hummus is topped with fresh cherry tomatoes and olives. I get the sweet chili shrimp with shirataki noodles and it is mouthwatering. One of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"It's ok. But i can eat like this at home...or no, i can eat better at home and i won't be out 100$, feel like a cool people fad with the obvious healthy edge. Overpriced as hell and overrated. We had been before and had the same feeling, but wanted to give it another go before officially crossing it off the list, since you can hardly make an informed opinion off of 4 food items. Well now we have had 8, and it's consistently underwhelming and overpriced."}
{"text":"good food in tiny proportions and pricey as hell. god forbid you get refills on your drinks and get charged extra each time? side salads are like saucer cups! when did the price of lettuce go up?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here 3 times now - will make the drive on my next trip in. If you're into eating quality healthy foods, I'm putting this up there in my fav 5 for places to go in the country.   Only thing holding me back from claiming more love is the drink prices (they will get you) on their bar drinks..  Not too far off what you'll pay at many other places in Scottsdale but it's not the wallets best friend from that perspective.  Get their Bison burger, Kail-aid drink and soak up the delisc!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a colleague here recently. I like that they have healthy food and adequate - but not overwhelming portion sizes. I order the teriyaki bowl and asked for chickpeas instead of one of the protein options listed in the menu - and they had no problem with that. It was delicious.   I appreciate some of the little touches at this place, like when you order water, they give you your own carafe and if you wear dark pants, skirt, or dress, they give you a black napkin to replace the white one that is part of their standard place setting.    The only thing I would change is make it a bit less noisy. Sometimes it was hard to hear my dining companion."}
{"text":"This place deserves 10 stars. The food is amazing and the best service in town. Chris and Nate are always very friendly and they even know what I am ordering most of the time. The managers always come by to say hello. All around great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place is quite cool.  They make a note that their menu is prepared in accordance with Dr. Andrew Weil (a well known physician-author) health guidelines.  However, don't think that this is a veggie only operation. I had a bison chili to start and it was quite delicious. Then, a tasty chicken sausage thin crust pizza. Try out their site-created sodas. The seasonal one was a grape concoction but tasted more like a crème soda.  Not only was the server extremely nice but they also have a lovely outdoor seating area that's shaded."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fresh and made with quality ingredients.  I love the variety of dshes too. I had a Thai curry dish and it was great! I'll go back here every chance I get."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and I like the healthy living menu theme - especially the fresh made drinks.  The food was enjoyable - though, nothing that can't be easily replicated at home after a quick stop at Whole Foods.  My biggest issue is that True Foods is way, way, way OVERRPRICED for what you are getting.  There is nothing truly special here to merit the cost of the meal - you'll likely enjoy whatever you order, but you will also leave with a nagging feeling that you got fleeced..."}
{"text":"I'm kinda stingy about giving up 5 stars but this place is the real deal.  I've been to the Biltmore True Food location and it was OK but I like this new place better.  The building has plenty of light and high ceilings.  The service is very friendly and efficient.  Lots of Scottsdale pretty people dining here to observe as entertainment.  I ordered the shrimp dumplings to start.  Not only did they taste great but the presentation was beautiful with the dumplings and broccoli.  I also ordered the shaved turkey pita.  This was enormous and every bite was delicious.  I had a nice combination of squash and kale on the side.  I like this place a lot and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped in here Saturday night.  Don't like this location as much as Scottsdale but the food and service were solid.  My friend raved about his New Planet gluten free beer.  He said it was the best gf beer he's ever tasted."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years...one of the best healthy options in all of Scottsdale. From drinks to appetizers to entrees to dessert, everything is flavorful. The Avocado & Kale dip is a great starter. Eaten here dozens of times over the last 4-5 years and look forward to many more meals!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered  Minestrone   Soup And I was very disappointed to realize it's a can soup not made fresh. 2 stars for that. Sorry true food you can't fool me."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with healthy food, if you like healthy pizza this place make nice pizza.."}
{"text":"I was staying nearby for a work conference, but didn't check out this restaurant until my last day - if I had, I would have been here everyday! The food was so flavourful and deeeelish!  I had the spaghetti squash dish, which prompted me to buy some spaghetti squash to recreate at home.  The beverages were also so much fun and so refreshing.  Super busy for a Friday at lunch, so plan in advance! We got a seat at the bar, so it worked out for my lunch date and I."}
{"text":"If you are looking for healthy and fresh food, this is a great place. We got the inside out quinoa burger and the red chili shrimp. Both were really great. I loved the kale salad that came on the side of the inside out quinoa burger. I have no complaints about the food. I thought the food and especially the drinks were over priced. I paid 6 dollars for a small lemonade. Definitely go for just water if you go!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I can't be objective with this place since I harbor deep resentment for the loss of Coffee Plantation (the former tenant in this space).  So if you want an objective review, skip to another yelper.  As a Biltmore resident, the last thing I needed walking distance to my house was a new restaurant.  The Biltmore and Esplanade already had plenty of restaurants.  Coffee Plantation was a community hangout and the neighborhood just does not feel the same without it.  The blue grass jams on Sunday are no more, the college kids studying are gone, and no longer do I see my neighbors grabbing coffee in the morning.  Paradise Bakery is no substitute.  As for True Food itself, the food is inconsistent so order with care.  The tuna appetizer has been pushed on me more than once and I have always been very disappointed in the quality of the fish.  Call it what you like, it's just plain tuna sashimi floating in some kind of sauce.  Some items I do like are the Teriyaki Tofu and the Curry Chicken (substituting with Tofu), but I question their logic.  With the Curry you get noodles and with the Teriyaki, you get rice.  It seems like it should be the other way around for me, or at least give the option of rice with the curry.    I do like their juices but could do without the waiters giving you the canned speeches.  Try asking what Olivello juice is and you will get a scripted response about sea buckthorn berries.  Say what?  Olivello is a trademarked name apparently.  The sea buckthorn berry exists, but still you can't help but feel like a sucker for ordering something with so many names.  Have you ever seen a seabuckthorn berry?  Me neither.  Another yelper had to point me to a website describing the plant (thanks Chad H.).  Surprise surprise, it also doesn't taste all that great.  My advice, add the $3.00 shot of vodka and let your questions fade away to the back of your mind.  And while I do agree with many of the health ideas behind the menu in general, they could make it a little more subtle.  When people put forth their views so strongly you can't help but question their sincerity.  The food should not need trademarked names, a celebrity endorsement, or other affirmations of healthiness if it really does the good things they say.  The results should speak for themselves.    Overall though, I keep going back to this place and have not had any bad experiences.  Mostly it's just a great location, good atmosphere, and decent food that you can feel good about consuming.  It's also great for groups."}
{"text":"there with out of town visitors a few weeks ago. specialty drinks are good. The menu has gone through several changes...not always good changes. Appetizers always good. fair value for the price."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night, food was awesome, especially the onion tart we got for starters.  Drinks were good too, but I got a cranberry lemonade with vodka and it was kind of weak.   For my entree I had the Mediterranean salad and split a mushroom pizza, both of which were very good.  The only negative was the length of time to get our food.  We had a 7 year old boy with us and he was very hungry"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch with the girls! The place gets packed for lunch so there may be a wait (not one when we went) but it is definitely worthwhile. The cucumber refresher non-alcoholic drink was exactly that... refreshing! Visiting from New Jersey, I'm not used to this dry heat so it was an excellent start to a great meal. The salad with goat cheese and pistachios was amazing. I nearly licked my bowl afterwards since the vinegrette was so delicious! I added chicken to it and it was perfect. My girlfriends got the chicken chop salad and the Mediterranean salad and there were smiles all around the table so I would definitely recommend this place to the locals who haven't been there yet!"}
{"text":"Great food, but the portions are a bit small for the prices. I love the idea of eating locally and I realize it is a bit more costly to do things that way, but after a $60 dinner (2 drinks, 2 meals, 1 dessert), hubby and I shouldn't both still be hungry. The food we DID get was awesome- I had a chicken sausage pizza and hubby had some sort of seafood soup. The dessert was flourless chocolate cake and it was delicious, but $7 was a bit much for a round cake that was quite a bit smaller than your average cupcake and a golf-ball sized scoop of vanilla-caramel ice cream.  The service here was awesome and they happily accommodated our group of 18. It was pretty empty when we came in, but crowded by the time we left. The decor of fresh fruits and veggies, clean lines and Asian influences was great except that one of my friends ended up with a fruit fly in her drink."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS hopping. Even so their staff are super friendly, service  has always been great and the food is top notch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food & service!  Clean & relaxing atmosphere!  Food was fresh & amazing!"}
{"text":"Always try something new here. Had summer pizza and delicious crispy crust with cheese, asparagus and summer squash. I ate the WHOLE thing!!  True Food always has delicious food but my absolute favorite is the spaghetti squash casserole. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"True Foods is our goto place given all their great vegan and vegetarian choices. The Crudités is our goto starter as a giant bowl of fresh vegetables. The menu is nearly flawless. Run, don't walk, to True Foods!"}
{"text":"I am plant-based and my boyfriend is a meat-eater, but we can both agree that this is our FAVORITE place to eat in Scottsdale. Everything on the menu is just amazing. They pay extra spacial attention to people with allergies or diet restrictions - which I appreciate very much.   You really must try this one :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Food is fresh and prepared well. Wonderful flavor combinations for healthy eating. I also love that you serve Kombucha!  It's not common here in AZ.  Service has always been good here as well."}
{"text":"The best part of our experience was our amazing Server. She was super considerate of my daughters peanut allergy and even looked up the ingredients for the bison burger, including sauce to make sure it was something she could eat. Who knew bison might be an issue?! We started with the edamame dumplings. They were interesting. Daughter liked them but they weren't my favorite...pass. I ordered the Mediterranean chopped saled and it looked really awesome! Sadly, it tasted like dandelions. Seriously. I feel bad because I'm sure that's all healthy and wonderful and blah blah blah but it was just yucky. Yes, yucky is absolutely a technical culinary term. Anywho, not my thing, two thumbs down... It was super busy at lunch time and people obviously love it...just wasn't my thing. If you're looking for overpriced 'healthy' fare, check it out! I'll be at happy hour down the street ;)"}
{"text":"Everything I have ever had here has been delicious. If I could drink the Kale-Aid every day I would. Have them put some jalapeño in it to elevate it that extra bit... yum! Service is very responsive, bringing extra silverware, filling water glasses, splitting checks and validating parking tokens. The only down side is that the restaurant is very open and it can get a bit loud during peak hours."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen was definitely one of the best restaurants ever for me and my family!  The workers are so friendly and happy to help! They have a great amount of gluten free options for us and the organic all natural food makes it even better!  I personally love that the kitchen is open for everyone to see in the restaurant! Everyone needs to go to this location! The little plaza with the fountain is an amazing view!"}
{"text":"Used to be a great place for dinner. Last two times not so good. Ate there last night and it was poor from start to finish. Our waiter could get nothing right. It was as if we spoke a foreign language Some of our . My wife and our friend had sea bass which had absolutely no taste. My wife got her sea bass  almost 10 minutes after our friend did. I feel as if Fox Group, the owner of True Food has expanded to fast and have taken their eye off the ball."}
{"text":"Love love love their Mediterranean salad, with or without a side of salmon - absolutely delicious!   Service is always prompt and attentive.   One of my favorite places for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I love it. We come at a busy night but the staff still enough for us not to wait long. We are seated and given a couple of water. The waitress is really nice. Since it is my first time, my friend order foods for us. Yes, the idea of organic food kind of but me in a mood \"Healthy food - not taste good.\" But it amazing how the food taste. You can taste the texture and sweetness of the veges. I like the pizza the best. Taste different than normal pizza but still have the flavor in it. I definitely come back for this. (Already ask for few business card)"}
{"text":"We have been to TFK several times. Service was excellent, we had the same waitress a couple of times, she was very nice and prompt.  I like the restaurant design, it's clean and simple.   Now, the food. There are some hit and misses. The onion tart, kale salad, hummus and farro are delicious. The honey lemonade is great, but with no refills it can get expensive.  The chicken, curry plate, spaghetti squash casserole were....ehhhh. Like they forgot to put flavor in them. It tasted like, well, chicken, curry, spaghetti squash. The plate looks great and you expect this explosion of flavors in your mouth. Once you taste it is like a firecracker that fizzles, disappointing.   Also, we had our son with us and ordered his vegetables to be cooked soft and in none of our visits they manage to do it right.  They tried, but for some reason they couldn't?  I had dessert once, I think it was a banana chocolate tart. I know it had chocolate in it. It was good but nothing to write home about.  I guess I like to go to eat to TFK when we are out, it makes me feel healthy. Not satisfied but healthy nonetheless.  *3.5 stars*"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Lovely atmosphere.  Last time there, I ordered the curry bowl and it was not what I expected. I love curry but could not bring myself to eat their dish. I had to send it back and ended up going with my usual mushroom pizza, which is great.   A little pricey, with rather small portions.   All in all, they're worth visiting."}
{"text":"Quite a unique place.  Fresh and organic is the theme.  Young, hip, trendy,  and friendly flows everywhere.  Jessica our barkeep directed us to a fee dishes that were exactly what the theme of the restaurant is, fresh and tasty!  Of course, it is not just regular carrots in the crudités, but red and yellow so your eyes are just as pleased as your taste buds are.  The side sauces are a perfect compliment to the array of vegetables provided.  You will be asking for more as they take on a presence of their own.  The Edamame dumplings were delicious as well.  A light broth with just a hint of white truffle accompanies the pillowy soft dumplings.  A sprinkle of chopped scallions give it the pop of flavor that makes this dish sing.  Saw numerous 'organic' vodka drinks, but didn't try.  Maybe next time.....but it did make me ponder just what an 'organic' hangover would feel like?!?"}
{"text":"Thank you, TFK for existing! I wanted to try everything on the menu but it just wasn't possible tonight! This is a place I could go back to every day until I try the entire menu.  I was pleasantly surprised. The food is so fresh and the flavors are great, not too salty, not overseasoned, just right. We started with the thai shrimp dumplings- small portion.  I considered ordering another.  I had the teriyaki chicken bowl and loved it.  My husband had the chicken sausage pizza.  He loved it.  We were pretty content after the entree but I just had to taste their desserts.  The almond oilve oil cake was so delish.  Light, fluffy.  A great summer dessert.  Now if they would only post that recipe.  The portions are perfect, service is great, staff is friendly and the kitchen coordinator was on top of his s*@t!  See you tomorrow, TFK :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! We ate here twice in two days, and it was as good as I remember it from my last trips to AZ years ago at another True Food location. The sea bass we had the first day was pretty standard, but everything else we had was very delicious, including drinks/smoothies/appetizers. Our guests requested to eat here a second time so we came for brunch the next day and were equally satisfied."}
{"text":"Really fun ambiance and a great place to go with your vegetarian and vegan friends. Service was good and the sweet potato soup with with Moroccan spices was my favorite."}
{"text":"Love this spot even though it is a chain. Location and ambiance cannot be beat. Great food and lots of good drink options."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.. The only dish I truly enjoyed was the Avocado/Spinach dip and gluten free pitas. I think our waiter's pretentious attitude ruined the food, and atmosphere. When I asked Andrew about a dish, his response was in an I am much better than you because I am a vegan tone... \"I don't know, because I don't eat that.\" Is really not the response you are looking for, I usually am one to chuck it up to ok maybe he is having a bad day... But It was like everything about him was sour, which I think soured the experience. My friend ordered the spaghetti squash without cheese, and Andrew rolled his eyes... I would of thought he would of clapped, since it now would be vegan... He sulked away...  The food came, and My friends dish tasted of Lighter fluid, when we brought it to Andrew's attention... he just took it away, he was unapologetic, he did not state whether he would get a new one or offer her another option. We watched as he spoke with the manager and pointed at our table... The manager  however was very friendly, and apologetic. He brought the new dish out, which tasted and smelled great.  If only that could of saved the evening from Andrew's attitude. We did not see Andrew again,  another server brought us our check, and took it to process the cards. It was not until it was time to pick up our check, did Andrew Return..  I was over his pretensions hipster attitude at this point. It ruined my evening as well as my chance to enjoy a new place I had once look forward to trying..."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time AND it was for Valentines Day.  I was a little skeptical because I am not a vegetarian, don't really care for many gluten free foods, etc.  But, I will say this, no flavor was lost on ANY dish I tried, everything was amazing and my eyes were opened up to how awesome the food at this restaurant is.    We got the hummus for appetizer, roasted chicken entrée and steak taco entrée and the dessert trio to try things out (flowerless chocolate cake, Pomegranate yuzu sorbet and squash pie).    Hummus - I have never found a hummus I enjoy, this was had a little spice to it and was amazing.  Roasted chicken - the amount of flavor in this dish is amazing.  I am not a squash fan so I substituted in some broccoli, mixed with the faro, spinach and puree I downed the entire entrée and was in heaven.  Steak Tacos - My girlfriend is very picky, but gobbled up every bite of her tacos.    Dessert: Flowerless chocolate cake - amazing again, flowerless..? I don't even know what that means after eating this cake, every cake should be made this way. Sorbet - Amazing, sweet with a little tang very good. Squash Pie - very similar to pumpkin pie but better.  Very, very good dish.  Assistant General Manager Ryan and our server were both so good and meeting everybody's needs during a busy Valentine's Day evening.  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed. The server was kind and helpful. Explained a lot of the dishes and helped me choose. Had the medicine man drink. Really tasty!!! Then had the day's soup which had a nice tasting chicken fennel sausage. Followed it up with a half salad.  I noticed that colors and textures are a key to this restaurant. I had room for dessert so I had the strawberry rhubarb crisp and a well made latte. All in all, great flavors, textures, colors and service. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! The patio is perfect for winter because their heaters are the best! They really project the heat and work well. The soup of the day choice is always special and yummy! We always start with soup and the vegetable crudités. My boyfriend begs me to figure out the recipe for their olive tapenade... SO GOOD! I always get the inside out quinoa burger with half kale salad half sweet potato hash. Sides of ketchup and chili paste. You will not regret it!!! They also have an amazing wine selection if you enjoy a glass or two with dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to try out True Food Kitchen because #1 it was close to the hotel and #2 we had a veggie in the group.  They have a nice selection of wine by the glass and bottle.  Some off beat varietals, like malbec and monastrell.  Our waiter, Andrew was amazingly knowledgeable about wine for his mere 26 years!  I ordered a veggie salad with beets, turnip, and some other crunchy root vegetables.  It was supposed to have manchego cheese but I realized half way through that it was missing!  The salad was tasty otherwise - perfect for a lite dinner on an extremely hot evening.  The patio seating was lovely and the misters were a life saver!"}
{"text":"I loved my first True Foods experience. All of the food is local, seasonal and fresh! There are not many places to go these days that offers nothing but \"true foods\", so I will be a loyal patron. I had the Kale Tuscan Salad with Cucumber Honey Lemonade. The salad was perfect and large and the lemonade was out of this world. The staff was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Healthy food that tastes amazing.  All the wait staff have always been helpful in suggestions and quick service.    I will warn you that this place is quite busy throughout the week and even busier on weekends. Business lunches during the day and meet ups after work. So plan accordingly.  Highly recommend the Steak Tacos and the Honey lemonade."}
{"text":"Another great option for dining! This one far healthier than any of the others posted.  The Edamame dumplings are like nothing you have ever tried.  They put grapefruit in their guacamole, which is bizarre, but yum yum yum.   We had a variety of meals, from vegetarian to Moroccan, to a steak bowl, and all of us were quite satisfied & very full.  And caution, It does get a bit pricey when you start adding beverages or meat To the meals."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for vegan options. I've been on a real vegan kick lately to see how long I could stick with it, this place has made that a lot easier. The appetizers I've tried here, the guacamole and the squash toast, both amazing. The tea selection is awesome. I've had the sweet potato bowl here twice now, really really tasty. The vanilla dairy free ice cream will leave you wondering a. How did they get it to taste so good, b. Why haven't I tried dairy free ice cream before? A soy cappuccino with the vegan ice cream is stupid delicious. Trust me. The ambiance of this place is also nice with an earthy feel that is interesting considering the actual steel and glass landscape that awaits just outside."}
{"text":"Good for what it is.....organic healthy blah blah blah....my gf is a vegetarian  We ordered humus....twas amazing to her...I enjoyed it.   She had a turkey burger and it surprisingly tasted good.     I had a Bison Burger and it was...interesting.....good...different....  We both ordered a drink and they were fresh and flavorful.   For an app, 2 drinks, and 2 entrees it was over $60. For the interesting taste and the feeling of not being satisfied in your belly.....not worth it. Granted, some people who enjoy this kind of food will love it. Not hating, just not my kind of food choice =)"}
{"text":"On Saturday wanted to hear the scheduled band at the Quad so I made a rez for outdoors. We were seated at a perfect location. The waiter was adorable and charming. I later told him he reminded me of Ed Norton but cuter. Sadly though he didn't introduce himself.   We ordered and the food arrived pretty quickly. My sea bass was delicious with a light tasty sauce alongside wonderful mushrooms and green veggies. Great size and cacophony of flavors and textures. I will repeat this dish on my next visit. Hubby was happy with his steak tacos and my friend really enjoyed her salad cause she was humming as she ate.  Returned for lunch with a friend today and again the waitress was adorable but No name."}
{"text":"I've been to this TFK more times than I can count, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it until now.  (I have reviewed the Biltmore location).  I've been here alone, in small groups of 2-4, in larger groups of 5+, with and without my toddler.  I've never had a bad experience.  That says a lot.  The food is consistent, healthy, and delicious.  The service is attentive.  The atmosphere is lively.  The bathrooms are clean.  This has become a go-to place for us to meet friends that live in North Scottsdale as it's kind of half-way...  Standout items on the brunch menu in my opinion are the johnnycakes and the open faced egg white omelette.  I enjoy the \"bright eyes\" drink as well.  For lunch/dinner, you really can't go wrong but some of my faves are the vegetable crudite appetizer, the kale salad with salmon, the pan seared sea bass, teriyaki brown rice bowl.  You can't go wrong with their turkey burger either, and their pizzas are great for kids!  On the FRC website, they say that \"At True Food Kitchen, we want you to feel better, live longer, and make your mouth happy in the process.\"  I'd say they are making good on their mission - one meal at a time!  ****It's worth noting that the parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter is either in the big lot or valet unless you have really good parkma and score a spot on the street nearby."}
{"text":"Smoothies and Omelets and Johnny Cakes Oh My!  True Food Kitchen is by far one of my favorite spots in the Valley, and definitely my favorite Fox concept.  I was a huge fan before, but now with the addition of breakfast on the menu, I could eat at TFK for every meal and never get bored...   While I have my favorite menu items for each meal, I do mix it up now and again.  However,  do not - I repeat, do not go to TFK for breakfast unless you are going to get at least one order of the Quinoa Blueberry Johnny Cakes for the table.  Served with pure maple syrup and Greek yogurt, this dish is a godsend from heaven!    And while I'm here updating my original TFK review, I have to add that service is always fabulous.  Damon has a special place in my heart as he was my first ever server, and continues to be friendly and attentive when I get seated in his section, but I've had numerous other servers, and they've all been awesome.  I hope that the new Scottsdale Quarter location will be just as successful as this one.  Until next time, TFK - see you soon!"}
{"text":"Note: I've only been here once, but I'll update my review if/as I go more and further inform my opinion.  This place was perfectly enjoyable. The food and juice selections are on point and just what you would expect from an establishment branded as \"True Food Kitchen.\" A cautionary note to the juices would be that if you're ordering one that incorporates lemonade, you might ask them to go light on it if you want to avoid a lot of sugar. But I want to focus on what makes this place exceptional.  The floorplan of the restaurant is really lovely and engaging. You come in and you can see the cooks prepping for a lot of the dishes you read about on the menu. I've never seen anything like this before, and I really loved it. Secondly, this place is probably one of the best places to split a meal. I don't recall if there was a split plate charge, but it would be worth it regardless. My co-worker and I decided to split the Quinoa Burger and a salad, and we received separately plated mini-burgers with our portion of the sides, and our salad portions were served to us in our own bowls. Maybe I'm eating at the wrong places, but I felt like that was truly exceptional service. Lastly, the menu was really varied and had lots of options for vegetarian and gluten free fare.   tl;dr This restaurant trafficked in pretty standard \"heatlhy\" fare and did a fine job. What sets it apart is the experience provided by the friendly, knowledgeable staff and the overall setting, which is greatly enhanced by the integration of prep space into the floor plan of the dining area.  UPDATE: There is no split plate fee at True Food, as verified by the owner in the below comment. Further awesome, verified."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant that is special - there is no wall separating diners from the kitchen so you can view the food preparers & the food itself as it is being prepared. There are also a variety of seating options - inside, outside, small tables, long tables, by the far. My wife & I had the Kale & Avocado Dip, Onion Tart,  Steak Tacos (minus meat), Apple Goji Crisp, Hangover RX, Cold Matcha Horchat, Sparkling Tea & Jasmine Pearl. Unique food items. Good variety of vegetarian & vegan items. Good service."}
{"text":"True Food has very delicious food. True Food has some really healthy options. True Food has very delicious healthy options that just aren't worth the prices. There's a good chance you might leave True Food still hungry.  Still, totally worth checking out, if for no other reason to taste something that you can later make yourself at home! (And hey, maybe that's the point-- encourage healthier eating at home by showing visitors how delicious it can be!)"}
{"text":"Went for weekday lunch on a Friday and there was a small wait so we opted for the communal tables. Slight snafu when our waitress didn't realize our party was three and not the five that all sat down around the same time, and she started taking someone else's order with ours, but it was easily sorted out. The communal tables are a bit too wide across so you have to speak up to talk across them, but I'd sit there again.   Overall I was impressed with the look and feel of the place - there's a very \"natural\" vibe carried through the decor and open air/sunlight that enhances the food.   The food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent. To drink we all got the honey lemonade which was so simple but really excellent and comes with a free refill. I'd go back just for that! My companions enjoyed their open-faced salmon and the shaved turkey pita which each came with a side of mixed kale/sweet potato hash. I had the chicken panang curry which was tasty with fresh ingredients and well cooked, but I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of sauce to rice seems off and too soupy.   My companions had tried the salads on previous visits and thought they were much too small for the money. For the price, I thought we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  I'm all about eating healthy and organic and what not (I frequent Whole Foods multiple times a week).  But this place is for suckers.  I already gave up eating here long ago, because their food is severely overpriced and bland - not to mention the seriously small portions.  However, this afternoon, while doing some shopping in Scottsdale Quarter, I stopped by their semi-new Juice Bar (Juby True?) and ordered an iced green tea.  No big deal right?  I didn't even look at the menu, because I would assume that an Iced tea would be a negligible expense.  Well, to my surprise, after they had poured it and rang it up - it was just under FIVE DOLLARS!!!  For an Iced tea?!! Are you freaking kidding me?!  On what planet is it okay to charge $5 for an Iced tea?  Seriously!  And it wasn't even that good.  I definitely should have gone across the street to Starbucks, or down the road to AJ's, where I could have gotten 3 way better ones for the same price.  You people are scammers.  I feel like I should also add that I lived in Manhattan for 3 years (which is by far one of the most expensive places in the country), and I was never charged this much for an Iced tea while I lived there.  Maybe I'm just having a fit, but this place needs to get over themselves.  I honestly don't understand how they're still in business."}
{"text":"I am not convinced I've never reviewed True Food before. I'm convinced my review must have been lost in some update or something.  Oh, where to start? So, the bigger chains usually turn me off and this is a Fox Restaurant Concept although they've stepped up their game and have some pretty decent places these days. This is definitely one of them.   It is a bit pricey if you're like me and want one of everything, even though you know a simple meal will suffice especially when it's nutrient dense like the ones at True Food. Dr. Andrew Weil helped design the menu here with health and taste in mind. Some of the items are very simple making them delicious, like the turkey sandwich, with grapes (if my memory serves me correctly) and a half and half side of Tuscan kale salad and sweet potato hash. All very simple yet packed full of flavour and well, you just feel healthy afterwards.   The bison burger will keep any meat eater pleased and is a bit more complex, with an umami sauce and a medley of roasted mushrooms and caramelized onions. Even for those such as myself who aren't huge proponents of meat, I have no guilt in indulging in one of these burgers.  The crudités blew my mind the first time I ordered it and the hummus is a personal favorite of mine, I make the same recipe at home and have never had one that tastes better. Okay, maybe once but it was out of state, therefore, out of mind.   These days, I typically order whatever seasonal salad they may have and am always impressed at random goji berries or boysenberries that maybe paired with whatever seasonal vegetables at the time of my visit.  Though their dessert selection is rather minimal, I still love the matcha ice cream. Not to mention the beverages, both alcoholic and non. I personally like the spontaneous happiness drink if I am in the mood to drink and I do spontaneously feel happiness at those times. I also really enjoy their elixir, maybe they have more than one and I'm sure they're equally deserving of a mention but I've only had one.  I've tried a rice noodle mushroom dish that was divine as well.   The kiddo loved the crispness of the veggies in the kids teriyaki bowl which was surprising because she is rather picky and I believe it came with black rice.   I personally don't think one can go wrong at this place. I wasn't stoked on the tuna started we had last time but think it was just the sauce for me. The only other complaint I have is that there isn't one out by me in Gilbert yet, especially with all of the new development in the area.   Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"The food is good and healthy, but I just wish they were a bit nicer when seating people. They totally discriminate against people who what to go there by themselves for lunch and make you wait until the restaurant is virtually half empty before giving you a table.  No classy restaurant does this, if there is a table for two available, they will seat a party of one or two in order, but with these guys, I guess its all about maximizing profits. They'll seat you immediately if there is two of you but tell you there is a 30 to 45 minute wait if you're just one person.   For a place that typically costs $20 to $30 for a simple sandwich and a healthy drink, you would think they wouldn't act so cheap."}
{"text":"You have to give it FRC.  You're going to get a good meal at any of his restaurants, but True Food is one of the best.  I have dreams about the edamame dumplings, and have been known to have 3 orders as an entree-don't miss out on these.  Although I usually go salad, today I had the Tuna sliders with a small kale salad and of course, the dumplings.  The dumplings were great as usual.  The Tuna sliders didn't blow me away, but they were solid.  I'd like for them to have a little more of a spicy kick, but that's just me- they were still very good.  Also, don't forget their drinks-you'll love the selection.    Chow away!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by some friends, so we decided to try it on a whim one night.  The decor was very modern and earthy.  Our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu, and gave my husband the advice of trying to \"half portions\" of the asian dishes he was debating between.  Turns out the half portions are HUGE.  He took almost a whole one home.  The teriyaki was a little bit too salty for my taste, but I thought the curry dish was excellent.  I had the steak tacos adn I thought they were also very well done.  The men at the table next to us ordered some hot sauce to go along with theirs, and I think I'll do that next time too.  I'll definitely be coming back here, especially when my sister is in town because they have a variety of gluten free menu items."}
{"text":"Dean was a fabulous server! We started with the guacamole and butternut squash soup both were fabulous but I would highly recommend the soup since it is a more unique dish. Next we had the butternut squash pizza with vegan almond ricotta. Yum and thank goodness for this pizza it was delicious next we had the squash pie yum yum yum! Keep in mind this is all vegan and healthy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore True Foods Kitchen! We had the vegan chorizo burrito and a pizza( not the butternut squash pizza) both were filling and fantastic. The vegan chorizo burrito is a bunch item so if you want to try it you must go on the weekend.  The patio was amazing to sit on chat and eat. I parked in the covered parking on the other side of the mall to save it from the sun and heat. There is parking in front of the restaurant. Thank you True Foods Kitchen for offering vegan options"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of cooking. I also love places that sell fresh food. After days of hanging by the pool, I decided to get out and venture over to the Biltmore Fashion Park. I checked the photos and figured that the True Food Kitchen was the place for me.   I sat at the bar and had a little trouble figuring out what to eat, it all looked great but I was craving fish. I ordered the fish tacos and decided on the Skinny Margarita. It's called a skinny margarita because it's made with fresh juices and not because it's made with that low-calorie margarita mixer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#QnIja5A6SwqeJcFfPfZRqA  The margarita was refreshing and my tacos were great. Very light, freshly made and my server Jake brought me two different types of hot sauce. I like it spicy and appreciated it very much. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#kVbK8jNzkNTAeL2ReBCpMQ  The lunch was light and tasty, which was perfect and tasted like something I would make at home. It's very refreshing to find places that are not chain restaurants and serve fresh food you can watch them preparing. That's why I truly enjoyed the True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"Unfortunately their pen ang curry comes with a Shrimp broth which somehow cannot be substituted. Upon finding this out our entire party had to leave.  Please fibd a way to make vegetarian Asian food if only because Asian food can be vegetarian by its very nature. To zin burger and sol we went."}
{"text":"I came in craving a fresh and healthy drink and had a great experience. I ended up getting a simple kale salad and opted for a sparking tea. As my server and I were talking I mentioned I didn't like drinks that were too sweet. She noticed I wasn't drinking my tea and asked if it was too sweet... it was for me so she brought me a flight of different drinks based on my preferred flavors! AwEsOmE service! I ended up liking a drink i otherwise wouldn't have tried. I had a great time trying all the different drinks. :) Kombucha, cranberry pomegranate, ginger honey lemon (the natural)... the Kombucha and the natural were my favorites. The best part is that you could always customize the sweetness.. light or sans honey :)"}
{"text":"Very healthy and fresh food! I love going here and always leave happy and full. The have a great salad selection with a wide variety of proteins you can add."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience at True Food. The food was exceptional. The red curry shrimp...OMG to die for. It was my husband's birthday and I couldn't of been happier with  the service. Our waitress was so nice and so component at explaining the menu to us. The avocado and kale dip appetizer was superb. We couldn't  wait for dessert .... Of course they out did themselves with the chocolate flourless cake which was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to add a few healthy options to their palette."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for a light lunch and we both ordered salads. They were delicious and surprisingly filling! I ordered the seared ahi salad and it, along with the greens were so fresh and delicious.   This place is one of those restaurants for those into health kicks and pressed juices, which isn't really my scene but I did enjoy my salad and actually crave it sometimes! The prices are a bit higher but it's to be expected from this kind of place."}
{"text":"After nine years of lengthy visits and six months of living here, I have finally found the best food in Phoenix. It's HERE at True Foods, on Scottsdale.   I am so grateful to have savored the astonishing flavor medley of the steelhead plate yesterday, as well as -- quite simply -- the best hummus I have ever tasted. Smoked onion tabouli made with farro and red quinoa! Yellow beet arugula salad with cilantro pesto dressing! accompanied the fish.   The miso soup was outstanding, if rather non-traditional. (Mine is still better, however :)  The onion tart (got some takeout to keep the food-high going) was rather disappointing. And I confess I added squeezed lemon to the tabouli, because... lemon.   The prices weren't bad, considering the wealth of fresh raw ingredients that were cooked into or made into every bite, and the coffee kept coming. At tables all around me people were raving after a couple of bites, and we all kept exclaiming to the wait staff \"OMG what's in THAT!?  And my server was perfect. She was attentive, positive, informative, helpful and friendly. AND unabashedly in awe of the dedication and skills of the kitchen staff. Now that's not something you run into every day!  It is so extraordinary to witness a restaurant exceeding our expectations over and over again. Heartfelt foodie thanks, I will be back. Often. Actually, might as well put a plaque on a table with my name on it..."}
{"text":"It's true. The True Food Kitchen on Scottsdale is MUCH better than this one on Camelback. I had read that somewhere, should have paid attention. Good service Thursday night, as usual so far. But. The miso soup was barely warm and too salty to eat. I sent it back. The coffee was luke warm and bitter, the cream had clots from souring, and I was never offered a refill (just as well really).  Should have sent it back too. Bison burger was good, but the sweet potato hash cubes were all burned black on one side. *sigh. Truly disappointing after my awesome first meal at the other location. Won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fresh, healthy and delicious! Loved everything!!! The bowls are in incredible. So happy to have found a place like this!"}
{"text":"I'm giving TF 3 because of the consistently slow service at the Kierland location.  We had reservations so the wait for our table to clear was not long but while we wait, the young ladies  ask us 3 times if we need a table.  Please girls, communicate, share info.   Mimosas took forever, water was never refilled and food took 30 minutes to arrive.  I like eating at TF because of the delicious food but I always dread the lame service."}
{"text":"Long wait for lunch on a Saturday, place clearly very popular.  Best to eat here on a weekday and early, preferably start your lunch at 11:30.; However, we think it is always in high demand.  The interior decor has a cold industrial feel.  Acoustics are terrible so uninviting for conversation, a feel somewhat like Horn and Hardart in New York City way back when.  House water delicious and much appreciated.  $6 Haras Chardonnay a good price for the quality.   Had kale with salmon.  Both absolutely delicious, but salmon had bones in it.  No charge.  Turkey lasagna arrived too cold which they happily replaced.  Dr. Weil seems to have less concern for fat, even good fat than we do considering ample oil and grated cheese in kale and plentiful cheese in lasagna etc.; however, popular opinion on heart disease risk seems to be changing on this issue.  Lets take the salt off the table.   Service cheerful and prompt.  General  Manager Shane an absolute delight.  Normally we eat better at home than most restaurants, but this restaurant competes with high quality healthy home fare.  We live in Tucson, belong to a CSA and get supplemental produce from the Farmer's Market.  So wish we had TFK in Tucson."}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure what to expect during my first True Food experience. I had read the reviews and they made me a little wary of the service at this location. The menu also didn't sound that great to me.   I have to say that I pleasantly surprised with my overall experience. Our service was excellent and that's saying something since one of my dining partners is a bit picky and not afraid to speak his mind. He's not the easiest to please and even he seemed happy with his experience. I ordered the acai mojito to start and it was pretty decent for a mojito. My husband had one of their non alcoholic drinks (I think a lemonade of some kind) and thought it was okay, but nothing too thrilling.   I was really unsure of what food to try and kept changing my mind. When our server gave us his suggestions I thought it was pretty entertaining that he chose the sea bass and the salmon...the two most expensive items on the menu. Uhhh...no thanks. I decided to go for organic tomato and roasted kale pizza. Luckily, our server informed me right away that it didn't have cheese on it. Shouldn't it say that on the menu? I'll pass on a pizza without cheese...isn't that the whole point anyway? I decided to go with the ricotta cheese ravioli (another expensive menu item). My fellow diners ordered the miso soup (he sent it back because it wasn't hot enough...but keep in mind he's not the easiest to please), the turkey bolognese, and the teriyaki brown rice bowl with tofu. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food.   So I know what you're wondering...why the three stars if you had good service and good food? After eating my meal, I really felt like I had been a little jipped. I received a very small amount of ravioli in my dish and I am not a big eater. I know they're using a high quality of food and that comes at a higher price, but the price just didn't match the meal. I've been to plenty of restaurants around town that use fresh, local ingredients and their prices just aren't as steep. Even though the food was tasty, the service was great, and the decor was lovely, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great ambience, always friendly staff and above all I get pretty consistent vegan options. They even have at least 2 to 3 different vegan desserts on the menu at all times which are really tasty. I love their vegan pizza and caramelized cauliflower.  Only negative is the high pricing, it's gets too expensive when you order a beverage, appetizer and an entree."}
{"text":"Ran into this restaurant for a grab and go juice! I bought the little miss sunshine & it was just what I needed! I will definitely be back for more juice & the food as well!!!"}
{"text":"JACOB WAS AMAZING!!! And he needs to know that he made our experience here a 10/10! He was so engaging, knew the menu, was knowledgable about your brand and expressed his desire to move up in the company. It truly is a treat with you are served by an individual who genuinely loves their job the way we could tell Jacob does.   This was the last stop to our little 'restaurant crawl' in Kierland Commons, and I'm glad we stopped in. My night cap was a Thai Grapefruit martini. I loved how fresh it tasted, and the basil garnish was a beautiful touch. We snacked on an order of charred cauliflower. Again, this was delicious! On my next visit, I'll definitely come in on an empty stomach so I can try one of their mouthwatering menu items. And I'll definitely be asking for Jacob!"}
{"text":"Come during off-peak hours! Great for vegetarians!  I've had mixed experiences at True Foods, which is why it was downgraded from a 4 to a 3.  We came for Sunday brunch a couple of times - the food was great and the environment was nice.  We had dinner one Saturday night around 8 or 9 - the service was horrible and the food wasn't cooked well.  As in, the fish was completely dry and we were very disappointed in the experience.  We just went back yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner (4pm).  We were immediately seated.  We requested outdoor seating, which I immediately regretted when I realized it was still HOT in the shade even.    As an appetizer, we had the vegetable crudites - I highly recommend this appetizer.  You can get the small or large.  The small feeds two pretty perfectly.  It comes with a house-made ranch and a house-made kalamata olive dip.  Both are great!  As main courses, my boyfriend had the brown rice/tofu bowl and I had the TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato).  His was okay - had a bit too much orange flavor for our liking.  The tofu was very chewy and seemed fried, even though our waitress assured us before ordering that it wasn't.  The TLT was good - lots of tempeh.  It appeared to be store bought (like fakin bacon), but may have been house made.  The sandwich had lots of avocado, tempeh and tomato.  It also came with a side order - half kale salad and half sweet potato hash.  Both sides were okay.  The sweet potatoes were under seasoned.  The kale salad tasted a lot like coconut oil, which they must use as their rub.  I mixed the two together.  Overall, the food was good.  If I was feeling less lazy (which I obviously wasn't when I was going out to eat), I could make it all at home, but the meal was quick and easy and so I give my kudos to True Foods for redeeming themselves.  Maybe we'll be back."}
{"text":"Same as my review of their Biltmore location (yum). Last weekend I went for brunch after yoga on the fountains. I ordered the egg & sweet potato hash which was a ton of food. I also ordered the kale smoothie which wasn't fabulous, but healthy, which was what I was going for."}
{"text":"Three words: Chicken Chopped Salad.  I could eat this salad everyday for the rest of my life. Absolutely delicious. The turkey burger is also just as great.  I can't wait to come back & try more dishes as well as the juices!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype. Our server was nice, but the meal for 3 took over 30 minutes to come out and our side was cold. The turkey burger was bland. We paid $80 with tip for 3 people (no alcohol or dessert) and I'm still hungry. Will not return."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   True Food Kitchen is one of the greatest success stories in the history of the food and restaurant industry.  TRUE FOOD KITCHEN: THE HISTORY   The history of True Food Kitchen started in Tucson in the late 1990's, when Dr. Andrew Weil met with Phoenix restaurateur Sam Fox. Dr. Weil was adamant about making restaurants available that not only adhered to his anti-inflammatory diet, but would demonstrate how delicious healthy food can be, as well as having an environmental awareness, all in an inviting atmosphere.  Dr. Weil's anti-inflammatory diet is not a \"diet\" per se, but is based on the staggering evidence that chronic inflammation is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including heart disease, many cancers and Alzheimer's disease. This is also the concept behind anti-aging medicine.  If you are unfamiliar with this concept, definitely check out drweil.com for more information, and for the anti-inflammatory diet specifically:  http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02012/anti-inflammatory-diet   True Food is currently in 9 states: AZ, CA, CO, GA, IL, NY, TN, TX, VA  There are two locations in Phoenix: Biltmore  Kierland Commons  Although there are now many locations, True Food Kitchen has a commitment to the community and will never become a \"chain\" type restaurant.   THE MENU  The menu is a work of art. Dishes are influenced by Mediterranean, Asian, and Californian cuisine, and include breakfast, soups, appetizers, salads, pastas, rice and noodle dishes, wood grilled dishes, sandwiches, burgers, brick oven pizzas and desserts.  CONCLUSION   I recently ate at the Biltmore location for brunch. I had the huevos rancheros with fresh corn tortillas and bottomless mimosas. The food was scrumptious and the staff was delightful. (see pic)  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *True Food Kitchen always uses local, organic sources when possible.  *True Food Kitchen is also decidedly \"green\" with many environmentally friendly accoutrements.   *Hours: Mon - Thurs: 11am - 9pm Fri: 11am - 10pm Sat: 10am - 10pm Sun: 10am - 9pm  *Valet parking is available.

{"text":"Started off frustrated but ended up happy.  Friends visiting the area requested to try True Food Kitchen, so I called earlier in the day to make a reservation. I was told they don't reserve tables for parties of less than 8 (there were 4 of us). So I asked how long it would take to be seated if we arrived around 7.30pm that evening. I was told likely straight away, or within 15 minutes for sure. We set out on the 30 min drive and arrived to be told there would be a 35 min wait for an inside table or 45 mins for outside... though if an area at the (busy) bar opened up we could get drinks and appetizers there and wait. The restaurant didn't seem slammed (several empty tables) so it seemed odd there was such a long wait.  We decided to wait for outside, and a little miffed went for a short stroll.  One of our party saw a spot at the bar opening up and we jumped on it, and enjoyed some fantastic cocktails (I had Spontaneous Happiness, it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had). Our buzzer actually rang in something closer to 15 minutes and we were seated outside. I know it's not an exact science, but normally being told a 45 min wait with no bar to wait at (after being told we would be seated immediately/in 15 mins) would have made me eat elsewhere - we only waited since our guests were visiting and so couldn't have returned another time. The menu had lots of delicious looking foods to choose from. I started with the hummous (wonderfully spicy/garlicy) and had the amazing butternut squash pizza for my main and a really light, delicate lemon sorbet for dessert. Service was excellent from all parties - 2 waitresses plus the bartended. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, lots of wood, metal and greenery and very open. It was still a cool evening and perfect to sit outside, though the waitress said they have misters in the summer. I also had a fish taco and it was very good.  My husband had the bison burger and wasn't a huge fan, though that may have been more down to the gamey-ness of the meat. He enjoyed the sweet potato hash side.  I would definitely return to try out next seasons menu. It's pricey, but the food, service and location are excellent."}
{"text":"Love love love the new spring menu! The Asparagus Toast is to die for!! Very sad to hear this chain is no longer a part of FRC. I had an FRC gift card, and hadn't heard about the switch so they couldn't accept it. But I will continue to come back and hope great things come for the restaurant in the future! Also tried the Sparkling Honeydew this last visit and I really liked it, it wasn't what I was expecting but definitely worth trying if you are in the mood for a fun drink! Side note: I don't usually come to this location, just because I prefer the atmosphere of the one in Scottsdale Quarter. However I have experienced better service at this location."}
{"text":"You have to appreciate the restaurants that serve healthy but delicious food and True Food Kitchen is one of those places. I've been coming here for years and I intend to keep coming here for years to come. With a wide variety of fresh food options, eating healthy is made easier than ever. They change their menu seasonally which is a plus because there is always new things to try! One of my favorite things on the menu is the the Tofu Lettuce Wraps. They are so yummy and filling but still light! I also enjoy all of their pizzas so that's an option for anyone who strays away from veggies! I always get the Kale Ade to drink it is so refreshing and the perfect accompaniment to any meal!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before or even heard of it but I decided to dive in. The food is delicious and the service is better than that! My server, Brandon, made sure my glass was never empty and they serve you fast. The vegan artichoke pizza is a nest have and the kale guac is so flavorful I crave it often now."}
{"text":"My favourite dinner in the last week. Lovely atmosphere. Enjoyed sitting outside finally! I had the edamame dumplings followed by grass fed steak tacos. Simply delicious.no good meal could be complete without dessert. The flourless chocolate cake stole the show!  The waitress had wonderful humour. And we were even treated to a second flourless chocolate cake as I had left my parking jeton in the car and joked I would burn off the calories walking to the car and back! Great great place and service"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places. Every Time I am back in Scottsdale I have to go visit, despite there is one not too far from me in Santa Monica. Not only is the location in a prime spot the food is always on point. No matter the time of day there is always a wait for this heavenly array of super foods. Truly encompassing an anti-inflammatory diet, the menu is filled with flavorful choices. Unfortunately, due to my current diet restrictions my limitations hindered me from anything that I would have loved to indulge in, however my group sure did enjoy the steelhead salmon and spicy shrimp dish. For me on the other hand they were extremely accommodating. Which is always a battle when you are traveling. I would love to see more vegetarian options in the future. Other than that the service was stellar and the food well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Well.... only the 11th review???? Even though this is a new place I'm a little shocked!  I'm always the last one to hear about the new \"cool\" places and I guess I got a jump start on this one!  True Food is soooo NYC chic to me and the food is great - and healthy!  Our entire sales staff went and we're a picky bunch.  Some how we all found something we enjoyed!  I have the steak tacos which were awesome!  I also had the Green Arnie, which carries a much prettier name than taste.  I was expecting green tea and lemonade, but I got it with a grainy mix I wasn't too fond of!  I would totally give thsi place 5 stars, but I'm a drinking gal and all they had was wine and organic vodka. ehhh..... I enjoy eating healthy, but organic vodka doesn't cut it for me.  But to each his or her own....."}
{"text":"Well, let's say that I love it. I mean, I am being patient while they work the kinks out, but for a chain (or shall I say potential chain) I think it is a fresh change in the sea of steak houses and Asian fusion joints.  The decor is fresh and sunny although the hard surfaces lend to poor acoustics. You may have to scream at you dinner date on a busy night. The staff is young and ridiculously healthy looking. I can't help but wonder if a pre-employment requirement is a complete body loofah scrubbing and two weeks of colon cleansing. Even some of the older management and staff appear to have just had micro-dermabrasion.  But hey, in at new take on a health food joint, maybe it's just good marketing. The staff is the problem however. They all seem so young that they have no experiance. They are kind of wondering aroung while your food is stuck who knows where. On my last visit a nice young man named Steve was my server and he was beyound good. I complimented management on him and will ask for him from now on. To the food. I am a very healthy eater so it is right up my allie. I can't get enough of the kale salad. I ask for it with chicken. The Miso soup is simple but full of flavor. The deserts are good as well. You don't have to take home you heavy guilt with your full tummy. I have had all of the salads and you just can't go wrong, perfectly dressed to show of the perfectly ripened seasonal veggies.  The wine list is interesting and fairly priced, chalked full of sustainable and organically produced wines that also taste great. You can even have organic vodka with you veggie refresher drinks. Who knew? Look, if fast food is your bag and you are looking to commit suicide via coronary disease... skip this place. If you are looking to experience truly healthy eating in a modern new spot, take your patience and give this a try."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am underwhelmed.    First - the good.  I went with a group of 7 and we were able to sit in the private room in the back.  It was great to have the noise of the restaurant shut out and we loved the room's decor.  Second - the bad.  OK, it wasn't that anything was bad, it was all just sort of fine.  It tasted like dinner you would have at someone's house.  It was all more than edible, some things very different, but a little blander or a little less fantastic than i expect from a restaurant.  The chopped salad and onion tart with figs were both good, but anyone can do a chopped salad.  I thought the shrimp dumplings were just OK and the kale salad was underdressed and basically just tasted like you were eating raw kale.  The butternut squash ravioli were too sweet and the sauce was a little flavorless.  For desert, the chocolate cake was good but I've had better and while the bananas on the banana chocolate tart were good, the tart itself was like a stale piece of pita.  One highlight was the beans that came with the steak tacos - they were very flavorful and tasty.  My final thought is that to serve good, honest, healthy, sustainable food doesn't mean you have to be quite so crunchy.  I think some in our party were turned off by the granola-feel of the menu.  It would be great to see a few more common dishes done in a healthy way and prove that healthy doesn't have to mean low-flavor."}
{"text":"I forgot to update the review. After posting how I got sick from the food, I was called by a manager. His first concern was if I was feeling better. I was invited back, and was told to personally ask for him so he could ensure that my next visit was nothing less than perfect.   I do think the food is overpriced, and I didn't like that I had to pay for extra quinoa to have enough in my yellow curry, but anyone who reaches out like they did gets 4 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Excellent concept and excellent tasting food. On the pricier side, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely blown away by the amazing customer service here! Scott is an amazing manager and this business truly has a business model that all businesses should take after!  I've eaten many different food items from here and have loved each bite! Excellent, healthy ingredients and excellent cooks!"}
{"text":"I love the one at the Biltmore location so I expect the same there.  Loved the macha green tea lemonade...  SO refreshing!  For food I got the:  EDAMAME DUMPLINGS:  Daikon Radish & White Truffle Oil - I am a super fan of this.   HOUSE-MADE CHICKEN SAUSAGE PIZZA:  Tomato, Fennel & Fontina - My favie of the pizzas  Sat on the patio and love the atmosphere.  The staff was super friendly and very tentative."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several time and I still love it!  Lots of healthly selections and just love the atmosphere in the outdoor and indoor seating.  My favies:  the matcha lemonade (it is off the menu, but they can still make it for you), edamame dumplings, herb hummus, house-made chicken sausage pizza, flourless chocolate cake, and ice creams.  The service is always on par and quick.  Also nice and relaxing here.  This is one of my go to places!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food was amazing. Had the spaghetti squash with chicken. It was a pretty big portion and had tons of flavor. The manager came to make sure everything was okay and our waiter was on it with recommendations. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I had the shaved turkey pita and it was delicious. Our waiter was nice, we got our food relatively quickly and I liked the high celings and simple, but sophisticated decor."}
{"text":"Still one of my absolute favorites for clean healthy eating. I love the assortment of different veggies that I always get.  #eattherainbow"}
{"text":"Creative menu, price was right, service was prompt and polite. What more could you ask?"}
{"text":"True Food Biltmore what has happened to you?   Let's start with the super unfriendly, uncaring hostess who doesn't smile or wishes one a pleasant meal.  Then the waiter Adam who after taking the order is missing through out the dinner only to pop up at the end with the check. Never came back to ask if we needed change or a thank you or a goodbye even though he was standing 3 feet from us.   What a disappointment. This place has really gone down hill.  We use to frequent it often but haven't been in almost a year. We were overdue for a visit.  Won't find any of the regular folks who use to work there. It seems like a Temp Agency has taken over staffing and its just a bunch of temps running it. Just a real disappointment. Plus the food simply isn't up to par anymore. And what's with the \"spring menu\"??... it's almost August!    Treated our friends to a birthday dinner and now wish we had gone elsewhere. We feel awful. We stopped going to the Scottsdale location a couple of years ago. We are now done with the Biltmore location and probably done with them period.  Ps - Wish we had read all the current bad reviews"}
{"text":"Arrived 9:30 on a Sat. nite no wait plenty of tables but was seated far from the kitchen and staff. Took a bit for server to make initial contact. Placed order....appetizer, salad, entree.   Appetizer arrived quick and was tasty. Entree came out next before salad.  What amazed us was how super hot the plate and entree was radiating quite amount of heat.   Could not touch entree till salad came out 10 mins later.    The entree...spaghetti squash....simply awful.  It lacked any flavor or nutritional vibe. The sauce was watery with zero taste.  We consumed it due to hunger. We ordered their market salad but what arrived was an overly green leafy very lemony mayo type tasting dressing smothered on top. There were no blueberries, avocado, goat cheese, etc. but still told by staff and by the primary server it was the market salad.  They offered a Mediterranean salad as replacement and we consumed it.  Due to the lack of a satisfied stomach we shared a very tasty lemon tart.  Service lacked any genuine hospitality.   Atmosphere could be pretty amazing if a change in personality took place. Did play cool music.   Did not get out till 11pm.  The bill was $48 bucks we left three 20's didn't wait for change and ran!"}
{"text":"I love True Foods!  Whether we are having an appetizer with drinks or enjoying a meal, the experience is always wonderful.  The organic tomato and kale pizza is SO yummy!  I love to sit on the patio next to the fountains on a nice night."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I leave happy . Excellent food , and lighting fast service !   Miso soup is delish and you can also order half salads If you have a small appetite."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! Everyone smiles at you with consideration and a desire to please. I was her for lunch and had the street tacos with Seabass, plus a green drink and some veggies. Everything was quite delightful and we had the choice of outside seating which was right next to the splash pad!! The atmosphere at this place is my style, very modern and simplistic with lots of shady trees and comfy chairs. Just an overall awesome place and experience. If you love healthy food then this is the place for you, complete with their own outdoor garden!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know about Dr. Weil before coming here and can't validate the anti-inflammatory claims based on what I was served all I know is that it was hella delicious. It tasted healthy and fresh. Our visit was during restaurant week. I had the shiitake tofu cup for starters and that was the best and my friend had the grilled avocado which was also yummy. I think the best part of the meal was the whipped coconut cream that come with the chia seed dessert..... WOW, completely mind blown. I asked if they sold it in cans or something! that was delicious. Service was excellent and I would definitely recommend to friends. I left with a happy full belly!"}
{"text":"Have only been here once. Was a Saturday and busy. We (two and a baby) got seating within about ten minutes. Our waitress was super nice and informative. We got almond and date smoothies, the inside-out quinoa burger, and the ancient grains bowl. All of it was super delicious and much more food than we were expecting. We shared so they split the dishes up for us. A little pricey, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My aunt is trying this new organic, wholistic living thing, so I wasn't all too surprised when she suggested that my family meet her and my uncle at True Food. There were some highs and some lows...  Let's start with the drinks. I looked at their fresh drink menu and had an impossibly difficult time deciding. I ended up with the Medicine Man, because an antioxidant blast sounded like the perfect remedy for several days of imbibing over the holidays. Other people at the table ordered the Apple Carrot Ginger Tonic and the Red Moon, and everyone raved about them - definitiely a high. I would go back just for the drinks. The meal (lunch) was good, but different. Not different in a bad way, just in a way that means \"I am willing to try new things but sometimes I have ideas about how things should be.\" So I just surprised with the texture of my Mediterranean Chopped salad, mostly because of the quinoa. It was tasty, just took some getting used to - another high.  Unfortunately, the low was that all six of us were pretty uncomfortable throughout the whole meal because we were seated close to one of the sides, right by the door where the waiters and waitresses would enter and exit to take care of the customers outside. Sometimes they would stop and close the door, but most of the time it stayed propped open just long enough to let a chilly blast of air wash over our table. The design of the restaurant isn't particularly easy to understand, specifically because you have to go outside to go to the bathroom and also because it isn't easy to tell where the hostess station is, especially if you come in from the opposite side (by LuLuLemon).  Despite the negatives, I'd go back...I'd probably just make sure it was on a sunny, warm day!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here regularly. I usually get the Kale Crunch salad but I arrived today and it's off the menu. Bring it back!!  Other favorites are the hummus, edamame dumplings, spaghetti squash casserole, turkey burger and bison burger. But, I have to say that everything I've had here has been exceptional. Nice wine selection, too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Love, love the dumplings, Asian bowls, salads, pizza, and desserts! Very fresh and healthy. Kind of pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for awhile now and today I finally decided to check it out - I'm glad I did! I was craving a burger but I didn't want fast food and I didn't want to cook anything myself so I placed a take-out order for their grass-fed beef burger with a side of kale salad. The burger was amazing! Definitely one of the best I've had, especially considering the wholesome ingredients. My only complaint would be that it was a little overdone - I asked for it medium-rare and it was definitely medium-well (overcooked burgers are a pet peeve of mine). The kale salad was tasty as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Four of us stopped here for a late lunch on 3/19. We were all starving and our first choice, Zinburger in the same shopping mall, was closed for some reason. For a second choice, True Food was pretty good.   It's like all the Fox Restaurants I've been to - open kitchen concept, young staff, loud music with a modern-industrial feel. The first thing the waiter told us while handing us menus was that one of the restaurant co-owners is Dr. Andrew Weil. He went on to explain how healthy and organic their menu selections are. Apparently this is their standard opening line to every customer since I heard it mentioned to other diners around us.   My daughter and I had the raw fish special which was served sliced sashimi-style topped with a sesame-miso sauce alongside thinly shredded carrots and cukes. It was very good with an appetizing presentation. I had the wild ahi sliders. The waiter warns that it's cooked raw. It came with sweet potato hash. The sliders were delicious, slightly warm and very flavorful. The sweet potato hash was tough and cold and had probably been sitting around for too long.   The shrimp dumplings appetizer (you get 6) were also very tasty as was the chicken pizza that our guests had. Hubby decided to go vegetarian and had the Miso Soup and Vegetable Caeser Salad, both of which were filling enough for him.   They also have specialty drinks that weren't really worth the cost. Hubby's Cucumber Refresher was pretty tasteless and my Green Arnie was weak.   The atmosphere was loud and energetic. The kitchen is right there and they don't care if they're banging pots, pans and dishes everywhere. We were there at the end of the busy lunch hour when the restaurant had emptied out and it was still pretty loud.   Service was quick. Our food arrived within 15 minutes of ordering them and they all arrived at the same time. Our waiter was helpful and friendly and he did check on us a couple of times but took care not to hover. It's a good place to eat if you want \"healthy\" choices and don't want to think too hard about it. I don't know that I'd come back here again, especially if Zinburber was open!"}
{"text":"Will you like True Food? Well, it's great for people who are looking for \"clean eating\", whatever the hell that means to you. That is, it's great for posers who don't really want to do the work to eat well or stay fit, but want to feel better about eating out or eating junk at home (loading up on sweet potato chips, antibiotic-free fried chicken and frozen greek yogurt).   Ultimately, True Food is wildly overpriced and not very good. I've joined friends here for lunches and dinners, not by choice. I've had the pizza (hurray for me, it's \"veggie\"), entree salads (hurray for me, I'm eating salad), tacos (hurray for me, it has organic beef) and rice bowls (hurray for me, nothing's fried). I've yet to have a good dish here that was filling and/or worth even 1/2 what they charge. Best thing on the menu is the hummus appetizer, and there are dozens of places in town who do it better.  If you want to eat healthy, prepare yourself healthy and great tasting food at home. If you want low-cal food that tastes great, walk over to Seasons 52. If you want food that tastes great and don't care about \"appearing\" healthy, there are a million places in Phoenix/Scottsdale I recommend -- read my reviews if you care to."}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed. Arrived here yesterday with a friend at about 4:15pm. Seated promptly. An over bubbly petite girl approached our table.. (you know the kind.. TGI Fridays \"flare\" type) speaking in cheerleading tones, we'll call her \"bubbles\" letting us know our server would be with us in a minute.. right as our server arrived.  There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours in all areas of the restaurant and Ill be damned if our poor server wasnt waiting on every single one of them.. which explains why she wasnt very attentive. Not really her fault..Our food did arrive in a timely fashion delivered by \"Bubbles\". My friend had ordered the squash casserole and had asked if bread was available for her to order and the attitude and outright snottiness of bubbles next comment decided the gratuity and the fact we will never go back. She said \" we dont have bread.. this isnt the Outback.\" You should have seen the looks on our faces.  She then catches herself and says we have pita and my friend staes \"nevermind, that's not what I was looking for\". Bubbles goes away and comes back with an order of pita anyway. We sat in silence for a good 5 minutes.. apalled at that little bitch's outburst. As a manager I would have fired her on the spot for speaking to a patron in that manner.   After the \"incident\" and our meal was finished, the plates were cleared and we sat...and sat while our server tended to the rest of her tables. Meanwhile there are 5 servers doing sidework right in front of us.. including Bubbles (who mind you was leaning over the sidework table laughing and not helping her coworkers at all). We made eye contact with several of them hoping they would notice we were looking for our server and nothing. We had actually wanted dessert but by the time our server finally showed we just wanted to leave. Im sure our server would have been great had she had any form of assistance from her coworkers. But the snottiness of the self righteous self entitled Bubbles was inexcusable.  Im sure you're wondering about the food.. it's decent but not anything amazing..too many restaurants in Phoenix to come back here for their food, let alone to be talked down to by the staff.  Oh and also, we were told their tomatoes are flown in from tuscany.. Seriously? In this economy you're flying tomatoes in from Italy and not supporting your local markets..FAIL"}
{"text":"I have to admit it, I'm a huge fan of True Food Kitchen and Dr. Weil! I have all the cookbooks and have been going to True Food Kitchen for years now.   True Food Kitchen is exactly how I wish all restaurants were - tasty, fresh, and healthy. It's easy to get a meal out with lots of empty calories, that have little to do with eating to live! Although I am not a true vegetarian or vegan, I do enjoy vegan and vegetarian meals and good ones can be pretty tough to find here in Arizona.   This was actually my first time visiting the Scottsdale location, I usually go to the one on Camelback in Phoenix. I had actually been very hesitant to visit this one, because I didn't want to \"fix what wasn't broken\". I am incredibly happy I decided to check out the Scottsdale location because it is equally nice, but in different ways. The location and ambiance was gorgeous and seating very nice out on the patio.  My date and I shared several plates, because it's a lot more fun being able to try many things off the menu. We started with a Torched Avocado, which was better than it sounded! The cucumber noodles were perfect, and the mushrooms gave the dish a strong mushroom essence. If you do not like mushrooms, this might not be the dish for you - but thankfully I do.   The Chioggia Beet Bruschetta was delicious; however I would have loved to have seen it on something other than a sliced bread. The bread reminded me of Ezekiel sprouted bread, which I have nothing against, I just would have expected something more special during a restaurant experience. The flavors were perfect and the vegan ricotta was every bit as good as the dairy version (coming from someone who loves cheese).   We shared a Roasted Artichoke Pizza which was delicious, though I found the other flavors overpowered the Artichoke (unfortunate due to the name). The pizza used the delicious dairy free almond ricotta, sugar snap peas, smoked onion, garlic, black truffles, and apparently artichokes!   I had the Health-Ade Kombucha with pomegranate and cranberry - which was to die for. I've been on the fence with Kombucha wanting to love it for it's health benefits, but never fully accepting it. True Food Kitchen has finally found the perfect mix to make Kombucha absolutely delicious. I've started buying the Health-Ade Kombucha for home, which can be found at Trader Joe's, Sprouts or Whole Foods (Whole Foods also carries the huge jugs!).   Dessert was delicious - I ordered the Key Lime Pie which was the best I've had in years. Only slightly creamy and incredibly rich and tangy! I hope the pie is on the menu next time I visit. I did get to sample the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which is every chocolate lovers dream! I still enjoyed the pie the best, but I think I'm biased."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite True Food Kitchen location and I've been to it several times - each time nearly as awesome as the one that came before it.   I love to visit True Food Kitchen on a seasonal basis to try something new each season. I wasn't planning on visiting True Food Kitchen, until they twisted my arm with an offer I couldn't resist.. their Trick or Treat Yourself promotion. Seriously, the best thing I've received for Halloween since I was a kid and dressed up going door to door! I strongly recommend signing up for their e-mails so you don't miss out on future treats.  We sat outside which was lovely, but a little chillier than I had anticipated, which unfortunately impeded my ability to order their Sea Buckthorn Sorbet (though our waitress was kind enough to provide us with a mini taste and its amazing.. but I'm going to have to come back during the day for this one).   For beverages, my husband got the Prosecco, and I ordered the Medicine Man. If you like cranberry juice, this one will be a hit, the pomegranate seeds are a nice touch, but sometimes get lodged in the straw.   We shared the Kale Guacamole and I've had my fill of guacamole of every variety and variant, but this one was new with the pink grapefruit, cilantro, roasted poblano, sunflower seeds and of course kale. Wow! This is a keeper and I would definitely order it again, even my husband who hates grapefruit and kale was incredibly surprised how delicious it was. There is tons of guacamole to share, the lavash crackers it is served with is delicious, but you will probably need to ask for extra.   We then were tied on what pizza to order, our waitress recommended we order half and half. Great suggestion, but one teensy complaint.. they charge you for the most expensive pizza and our waitress unfortunately did not communicate this. We ordered the Butternut Squash pizza $15 with their absolutely delicious vegan almond ricotta and the classic Margherita $12. I would love to see True Food Kitchen either average the amount to $13 or go with the lowest, or even just tell the customer up front how it will be billed!   We shared the T.L.T. sandwich.. which I was very apprehensive about, but curious. Our waitress reminded us that if there was something we didn't like, they would be happy to replace it with something else. I've never had a good relationship with tempeh, in fact I've gone over a decade avoiding it because my experience has never been great. I kept hearing people rave about the T.L.T. and came to two conclusions: 1) everyone has lost their mind 2) True Food Kitchen actually knows the secret to making tempeh taste great.   I decided to live dangerously and pulled out a piece of the tempeh bacon from the sandwich when it arrived. It wasn't quite bacon, but it was still delicious - it was almost like a smoked piece of chicken breast? So there it was, the correct conclusion was 2) True Food Kitchen actually knows the secret to making tempeh taste great. I am happy to announce I would even order the T.L.T. again, it's healthy, nutritious, and best of all vegan - the portion size is great!   I ended up ordering a tried and true favorite for dessert, the Squash Pie, which did not disappoint. You will not believe it's vegan AND gluten free. Yum! Certainly enough for two to share!   Overall service was good, my waitress Danielle was great with a fantastic attitude. My only other critique regarding service was it started up exceptionally well timed and fantastic, and became very slow as more tables were added to her responsibility.   Everything was running smoothly, we sat down around 5:40pm, we breezed through beverages, appetizers, and entrees without a hitch. The entrees came around 6:10pm and we finished about 15 minutes later and waited and waited. Ordered dessert at 6:45pm and about 7:00pm our box for the pizza and dessert came, along with the receipt.   Our waitress forgot to punch in the discount, and I provided her with the gift card I had, she adjusted the amount when the transaction which was put through which was good. It took another 15 minutes before we got the receipt back and I opted to tip in cash because I didn't really want to wait another 15 minutes.   This visit was so close to being a 5 star, minus the points I've addressed here! Darn! Maybe next time.  P.S. Sorry the photos are a little dark, but the lighting was not great outside!"}
{"text":"good food, high prices.  love the modern atmosphere and patio is very cool but i think there are much better places to get tastier food and less expensive drinks in central phoenix."}
{"text":"Took a VIP customer out tonight from Taiwan, who is a vegetarian. True Foods Kitchen was a great selection for this. Innovative vegetarian (and non-vegetarian) dishes.  Torched avocado appetizer was excellent. Can't go wrong with their pizzas. We ate outdoors on the patio. Great atmosphere and lively crowd.  Friendly service and overall a good value.  I've been pleased at all the Fox Concept restaurants for delivering a solid and consistent experience. True Foods Kitchen is no exception."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and the food is outstanding. However, today was a whole different outstanding experience. I was picking up lunch for my very busy boss. They accidentally tossed the dressing when i asked for it on the side. I told the gentlemen that was helping me, I only had 3 minutes to wait. Not only did he get my order out in 3 minutes, he also brought me two juices and a juice boost. Time and time again this restaurant company amazes me. Their service is incredible and there food matches that services."}
{"text":"I get it, super fresh, organic veggies, farm raised animals blah blah blah. But let's just get one thing clear, there's never an excuse to charge $19+ for a lunch sized salad. The salad itself was listed at $12 on the menu, but rang up for $12.50. Ok, Fine. But $5.50 to add chicken?!? It's not like you get a whole breast. It's 4 small slices. I was literally speechless when the teller told me the total. Did you raise that chicken from the nest? Did you cut of it's head and clean it out back? No. Nope. Not cool. Additionally, most of the baby kale was still on the stalk to the point where I had to get out a kitchen knife, dump the salad out, and cut it up in to pieces I could actually make sensible bites out of. If you're going to charge that kind of money for a salad, at least take some pride in the preparation and presentation, even if it is to go! So annoyed. The Marcona almonds were good at least. Small victories."}
{"text":"What a great concept! Delicious food and great service. Although the place was busy,  we were served rather quickly.  Crudite was beautifully arranged! My quinoa burger went down really fast. I *need* to learn how they make the sweet potato hash. I'm jealous of the states that have a True Food Kitchen....I'm ready to petition to get one up here in the northeast"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Love it so much. Anything you get on the menu is going to be delicious. I'm convinced. Haven't had a bad meal here.   I highly recommend the edamame dumplings for a starter. Incredible.   Red chili noodles dish is amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"Had the red chili noodles with chicken today. Very tasty. Just enough heat. Plenty of vegetables and just enough to feel full but not stuffed. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen is one of those restaurants that becomes an instant smash hit. They are legendary for their healthy but still delicious menu, which is a feat many restaurants try but fail. As healthy as TFK is, rest assured that the his place doesn't come across as a pretentious eatery.   The menu changes from season to season but maintains several consistent items. Most items come with a choice of sweet potato hash or a kale salad.   My personal go to favorite is the quinoa inside out burger with both sweet potato and kale with a beet juice blend.   There are now several True Foods around the country. The location at Scottsdale Quarter is our closest location. The Quarter has ample parking including a few valet parking options, Tesla electric chargers, standard EV chargers, street parking and garage deck parking.   Show up early during the busy times of the day, as you can expect a decent wait. The juice is worth the squeeze both literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"True Foods is the real deal!  True Food Kitchen is a consistent winner.  They offer great, clean and healthy food without the typical healthy food vs good food trade off.  I enjoy the consistency they offer from restaurant to restaurant.    True Food Kitchen offers fresh cold pressed juice drinks, as well as some very unique \"adult\" version cocktails.  They refresh the menu several times throughout the year.  They do keep several of the mainstays throughout the year.    Their wait staff are always amazing and super friendly.  Easily located at the front of Biltmore on Camelback Rd.  The icing on the cake is that they offer free validated parking at their Biltmore location."}
{"text":"Hey, the food wasn't bad. Like a lot of people here, definitely felt like we paid a lot for what we got (but maybe that's the \"natural\" or \"true\" food mentality). Our server Tyler didn't really pay attention to us (lots of awkward eye contact, like oh shit I forgot about you guys), and no offers to refill drinks. The close proximity of tables can make one feel claustrophobic. My girl friend ordered the curry and commented that she felt something was missing afterwards. Come to find the rice was missing. When we informed our waiter, his reply was simply \"sorry about that I will let the kitchen know.\" $14 for an incomplete meal!!!! Not to mention the vegetables were semi-raw still (but maybe that's a \"true\" thing)."}
{"text":"Great place for the healthy individual. It is a bit on the pricey side, however the food was terrific as well as the service attentive."}
{"text":"Who knew eating right could be such an amazingly tasty experience! This place is such a welcomed find and I cannot wait for the Chicago location to open up at State & Erie next year. I enjoyed it so much that I dined here twice in 24 hours.    The menu is balanced and offers something for every palate including, vegans, individuals with gluten allergies and carnivores.   Value for the money -  4 stars   Location - 5 stars   Service - 4 stars  Herb Hummus - 5 stars   Red Chili Shrimp - 5 stars   Kale and Spinach dip - 4 stars   Vegetable Crudités - 4 stars  Squash pie - 5 stars ***** absolute favorite   Spaghetti Squash Casserole - 5 stars ; you can add a protein like mushrooms or chicken   Almond cake dessert - 2 stars"}
{"text":"This review is way overdue but better late than never. So True Foods is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley and that's a given as the food is flavorful, fresh, non gmo and organic 80+% of the time and just plain amazing. I am a regular every-time I choose to eat out. Besides the food this review is for the above and beyond service. I ordered to go which is something I never do and ordered the soup of the day. I ordered the soup of the day only asking about one allergy and not another since wheat is uncommon in soup. Turn out I devoured the soup and felt horrible. I called the next day wondering what the ingredients were since I know their food and their had to be something I am allergic to in there. I called and spoke to Lauren who is a ALLERY SPECIALIST and went above and beyond to help and apologize. I am so grateful and absolutely fell in love with True Foods even more which I didn't think was possible. I just called to find out ingredients and as soon as I heard my allergy I was just going to hang up and make sure I ask about wheat and dairy in everything next time. Thank you for leading the food restaurant industry in higher standards and staying true to appreciating the customer and serving real food."}
{"text":"True Foods you are going downhill. In particular this location. I am a regular on average 5-10X per month depending on what I am feeling. To give an example of how service and food quality is declining. I show up me and my book tell the server I just want something light and quick. We discuss soup and 1/2 sandwich is possible and a drink done  awesome. Soup is good, then comes out a pizza- I tell food sever I didn't order a pizza she/ probably manager looks at me confused and says what did you order. I ordered the tempeh sandwich. Ok cool I go back to reading my book. Out comes my original sever asking me why I didn't want the pizza. And I get slightly annoyed as I know what is going on. He forgot I I'm sure to just place the order for the Sandwich and long story short looks at my crazy as if I changed my mind. Ok whatever no biggie I get it and I move on... I don't take it personal perhaps it's he is new and his manager bugging him about it. Out comes my tempeh sandwich with tofu instead of tempeh. I ask what is this? Thinking they changed the menu and I missed it... ummm her reply is it's still vegan and it's tofu and we don't have tempeh right now. Really?!?! 1. I'm not 100% vegan and 2. I know what tofu is but whatever. 3. In my head why didn't he tell me this when he placed order 4. Whatever in my head I am saying and I am  moving on again. I take 1 bite of sandwhich and it tastes like crap. Literally I make tofu soup, stirfrys etc at home and this was no bueno. Here is the annoying part... no one said we messed up ever. She apologized but after the fact I had to get up and ask why is there tofu instead of tempeh. Waste of $ and time is what this equated to. True foods better step up their game as other restaurants are popping up that offer better food and they will loose customers. Probably will not be coming to this location again for a minute just based of service. Food is whatever s*** happens. I'm no-self entitled jerk but with my kindness and humility they still treated me like crap. Try True Foods but if the service is sub par don't say I didn't warn you"}
{"text":"I just want to tell about my experience here this is not a place I would normally go cause I eat food cause I like the flavor not cause its healthy. I can appreciate the idea behind this place but holy shit this place is over priced for what you get. Everything needed salt and I kind of expected that. I will say that the pizza we tried was good. We tried the shrimp, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese pizza and it was suprisingly good. I did not think I would care for shrimp on a pizza but dam it, it was a good combo for sure. I also got the turkey pita. It had a great dresing on it just did not have enough of it. The pita bread was so dry i drank two glasses of water just to get it down.  When you eat this you know your eating healty so its just blah. They use all local products which  I like and the menue changes with the season wich I like but everything we tried was lacking flavor . I went with 6 people and everybody shared so we could all try everything. Betweeen all of us we tried 6 different dishes and two apps. They have an outside patio and the inside decor is nice. We got the private table in the back wich was cool. The restrooms sinks are very cool and they have the best hand driers ever in the restrooms as well, not really important just thought I would mention that. Anyways If your a healthy eater than this place is worth a try. For me if I'm going to spend $15-20 for myself I would choose so many other places."}
{"text":"So we went again, we love the patio. This time for drinks and appetizers.  The service was horrible. The drinks good. The hummus a little weird in flavor. Not really Persian and creamy. Lumpy and brownish with too little bread. The pizza was horrible, tiny no flavor, digiorno is better. The lettuce cups were so so, the restaurant seems committed to using something sweet and stcky in everything. I don't know the name of the spice but it smells like potpourri and tastes like room freshner"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and really like it. The wait is usually insane and not worth the food though. If you can grab a seat at the bar or the community tables it's best. Avoid the street tacos. Terrible. I was able to try both the fish and the steak because they brought me the wrong order and I had tried the steak before realizing it wasn't what I had ordered. Steak was dry and the fish (my original order) was non existent. Very disappointing for the $16 price tag. Kale salad and Quinoa Berger the way to go."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. So far in Phoenix it has our favorite Turkey Burgers. I love the way everyone is in same color uniform, super clean and excellent food. Amazingly well-run restaurant. They also have muffins that make you wanna slap your mamma."}
{"text":"I came in around 7 pm and had a 20 minute wait, but felt like less. The atmosphere was aesthetically pleasing, but a bit louder than I prefer. No biggie. We ordered a few starters, a caramelized onion tart (which was pretty good) and an absolutely beautiful bowl of crudités vegetables that were just delicious. I got the Kale-aid to drink and it was wonderful. Fresh juice, yum! My entree was a lovely vegetarian TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) sandwhich which also included avocado and veganese. The meat eaters in our group tried the grass fed bison burgers and we're very pleased. Each entree offered a side of kale salad, or sweet potato hash, or the option of \"a little bit of both\", which we all happened to choose and enjoyed. I love that they try and use the freshest, most local, organic ingredients. They have something for everyone. It's a bit pricey, but it's a nice treat every now and then. I will happily go back again."}
{"text":"So I am here a lot. Like twice a week as my boss is obsessed with place. The food is so yummy, healthy and fresh. The employees here are so friendly and professional. They work so hard to make right. Sometimes when I coming in I can tell they are slammed, every table full and 10 to go orders up and yet they all are so positive and each team member is working so hard. It is like watching a dance. Everyone knows there part and does it flawlessly. I have a few issues over the years but every time the manager handles it so well. This place is truly the best and it all because of the amazing team and yummy food!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We had and loved the  shiitake tofu lettuce cups, Panang curry shrimp , the daily market soup (chicken noodle), sustainable seafood special (scallops). The cocktails were also excellent.  We had the ginger margarita and thai grapefruit martini. For desert we had the rhubarb crisp. Our server Danielle was great."}
{"text":"So I have to start out with a complaint. Why the heck do we not have one of these restaurants in the Chandler, Gilbert, or Tempe area? This place was an awesome treat for our dinner. My wife and I primarily eat vegan and vegetarian at home  so it was nice to find a really awesome restaurant out there with these options but even better. We had a couple of the skinny margaritas each which were delicious. We started off with the kale guacamole and shared the artichoke pesto pizza. Both of these options were beautiful and delicious. This also made us order the true food kitchen cook book. Do try this place and I promise if your open to this kind of healthy eating you'll love it."}
{"text":"Usually love True Foods but today the service was very poor and very slow.  It took 45 minutes to place our order.  Waiter took drink order and did not come back for 45 min to get food order.  Then took another  1 hour to get our food.  I ordered a salad and my salad came 30 minutes before everyone else's food.  I was well finished before the others even received their food.   The waiter came by twice and said food would be right up, but was another 30 min before it arrived.   My boys were still extremely hungry after they ate(portions very small) so they ordered dessert.  Took 15 min to even get our ordered placed for dessert, and then the waiter came back 15 min later and stated that they ran out of what we ordered.  Very disappointed.  Left to go get ice cream across the street.   Was at true foods for over 2 hours waiting for service.  Not sure will go back.  Definitely not with hungry boys!"}
{"text":"Loved eating lunch at true food kitchen! I had the roasted turkey wrap with kale salad and it was amazing. The wrap was very fresh and the turkey was wonderful. I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was very relaxing and the misters made the outside seating extra comfortable and not too hot. The honey lemonade was a great and refreshing drink starter, and we had the kale guacamole dip as an appetizer which was great! Also pictured is the teriyaki quinoa bowl (with added chicken) and the turkey burger with hash which were equally as delicious. We loved true food kitchen and we will be back!! Food and service was quick as well. Loved being right in the center of kierland commons!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Outdoor seating has misters! Food arrived promptly! I eat lunch at this place often and order the turkey wrap. They got rid of it so some silly reason. Should bring it back! Kale salad is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good and so fresh!! The ancient grains bowl blew my mind!! The glazed sweet potatoes in it were divine! I also love the cocktails! Thai basil grapefruit drink was the perfect amount of strong and citrus. I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food, lovely location. Visiting from the east coast where organic is now becoming a mainstay at most high end restaurants,  I must say I was impressed with the quality of organic, vegetarian and vegan options. The food was interesting too...well presented and very tasty.  Wish we had franchise in the NY/NJ area."}
{"text":"Best food in Htown hands down! Their taking is insanely good and I loveeeed the salmon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great atmosphere, simply a great place"}
{"text":"The service and food was great as usual, it wasn't until me and my girlfriend split the bill that things got weird...Long story short I was charged the whole bill and immediately informed it would be cleared and changed to the correct price (in my account) in 15minutes. Then after finishing up our drinks I checked my online banking, not cleared. Then she told me by midnight. Still nothing in the morning so I called the manager and asked when it would be corrected. He tells me 3-5 business days...A 15 minute correction (originally what I was told) turning into a week thing is frustrating and to top it off there was absolutely no offers or compensations of how they could make up for such a huge inconvenience:/ Won't be going to that location again."}
{"text":"This is my second time to True Food Kitchen (first time to this location).  It was great!   Nice atmosphere, great service and the food is wonderful!  If you can't appreciate local, organic, fresh good- stay away, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"I like the healthy-focused menu, but execution was not as great as I expected. We still had a good meal, thought. The kale salad as everyone has stated is quite delicious. I also had some type of fish. The foo is reasonable and the service was fine. Maybe it being a tad cheaper would make it a little better but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"A trip to Scottsdale is not complete without dining at True Food. Here are my top items: - Onion tart - Butternut squash pizza - Vegetable crudites - Medicine man-- at least 2 glasses! - Teriyaki bowl - spicy shrimp - Bison burger Can't wait for them to open in Palo alto soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting my sister over Thanksgiving, and we tried out this place for brunch.  I was impressed with everything about this place.  The food is delicious, but is uniquely creative and healthy.  The menu is filled with wholesome entrees, ranging from meaty to vegan, and all the options are tasty.  I ordered the tofu scramble wrap, and to my family's surprise it was the best dish ordered (although the quinoa jack cakes, the date-pistachio-espresso-banana muffin, and good ole scrambled eggs and turkey bacon were delicious too).  What tops this place off to a 5-star rating is the great ambience, with both outdoor and indoor seating options, the attentive and informative wait staff, and the innovative kitchen.  It is completely open to air, with the servers working at prep stations.  You can watch them prepare your food, or pull salmon fresh from the icebox to be cleaned.  Amazing.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"If you want good, clean food... Come here. The brussel sprouts and mushroom pizza is so tasty. The  chili noodles are amazing! Our waiter was so friendly as well!  Bonus points for being a peanut free facility!"}
{"text":"Very \"trendy\" but overpriced place with just mediocre food with not-so-good service. Definitely overrated.  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"They have very cute signature drink with fresh juice and fun names. They are a bit pricey but are pretty large. The teriyaki brown rice bowl is disappointing, however, they have great personal pizzas. The menu is relatively overpriced, but the atmosphere and servers are great."}
{"text":"I had a great experience when I had dinner with my friend here the other night. The waitress was nice and patient with our questions. We ordered a turkey burger with the kale salad and sweet potato. It was delicious!! For beverage, I ordered the vanilla almond milk java and it was so good. The price was reasonable and worth it. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"OVERHYPED! Food is bland and tasteless but great atmosphere.  We went here and ordered a variety of food (an appetizer, a soup, a salad, 4 entrees, and a dessert).  This place is great for a happy hour and to kick it as the environment is spacious and hip and full of good looking people, but other than that, the food is very overpriced and every dish besides the bison burger was bland and tasteless.  They infuse a lot of culture into their menu but everything is so generic and americanized with absolutely no WOW factor."}
{"text":"So good! I've heard that this location is better than the Arcadia one. My favs are the bison burger, the chicken chopped salad, and the panang chicken curry."}
{"text":"TFK please come to Tucson......pleeease! This is the healthiest of all Fox Concepts and it happens to by my favorite followed closely by Wild Flower. I've dined at the Biltmore TFK a number of times and always had an excellent experience. Today was my first time at this particular location and I was pleasantly surprised that it was a bit smaller but still maintains that airy, earthy organic vibe we all now associate with True Food Kitchen. Our group arrived a little early and they weren't quiet open for lunch, but they graciously sat us and took our drink order. That's the first sign of top notch service. The rest of our lunch went just as nicely and quick too! This time I ordered the Chopped Mediterranean salad which is loaded with the sweetest tomatoes, cucumber, olives, feta, greens, almonds and quinoa with a tangy vinaigrette. I added grilled chicken for some extra protein and savored every bite! When you come to TFK make sure not to pass up their fresh drinks. I ordered The Natural which is fresh ginger, agave and soda. Pretty much like a ginger ale, but oh so refreshing. All of their refreshments in my opinion are worth a try! Since the menu here is the same as their other locations, I think it's also worth pointing out some of my other favorites: the kale salad with salmon or just by itself, so lemony and zesty! The teriyaki brown rice bowl, lettuce cups and street tacos. Seriously, what's not to like? It's healthy, delicious and portions are generous. Attentive service and and refreshing atmosphere make this a solid five-star spot in my book."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some healthy food. I love the open kitchen and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"So delicious!! The wait is totally worth it. Our waitress (forgot her name) was extremely helpful in answering all our questions and being patient with us. I love the hummus and pita appetizer!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect here It being a vegan type of restaurant but the food and drinks were really good.  I had the Thai basil grapefruit martini which was amazing.  For my entree I had the grilled chicken salad which was delicious.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Another tough one that will require revisiting and re-scoring in a few to several months, if things change. Had a few visits so far, with generally good but mixed results.   THE CONCEPT - 4 Stars I'm no Weil disciple who drops to their knees and goes all agape for his every utterance. But I think he is the perfect partner for a Fox concept, as long as the fresh, fresh, fresh motto is adhered to over the long term. I like some of the Fox places (okay one, Greene House) and it's the same chef that opened True Food.  My Dad was recently diagnosed with Seliac Disease and seeing more and more restaurants acknowledge that dietary restriction on gluten is important to a growing segment of people is refreshing. The menu makes it easy to distinguish between various dietary regimens and other considerations, in both food and drink. I eat anything, but it sure makes it easier to eat with those who are justifiably (and sometimes unjustifiably) conscious of what they put in their bodies.  Everything from the mixed drinks to the food items seems to be VERY fresh, or at least sourced very well.   THE SPACE - 4 Stars Simple, modern, open California kitchen appeal. I like how they raised the ceiling of the old Coffee Plantation shithole. The mural wall and the over-sized lamps are fun. Open kitchens are always a little more fun and give you something to talk about if your date is lacking in conversational acumen.   THE EXECUTION (for now) - 3 Stars  Service They're trying. Things still seem jittery with some of the servers. Have seen a lot of food go to the wrong tables and places. I'm sure they'll work through that. Everyone is friendly, but not necessarily knowledgable about the food. Sure they've memorized the spiel, but these aren't foodie servers. They're young, friendly folks working at a hip spot.  Food Have tried several things that were tasty and fresh, if not particularly interesting. They just kind of show you that you can eat stuff that is relatively healthy and not have it taste like nothing. A few things so far have shined: the spelt pizzas have a unique, chewy crust and nice toppings. The Kale Salad is unique and delicious. Nice textures. The Shrimp Dumplings are nice, but make you yearn to eat real chinese, or make your own like you like 'em. Steak Tacos are of the Fresh Mex variety but have a great char.   On the downside...  I had the Turkey Bolognese Penne. To me, there is never an excuse for overcooked pasta. If you cook it, and it's overdone, throw it away and cook it again. Check your pasta, it's the heart of the dish. I neglected to order \"al dente\" because so many places give you that look like \"But of course, signore!\" And you shouldn't have to ask for pasta to be done that way. That's the only way it should be done, unless you're eating Spaghettios. As for the sauce, it tasted like diced San Marzano's which is great! But if you use the canned San Marzano's omit the little pieces with the unchewable stem base. Cut that part out or pitch the piece. I added shrimp to the dish at the server's suggestions, despite my past history of NOT combining shrimp and turkey. Call me crazy, but that's just not a combo I yearn for. Would have been fine though, except that the shrimp were completely undercooked. I eat shrimp raw, when I intend to, but that clear uncooked shrimp is not the texture you want in a cooked dish. At sashimi/sushi, yes. Pasta, no. Seems to happen a lot though. And no discernible seasoning or flavor to them either.  My wife's salmon was largely flavorless, and very rare. Fine for us as we love raw salmon. But at a certain point, she just would have preferred sashimi and the accompanying soy sauce. I'm sure the amount or rareness would have been a problem for many diners. Especially when combined with almost no salt. On that note, the fresh fish crudo of the day was a nice hamachi with an excellent yuzu/miso (? - that's what it tasted like) sauce.    BOTTOM LINE - 3 Stars for now I could see this going either way in the future, but if they stay fresh and improve on the execution, it's a no-brainer that they will end up a 4 star. I don't think they'll ever hit 5 stars, just because their commitment to the healthy stuff and a very broad appeal will keep them from really being able to push it from a culinary standpoint."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and the place was hopping! There was a line of people waiting to put their name in... We decided to grab a seat at one of the communal tables near the bar which happen to be open as oppose to waiting.   I had the turkey burger on their GF bun with the kale salad and sweet potatoes as sides (you get two). The GF bun seemed dry and the turkey burger not that impressive. I'd say my meal overall was just okay.  Great ambiance and as many have said the patio is pretty awesome. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting to try this place.  The concept is great, the decor is modern, and the eco-friendliness is right up our alley.  When we arrived the wait was about an hour, but they took down our cell number and said that they would call us when the table was ready - so we were able to wonder around Scottsdale Quarter (which is easy to do when killing time).    Once our table was ready we were sat outside on the patio, which was very nicely decorated.  Our waitress was nice and helped to make recommendations when asked for them both with drinks and the food.  I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole and my fiancee had the turkey lasagna.  Mine was good, but his was much better - wish I had ordered that instead!    My berry smash cocktail was good and the chocolate cake dessert was decent also.    Overall: B+   Perhaps a touch overhyped and always seems to have a long wait, but with a rotating menu and always having healthy options this place will definitely get a re-visit."}
{"text":"True Food is completely over rated.  It is located in the Biltmore shopping area and it has an open, spacious restaurant.  Food is really pricey, portions are small, and service is ok.  I ate here once and I don't plan to come back, but I've noticed most people like eating here.  It's not for me."}
{"text":"Open air seating here is great. Awesome selection of mixed drinks and wine. Dr Andrew Weil's inspired menu of organic and local fare is excellent. Kids menu is in top 3 I've even seen. This will be a constant stop every time I visit the area!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Love so many things...Turkey lasagna is to die for and healthy. Their plain green salad is wonderful because of their Umami dressing which I am addicted to, can't live without it! Also their salads are very good. Their flatbread pizza is good. Their Edamame dumplings, spaghetti squash pasta is great. Their fish entree for dinner is always great as well as their shaved turkey on pita with their sweet potato hash and kale salad! As I said before, everything is good. And, the best thing is everything is super healthy too! I could eat at True Foods every day very happily!"}
{"text":"Awesome bison.  Kale.  Juice.  Herbs back.  Very nice bathrooms.  Clean."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. I have never had a bad experience here. There is never a wait and the service couldn't get any better!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Andrew Weill but somehow the restaurant did not reach my expectation.  It is a nice place, the waiters are very attentive and friendly and the food was yummy, but I expected sensational. I was looking for a mouth watering menu that would be unforgettable - but it was nice. Just nice.  Maybe my expectation was out of whack, maybe the dishes could be tastier...  I was also disappointed by the menu - I would like to have more options."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. Visited in Boca Raton and now in Phoenix. I love the concept, the fresh ingredients and the open kitchen. This time, I had the Tuna poke bowl with the Kombucha (with pomegranate). We also enjoyed the Kale guacamole. One person had the teriyaki bowl and raved  about it. If this place comes to Jacksonville FL I will be there a few times a week! Pleas come here!!"}
{"text":"i want to move there just so i can eat here frequently! love their veggies & concept"}
{"text":"While the service was nothing spectacular to boast of, the open kitchen, and the arthritic layout of the restaurant makes it appealing for both ambience and conversation. The food was good, with many hearty and warm dishes that are seeming comfort food with a great healthy perspective. Also, thorough enjoyed the ever changing list of mocktails for non-drinkers."}
{"text":"Good restaurant I love the decor. Great place to go for a light, fresh and casual summer dinner."}
{"text":"I came here with my family in the summer time and was really impressed. My mom has some specific dietary needs and the staff did a great job in helping pick entrees and explaining the healthy concept they are. Even though their is a focus on healthy food their is something for everyone and they do a great job having contemporary American cuisine on the menu. I also love grabbing a smoothie next door at juby true when I am walking through Scottsdale quarter."}
{"text":"Another typical Fox concept that is completely self serving the fox the empire.  Yes- the food and concept is good. However the service as in the hostess department is abysmal.  It's like they send all these early 20 year olds to a school where they learn that they're time is more important than yours.  Every single fox concept I've gone to is like this- it's pathetic"}
{"text":"The quality has really gone downhill. For an expensive restaurant, I would now say it is not worth it. We spent 50.00 on lunch for 2 and it was OK. Will not be returning any time soon.  Much better food quality at Lotus in Encinitas at more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"All my veggie friends love this place.  Offers gluten free meals too.  Enjoy their summer squash casserole.  Tried their corn and hatch chili pizza w/kale pesto which I enjoyed.  Somewhat noisy and always crowded.  They comp'd us a flourless chocolate cake for a birthday we celebrated.  Nice touch.  Lunch & diner menu is the same.  Get here early or you'll find yourself waiting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The servers are great and so nice. The food is delicious. My only complaint would be the hostesses are not very friendly but I still give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place. My boss (who is into healthy eating) recommended this place. I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  Plenty of healthy food and drink options and they are all organic.  If you are a heavy meat eater this is not the place for you.  They have delicious specialty drinks (both alcoholic and non alcoholic) and plenty of salads, entrees, appetizers, and deserts to choose from.  I would recommend either the spaghetti squash or the quinoa beat salad.  Both are delicious and very good for you.  Service is pretty good.  I have yet to have a poor experience here (knock on wood).  The servers are always very nice and personable and get you your food as soon as its ready.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is trying to lose weight, diet, or just start eating healthier."}
{"text":"I admit of a weakness and recurring craving for their Quinoa Tabbouleh (gluten-free and vegan) which only appears on their lunch menu, but they'll serve it to you for dinner as well.  I have to recommend their beverages even though they are pricey. I'm always game for interesting flavors and combinations, and for the most part True Food gets it right.  If you have dietary restrictions give this place a try.  Most of the plates have subtle flavors so if you prefer robust and spicy True Food probably isn't for you. However, if you like to feel healthy after a meal; TF gets a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I LOVE TRUE FOOD! Thank you Dr. Weil for creating this amazing restaurant! The food is so delicious, clean, and healthy. I love the tuna tataki!!!! The caramelized onion tart is crazy good! The roasted seasonal vegetable board is also really yummy. Everything is so yummy! I love that the fish is sustainable!  The service is fabulous and friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!! Had the curry with salmon which was delicious!!!! Definitely recommend.  Staff was very nice and welcoming! Also the kale salad was to die for."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Moving from San Francisco- I feel I'm back home! Food is delicious, love the ambiance and it just feels so organic!! I'll be back many many times!"}
{"text":"When I am in Arizona this is one of my favorite places to eat!! They are on their game. They ask about food allergies, preferences and make sure everything is taken care of. The food is fresh, local and delicious! The atmosphere in this place feels alive!"}
{"text":"As a person with special dietary restrictions (I mostly eat AIP) I am constantly on the look out for places I can safely eat. Not only could I eat most of the items on the menu, but the food is just delicious! It is a little pricey for what you get, but it doesn't bother me considering the high quality food and warm, attentive service. I'm confident I can safely eat here, while still having an enjoyable time. Did I mention the food is delicious?! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"From a girl who was born and raised in sunny SoCal, when I walked into True Food Kitchen, I thought to myself, \"Wow...this place is so LA.\" Minimalist (yet natural) design, hip waitstaff...it would fit right into Los Angeles. However, True Food is a little too LA: it's all looks but no substance.  True Food Kitchen cooks with a very literal defintion of vegetarian/vegan food in mind, which results in overly bland foods. Probably healthy, but still overly bland.  The brother and I split the carmelized onion tart to start, and I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole as my main entree. To call the onion tart a tart is misleading - It should be described as more of a flatbread pizza (or, in our case, a very charred flatbread pizza), with gorgonzola cheese, figs and onions as toppings. The figs were slightly burnt as was the bottom of the bread, so the taste of onions and cheese was masked by the taste of charred food.  The spaghetti squash casserole was exactly what it was described to be: spaghetti squash with mozzarella, tomatoes and zucchini. It tasted like squash and zucchini mixed with marinara sauce and baked with cheese on top. Nothing more. The first couple of bites were fine, but I got sick of it halfway through.  If you're into very simplistic, healthy food, True Food might be right up your alley. But, it just lacks the flavor and depth of other vegetarian restaurants I've been to and overall, I just wasn't impressed by anything I tried."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  I could eat here every day. Creative, delicious farm to table food. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I heard from my friend, who heard from Phoenix Suns players, who heard from Steve Nash, that this place is one where you can get your grub on while eating healthy.  I had the ahi wheat pasta and new moon drink, both of which were good and delicious. Honestly, I had forgotten it was ahi and thought it was chicken until I remembered what I ordered! The new moon was a mixture of grapefruit juice, agave, and soda water, doesn't that sound good?"}
{"text":"I like True Food. I been to Santa Monica, Denver and both AZ locations. The problem with particular location is Juice. I order costume juice in tall glass with no ice and aways get it with ice. So I send it back and get the same juice in smaller glass with added water. I been here 3 times and every time the same story.   As far as food goes, it's very good and healthy in every location.  From now on I will skip this location."}
{"text":"True Food gets high remarks from me mainly for the friendly service and casual, open atmosphere. I especially like that there is a lot of outdoor seating, and the indoor seating is somewhat greenhouse or gazebo-like.  The food tastes pretty good, but my suggestion is not to arrive too hungry. The food is so damn healthy that it leaves you wanting to snack on something immediately after leaving the restaurant. It's a good thing that there are no cookie or cupcake shops around the corner.  On my latest visit, I ordered the organic tomato and roasted vegetable pizza, which was quite tasty, but much to my surprise did not have any cheese on it. I dumped an entire bowl of parmesan cheese on it to make up for it. I wonder if they'll add some mozzarella cheese to it next time I order it. At least that way it'll stick to my bones and drown out my snacking cravings after eating there."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner!! Our server Chelsea was AWESOME! She took her time with us and our many questions, always was more than happy to accommodate our needs, and split up our meal for us to share before we even asked!! If you're heading here, ask for her. Thank you for making me feel so special on my birthday, Chelsea!!"}
{"text":"If you like California fare AND California attitude, this is the place for you.  The food is pleasantly above average, and the creative sandwiches, salads, and pizzas make for nice, if somewhat pricey, lunches.   The atmosphere is transplanted directly from southern California, down to the plush seat cushions, use of authentic and fake plants, and quantity of hair gel atop employees' noggins.  However, the staff behaves in an overtly pretentious manner. Ask any specific questions and you will expose their lack of knowledge of the True Food menu. The hostess staff seem to take pleasure in making diners wait for a table. Folks, it's Phoenix, and it's decent, but not spectacular food.   If you have ever been to Century City in Los Angeles and enjoy that kind of atmosphere, then True Food is for you."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, I find that there are many options for me here, which is nice. The edamame dumplings are delicious (although it only comes with 4!) and the kale salad is very good as well! Almost everything I've tried is tasty and the service isn't bad. The biggest problem is the small portions for such high prices!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are up in Scottsdale we try to find new places to eat.  Apparently this place is another Fox restaurant.  I am always impressed with the decor of his restaurants.   The food is great we had a flat bread pizza and a spinach salad.  Everything was fresh and tasty!    Again though there were more staff than customers, now a days I don't see why that is."}
{"text":"4 stars...because the waiters service at the Scottsdale Quarter location for our large group during a busy lunch was fantastic.  All the food was fantastic as well.....except for my 'Heirloom Tomato and Watermelon' salad.  I was really expecting heirloom tomatoes to be the star of the show...and had a hearty craving for some fresh heirlooms...but...sadly...the number of cherry tomatoes on my plate far exceeded the 3 tiny wedges of heirloom tomatoes I received :(  Sam...I know you got to make a buck just like the next guy...but please know this....I would gladly pay more for a nice healthy portion of freshly dressed heirloom tomatoes!"}
{"text":"2nd time I've been here...Definitely the last.  Lots of trouble finding anything \"normal\" or 'plain'.  1st time we went, they accidentally skipped our name on the waitlist, and we ended up waiting over an hour for a table--this was a weekday lunch and it was briefly busy, but certainly not busy enough for that much time--  We had to remind them twice.  That time we ordered three different items...they were All Beige!  2nd time we couldn't figure out What to order, I lost my appetite from the menu choices, and the waitress had a bad attitude.  Finally I asked for a side of brown rice.  that's what I got.  No spoon, no chopsticks, no soy sauce.  Nothing.  She never came back.  Our family has been in the restaurant business for over 30 years, and we have never found a place so highly touted, yet so terribly disappointing.  By the way, the place is Really Loud, too."}
{"text":"Meh.  That's all I can say about this place.  My dad was raving about how good everything was, but when our family came here to eat, at least half of us weren't that impressed.  Luckily, I was not one of them, as I ordered a fish entree that our server recommended.  The service was really sub-par, as I guess they're a new restaurant.  They forgot our appetizers, brought wrong drinks, etc.  We'll see how they do as they get through their opening stages, I guess."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!  The staff is AMAZING!  Everyone is super knowledgable and helpful.  The food is soooo soooo good!  For being healthy, offering multiple vegan/vegetarian options, and being reasonably priced, I'd say that is one of two restaurants that are my favorite in town."}
{"text":"I recently had a wonderful lunch experience at True Food! They have multiple vegetarian options to offer making it difficult to decide what to order. I started with Shiitake Lettuce Cups and every bite was full of flavor..next on my plate was a Wild Mushroom Pizza which was cooked to perfection. My server was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. In addition multiple managers helped ensure my meal was satisfactory. If you are looking for a fresh and healthy bite head to True Foods!"}
{"text":"If today was my first time at True Food Kitchen, I would probably give it one or two stars only, but because I've been there a few times, I have to give it more.    I went for breakfast today and the service was just terrible.  We ordered coffee to drink, and the cups sat empty for almost the entire meal until we were able to flag down another waitress.  Same case for the syrup for our pancakes, and we were one of four tables there... that's just not acceptable.    But the shining star is the food- I just LOVE the food here.  I've been for every meal and there is always something I love.  The quinoa blueberry johnny cakes are wonderful for breakfast and the salmon is great for dinner.  I also love their elixir's- the green arnie and cucumber refresher are my faves- super refreshing!!   If you're going to try True Food, and I definitely think you should, I suggest going for dinner when the service is so much better!"}
{"text":"True Foods has a great concept but in all honesty I believe it's overrated. I have dinned with them on several occasions - last night for a friend's birthday - and each time thought it was okay but not fantastic. The menu dinners range from $15-30, but are not worth that much (for example there was bones in my fish and our desert oil cake was a bit stale). However, they are a good place if you want to feel like you are \"eating healthy\" because of the organic/gluten free dishes. The service was very good - Damien was our very attentive waiter."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving bad reviews but at the end of the day this was just a big ol' disappointment for all three parties that dined.  Service was great - our server was very nice and wanted to make sure everything was good.   Our meals were just bad.  We started with the small kale salad, which I love but it was really over dressed this go around.  Then all got the Pad Thai because our one friend said she had it (at the phx location) and said it was great.  We all got our bowls and the rice noodles were not cooked and still stiff.  Our waitress was nice enough and asked the kitchen to redo our dishes.  Our one friend just hated the dish entirely and asked to get a burger instead (which turned out terrible as well) but the burger came out overcooked and missing ingredients.  My friend gets this burger all the time so she was pretty bummed but didn't want to complain a second time. Plus we were just hungry.  Our new bowls came out, this time very cooked noodles like mush almost.  I have to say this is definitely not your traditional pad thai but that being said its just doesn't work.  The flavor combination along with the texture of the vegetables used was just off.  I ate my tofu and called it a day on that dish. My other friend was just so hungry she ate it but didn't like it at all.   We will stick to the Phoenix location and call it a day."}
{"text":"I little pricey, but my goodness this place is delicious. As a both gluten free and vegan customer it would be nice to have a little more flexibility with the vegan dishes and making them GF, but this place has great service and delicious selections, so we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Wish there were a few of these in San Diego. Great fresh food and wonderful atmosphere. The pesto olive pizza is one of my favorites, I usually add the chicken sausage to it. The kale salad is great as well. Had tempeh here for the first time and it's good too. I feel like you can't go wrong with their menu. The porter beer was incredible and their refreshing drinks are awesome. My favorite are the Ginger and the pineapple with coconut water ones. The teriyaki bowl with tofu is a hit and so if the curry bowl. It can be packed midday for lunch but not as much in the evening. The kitchen is open and they make a lot of their food steps away from you. I love this place! I can't wait to return to Phx to have it again."}
{"text":"We waited half an hour for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. While I did enjoy the patio seating, the food wasn't all that great. I'm all for the healthy eating concept. However, the portion size and flavor were lacking for the price you are paying. The shrimp dumplings were 11 bucks for 4 dumplings that were worst than frozen ones from the bag! Not impressed."}
{"text":"After reading the menu items, you immediately realize that you are going to get some good all-natural food.  Many varied things on the menu which all looked intriguing.    I ordered the Pan Roasted Chix with asparagus and fennel which was the waiter's recommendation.  The chicken was juicy and tasted fresh but nothing special."}
{"text":"Prefer this place for breakfast/brunch. But all in all great concept and great restaurant. Wonderful ambiance and you can't beat the open kitchen atmosphere. The menu is very healthy with lots of gluten free and vegan options.   Biggest complaint is sometimes their service isn't always the best. Went last night with my fiancé and our waiter complained to us about other costumers which we both found very unprofessional and left us waiting for close to 20 minutes to order.  All in all a wonderful healthy restaurant option - but out of the John Fox concepts, I prefer flower child and the Henry."}
{"text":"Honestly had the best meals of our lives tonight and were super happy and surprised at how much we loved everything. We started with pomegranate limeade and a sparkling wellness tea and both were tart perfection! Ordered a teriyaki kids meal for the kid and it was generous in size and delicious! We all ate some! Service was great and I loved the restaurant itself. Views of the splash pad and very industrial building. Cool patio too. We got turkey burger entree (we never eat turkey burgers) and lasagna. Both very random for us and veered far from our norm but holy shit we are glad we did. The turkey burger was so fresh. So seasoned to perfection. The lasagna. OMG don't get me started. LEMON RICOTTA CHEESE. This is all u need to know so hurry because it's all seasonal."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side, but the TLT is to die for if you're a vegetarian. It's definitely got an air of trendiness and it's a little expensive, but it's good food and a good time, so I can't ding it."}
{"text":"I walked over from the hotel hungry and about 30 mins late...Sean opened the kitchen back up and I had the best turkey lasagna EVER!  Great service, even from a server who should have already been on his way home.  Big props guys, can't wait get back!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting form out of town, this is a must. If you live in Scottsdale, you have already been here.   I have not had a bad item on the menu. The food is always top notch. Only issue has ever been the service.   This can be attributed to high turnover and always being very busy, but the food always seems to bring us back."}
{"text":"I love the open area concept of the interior of the restaurant. There are no obtrusive walls, a lot of natural light, and you can even see the kitchen. Both the east and west sides open up, which was great when I walked in one Sunday afternoon in January while the sun was shining and the air was cool and crisp. On either side of the restaurant are patios where you can either lounge or enjoy your meal. It was a enjoyable spot for me as I waited to be seated.  Our waiter Rodney (very friendly guy) inquired if we were familiar with True Food Kitchen and asked if we would like to know the story behind it; not necessary, but certainly a great, welcoming intro. Before coming in, I eyed the menu available on their website and already knew what I wanted. I had the Grass-fed Bison Burger. I never had bison before, but had always wanted to try it. It was everything I had hoped it would be. The burger was light, but had that wonderful grill flavor. The burger was a little smaller than what I'm use to, but I believe this leaves up to the concept of healthy, but flavorful theme of the restaurant. My sides were diced-sweet potatoes and a salad. First off,  you can rarely go wrong with sweet potatoes. Second, the salad was wonderful; again, it lived up to the theme of the restaurant. I don't completely recall what type of dressing was used, but I'm sure it was some sort of vinaigrette. For desert, I shared a flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The flour-less cake was another first for me and I was intrigued by the idea and it did not disappoint. It wasn't a good idea to share this though as it was gone too soon. Next time, I'm getting one for myself only.  True Food Kitchen is one my new favorites and I'm excited to visit again!"}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks. Noisy but good ambience. Small portions but tasty. Definitely recommend.   Update after Ryan's response:  We will definitely visit again. It was just an observation. We love the place"}
{"text":"Woop!  Yay for TF's super chic patio, interesting drinks and AWESOME healthy food options!  I love it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely  this place !!! I could eat here everyday and still stay fit! Just great taste! Love the crudete!!"}
{"text":"While I still mourn the passing of the most rad Coffee Plantation ever, its replacement, True Foods, is a quite acceptable substitute.   It's based on some cheesy anti-inflammatory diet by some doctor. Yeah - real helpful, I know. I'm sure there's plenty written about it, so why waste your time and mine rehashing it?  I have been to TF a few times. The decor is gorgeous, and I love the outdoor patio. I met a friend there the other night. He was late (tsk, tsk), leaving me sitting by my lonesome on the patio surrounded by cougars and Scottsdaleites. Some staff member - a supervisor, maybe, as he wasn't in uniform - took pity on me and brought a little kale salad for me to nibble on, gratis. How sweet, but..... kale? Um... OK... BUT... dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, toasted bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and chili flakes, kale is KILLER! Who knew? Fresh, clean, and delicious. I'm getting the big version next time.  Our server, like all servers I've had there, was genuine, helpful, and friendly. She brought us a bit of the wine we were interested in, an AZ blend, to sample before committing to a whole bottle. We proceeded to suck down the said bottle, without much further ado.  The menu has a lot of options - and that's coming from a vegetarian with a fungus-phobia. I've had something different every time I've gone, and each has been so very tasty. My favorite is the tofu and brown rice - simple, yet flavorful, and generously portioned, allowing for lunchtime leftovers. My companion got some pasta thing with ahi, maybe? Come on, I was drunk. But he seemed to like it just fine.  So, is True Foods just slightly self-righteous with its sparkly clean offerings and slick decor? Well, OK. Maybe. If you can get past this and the crappy parking situation, you are gold. Your liver might thank you for the healthy meal, but you can go ahead and shush it up with one or four of their signature cocktails. Tons of yum! I will be back."}
{"text":"Been to this Restaurant a couple times for Lunch !  Love the Sashimi Salad, just wasn't big enough!  LOL !  also had the Shrimp Dumplings !  which were pretty good, but would not order that again, the Sashimi Salad is the Best ! Great Servce, will never leave your glass of Green Tea empty !"}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona our friends decided to take us to this restaurant they said served fresh delicious food. They are vegetarian but also said there were meat options too. I was excited to try because I love food and like trying new places. It was a busy Saturday lunch so there was about a 20 minute wait. Once seated on the patio we were promptly greeted by our server Amber. She was one of the friendliest people I met in AZ! She patiently answered all our questions cheerfully and with smiles.   On Amber's suggestion I tried the fish tacos. She made an excellent recommendation as it was quite tasty! Asked Amber what is one of her favorite desserts and she said the Flourless Chocolate Cake was in her top three. She was right again and topped off a perfect meal. If lived in AZ and was remotely close to restaurant I would be here all the time! The menu is expansive and lots of choices and the service by Amber could not have better! Thanks Amber for being friendly, the tasty recommendations and making True Food Kitchen one of our Arizona weekend highlights."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen is the perfect place to stop and have lunch before or after shopping at Scottsdale Quarter! I had the Teriyaki Quinoa Bowl and it was both healthy and delicious. The restaurant has lovely outdoor and indoor seating and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"Overall, True Foods is a nice place to have a sit-down lunch whether by yourself or with company. The food is inexpensive and quite healthy. They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options for customers along with other delicious meat dishes.  I was not very adventurous as this was my first visit to True Foods. I chose to play it safe and got the Margherita Pizza, which was a 10-inch pizza topped with mozzarella, organic tomato, and basil. As a whole, the pizza was alright and the sauce had a special sweet taste to it that I really enjoyed.   The wait may be a little long and service may take longer if you go around lunch time. Definitely give this place a shot if you're looking for good food and healthier options."}
{"text":"There were a couple of vegetarian dishes on the menu. They were expensive and a small portion, but full of flavor. Customers service wasn't great...we were ignored quite a bit. Seating was good.  I haven't been back since the first time...I'm just not that into quinoa and kale."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! A vegetarian person's restaurant heaven. Real, clean ingredients, awesome options and meat/seafood for those that want it. We came for dinner and tried a variety of their juice, lemonade, tonics. Each was a wonderful taste experience and very healthy. For apps my fam ordered the kale guacamole, which was fantastic (I did not have the pita chips as they had gluten). The server did offer me gf pita but the guacamole was almost finished by then. They also had the albacore tataki app that they enjoyed. Everyone ordered a different main and mine was the Mediterranean quinoa salad minus the cheese. It was excellent. The others had the sea bass, Panang curry and poke bowl, which they said was fantastic and flavourful. The panang curry was apparently quite spicy. We finished off with the squash pie and flourless chocolate cake with vegan ice cream. I was so excited that almost every dessert was vegan and gf! To end, my son had the classic chai and hubby had the ginger tulsi tea which he did not like (they took the tea back and did not charge for it. For 4 adults to eat, it cost $159.77 pre tip. The restaurant is open, spacious and trendy. The patio is lovely and the washrooms are clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. PLEASE open a location in Mississauga, ON!!!"}
{"text":"Very limited menu. A bit to \"greenie\" for me. Too much emphasis on sustainable and local, not enough on flavor and presentation."}
{"text":"when i am feeling a health kick coming on, this is the only place to consider in phoenix.  ambiance is great.  really the place inspires you to eat healthy and enjoy it.  love this place.  service is always good, too."}
{"text":"I went with my fiancé and two close friends.  Their menu is delicious and decently priced for what you're getting.  I ordered their turkey burger, which was moist and tender -- the sweet potato hash on the side was flavorful and smoky, which I loved.  I also got to sample my fiancé's chopped salad -- also tasty and fresh!  The hummus was yummy, too, and I love the additions of cucumber, olives, and tomatoes on top.  Our server was gracious and very quick to respond to our requests.  Our waters were filled regularly, and she seemed to really enjoy the business' mission to serve healthy foods -- you could see that in her attitude.    My one and only complaint is that it's hot outside.  It's Scottsdale, so that makes sense, but I would expect a restaurant with so much outside seating to have their misters on and perhaps even some fans to help with air circulation, especially when it's over 95 degrees.  We would have sat inside, but the wait was much longer, so we opted for outside seating.    Still, the experience was a good one, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day.  It has healthy food that is well prepared and has a good presentation.  It is casual and hip,modern and clean.  If you just want healthy food or are a vegan, you can find something for you.  Sit out side if you can.  Walk around the Biltmore Shopping Center.  Bring your kids and they can play on the. Grass."}
{"text":"had the vegan blt and was not impressed. however, the almond cheese bruschetta was incredible. i tried three different handmade drinks and enjoyed each of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary lunch today. The food was great as well as the service. The dessert (crisp) came out a little late so the manager treated us even though we didn't complain. I had the sea bass tacos and my husband had the inside out quinoa burger. Both were great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience here tonight! I called around 5:30 and made a reservation for 8:00 pm because we were going to stop in before going to the airport. Our waitress was super sweet and helpful in regards to us being in a time crunch. She brought our bill out after we ordered so that we would be ready to pay after we ate. I ordered the artichoke roasted tomato garlic pizza topped with herbed cashew ricotta cheese. This pizza was SO yummy. I ate the whole thing and ordered a piece of key lime pie for the road. I enjoyed the key lime pie but wasn't crazy about the crust. Honestly this is an awesome place for vegans and their non vegans or vegan friends/partners/families. I am really glad we came and am sad that we live so far away. Also the water is very bad.... the only bad thing I can say."}
{"text":"I like the food but I don't like the seating. Not comfortable. I had the big veggie bowl with 2 types of hummus as an appetizer and spaghetti squash lasagna. Both delicious! The appetizer was visually very impressive!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! SOOO wish they would put one closer out to where I lived...if so, we'd go there every week. Please come to Queen Creek, Gilbert..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Their food is unique and healthy and it's always fun to try different foods. Their salads with the salmon added are super good. I just wish they were closer to the East Valley."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting a friend, and he suggested we check out True Food Kitchen. At first glance, I was in love. It was an awesome setting - the lights were just dim enough, the kitchen was out in the open, the hostess was friendly. Without one glance at the menu, it had everything I needed to call it a great place.  We ended up sitting at the bar because the wait was long and we were hungry; I'm glad we did. The bartenders were all friendly, but not in a you're-in-my-restaurant-I-have-to-be-nice kind of way. They were genuinely kind, and before we knew it, we were all engaged in a conversation about the name of the Oxy-Clean guy. It's Billy Mays, in case you forgot. The drinks were great (the acai mojito made my life), which was the icing on the cake.  The food was alright. Being from a small town in the Midwest where Applebees is considered fine dining, I was excited to see their menu with just the right amount of options. I wish I would have branched out a little farther than the steak tacos, because I'm sure I was missing out on something better. We split the heirloom tomato & watermelon salad and it was a hit, but aside from that, everything was just alright. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth writing home about. With that being said, it was definitely better than Applebees.  Bottom line? If you value good service and a relaxed atmosphere, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"The presentation of my street tacos was very nice. They tasted very good and the request for the beef to be cooked medium was accomplished. However, I had a large chunk of an avacado pit left in one of my tacos which I bit down on. It was super hard, and could have been an issue if I swallowed it. We brought it to the waitresses attention and she spoke with her manager. They confirmed that it was part of the avacado pit, but they didn't say anything past that. I was dissappointed they did not at least discount the price of the tacos. Other than that, we enjoyed our food and the atmosphere was kind of cool."}
{"text":"A sign of a good restaurant is that I'll become a repeat customer.  True food is a breath of fresh air.  It is healthy and extremely good food.  So far, my favorites are the mushroom ravioli and the curry rice dish.  The portions were perfect and the service was good, but not great."}
{"text":"If I were basing this review on taste alone, I'd give True Food five stars. But this review is based on more than taste. It's based on price, because I'm a broke college student who wants to eat healthy without going bankrupt.  That being said, if you're into the health food scene and enjoy spending $10-$20 on a main dish, this place is for you. Which makes Ture Food a place I ask my mom to take me when she and I go out for brunch.  Many of their dishes are delicious (namely the shaved turkey sandwich, sweet potato hash, and soyrizo breakfast burrito), but could also be re-created at home with a small amount of culinary skill.  I do really respect True Food for also locally sourcing all of their food, and for being vegan-friendly and gluten-free friendly, but there are certainly smaller restaurants around Phoenix where locally-sourced food is offered at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Ah what a lovely place...  I've been here twice already in the past three weeks. The food is fresh, local, unique and delicious. True foods designs their menu with ingredients that are in season, thus everything tastes extremely fresh and flavorful.  They also have a selection of non-alcoholic drinks that are also made to order with fresh fruits and veggies. As far as drinks, I would recommend the medicine man. Kale salad for appetizers (this is not just your ordinary kale salad, this one tastes amazing!) and the chicken sausage/margarita pizza or red chili shrimp entree.   Aside from food, service is also wonderful. In my past two experiences, my two male servers were kind and seemed happy to be there! The restaurant itself is also very pretty, it is modern, clean, colorful and vibrant. I'll definitely be coming back and I would highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"Loved it, wish I had one close to my home. The service was excellent, the food was incredible. We went on Valentines Day at lunch. The restaurant was full but we were seated and serviced quickly. No question this is high quality food prepared with care.  I've been telling all my friends, go please go! We had the Sashimi Salad, Hummus appetizer, Red Chili Shrimp, a drink called the Red Moon and finally a apple cobbler dessert."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and found True Food Kitchen via Yelp - if you are looking for a fresh, healthy menu with abundant options this is a great place to go. Almost embarrassed to admit we came here 3 days in a row. The ancient grains bowl with chicken was by far the best dish we had - very filling and fresh! The kale-aid and lemonade with cucumber were both delicious and refreshing. Would love to have this restaurant in Charlotte, NC!!"}
{"text":"I've only been once but the food was fantastic and service was above average. A bit pricey but worth it. Try the Kale Salad, it's a unique and tasty side or starter."}
{"text":"The food at True Food is good, the problem for me is the value. My boyfriend & I went before an iPic movie because its right there but now we stick to Zinburger just because of the price/amount you get, and we aren't cheap -- we will pay good money for good food. But for a Mediterranean salad with chicken paying $17 is a little bit crazy, especially when I'm still hungry after LOL."}
{"text":"I've been going to True Food since it first opened in the Biltmore years ago. I love all the food and have never been disappointed. It's atmosphere is not especially trendy or modern, but open and fresh which is accurately reflects their menu.  This was the first time it had their brunch and I was not disappointed. I had a soy cappuccino and the chicken sausage scramble. The three of us all split an order of the quinoa pancakes which was probably my favorite part of the meal! They put Greek yogurt on top and it changed the way I view pancakes for life. The scramble was good too but I would have liked a sauce or something on top to put it all together, regardless I still enjoyed it. Hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The staff was not courteous at all. When we pointed out that the table we were asked to sit was dirty, there was hardly any response. It took them 5 minutes to get the table cleaned and we were left to stand near the table. No apology of any sort."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. I had the salmon and keanwa bowl. It was excellent. This was my first experience at this restaurant and the staff helped me through the menu. It was a very tough decision because everything on the menu looked great. When I am back in Phoenix I will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"I wish more restaurants could be like this. We came here for brunch this weekend and enjoyed everything about this place! The service is top notch, more healthy options than not, VERY reasonable prices, and fresh ingredients. What more could you ask for?  The place was shockingly empty at around 10am Saturday morning, but that just meant faster service for us! We were pretty hungry so opted to split the banana, espresso, pistachio, date muffin. It was the just the right size and oh so delicious. I need to figure out how to make those suckers!  I shared the huevos rancheros and the market vegetable scramble. What a perfect combo! The scramble was chock full of veggies and laid on top of a sweet potato hash (basically some finely diced sweet potatoes that seemed to have been sautéed. The huevos was two sunny side up eggs on top of corn tortillas and served with a side of freshly made salsa. There was a light sprinkling of cheese but just enough to see. The spice from the salsa was not too heavy and worked well with the ranchero sauce. I was surprised not to see a side of beans or something. Regardless, it was really good.  We decided to try a quinoa Johnny cake because the server was telling us how good they were. He wasn't kidding. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was plenty big and I couldn't even tell there was quinoa in it...it tasted just like a pancake! On top was a decent sized dollop of Greek yogurt and a few fresh blueberries.  I left stuffed but not in a food coma like way, like i would have felt eating breakfast out somewhere else. I would definitely return for brunch and can't wait to try lunch or dinner there! This restaurant proves you can eat really good food that's HEALTHY! And you can watch them prepare the food from your table to prove it!"}
{"text":"Went to the one located in Scottsdale which was very well recommended by a friend. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. Great fresh ingredients. Everything on the menu looked so good that I'll have to return again just to try a few different items. The edamame dumplings and poke bowl were very good. We also had the flourless chocolate and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I love True Food Kitchen! The space is airy and bright and fun. Our party sat on the patio which was lovely, and shady even in 90 degrees.   We ordered the watermelon salad and mushroom pizza to start and they were both excellent. The portions are perfect - light but filling. Nothing we ordered felt heavy or overwhelming. I had the teriyaki quinoa bowl which is both vegetarian and super yummy! The whole menu is very vegetarian friendly. Don't forget to take a look at the juice and cocktail menu too!   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Refreshing Drinks: Red Moon (grapefruit, agave, yuzu), Medicine Man (antioxidant) The Food We Ordered: ahi sliders, mushroom soup, kale salad, sweet potato mash, raw fish of the day hamachi, natural chicken --- all fantastic. Service: A+ Cleanliness: A++ (open kitchen)  We wish we had a True Food Kitchen near us. We left satisfied and feeling energized and healthy. We will be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere and menu. If you have dietary restrictions, and love food, come here and enjoy.  My wife and I split the artichoke/pesto pizza and turkey burger.  They also had a lavender Collins that my wife loved.  Great bartenders. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cucumber refresher rocks! Great service. Can get busy around dinnertime so get there a little early and put your name on the list. I regret them not being on opentable. It would make reservations much easier"}
{"text":"I used to give this restaurant very high marks based on the deliciousness of one particular dish (the Panang curry with chicken) and one particular cocktail (the skinny margarita). Both were indisputably top shelf. But lately, the service has gone downhill at this location, and they have also altered the way they prepare the dish (which one should never do when one has perfection).  Brought my daughter there last night for dinner and it was very disappointing. After taking our order, our waitress basically abandoned us. We had to flag her down just to get a spoon - never saw her again after that. Asked the server who brought the food to please bring a chopped jalapeno; she never returned and no one brought the item.  When it was time to pack up, we waited forever for some help, and when we finally got someone to attend to us, it took another century to get the process completed. I'm thinking it's a management issue, but I don't know what's going on behind the scenes there.   The Panang curry had a ton of green beans this time, no broccoli (the broccoli was one of the best parts), underdone potatoes, and just wasn't nearly as \"soupy\" as it used to be.   Sad - such a let down. I'll try the True Food over at Scottsdale Quarter soon to see if it's just an issue with the Biltmore location, or it's it's truly time to say goodbye to one of my very favorite meals in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I love how accommodating their menu is for dietary restrictions. We are vegan, and members of our family are nut and gluten free. True Food usually has something everyone can enjoy!  I was so happy to see they put the vegan butternut squash pizza back on the fall menu. It is quite possibly my favorite pizza in town (aside from Bianco's). The vegan ricotta is amazing and the squash crisps up like bacon. It is so good!  The problems we usually have here are seating and service. You have the choice of eating inside, where it is just too loud (especially for my 80 year old mother-in-law) or outside on the patio where it is too hot for 90% of the year. This visit, we tried the patio since it was under 100 degrees out. But, the sun was blazing on our table and the sunshade didn't help much. Our server was very slow in getting to us so I had to find the host to ask for water and to adjust the shade. When the water arrived, there was no ice and we had to ask for it twice before getting it. The server wasn't familiar enough with the menu to answer some of our questions with confidence so some folks at our table got frustrated. She did comp us two deserts though (I had a coupon for one). The food was great, but the overall experience left room for improvement. It's a shame they can't muffle the noise more inside!"}
{"text":"I had lunch with my son recently and I was a bit disappointed.  I had teriyaki quinoa bowl for $14, it was good but I wish the portion could be bigger. I wad kind of still hungry when I walked out the restaurant.  My son had pizza kids menu for $9 and it was good, he liked it."}
{"text":"We tried the lasagna, which was delicious. My husband was amazed that something gluten free could taste so authentic, flavorful, and the right consistency. The veggie sides for the inside out burger were delicious, but the quinoa burger itself was dry. The fish tacos were well-prepared, but not very flavorful and a little bland. They needed something tangy or spicy. Overall, our food was decent but was a little lacking in flavor--the lasagna really stood out though. The service was really friendly, but there were a few hiccups (the food didn't all come out at the same time and it took a few minutes to bring the right silverware)."}
{"text":"Service lacked, 15 min to get water for instance, but  geez, I feel picky even mentioning it as the food is TRUE!  Honeydew ginger honey cooler as a drink is truly amazing.  Margarita with organic tequila an equally as refreshing.  This is a vegetarian food dream place and gluten free capable zone for those in need.  It has high ratings for a reason and although this general dining environmental surrounding (mall-like) isn't my thing it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"True Food is my favorite \"go to\" restaurant for fresh healthy fare. Love the kale salad, lasagna, and spaghetti squash casserole. Kale Aid is my favorite drink and chai seed pudding is amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered the tuna salad which was a very small portion and lacked all of the greens this place raves about.  My wife's dish was a curry with the rice already mixed in that was like more of a soup.  The service and ambiance was the reason this place received a 3 star rating from me.  I did like the high ceilings and clean lively scene."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I don't know where to begin. The staff and the servers are really welcoming and nice. We had one guy sit us that took our drinks but then left for another server to serve us. The food was delicious. I've tried the tacos, the pizza, the salads, and a bunch of their drinks. No complaints at all. They all seemed fresh and healthy. I love how the menu offered in season items as well. For the drinks I recommend the medicine man. For the salad definitely the Tuscan kale. The entree I loved the pizza. Don't forget dessert too. My partner and I loved the chocolate cake. Lastly, don't forget to get your token validated so you park for free! Overall, great dining experience and left feeling satisfied. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Love the dedication to innovative, healthy, plant-based food options!  Server recommended charred cauliflower starter - it was deeelish.  Quinoa teriyaki bowl with tofu is great, and the tempeh BBQ sandwich is also a win!  We come here frequently and always enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was great, as always (see Biltmore review).  The only warning I would give is, don't go here if you aren't prepared to be there a while. We got in around 8, had plans to meet people at 9, and didnt get out until 945. Our order wasnt taken until 820 and we waited almost an hour for our food and it was NOT busy."}
{"text":"Food is really good here, trendy decor, friendly staffs. Variety of healthy dishes, fresh ingredients. Love the wrap and taco Hangover Rx is also amazing. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line-  Consistently good healthy food!   I have visited here over a dozen times and typically walk away feeling full, but not overly so.  I love the organic drink menu and if you are in the mood, the organic vodka ;) Place is veggie, vegan, and gluten-free friendly.  Service is a little scattered at times, but nothing notably bad.  The sunday brunch is also excellent.  The mock chorizo is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this chain when I lived in the DC area and was so pleased to see there were locations in Arizona, too. Amazingly fresh, delicious and healthful food. It was jam packed at lunch so reservations are needed unless you want to take your chances on a wait. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the ingredients and was very patient with our group while we were ordering. Everything was brought out exactly as requested. The honey lemonade with matcha is one of my favorite drinks and the TLT sandwich is so filling. The kale salad is a must! It's got this tart and lemony dressing that I just crave. Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  I have been to True Food twice now, once for breakfast and once for dinner and both meals were excellent.   The dinner was the standout for sure. The boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. It's a popular place so we expected to wait (and we did).  When we were seated we were immediately greeted by our server, I think his name was John, who was great from beginning to end.   I ordered the teriyaki bowl with chicken and boyfriend ordered the bison burger. I loved my rice bowl. It was loaded with broccoli, snap peas, green beans and chicken. It also had avocado on top which was surprisingly a great addition to the dish. I enjoyed every bite of this dish.  Boyfriend enjoyed his bison burger but it could have used a little more cheese. They serve sweet potato hash instead of fries which is very good as well.  For desert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Small but rich. Very fudgy and yummy.  I can't wait to try more dishes at True Food. Open a location in Tempe, please!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is healthy yet tasty. What a great combo.  Some highlights:  Edamame Dumplings - excellent balance of flavors. Light, not soggy, just a perfect dumpling.   Grilled Shrimp Spring Roll - love that they use soba in these. the sauce it comes with is also great.  Mediterranean Chopped Salad - lots of quinoa - more than i expected. all in all, a good salad you can easily eat as a main.   Shiratake Noodes - first, i cant believe i found a place that serves these noodles. second, shiratake noodles are hard to season but True Foods does the trick. The curry has a god kick to it and this dish is by far my favorite.  Service can use a little work, but the food here is fantastic."}
{"text":"I feel like this is a trendy \"it\" type place. If you like to be seen, pay a lot for so so food, and be crowded in the place; you'll love it. The kale salad I had was good but nothing you couldn't make at home. My fiance had a chicken dish that was extremely bland. The portion size was good and the juices were excellent. We say at the bar and were cramped on top of each other. I don't know that I'd go back for the food but would for the juice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale!!! I've ordered something different every time and am never disappointed. The atmosphere on the outside area is beautiful!! Sit outside if you can! Katherine, my waitress was amazing!!! She helped me and I ordered the Edamame Dumplings, which were so freaking good!!! I would've never noticed them. I also had the Mediterranean Salad adding salmon and avocado. Katherine's suggestion w a little add ins. Order it that way--your welcome!! So good and fresh!!! I would eat here everyday if there was one near me. It's the best!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing .... it's lick the plate good. Love the bar area. Good people watching. Wonderful staff.  Great wine list."}
{"text":"Eating at True Food Kitchen really pissed me off. Everything we ate was amazing. Lettuce wraps. Onion tart. Panang curry. Apple and goji berry crisp. Everything was was really very good.  What pisses me of is that not enough restaurants do what True Food Kitchen does: they serve mostly local food which is actually nutritious food. There are no fries or Coke.  It's just annoying that I have to travel from Chicago to eat this well. Rumor has it they are coming to Chicago, and that's great. But ALL  restaurants should be doing what TFK does and it makes it hard to eat the unhealthy stuff almost everywhere else."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some tasty and healthy food look no further. TFK offers excellent fare for the vegetarian or pescetarian alike.  My wife and I have been to TFK on many occasions including birthday parties for friends, group outings and entertaining out of town visitors.  The service and food quality is always very good.  We especially love the Ahi Tuna Sliders and highly recommend the Sweet Potato Hash and Kale Salad side.  We have tried every seafood dish on the menu and they have never failed to satisfy.  The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star experience is the price to portion size ratio.  The food is flavorful and healthy, but each entree will probably just fill you up and are not good for sharing unless you're not very hungry.  However for special occasions this place is high on my list!"}
{"text":"Clean food options are here at this joint! Order a salad with shrimp, a vegetarian appetizer, or some freshly made juice and teas. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a healthy option. The service is pretty friendly. I do have to say the food does take a bit longer than I would like. But, hey it's probably because they don't pre-make/ cook things in advance. They probably just have the raw ingredients prepped and ordered up once ordered.   I eat here pretty often. After each meal I've had here I never feel sluggish. There's no after meal food coma. The food is energizing."}
{"text":"This place is a health food nuts dream come true. Not my first time at this location nor other locations. This is however my favorite as it is at the biltmore, nice ambiance and friendly staff. Our server was very nice and friendly, and made lots of good suggestions. I started with a pomegranate chia limeade which was very refreshing and surprisingly delicious. For my meal, I ordered the seasonal ingredient salad. This was very very very tasty. The ingredients were Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, butternut squash pomegranate, white beans and the surprise ingredient, toasted mulberry all mixed in with horseradish vinaigrette.  HOLY molly this was a great salad. The one disappointing thing in this meal was the portion comparing it to the price. I hope they increase it as I loved every bite of it and would like to try it again when I go there."}
{"text":"Have only ever eaten at True Food kitchen for dinner but found out today they do a brunch. Enjoyed the breakfast burrito with fresh salsa and sweet potato hash. Love the concept of this restaurant with delicious healthy options!"}
{"text":"So I went here last night for a first date and I knew this would be the place he would pick since he seemed kind of hippie-ish.  I was a little wary of this place because of the Yelp reviews, but you're supposed to be open on first dates and all that bs.  I arrive there first, I always do this so I can get a drink in before the date arrives.  Always important to pregame just in case they don't drink or are that awful that you need more drinks to handle them.  But I digress...so I go up the \"bar\" (if you can call it that) and get a Red Moon with vodka.  Really tasty, but I don't need the bartender going over how sustainable their liquors are.  You have MGD on the menu!!!  My date arrives and we head over the table to be greeted by a perky little blond named Kristen.  She was sweet, advised we do the restaurant week menu.  We did, and within moments our hummus arrived.  The hummus was good.  I liked the feta and olives in it.  Then came the first course of the summer salad for me and the edamame dumplings for him.  Again they were good, nothing spectacular yet...  Entrees were next.  I ordered the steak tacos and my date ordered the cod.  So this is where it gets interesting.  I'm all for being green, but I hate when businesses or people act like they are enviromentally friendly because it's the thing to do.  My date had chopsticks for the dumplings and was told he would need them again for cod.  When they took his plate away I jokingly called to the manager who took the plate that he needed the chopsticks and throwing them away wasn't environmentally friendly.  Damn!  Did I get the nastiest look back from him!  Then when we receive our entrees the second manager, Kent, comes over and my date asks him if he returns the freshly unwrapped chopsticks would they go back to the bin so another patron could use them.  This confused and disgusted Kent at the same time.  How dare we ask to put unused chopsticks (STILL IN WRAPPER!) back into the bin instead of wasting them?!  At this point he subtly rips them, hands them back to my date and says he can't return them to the bin.  This whole situation was hilarious for me.  I couldn't believe my date did that and then the manager's actions as well were unbelievable.  They really believe in sustainability.  The rest of the meal was just okay from there.  The steak tacos were bland.  And the lemon olive oil cake I had was just okay.  It was cold, and I like my olive oil cake served at room to warmer temperatures.  FYI for the \"sustainable and environmentally friendly\" restaurant eating buffalo is better than eating beef for the environment.  http://www.sunset.com/food-wine/flavors-of-the-west/bringing-bison-back-00400000019838/  Try adding it to your menu!"}
{"text":"OMG, I can't WAIT to go back again...NOT!!!  The food was not memorable, the service was not attentive AND on top of it the seating is ridiculous close, I could of reached over and shared his food!  BUT, for some reason Sam is opening a second True Food at Scottsdale Quarter...!?   Me thinks, wait for that one and give it a try again..."}
{"text":"This is a very unique dining spot. It is intended to get you a healthy, nutritional alternative to the crap you eat everyday... Or not if you are a total health nut.  Get the watermelon salad and drink their juices.  I liked the Pad Thai I ordered, it was a new experience for me."}
{"text":"The place to be for a health conscious vegetarian, although there are many non-veggie options.   THE GOOD: Location, ample garage parking and consistent delivery. Menu changed a little since my last visit (been a while). Tried the quinoa \"burger\" it was delicious. \"Buns\" made from quinoa with veggie filling. Ordered with 1/2 sweet potato hash and 1/2 kale slaw. Perhaps one of the best things I've eaten at True Foods.  THE AVERAGE: No reservations and a 20 minute wait, even for lunch on a weekday at 1:15 p.m. Also with quinoa being the hot addition to anything from food to drinks I had to deal with post-dishwasher quinoa floaties in both my water glass and the water pitcher (the waitress should have noticed this). Sent them back for fresh ones.  Ask to sit outside vs. inside (they have well-placed heaters). You can't have a decent conversation indoors due to sound overload.   Overall good experience and good food, needs a little more attention to detail."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, for family dinners, date nights, and even business lunches. The atmosphere is peaceful and the restaurant is clean. I have sat at the bar, the high-top, and the tables and all have had equal service and comfort levels.   Now, onto the important part, the food! My favorite dish, and always my go-to when I can't make up my mind is the spaghetti squash casserole. It comes in a little ramekin, which I thought was a small portion size, but it actually filled me up. I ordered extra cheese (cheese lover here) and added shrimp, both accommodations they were easily able to handle. The sauce on this dish is absolutely AMAZING. I do not typically care for marinara, but this was so fresh and seasoned perfectly that I ended up licking the plate. Yum! Another entrée I have had was the shrimp curry, the blend of spices is out of this world, and the teriyaki bowl (not as much as a fan). Backtracking to appetizers, the vegetable board is insane! I prefer the seasonal board, which is filled with roasted vegetables rather than raw. There were Brussel sprouts (the highlight of the evening!), squash, mushrooms, beets, carrots, and more. Accompanied with the vegetables were three different dips, my favorite was actually had a  cashew base which was perfect for the rest of my dairy-free family. Now for dessert, The flourless chocolate cake is obviously going to be a winner, I mean how can you go wrong with chocolate?! But surprisingly, I liked the chia pudding more. Shredded coconut and fresh bananas really elevated this simple concept.    Overall, True Food is filled with fresh food that is constantly changing due to seasonal options. I have never left unsatisfied, and cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Better than i imagined.  I had the summer tomato pizza..Sooo good. Also had the Mediterranean salad. Both amazing. had a hangover rx drink...added vodka of course :) service was incredible. Staff knew menu inside out. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love this place, but their service is horrible. Food is great, healthy, great flavor. The delay between ordering food and actually serving it needs improvement. Not coming back for awhile. Hopefully management sees this and improves this aspect."}
{"text":"I enjoyed True Food's organic and healthy menu, and with a daiy-free diet it was easy to substitute goat cheese into my meal. It is easy for your bill to add up quickly, but if you & your date just order an entree, salad & water, it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"The food tastes very fresh, excellent appetizers and seasonal menu.  Great outdoor seating atmosphere and healthy menu options."}
{"text":"What a great new dining place! The food & drinks have a locally grown, fresh, organic theme. Our party of 8 sampled a little of everything. They have a nice selection of refreshing beverages, particularly liked the Medicine Man with Pomegranate juice, blueberries & black tea. Everything had a satisfying taste,  yet you didn't feel uncomfortably full. We were seated at a long wooden dining table, with unique extras - like the dish towel napkins and fun chairs. The decor is terrific - high ceilings, great wall colors, over sized unique light fixtures.  The dinner team from hostesses, to wait staff and kitchen support all have great complimentary outfits - working as a one unit, which translates to quick, efficient customer service. The acoustics do not allow for a intimate conversations, the atmosphere is open and has a good energy buzz. Another nice showing for the Fox restaurant group."}
{"text":"I will update this review to 4.5 - 5 stars.  Convinced by some friends to go back.  Service was QUICK and pleasant!  They bent over backwards to cater to my food allergies.  What a great experience!  DEFINITELY worth it!"}
{"text":"True Foods is truely yummy!   I FINALLY went here last night after hearing from tons of friends how great this place was. Love the way it is designed! I seriously want one of those huge wood tables in my house, and reallllly had to stop my self from rolling off with one of those cute planters!   We started off with some hummus. It was mighty tasty, but just like other restaurants that serve hummus ::cough cough pitajungle:: they never give you enough pits for all the hummus. I loved the addition of onions and olive and cucumber to the mix.   I also had the \"soda\" of the day. A strawberry rhubarb concoction. It was very refreshing.   For dinner I had the farmers market salad. Sooooo good! So Fresh! loved the peas and asparagus pieces in it.   For dessert we split the strawberry rhubarb crisp! I didnt even feel bad about getting dessert, it was so light and fresh!   I will for sure be going back here, just wish it was a few bucks less a plate! Also the staff is all really weird and overly overly nice."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation of a coworker who used to live in the area. Great place for healthy sustainable, guilt free good food. The wait was a little long as I am sure we got overlooked in the crowd of people, but our waitress and the food made up for the mishap. I had the red chili noodles; great flavor, spice and presentation. Others in my party (correct menu item names not included) had chicken salad , curry and quinoa with tofu. All dishes were great from each person in the group. We also shared the kale guacamole, tasty. I did not enjoy the honey lemonade, but could be a taste preference. Our sever was phenomenal, attentive, friendly and had great suggestions; although that was not helpful, in a good way as we couldn't decide on what to eat! Good all around. Will be back and will look for their other locations."}
{"text":"I visit Scottsdale 2-3X a year, so when my girlfriend suggested we meet a TrueFood she was shocked I hadn't been there. When I saw the crowds at this place, I was shocked too.   I wanted to LOVE True Food Kitchen. Its a fantastic concept. And I was really excited to be eating whole, healthy foods at a restaurant. My first visit, we had the crudite. It was gorgeous. And tasty. And there was so much of it. I let myself indulge though because, well, it was VEGGIES. But my body was revolting, so I had to go with the hamburger for lunch. NOT the Turkey Burger - the Bison Burger. It was very good.   My next visit (yes, twice in a week. Crazy, huh?!)  was somewhat unforgettable. I don't remember what I had.   Both times, the service was \"good.\" Once it was great. I the atmosphere is very nice.   The thing is, something was missing. I wasn't in love. I don't know, maybe I need a little fried food in my life. Or bacon. Everything was spot-on and yet...I'm just not crazy about it. I feel like there are so many other restaurants in the neighborhood that I love that I doubt I'll be back.   But don't let that stop you from going. Lots of people seemed to love it."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Tasty, nutritious, and healthy food as well as great atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I lived in Scottsdale I would be here every week. The flavors of the noodles were sooo good. We subbed sweet potatoes for the mushrooms, and they came charred and delicious. It really brings out the sweetness. I've read negative reviews about the charred sweet potatoes, but I didn't think the flavor overpowered the rest of the meal. The chia pom lemonade was great and had the perfect amount of chia seeds."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, friendly knowledgeable staff and yummy menu! Highly recommend the vegetable crudités with hummus and tzatziki. The presentation is amazing, a beautiful arrangement of fresh vegetables. We also had the Mediterranean salad with quinoa and gluten free pizza. The gluten free pizza was good but not my favorite gluten free crust. Overall, fabulous restaurant for high quality food! We always leave feeling energized from the great food!"}
{"text":"Great vegan and vegetarian options!  Everything we had was delicious, staff was friendly and attentive, decently priced wine list too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I eat here atleast twice per week.  The staff is friendly and the food is great.  For lunch, try the shaved turkey and at dinner go for the steak teriyaki."}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't reviewed this spot yet. I've been here a few times and am always satisfied with the food and the service. Today we sat outside on the patio in the afternoon and although it was humid, there was enough wind to keep us cool, plus it was covered so there was no direct sun. It was fairly busy and the inside seating had a 30 min wait, hence the reason we sat outside.   The menu seems to change on a frequent basis, every time I go I see new creations and dishes. I ordered the inside out quinoa burger, which comes with a side of kale salad and/or sweet potato hash (I got half and half). Everything tasted great and they brought out some chili paste when I asked for it. My friend enjoyed her fish tacos and drink. Our waitress was perfectly friendly and attentive and it was a nice outing. Conveniently located in Scottsdale Quarter where you can walk around and do some shopping afterwards."}
{"text":"Amazing! We had the spaghetti squash and turkey lasagna and both were awesome!!! Can't wait until they open one in Bellevue, WA!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. It's healthy, it's delicious, tons of organic options. You just FEEL GOOD going here. The spaghetti squash casserole is really good, so is the Panang Curry with tofu...but my favorite thing is the kale salad with grilled chicken. It's refreshing, light, lemony, just all around good. I think I could eat it for lunch every single day and not get sick of it. Everything on the menu looks so good it's hard to decide what to get! Good red wine selection (very important) and lots of good juice options, I tried a kale one the last time I was there. Definitely not cheap though. I'm sure I'd eat here a lot more if it wasn't so pricey. But definitely worth it every once in a while- you're paying for the quality of the healthy organic food."}
{"text":"Salads are great. Just had an autumn salad and cannot stop thinking about it! Of course, their kale salad is famous, and for good reason. I sampled friend's quinoa pancakes and they were incredible.   Tuna sliders: awesome.   I'll say mimosas were meh. Switched to champagne & cranberry and it was better.   Service was incredible, as usual!"}
{"text":"So been back since my unexpected experience and walks! Reprieve!  I had to go back, love the food options. Waiter was courteous and service was great!  Appetite arrived before entrée Yeay! Actually two visits before update of review and all is well. Thank you!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite spots...can't think of any food i have had that was bad. Really love the pizzas and starters...super good. Will definitely be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great location. Great staff with the exception of management. Management could learn a thing or two from the waiters and waitresses. They are always quite pleasant unlike management. However, if you are looking for delicious, healthy food you should look no further. I crave the Kale salad from time to time because it's that darn good! They are even pet friendly so your furry family member can dine with you. It is often a waiting list but there are plenty of shops in walking distance to help you kill time. I would love to give this place 5 stars but the management is less than mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm the new Vegan on the block, I can't say enough about this place and the level of service by the lovely Desirae (Damn Daniel... back at it again with that top notch service). Once more, thanks Yelp for letting me know about this place and to all my fellow Yelpers."}
{"text":"Pierce was a great server! I had the kale guac and the half portion of the ancient grains bowl with steak. I understand why people go nuts for this place, it was amazing. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went for arizona food week. Kinda disappointing. The heirloom tomato, watermelon salad was good. The salmon was dry. The key lime pie was gelatinous. On the menu it said it had blue berry's with it, it did not. When questioned I was told it was a misprint. I cant say. I was not impressed and probably wont be back."}
{"text":"What a place?! Amazing fresh, tasty food. All kinds of juices. Nice clean interior. Service was slow.  Can't wait until they open up in my city."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and go here frequently, but I can't give it 5 stars only because too many times service has been painfully slow.  We are usually okay with the slow service because it gives me time to enjoy my two favorite things. But, sometimes it will test my patience.  On to my favorites: First, the appetizer, which in my case is always the Crudites.  It is basically a massive bowl of raw vegetables served over ice.  It does not sound exciting but it is the most gorgeous bowl of raw vegetables that you will ever see!  The veggies are seasonal, so they vary, and often they will include something unrecognizable, yet vibrantly purple, and it's just not often enough in life that I get to think, \"Hmm, what is this purple thing I am putting in my mouth?\"  My second favorite thing is some fabulous drink called the Skinny Cucumber Citrus Margarita. Since it is \"skinny\" and since there is plenty of time before the food arrives, you can drink two of these drinks. Or three, if you are a little crazy and not driving.  It is muddled cucumber, oranges and mint (heck, this makes it almost healthy!) and topped with a little carbonation.  It is just so good, I wish I was drinking one right now. My husband always gets a beer, feels a little disappointed when it comes out of a can, but then likes it and orders a second, too.  The food is good  and the menu is seasonal.  The kids' pizza is HUGE but all the adult servings are normal.  The kale salad that comes with the burgers is best if it is taken in the same bite as the sweet potato hash (that also comes on the side). The sweetness helps cut the bitterness.  The waiters are cute and I recommend sitting outside!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for healthy, clean eating. The service is always fantastic here. The food is fresh, unique and locally sourced.  My two go-to's are the grilled veggie board (in season) and the edamame dumplings. Regardless what you order, you need to start with one of those! The bison burger is also really good and the squash soup is to die for."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the grass-fed burger with kale salad side.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Nice place.  We will be back."}
{"text":"So the food is pretty good. I got the all grain bowl which was tasty and my husband got the beef tacos which he liked. I got the flan for dessert (yuk!) and the cappuccino (good!) it's more like sitting at your kitchen table which didn't seem to mirror the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place was great, with super atmosphere and service.  We really enjoyed our meal and was super healthy."}
{"text":"Fewer plant-based (vegan) options now and no more chocolate pudding!?  Boooo.  We'll be back, but if the menu slips any more into the mainstream, we will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"As of this review (September 2017), there are currently a whopping 23 True Food locations across eleven states - which often has me surprised that the millennial crowd isn't more quick to dismiss TFK as an evil chain. But at the same time, it almost seems to be tailored made for Yelp, as users generally seem to rave about places that cater towards the vegan/vegetarian/anti-gluten crowd. And believe me, True Food is definitely one of those places that seems to be targeting all of the people that simultaneously developed food allergies around 2009. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.  TFK has been on our bookmark list for years. We've passed by this particular Biltmore location many times, but have always put off going there for various reasons. For one, it looks like the kind of place I'd eat at if I just had a coronary bypass and forced to drastically modify my diet. Additionally, as I've mentioned in practically every Fox concept restaurant I've ever tried - I just can't bring myself to look past the whole hip-corporate vibe that just feels so damned sterile and uninspiring.  But when the mood is right and if I choose my menu items very carefully, Fox Concepts can actually deliver a decent meal. And this is one of those instances where I'm willing to openly admit that the food here is actually respectable.  Although the menu isn't really my style, there are thankfully some options for people like myself who still eat meat and don't count calories. The menu appears to be seasonal for summer (even though it's now Fall). I'm guessing they have several main staples that are permanent, while rotating out other items that are only available at certain times of the year.  I ordered myself a honey lemonade and my girlfriend and I split some of their kale guacamole. The lemonade was a bit weaker than I like - although I didn't really expect to find the diabetic coma-level lemonade that can be obtained at a place like Matt's Big Breakfast. The guac was just okay, but a bit too new-age for my taste buds. Neither one of us were impressed with the chips.  For my main entrée, I ordered the grass-fed burger which had a nice flax seed bun. Meat was good quality and my girlfriend and I both agreed that it was actually superior to the burgers served at the nearby Fox-owned Zinburger, which is kind of funny. Mine came with kale salad and some sweet potato hash. The hash was dry and bland, while the kale was fine, but not really my style.  My girlfriend ordered the steak tacos, which naturally, also get the grass-fed buzzword status. Joking aside, the tacos were also good quality, having great-tasting meat and including some avocado, greek yogurt, and cilantro. They're full-size tacos (two) and come with a small bowl of decent beans.  For dessert, I found most of their choices a bit lame, but given the way the menu is developed, I kind of expected this. We opted for the chia seed pudding, which included coconut and banana. Neither one of us had had tried chia seed pudding before, so I'll at least give them some credit for exposing us to something different. It's an overall light dessert that still tasted satisfying on the level of a smoothie.  The question is: Would we ever come back?  Honestly, some day, we probably will. Although I maintain that this food isn't really something I'd regularly crave, I can easily see why it's very popular with all the urban locals. Out of all of the Fox Concepts restaurants we've tried, this is easily one of the better ones out there.  I'd definitely recommend it, but it appears that we're basically the last people in Phoenix to actually try it."}
{"text":"Always consistent. 2nd best lettuce cups in the valley. Fancy drinks!"}
{"text":"I am gluten free, so I find no greater joy in life than picking up a menu and seeing the \"gf\" symbol next to items I can indulge in.  I ordered the spinach and turkey lasagna and it was a dream come true.  Our super friendly waitress explained that they use a spinach noodle that is completely gluten free!  It came in a rustic dish that I wanted to take home with me and was cheesy, robust and delicious.  My friend ordered a gluten free pizza which was also a hit.     I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Well this very busy lunch place is amazing find food considerations able. Sitting at bar with pomegranate lime drink and asked for fennel chicken pizza. And all was excellent here, and I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"I just love Sam Fox and all of his foodie goodness! True Food Kitchen, the latest to come from Fox Restaurant Concepts and Dr. Andrew Well of the Oprah fame, certainly lives up (and possibly surpasses) the fame of it's sister restaurants.   The menu consists of all Natural/ organic foods with a healthy twist. The servers are even wearing \"natural clothes\" that actually look like pajamas!   I ate quick and wish I had time to really dive into the menu, but what I had... I loved! My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna burger and said \"it was the best ahi burger he has ever had\" (BOLD STATEMENT). I had the Turkey Spaghetti Bolognese, which was amazing! The bolognese had chucks of carrots and other vegetables, and the portion size was perfect. We definitely wanted to try the Sashimi appetizer, that the table next to us said was delicious and fresh.   Overall, the service was excellent- they really were interested in if we enjoyed our experience and had any comments for the new serving team. I loved the menu, it was so different and not outrageously priced. It's clear that a lot of research went in to everything from the decor to the wine selection.   I'm looking forward to getting into the menu a bit more next time!!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooo nice going out to eat and not having a stomach ache afterwards  I ordered the trout (fabulous) others at the table had the burger, poke, and crudités. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Major win."}
{"text":"True food is my absolute favorite restaurant anytime I visit a state that has one we go out of the way to eat there! I found my favorite wine there Snoqualmie, you can barely find that in a liquor store let alone in a restaurant! Their food is so fresh and their menu continues to change and offer so many awesome fresh dishes! Please just build one in Utah!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place!  We got appetizers and they were great - the miso soup and raw fish.  Both were really good and everything was off to a good start.  We ordered the entrees and got them in adequate time.  I had the spicy shrimp which was good, but honestly wasn't worth the price.  My boyfriend got the bison burger which he loved, but the portion was too small, again, especially for the price.  We decided we wanted dessert, however, our server had seemed to be slowly forgetting we were even there.  We finished the entrees and waited for the server so we could order dessert.  And waited.  And waited.  I literally watched this guy bustle around the entire restaurant, out onto the patio dining, back and forth, SEVERAL times.  It really looked like he completely forgot we were there.  Finally, after 10 minutes of waiting he came over and we said we wanted dessert.  He only had one menu on him and gave it to us.  We decided on our desserts and then once again waited for him to come back.  And waited.  AND WAITED.  Now, actually getting the dessert once the order was in was another disaster.  In total we probably waited for 30+ minutes just to order and receive our dessert.  He even comped the dessert because the kitchen had taken so long to get it out.  Absolutely ridiculous.  It looked like the server did a whole lot of running around and no actual work.  Worst dining experience ever - and that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I was really surprised to see the accolades from other Yelpers about True Food.  I have been waiting for this restaurant to open as I am a huge Andrew Weil fan and love the Sam Fox restaurants in Scottsdale.  The menu is terrific, the service was great, the ambiance was unique (the prep tables and kitchen are both in the dining room), but the food was a huge disappointment.  My husband and I sat on the patio at a corner table which was delightful.  Our server, Christina, was a amazing, but that only earned the place two stars.  My disappointment began with the water which tasted salty and like dishwater (not that I've ever tasted dishwater, but this is what I would imagine the taste to be).  Next was the hummus, which tasted, salty.  My husband ordered the salmon which, you guessed it, tasted salty.  I, on the other hand did enjoy the butternut squash ravioli.  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake which would have been so much better if it had been heated and if the ice-cream with which it was served had the remote taste and texture of ice-cream.  To the credit of management, we were refunded price of the hummus and salmon.  When we left the restaurant, I looked deep into my husband's eyes and whispered softly, I don't think we'll be back here for dinner again."}
{"text":"I love True Food Kitchen - There is nothing better or should I say more reassuring than walking into a restaurant and seeing a kitchen that is full of beautiful and fresh produce! Such an amazing concept to have an open kitchen that allows patrons to see their food being prepared fresh! It has such a great vibe and a big reason alone I love this place! I know that when I dine at True Food Kitchen that I will be not only getting really fantastic food, but I know that it's fresh!   Their menu is full of fresh and seemingly healthy options - and It's all great tasting too! The several times I have been here I usually opt for a Kale Aid juice, which is freshly juiced and might I add delicious concoction of  Kale, Apple, Cucumber, Celery, Lemon & Ginger. It reminds me of a drink that I used to get at Pressed Juicery in Malibu CA! The Edamame Dumplings are fresh and tasty - the only criticism I would give is that the truffle oil really over powers the beautiful flavor of the edamame, I think in the future I would opt for the dumplings minus the Truffle Oil.  But the absolute best thing on the menu would be the Panang Curry! It rivals some of my favorite and might I add authentic Thai joints in Los Angeles....  it's full of Brown Rice, Potato, Broccoli, Ginger, Carrot, Mushroom & a beautiful and flavorful Coconut Shellfish Broth.   It's a great addition to the Arizona food scene and if your in the area and looking for a healthy and casual but still trendy option, True Food is for you!"}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, it's hard to go wrong with a Fox Concept, but True Food is top 3 for me.  The menu is ever changing, with seasonal items added frequently. As someone with Celiac Disease, I am very conscious of what I eat. For me, restaurants that have menus with healthy options are terrific, but True Food takes it to a whole new level! The ingredients are fresh, healthy, anti-inflammatory and they have so many Vegan, Vegetarian, and Gluten Fee options. Adding to that, the wait staff is very knowledgeable about ingredients and modifications.  True Food is on the higher end, price wise for a FRC, but the quality makes that understandable. Aside from that, my only complaint is the staff can seem inattentive or unavailable at times, to where you're flagging someone down just for water."}
{"text":"Interesting concept. Excellent service. Seating was uncomfortable. Expensive for what was served. Food wasn't bad. No happy hour menu. Parking is problematic. Location is ideal for an after dinner walk in the Biltmore shopping mall where the restaurant's located."}
{"text":"Healthy eating always tastes good.  True Foods Kitchen is one of my sister's favorite eatery and now having a chance to try their food I see why she loves it.   Had the opportunity to try a couple of the refreshing drinks and they all are equally tasty.  Started our meal with some simple pita and hummus. And tried the Open Faced Moroccan Chicken Salad and that did not disappoint. The chop sweet potatoes sides was delicious. My sister couldn't get enough of it. It was definitely a delightful meal. The ingredients tasted fresh too, just as promised.  Service was great. Our server was attentive in refilling our waters, teas and pita bread when needed. I like the layout of the restaurant. There's ample seating without feeling cluttered and somewhat of the kitchen is visible."}
{"text":"I love eating here. I eat here all the time because it's near my work. It's so healthy. Everything on the menu is good for you, and they make popular comfort food dishes that are healthy. I think the food is consistently good since I eat here probably once every 2 weeks. I love the turkey burger and the salmon sandwich."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the food was so good I ate here twice in one day. Very simple, clean, but elegant pairings with the freshest ingredients around. I had the edamame dumplings and the farmer's market salad for lunch. The dumplings were more like ravioli with a bit of truffle oil - some of the best I've had. I really would have been happy with an entire plate of these for my meal! The salad was fresh and crisp, and an interesting combination of ingredients - golden beets, kale, romaine, manchego cheese, avocado, with a light champagne vinagerette.   Later, I ordered the thai dumplings and steelhead salmon for dinner. The dumplings were good, but not as good as the edamame dumplings from lunch. The salmon was cooked perfectly - good sear on the outside, and moist on the inside - all on top of a bed of beets, greens, and red quinoa.   Price is a bit of a drawback here, but I suppose you pay for what you get when it comes to the calibur of the ingredients. I don't live in AZ, but a True Food just opened in Denver where I live - can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is solid 4.5 stars. Really excellent, health conscious, inventive and flavorful food. The service (Matt) was also top notch, he offered suggestions and was very attentive and friendly. I had the bison short rib which was delicious and filling yet not heavy. I think the price point on the food is actually fairly reasonable considering quality and portions. However the beverages seemed rather over priced to me. Teas at 5 bucks a pop seems a bit much. That being said both alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage were creative and I did go for the $6 medicine man which to be fair was quite good. I will definitely come back again and keep my fingers crosses for one to open in SD."}
{"text":"I frequent here quite a bit and my experience is always great. However, tonight went above and beyond my expectations. My best friend and I came to celebrate her recent engagement. Our waiter, Jake, was phenomenal! He was so kind, engaging, and really happy for my best friend. He took fantastic care of us. Thanks Jake for being so great!"}
{"text":"Very nice menu of seasonal items. Healthy options here, and decent variety. Apple carrot ginger tonic was outstanding. Sweet potato hash was fantastic. Nice stuff large outdoor patio, overall really nice place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Thank you, True Foods, for giving me a healthy eating option."}
{"text":"Fun place!  I just wish the wait on the weekends was shorter.  Yummy roasted veggie salad with pistachios and golden beets, yummy ahi sliders, chicken dishes and vegetarian options.  The wine list rocks too!  Great organic wines for CHEAP.  And the elixers they make in house are pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"This place have the Best skinny margarita drink and food are all delicious!!!!  I ate practically everything on my bowl and plates no take home that how good  it is!!!!  I'm a foodies I love good and healthy foods!  Top on that is they have the BEST friendly servers and I love bartender Ally she made amazing drinks and great personality"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. They use healthy ingredients and have seasonal menu items too. Makes going there even more exciting. The chicken sausage pizza is my favorite. Oh & great drinks too might I add. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic"}
{"text":"A really fun experience with really good, forward-thinking food and menu. It didn't quite deliver on value, but I would definitely return to make sure."}
{"text":"My picks:  Cucumber-Clementine Skinny Margarita House Smoked Salmon Sustainable Sea Bass Banana Chocolate Tart  This new location within The Scottsdale Quarter is gorgeous.  The outdoor seating is amazing and the food is another Sam Fox masterpiece!"}
{"text":"For clean eating, I love coming to True Food's!  It's a open, friendly atmosphere with a ton of healthy eating options that are flavorful and tasty.  Their salad staple is the Tuscan Kale salad, which is full of crisp kale greens, sprinkled with parmesean cheese and a lemon spiced dressing.  Really fresh tasting and super delicious!  My other favorite salad (when it's in season) is the Roasted Vegetable Ingredient salad.  Roasted veggies (think califlower, squash, brussel sprouts), pomegranate seeds and mulberry with a horseradish dressing.  It is absolutely SUPERB!!  My only issue with it was that for some reason this time the salad was about half the size it used to be.  I mean, I don't normally eat a ton, but this was so tiny that I was still pretty hungry after.  Not sure if they changed the portion size, or if they were running out of ingredients, but for $12 I expect to be satiated.  Overall, I love the quality of the ingredients at True Foods and will definitely be coming back to get my healthy eating on :)"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. I have never had a bad meal here. The atmosphere is great and the food is always fresh. Definitely a must try if you are looking for a new spot in Scottsdale.   They also text you when your table is ready so you can walk around and shop nearby while you wait which is so convenient and adds to the overall positive experience."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday celebration - for ME of course! It was excellent! Our server was completely fantastic, and even though I really disliked the drink she recommended (the honey lemon ginger with rum), her upbeat attitude was totally worth it.   I'm #glutenfree and went with a pescatarian/no-cow-dairy-eating-person, so we are a match made in heaven for horrible ordering. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. She ordered the shrimp goat cheese pizza. I love the menu, because it spells out the ingredients (which are all pretty simple - the whole appeal of the natural hippie simple recipe theme) and lists if it's vegetarian and gluten free. The casserole was SO delicious, I would totally go back once a week to eat that! My girlfriend's order came back with cheese on the pizza, although it wasn't listed. The waitress gladly remade the pizza and apologized. See, I told you she was great!   They also serve Dos Cabezas wine here - a fantastic winery in Sonoita, AZ. I suggest you get a glass when you go there. They are fantastic people and I love supporting local wineries! I had the rasberry sorbet for dessert and the pomegranate seeds really took it to a whole different level.  This place is brilliant, but I'd love to try it again to see if everything else is worthy of five-stars. I hope that the rest of the wait staff is as awesome as the server we had. It's not cheap by any means, but it's worth it if you want TRUE food :)"}
{"text":"I've grown to love True Food. Very flavorful and I feel good about what I'm eating. The atmosphere is always positive. The only advice I have is to refrain from sweeping the floors next to us while we're eating. It made my wife lose her appetite."}
{"text":"We went with our boys and another family, and the dinner was delightful. After a 30 minute wait, we were seated and got friendly and attentive service for the entire meal. We ordered the panong coconut curry with shrimp, brown rice bowls (one chicken and one beef), and the kids pizza. The bowls were delicious - wonderfully flavorful and fresh veggies, tender steak and chicken, brown rice cooked to perfection, curry that had a perfectly mild punch.   For dessert we had the squash pie and flourless chocolate cake. The pie came with coconut whipped cream and we added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My husband loved it. The chocolate cake was fantastic, with little chocolate shavings and a touch of caramel. We will definitely go back when we are here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE being able to go to a restaurant with my family and not have to worry about anything they order being bad for them.  Even my toddler loves it.  Clean, fresh, and pure food...the kind our bodies were designed to eat."}
{"text":"One of my faves in Scottsdale. Gets a little pricey but I love the flavors. Healthy and delicious. This location is never not busy so reserve a table or be prepared to wait. I like grabbing a bar stool for faster service. Service is good generally. Ancient grains, steelhead, Brussels, the turkey burger. I've not had a bad meal here.  Never feels mediocre. :)"}
{"text":"From the friendly greeting and fantastic service great drinks fresh food and awesome delivery a healthy meal that was fantastic we had to crudités delicious raw vegetables The tuna tataake to die for the mushroom pizza unbelievable and the steelhead trout the sustainable fish unbelievable will I come back absolutely.  Great atmosphere high energy and just a wonderful experience all around sit at the bar if you can you get in faster and they treat you like royalty"}
{"text":"Had the  pan seared halibut.  The portion is a bit small but the food is great.  Also had the acai mojitos drink.  The drink wasn't so good."}
{"text":"Located in the fancy schmancy Biltmore fashion park, True Food Kitchen offers healthy anti-inflammatory food. If it's your first time here, they can give you a little spiel about Dr. Weil!  We went for dinner twice and tried: Herb Hummus Wild Caught Albacore Tataki  Braised Bison Short Rib Butternut Squash pizza with GF crust Sustainable Petrale Sole  The tataki was soo good! I wish it came with more pieces. We were licking the sauce off of the plate. The herb hummus was meh, pretty standard and something I could have made at home. Of the entrees, we both liked the bison short ribs the best. They were so soft and meaty.  The space was a little too \"cafeteria\" like for me with all of the tables so close to each other, but other than that I really liked the offers they had and their service. Our servers both times were GF themselves, so it was so easy for my GF dining partner to get recommendations."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant but its definitely a BUT restaurant.   Good food BUT small servings. (don't order the steak tacos if your hungry. My son ate his tacos, half of my dinner, a portion of my husband's and a bite of his wife's)  Friendly BUT slow, REALLY slow service.  Nice open space BUT if the restaurant is packed then you can't make out what your friends are saying.  I'm not one to complain too much but Scottsdale is really hot this time of the year so I really needed a glass of water upon being seated.  It took waving down another waiter to even find our waiter to bring us three glasses of water. It took him another 10 minutes to bring us water so it took total of 15 minutes just for water.  He then ask if we would like anything else to drink so we order our beverages thinking okay let's give this guy another chance cuz he's gonna be on his toes now especially after complaining to the manager.   It took him ANOTHER 15  minutes to bring a single glass of lemonade. The rest of the food came, fresh and cooked to order so we didn't mind waiting the 20 minutes for fresh food BUT this is NOT the place to go during lunch hour if you need to get back to work.  Bottom line is it's a nice restaurant.  Wouldn't hesitate to go again when I have time but I woudn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"First off, True Foods is a beautiful restaurant! I love the decor, and I even love how the staff is dressed. It's just an overall nice place to be.   Some friends and I tried it for the first time recently. LOVED the hummus appetizer and shaved turkey sandwich. Out of curiosity, we tried the kale-ade... mistake. A $6 mistake. I really even tried to like it. It's just a big jumble of unpleasant flavors. For dessert we shared the lemon tart, and the rhubarb crisp. Both were tremendous!   With all this tasty food to try, it's hard not to get carried away. But keep in mind if you get an appetizer, drink, meal, and dessert... expect to have a pretty hefty bill.   Other than that, my only real complaint is that the light fixtures are really yucky dusty. I know we live in the desert, and it's in a hard to reach place, but it's gross to look up and see all that dust looming above your food..."}
{"text":"I'm not a health nut. At all.  I primarily eat healthy but can cross the line from time to time and I'm definitely not someone who seeks out healthy places on purpose.  I need meat, cheese, and carbs. However, this place actually makes healthy food taste delicious.   I do love kale and really enjoyed the kale salad. It was crunchy, flavorful and very filling. that didn't stop me from having a pizza. I mean, I have to even out that healthy kale salad AND the pizza was organic and full of veggies, so it's okay.    If you have any dietary restrictions or have several friends who are on fad diets (you know the ones. Those who suddenly are 'gluten free' for no apparent reason).. take them here. You can still enjoy a delicious meal without having to be a pain in the butt!"}
{"text":"We dined here for fathers day 2013. There were 5 of us and had a nice table outside under misters. We enjoyed a few of the Natural Refreshers, I recall the carrot lemonade was the most interesting, in a good way. I started with the shitake & tofu lettuce cups. They were excellent- messy but great. My mother law really enjoyed her spagetti squash casserole, and had a few meals of leftovers! My husband ordered the curry which was so good, I helped him finish it!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I noticed True Food Kitchen was close to my hotel! We had a delicious dinner tonight...  After reading the reviews raving about the edamame dumplings I had to try them. OMG good. We shared a mushroom, shaved Brussels Sprouts and taleggio cheese pizza to start. More OMG good.  I had the potato, long bean and bok choy curry bowl - spicy! But still OMG good. My dining partner had the salmon entree with quinoa, brown rice and farro. The grains had a garlic and lemongrass sauce that was amazing.  Service was prompt and friendly, and the ambiance was casual and comfortable. Noise level was acceptable. Dinner for two with two cocktails was $86.00.  I'm already thinking about coming back for lunch tomorrow... :D"}
{"text":"okay, so this place is part super healthy, part experimentally interesting.  and the bathroom is outside.  we had the edamame dumplings to start. excellent.  my colleague had the mahi mahi special - she was underwhelmed. she gave me all of her vegetables. I love veggies, but the tough, half green cauliflower I wasn't feeling. (apparently it's a half breed of another vegetable i'm not familiar with.)   I had a spaghetti casserole thing with a bison burger on top. i wasn't mad at that at all.   dessert. we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. it's made with 72% cacao, 0% sweetness. meh. I also got the squash pie. I was into that, until the crust that was so hard I needed a knife and brute strength to cut, cut the roof of my mouth. it's still healing. if that crust wasn't so hard the pie would be fairly amazing."}
{"text":"I oh so wanted to love, love, love this restaurant and am rather disappointed.  Drinks are real stupid and overpriced, service was slow, really slow, taking forever just to get water, in fact had to ask 3 times to have it brought to us. It was a quiet slow day at True Food so being busy was not an excuse for the bad service. The kale salad was great, the side dish of beans that came with the tacos, tasty, the pizza - very average.  I might go back to give the place a second chance and to enjoy the healthy and wonderful kale salad."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is but I can never really get into any Fox Restaurant Concepts. I've visited Sauce, Arrogant Butcher, True Food, and Zinburger.   I go to these restaurants a lot because my girlfriend's parents love Fox and they buy gift cards by the bushel. Anyway I was True Food the other day and thought I would write a review.  We started off with Chicken Chopped salad, they were out of the Mediterranean which was shocking, (how do you run out of a salad?) The salad was decent, nothing to write home about.  We also split some Edamame dumplings which were the highlight of the night, honestly i should have just ordered two of those for my entree.   For entrees I ordered the Margherita pizza, and my lady order the TLT and we traded halves. The pizza was solid but I wasn't blown away. The TLT on the other hand was actually really good, the Tempeh bacon tastes just like bacon and I would glady order that again.   I've had the panang before and your better off just visiting a Thai restaurant. That's my big problem with the Fox concepts, their menus are all over the place, they have Thai, Italian, American, Mexican, and Mediterranean on the same menu. The food is overpriced and you would be better off visiting a restaurant that specializes in a particular cuisine.  If you like pizza visit Pomo or Cibo  If you like Thai, your better off at any chain, even Thai Basil.  I just wish these places would have fun with the food instead of creating these \"hip\" dishes that sound cool ordering but lack in flavor and originality.  Rant over. It's not so bad when you have a gift card!"}

{"text":"Not a good night for these guys overall. I would avoid this place on the weekend. Although it's busy, service severely lacks and it just isn't worth it.  Normally I come here during the week and have heard the horror stories about weekends, but have it a shot anyway. My mistake. Waited a long time while tables sat empty because bussers weren't organized. Hostesses were giving out unrealistic wait times, I think they just gave up. Food was not up to par, three of us ordered the same salads and they all looked different. Server was either there a lot or not at all, which was confusing. It was a mess.  To be fair, I'll give it another shot during the week."}
{"text":"The turkey burger was the best turkey burger in the entire world.  On the other hand some of our dishes were not better than three-stars-worthy: brussels sprouts app was overcooked and the kale guacamole was a small, low, half-mixed pile of large avo chunks and kale shreds with some ingredients we couldn't identify, accompanied by a disproportionately large pile of unappealing pita chips. The spaghetti squash casserole was like something you'd make at home when you don't know what else to make, only it was half as much as you'd eat at home. The inside out quinoa burger fell apart immediately, turned into a mess on the plate, and was just eaten with a fork.  The server was precious, not in a good way, and no matter what exchange she had with the table, she'd end the interaction by putting her hand down dramatically on the table and saying \"Mmmkay, let me know if there's anything else I can bring for the table.\" The first time or two it was mildly weird but she did the same thing four or five times, robotically, no matter what stage of the meal we were at, and it just left the whole interaction feeling programmed and impersonal."}
{"text":"Was told this was a great place for vegan and healthy food. It's true. We ordered one of the bowls plus an order of roasted cauliflower. This place is fantastic with such a cool feel.  Curtis the Assistant general mgr made sure everything was perfect. The only thing better than the food was the service.   Thx Danielle"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Quality food prepared with your health in mind. Leave full and feeling good about what you ate!"}
{"text":"Honestly, we went there because it was close to the hotel and I could get a reservation quickly on Open Table, but everything we had was delicious. I had the quinoa bowl with grilled salmon and it was just what I was looking for. Filling, but not too heavy, with whole grains and lots of veggies. My kids had a grass fed burger and a margherita pizza. I would comment on those, too, but neither left me anything to try. Overall, one of the better meals we had while in Scottsdale. We'll be back next trip."}
{"text":"So, this was my second time entering this establishment. The first was to buy a gift card for my daughters teacher & the bartender (the ONLY man in the place who can sell you a gift card apparently~ young guy...fohawk?) ignored my desperate glances for all of 20 minutes before he finally granted me (the sale of) 1 gift card.  So, round two, today.....was told upon arrival (12pm) that it will be 15-25 minutes for the 1st available table, wait 40 minutes before the pager buzzes only to notice she called 8 parties that arrived AFTER us. She couldn't bear to apologize for the loss of our lunch hour~ didn't care or acknowledge that we were standing 10 feet from her while she was piling other guests in front of us.  We spent 45$ (plus tip) on 2 meals that we had to leave behind, because there wasn't time to wait for our food (had to go pick up kids from school).  The waiter was nice, but I don't have a clue where they get all their customers, the pinto beans were yummy, but their fish tacos have nothing on Otro.  Never again, not for me."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food is seriously amazing! The beef tacos are my favorite. Great atmosphere and great service. If it's cool enough it's great to eat outside. It defiantly lives up to all the hype."}
{"text":"Great service for a large party and delicious! We're from SF and felt very at home here (they make all their own food, bread included!) We brought 14 people here without a reservation at 1pm on a Saturday and got very quick and super friendly service from Ali and Dean. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try True Food, as I had heard so many great things about it!  Their drink menu looks interesting.  My friend ordered the honey tea, and said it was refreshing and light. Everything on their menu sounds appealing, but is a bit on the pricey side for what it is.  I ordered the chicken sausage skillet from their brunch menu.  It was good, but a little on the bland side.  Could use some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.  The other two at my table ordered the bison burger, which was amazing!  The flax seed bun was fresh and the fixings were perfect.  Kale salad and sweet potato hash on the side, which were both really good as well.  For dessert, we all had coffee and split the flour-less chocolate cake, which was perfect in size and flavor.  The coffee was nothing to boast about, but it rarely is for me.  Service was good.  I recommend sitting outside if it's a nice day.  Next time, I'd like to try the pizzas or tacos."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this healthy spot for lunch & finally called in my order; chicken salad w cranberries, various nuts & grains & the most vibrant colored salad that tasted like it was just picked. I worried it might be too sweet w the dried cranberries... But holy cannoli did that tangy dressing balance it all out beautifully...Little sweet...little sour.. Little crunch..little apple-slices.. Nice flavored & Tender grilled chicken strips all over...my new after yoga..before happy hour..anytime delish salad!!"}
{"text":"Again, another find based on reviews, and again, not disappointed!  Stopped for a late lunch one day, and shared an order of dumplings to get started.  Then, totally enjoyed the Panang Curry and the Steak Tacos.  Both were perfectly prepared.  Service was great, but then we were there at an off time.  Bevgasm'd the Ginger Margarita, but at $11, enjoyed just one!  The prices are pretty steep, which is the reason for one less star.  Lunch for two with a shared appetizer, two entrees,  one cocktail,  a club soda was pushing the mid $60 range!  But....the flavors and execution made it worth the investment!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, overpriced, but what else can you expect from the Biltmore area? I love that the restaurant has a philosophy & sticks to it. Their vegan cocktails are awesome. It was very good, but I won't go back because of the prices. The restaurant is very loud, not great for a date."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Saturday 8/19/17 and were totally unimpressed. Service was mediocre and the food was worse. My wife ordered eggs over medium with toast (They only have one type of bread which is a multi-grain, not even a sourdough is available which was surprising.) The eggs were served up with slightly burned whites and hard centers. How hard is it to cook over-medium fried eggs? The toast comes standard with NO TOPPINGS???  I mean no butter, no jam or jelly, nothing, so we had to request some butter. The dish came with sweet potato hash and chicken sausage. The sweet potatoes were burnt black on the outside but not totally cooked and there were a few onion slices here and there. To be honest the chicken sausage patties were quite good.  I ordered medium poached eggs with the same sweet potato hash and chicken sausage. You guessed it, the eggs ended up being hard-boiled!  We were both too hungry to send our orders back so choked them down the best we could.  Hard to see why people think this is great food???"}
{"text":"Tasty real food, what else can I say. Simple ingredients put together simply, but with studied exactness, produces quite a culinary experience. I have eaten here before on a whim and have thought enough of this place to keep it in my thoughts and return. I do not live in the area, or country for that matter, so when I am in this area, there are a lot of other untried options available. So why did I return? I think you need to find out for yourself..."}
{"text":"I've really become fond of the quirkiness of the Fox Concepts restaurants. True Foods is probably my favorite with Blanco a close second. I love the vegetarian options here and it doesn't make me feel like I'm cheating on my healthy eating habits. It isn't a perfect whole foods menu (they have things like pasta and bread and pizza) but lots of the menu items are vegetable centered and many things can be made GF.   Service was phenomenal. The waiter was attentive, food was out quickly, and a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. You always get an A in service from me if a manager is going around checking on customers!  I got the quinoa burger (still on my quest for the best veggie burger in PHX) and the flavor combinations were amazing. The burger was definitely a messy, eat-with-a-fork-not-your-hands sort of thing, but it was so good I didn't care. It came with a side of sweet potato hash, which was sort of cold, and a kale salad, which was also sort of cold, but tasted much better.   The place got busier as we ate, so the earlier you go the better if you don't want a wait. I think next time I'll try eating at the bar and get something off the drink menu, lots of interesting alcoholic options!"}
{"text":"I ate at True Foods at the Biltmore on December 29th.  There were 4 of us(this was my sister-laws treat to my 2 daughters and myself).  We were anxious to try this Vegetarian/Vegan. Etc restaurant.  Our server was lovely and very attentive.  I checked the menu online before going so that I would have an idea of the selections.  The prices seemed reasonable.  I ordered the Autumn Salad, and as a treat I added Chicken.  It was $16, and was the size of a side salad.  My sister-in-law ordered the spaghetti squash casserole which was miniscule,  one daughter ordered the tacos, there was 3, and I wouldn't even call them the size of an appetizer, the other daughter ordered a pizza which she said was tasty, and looked to be of lunch size.  The bottom line,  the Portions are Very Small for the price you pay.  You will probably walk away hungry.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go here a few weeks back for her birthday so we went on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking was easy to find and there was no wait to get a table.  Wish it had been a touch cooler, but it wasn't so we decided to eat indoors.    Had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders, but it was straightened out pretty quickly.  We each ordered one of the signature drinks, the wife got cucumber lemonade (I think) and I got a green arnold palmer.  I liked the g.a.p.  For the meal, don't remember what the wife had, I got the chicken sausage pizza.  It was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.    Basically, that's how the whole meal was, okay, but didn't blow me away (not that I'm a huge healthy/organic foodie kind of guy though).  I guess I'd go here again, but I probably wouldn't suggest it.  (I did think the music was a little loud...)"}
{"text":"I just can't seem to like this place. The atmosphere is strange. I rarely get greeted when I walk in, which is awkward. Service is okay, although sometimes slow. The food is typically underwhelming, but the dishes I keep coming back to are the pita and hummus appetizer and the curry entree. I really don't mind the food when someone else is paying, but whenever I eat at a Fox restaurant, I always feel like someone just took 20 bucks out of my wallet, and I'm probably still hungry."}
{"text":"True Food is my favorite restaurant in AZ. I am from the east coast (New Jersey) where you get the best of the best when it comes to food so I struggle trying to find good food out here. I love everything about True Food.  The customer service is spot on, food is delicious (sea bass is my favorite), ambience is great, love the open kitchen so I can see who is preparing my food and the staff are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Great service and food at the Biltmore Trie Foods!! Sooo good! And love the \"green tea\" to go!! As well the wait staff always seems to remind me of my parking token which I really appreciate!  Thank you"}
{"text":"Seeing as it's January and I'm self-imposing a \"healthy eating month\" to counteract the damage done in December, I was really excited to try True Foods.  I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night, and although it was crowded, we didn't have more than a 20 minute wait.  Most things on the menu looked great - when you're trying to eat light, you're usually limited to 2 or 3 of the more boring items on a menu.  Here, I felt as though I had a solid selection that spanned from a few pretty innovative salads to low carb chicken and salmon dishes.  We split the edamame dumplings, and I got the sashimi tuna salad as my entree.  Both were really outstanding.  The dumpling wrapper was really thin and tasted homemade, and the accompanying broth/sauce had a hint of truffle oil in it - delicious!  The salad had quite a bit of cubed raw ahi tuna with a light miso vinaigrette and some edamame and avocado.  For $14, I thought it was a pretty good deal.    Although I really enjoyed my experience, I can see why this restaurant isn't for everyone.  Portions are intentionally a bit smaller, and although healthy can still be really flavorful, it's not the same as the food you get elsewhere that's smothered in butter or deep fried.  I would recommend True Food for vegans/vegetarians, people who want to go out to eat but are still looking for a healthy meal, or a girls night out.  For large, pickier groups or people wanting a huge plate of food, you should probably look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I travel to AZ from the East Coast twice a year. After the long flight, we stop for bite to eat. We selected True Food Kitchen for both visits in 2017.  A True Food Kitchen opened in King of Prussia, PA (KOP) just this past month.  I visited it recently as well.    It was lunch time and they were very busy. We were warmly greeted and seated quickly.  The server was welcoming. The service was good. The food is always wonderful.  Although there are many wonderful selections on the menu, Mom always gets the spaghetti squash casserole.  She loves it! I ordered the Inside Out Quinoa Burger. It's wonderful with a side of their amazing kale salad. Seriously, it's very very good. Dad ordered the burger and enjoyed every bite.    What I thought was remarkable, was the difference between my Quinoa Burger in King of Prussia, Pa and that of the one in Phoenix, AZ.  The Phoenix Burger was 2-3 times the size of the KOP burger. Kudos to Phoenix.  Clearly, KOP's location has to match up to the True Kitchen standards of Phoenix.    We've appreciated Dr. Andrew Weil for years. We're thrilled to know we can go out for a bite and know we're truly getting food that is good for us! Beverages too!"}
{"text":"Anytime a new trend develops, you can count on the hipster trendoids loving everything about said trend, paying ridiculously overpriced tabs, and bragging how they got there first.  One of the latest trends is, in a need to pretend to be eating healthy, eating some really weird stuff, that is marketed and wrapped in words like ORGANIC, WHOLE and TRUE.  \"YUMMERS! The Clarified Tibetin Yak Feces on Mandarin Chiffonade Soil Wafers with Escargot Infused Pablano Aioli is the best thing I've ever had.\"  Yeah, Ok. For the trendsetters, trendoid wanna-bes, and lemming followers, this sounds great. There are a few of us, however, who understand that you're just eating YAK SHIT, ON A DIRT CRACKER, WITH SNAILS AND MAYONNAISE.  Cut to True Food Kitchen in Scottsdale. With delights on the menu such as TUSCAN KALE SALAD, BUTTERNUT SQUASH PIZZA, \"INSIDE OUT\" QUINOA BURGER,  and SHITAKE & TOFU LETTUCE CUPS, made from quality ingredients like SULTANA, FARRO, COCONUT SHELLFISH BROTH, & TELEGGIO, Yak Shit lovers must be cartwheeling.  I made the mistake of ordering a Turkey Burger from True Food Kitchen at the behest of a Yak Shit eating co-worker who \"just had to have\" a Bison Burger.  For $12 you get the following; Turkey Burger, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, Mayo & Flax Seed Bun. Seems harmless enough, even almost tasty.  Nope.  It's hard to imagine screwing up a turkey burger this badly. Soggy, greasy, slimy....JUST PLAIN BAD. REALLY BAD!!  The patty was dry. The bun was a soaky soggy. The worst, from a place that boasts \"Honest food that tastes really good,\" is the terrible condition of the produce on this burger; slimy to the point of being gelatinous. Just plain gross. I took one bite and threw the rest away.  Sorry, True Food Kitchen. I won't be back.  Enjoy the KALE-ADE, THE SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE & THE GRASS-FED BISON. To me, It's all just Yak Shit."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after a strenuous hike. We were hungry but didn't want to eat something unhealthy after a good workout. My wife got the grilled chicken salad and wouldn't share with me while I ordered a quinoa bowl with chicken and it was delicious. The restaurant itself looked terrific inside and out and the service was excellent. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the best meal I've ever eaten. The citrus skinny margarita was refreshing and sneakily strong, the greek salad hummus was as fresh and delicious as I've ever had (and I'm Greek), and eating the ancient grains bowl felt like packing on muscle from eating a tub of ice cream. Basically a cheat code on life. Do yourself a favor and eat here, as much as possible."}
{"text":"For a veggie and juice lover, I was in heaven! There's a also a full bar to pair your veggie dish with a nice drink. The beauty of this spot is that they also serve beef, fish, and poultry for the carnivore/omnivore in your party. Other restaurants like this often don't cater to those who like meat, which makes this spot a 5 star in my book!"}
{"text":"I really love this place! I had a burger with the kale salad and I can say that everything was excellent. The vibe at this place is very relaxing as well! You really can't go wrong dining here."}
{"text":"I had dinner last thursday at the biltmore location it was very busy but i waited for a server to take my order for 15 min and 1 hour for my food when it finally come to the table was cold we paid and gave 20% tip but i was very happy about it idk if ill gove it another chance to true food biltmore location"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Boyfriend & I went to Scottsdale to visit his Mom & we went twice that weekend!  I love that it's all fresh, organic ingredients, and I also love that while Boyfriend is on his healthy/vegan/etc. kick, this is a place that more than suits both our needs!  Our first trip was dinner; I had a turkey wrap thing that was v. v. good...Boyfriend had the kale garlic pizza (which, just, wow, no words!), and Boyfriend's Mom had grilled salmon which she thought was v. v. good also!  I loved their selection of interesting & different drinks, also!  We came back for lunch a couple days later--I just had the margarita pizza, Boyfriend had a pizza with manchego, I think (?) and peppers, and Boyfriend's Mom had the kale pizza that BF had a couple nights prior.  Definitely high marks, still, for lunch!  All in all it was a really great experience...unfortunately, there aren't any in California, but we were told that they are opening one in Newport Beach and one in Santa Monica (YAYYY!) in a year or two!  This is SUCH a California place--once they get out here, I think they will do very well!"}
{"text":"Came an hour before close when hardly anybody was there. Very slow service and my meal was given away to another patron who came in 10 minutes after me with nothing said about it and no offer to make it right. Staff was more concerned with closing duties as opposed to patrons. Used to love these places but they've gone way downhill. Won't return."}
{"text":"This place just brings me joy, hands down. Healthy... Great atmosphere.  Always leave here in a great mood!!!  Get the dessert by the way"}
{"text":"This place has my heart, it really does.  You cannot go wrong with leaving there feeling nourished and not heavy from any type of greasy food.    Try the kale and avocado dip :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here about a month ago, and was not disappointed.  We enjoyed the edamame dumplings to start and also shared a plate of grilled vegetables that were really tasty.  Our dinner selections included a chicken teriyaki bowl, fish, and the turkey lasagne.  All dishes were prepared with very fresh vegatables and ingredients, and were flavorful.  This is a place where you can make healthy choices and still enjoy a nice meal out.  Portions were good sized, not over the top.  I plan to return to try some other choices."}
{"text":"5/29/10 Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door (I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good.  Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)  Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).  The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :(   Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...  Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"SOOOOooooooo good. We ate outside, there was plenty of seating inside but I read that it's noisy inside and it was a really nice day.  It's got all of the F-words. Fresh. Fun. Fantastic food. Friendly staff. Fizzy drink that was yummy. Fast service. Flabby- NOT how you felt when you left. For vegetarians and folks that eat meat, alike. Free parking on one side of the mall. Fix- what they'll do to your parking pass if you park on their side of the mall.  Fact: We will go back!"}
{"text":"Extremely good & fresh organic tasting ingredients!  The Panang Curry is excellent, ordered mine with chicken protein option, but available vegetarian style as well other options. Very very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"We started with guacamole, the best ever.  I ordered  the pasta dish. Realy good flavor and a very small portion for 14.00.  The key lime pie was soo good. The quality of food is a solid 4 star, but the portions need to step it up. My wife had the vegan pizza i tasted it it was 3 stars."}
{"text":"Always love a fresh meal, and need to go here more often! So many great menu items and a helpful staff in case anything should arise. Can't say I've ever had a bad experience, and will remain a loyal patron! The juices are a great option for an on the go pick me up later in the day, and Squash Pie... MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"I just love the healthy menus here! Gluten free and vegan options are always a plus. My favorite thing on the menu is the spaghetti squash caserol. I have dreams about it! You can make any of their specialty juices into a cocktail."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat lunch or dinner! The environment is great at Scottsdale Quarter. Outside seating is perfect. Service is usually good, servers are always busy. Spaghetti squash casserole is the bomb.com!!! Also the root and remedy, matcha horchata, and honey lemonade are a must try!"}
{"text":"Co worker heard that this place was a good place to eat.. menu everything made from scratch... and gluten free.. appetiser kale guacamole.. Mmmm not my favourite it was okay .. however the lasagna was a piece of heaven wasn't heavy at all .. flavours were good..?and didn't leave you feeling bloated might have to change my diet to gluten free.."}
{"text":"We literally come here all the time, but tonight there were cockroaches all over the place in the outside patio. They literally crawled across our dinner plates tonight. And where there is one cockroach there are many. And they did not even totally comp our dinner either. Our waitress however was amazing. We forget her name but she had brown pony tails, loves bend Oregon and was a very exceptional server. But the management and owner needs to take this issue more serious."}
{"text":"I've been here now not once, or twice, but thrice. My first impression is still correct: I love True Food Kitchen.   After the first time I went, I came home to Yelp about it, read some other reviews and hesitated, thinking that perhaps I had overlooked things. So I went back. I still loved it. But then I went again just to make sure. And, yup, still delicious.   The pita and hummus was simply amazing. I'm kind of a hummus snob and was surprised how much I liked it. I liked the pizza with shrimp on it. I liked the beef tacos. I liked the salmon sandwich, I liked the turkey wrap, I liked how the kitchen seemed to spill over into the dining room. I loved how open and airy it felt. Like other people have said, it did feel like L.A. But that's not always a bad thing. In the three times that I've gone I thought there was both image and substance.   There were a few items on the menu that I had no clue what they were. I had to ask. The portions are not huge, but I found them to be quite filling. I always get one of the delicious and refreshing drinks too. I like the one made from the blood orange and the one with lots of ginger in it. There was not a hint of chemicals or fake sugar in them, just natural food, the way I like it. Refills would be nice though.  The prices were a little higher, but not bad. I thought the food was flavorful and delicious. I would take people I like here. Heck, I'd even take people I don't like here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time. Delicious turkey burger with a side of diced sweet potatoes and yellow onions. Only one complaint. Sat at counter on wood stools. Most uncomfortable seating of any restaurant in my life of 65 years."}
{"text":"When is this place not good?!   This time around we got some wine and shared the butternut squash pizza and a great chicken chopped salad. Both were delicious.   We like going here for our friend who is celiacs and needs the special attention to his allergy. We have brought other friends with food allergies here and never had an issue and always find something delicious for ourselves."}
{"text":"I'm on a dietary restriction, so I wanted to have lunch somewhere that is healthy. I had lunch here this afternoon since it was close to Sephora. I couldn't decide whether to get the Kale Salad and Shiitake Mushroom & Tofu Wraps or just get an entree. I was eying the Spaghetti Squash since it was the only appetizing vegetarian in the menu. I asked the server, and she recommended that I order the Squash. Great choice since it was healthy and delicious. However, The presentation was lacking; the male waiter just plopped the sad little dish on the table, smiled and walked away. No bread came with it, grated parmesan nor was I asked if I wanted crushed pepper. I guess I had a high expectation for this place since the price was on a mid-range scale. The lady that took my order was very nice, and the dish was good, but the presentation was just a little sad.  P.S. - I might give them another chance. I'm going to try their brunch one of these days since they look appetizing."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of True Food at the Biltmore for a while now and recently decided to try this location. My husband and I loved our lunch. We started with the edamame dumplings which were very tasty. For mains my husband had the bison burger which he enjoyed and I tried the organic ricotta ravioli which was REALLY delicious! I also had their Red Moon drink which is made up of pink grapefruit, yuzu, agave and soda .... very tasty and refreshing. I have to say I prefer the location of this True Food ... love the outdoor seating and the nice open feel."}
{"text":"Dined here again recently with my husband who thoroughly enjoyed it. We had a 15 minute wait to be seated but that is all good....reassuring to know you are not the only people who would like to eat there. We tried the turkey burger and the roasted garlic, wild mushroom and tuscan kale pizza both delicious. We also had the organic honey lemonade which is amazingly tasty and refreshing! Wonderful little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Why don't we have a True Food in Boston?  I love pretty much everything about this place....love the open, all glass feel of the restaurant itself and the simple honest cuisine  We started with juices...Now its hard to screw up a juice, but restaurants in these parts don't even offer it.....You have to go to a juice place  I really liked the humus platter with fresh veggies.  They arrive in a pail.  You feel like a rabbit, but the freshness of the veggies and humus is pretty compelling.  Ditto with the chili.  Its fresh...not outsourced or made in a central commissary and shipped  Loved the vibe, experience and especially the food"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that if it weren't for the high prices, I would happily give True Foods 5 happy stars.  True Foods is wonderful.  If they opened up shop on Beverly Blvd, La Brea, or 3rd street in LA they'd get my business all the time.  I was looking for something healthy that was gonna fill me up without weighing me down (was going to a wedding that night), and relatively fast.  For some reason in America, this is a really tough thing to do.  I opted for the spaghetti squash casserole with fresh mozzarella, organic tomatoes and zucchini ($13) and a New Dew drink (honeydew juice, mint, and lime).  I was blown away by the casserole.  Simple, tasty, really nice kick in the tomato sauce, and besides the fat in the cheese, made completely of vegetables.  AWESOME.  I mean, really really great. I'm gonna make the dish at home.  The juice was good,although the honeydew wasn't super ripe like the ones they juice at Fred Segal in LA.  All that said, I was SUPER impressed with True Food kitchen.  Someone there told me they're going to expand.  I'd say bring the prices down a bit (I'd pay $10 for that casserole at lunch any day fo the week), and come expand to LA.  You'll make a KILLING."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful day, I found parking right in front of the restaurant, and we were served quickly. What can I say - it was a 5-star day.  I had a delicious cucumber & honey lemonade and a scrumptious gluten-free curry chicken with rice noodles. The curry was not spicy (by request), the chicken was cooked perfectly and the noodles were flavorful and abundant. The entree was enough for two meals. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Although a little expensive, food was great. Nice to have a restaurant that has healthy choices. Service was so-so, but overall, I had a good dining experience. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Healthy and tastey can sometimes be blended beautifully, something true food kitchen would do well to learn. I know you're aiming for healthy, but the food tastes like cardboard. I won't be earring here again."}
{"text":"I've been totally unimpressed with the flavourless overpriced food at True Food. It's dirty hippie food with zero effort at making it taste edible. Save yourself some money and go get a grilled chicken sandwich at Chick Fil A for a fifth the price."}
{"text":"I had a very adequate experience at True Foods at the Biltmore location. I went here with my fiancee and two of our friends as it was the best option in town to meet a variety of dietary needs. We had kosher, vegetarian, and sustainable eaters in the group. I did like the decor though at points I was worried about the sturdiness of my seat at our table.  The service was very sweet and friendly if a bit slow. I would in fact say our service was almost too bubbly and happy. Enough that we were slightly weirded out by it. However, if you really are that happy then I guess good for you.  As to the food, we ordered several appetizers, entrees, and dessert. My fiance found most of his food to be the better end of ok. I did try some of his items and I must say they all begged for just a hint of salt. Our friends loved everything. I had a mixed bag. My drink was very nice, I had the Green Arnie which was nice if a little subdued flavor wise. I also ordered miso soup to start. That one was a bit of a surprise. At no point on the menu or by the server was it mentioned that it was a red miso soup. For those of you unfamiliar, the kind of miso soup you get at most places is a white miso. Red miso is much stronger and more pungent. While I am do like both it was not what I was expecting. I would not have ordered such a large potent bowl of red miso if I had known. I then had the Wild Ahi Sliders which were really the best part of my whole meal. The fish was fantastically fresh and delicious. I did not partake of the dessert.  Overall, the food was goodish. Though I did spend much of the evening wishing I had some salt for the potatoes I got. Not a lot just a pinch of something. Otherwise, they were fairly bland. My fiancee had the same complaint. Everything could have used just a pinch more flavor.  Nothing was bad or anything the whole experience was simply ok. If it had been significantly cheaper and the service had been more prompt I probably be willing to boost it up to 4 stars. However, the portions are kind of small (other than the miso soup) for what you pay.  I would come here again with some of my groups of friends with needier dietary restrictions but otherwise I don't believe I will be frequenting this restaurant."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorites places to eat!  I can't help but get the inside out Quinoa burger.  Love the textures and all the different tastes.    Even though they were slammed today.... the wait staff was attentive and friendly.  I hear they have sold to another company.  Advice to them.  If it ain't broke.... don't fix it!"}
{"text":"Very good, pretty healthy, and very kid friendly! The service is always good, and the food is consistent. The atmosphere, while busy, is also very comfortable but still pristine."}
{"text":"The wife and I made it over to True Food the other morning for brunch and had a nice experience. Looks like Yelp! needs to revise the hours of operation because my app said they were closed, but we called and sure enough, they do serve brunch.   Our server was very helpful and explained the philosophy behind the True Food experience for us. We started off with some tasty fruity beverages that were refreshing, if not a little weird.   We ordered the Greek frittata and the chicken hash. The frittata was OK, and the hash was very good. Maybe too much squash in the hash...   We finished off our brunch with a single blueberry johnnie cake that was pretty awesome and was only 2 bucks forth single cake. Very tasty.   Overall a nice place to enjoy meal, albeit a little on the pricey side. Also, a tasty and healthy alternative to breakfast (no slab bacon here) that is a nice change of pace. I may not be rushing back here anytime soon, but I would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"WOW! It had been a few years since I had been here, but was in the area visiting a friend and we decided to grab a bite to eat here. I forgot how delicious and fresh everything on the menu was! The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. We ordered the herb hummus to start and each ordered the salad special which had summer vegetables, manchego, and more + chicken. It was absolutely delicious and I felt so good after eating it.   If I could, I would eat at this place multiple times a week. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Fox restaurants.  The food is fresh and quality is high.  It satisfies both my vegetarian and meat eating friends.  We always sit at the bar (although sometimes it's packed) because the bartenders are probably the best in town. I recommend the steak tacos and kale salad."}
{"text":"Great healthy food with a great atmosphere. Food has never been sub par. It always meets or exceeds(mainly exceeds) expectations. If you want a super greasy bad for you meal this isn't the place lol, but I promise you it'll be worth it and save your arteries ;)"}
{"text":"Great menu that rotates seasonally. Good vegetarian options. Delicious cocktails. Everything is executed perfectly and food comes out quickly. Atmosphere is cute, although loud inside. Patio is a nice option."}
{"text":"A true culinary experience! Great patio, helpful service, and exceptional ingrediants! The iced tea is not to be missed and the ravioli is to die for!! Any place that makes organic food, has a positive energy, and a little hippy vibe- I will always award 5 Yelp stars!!"}
{"text":"On our mid-day adventures my friend and I ended up here.  I was hesitant but, she wanted to try it and upon the glowing recommendations of the shop owner we were at previously and yelp we went. So here it goes:  Service: We were seated promptly and the hostess was nice enough. Our waiter was obviously bored. As soon as we sat down he began hanging over us asking our drink orders...we did need more than 2 seconds to scan the menu. Its great he was attentive and tried to be helpful, it was just a little much.   Atmosphere: Trendy and the music was LOUD. It was very clean.   Food: Small portions and unimpressive. We split the hummus which for its price should have been enough to share, but really was a build for one plate. The vegetables were good and crisp, the hummus was decent but was nothing special.  Ravioli with Pesto - Weird and boring. Apparently they usually put Red pepper and corn on top, which I can't really fathom as being good. It was okay, again nothing special, also small and pricey.   Drinks: Hangover RX - I didn't like this at all, and I believe it was $4?  Medicine Man - It reminded me of a watered down cranberry juice.  It had some flavor but, very light. $6.   We ended up spending $50 bucks for lunch, so plan to pay. In my opinion, this place isn't anything special, and its basically just reaping the benefits of the ongoing health trend."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of True Foods. I have eaten here twice, both times on the insistence of friends who love this place.   The restaurant is for me an awkward attempt at making something corporate more local and at making something more upscale more casual. The result is something in the middle that in my opinion doesn't really work. When our server tried to introduce us to the concept, when he first approached our table, it felt very corporate, forced, and fake.   The actual restaurant space is loud, so it is hard to have a conversation with anyone who isn't seated right next to you. On this last visit we had a table of six and it was very hard to hear everyone.   The first time I ate here I had the soup to start and a fish entree. The portions are small for the price.   On our most recent visit we started with the tofu lettuce wraps they have a very strong flavor. For dinner I had the bison burger, on the recommendation of our friends. It just wasn't for me. I didn't eat the top part of the bun. It was a little too dry and way too garlicky. The garlic might have also been in the sides. As a side I had half sweet potatoes and half kale. I usually like kale but this kale was really tough, hard to eat and hard to digest. There was nothing really wrong with the food I just didn't like it.   I order a glass-and-a-half of Rioja; I like that they serve the wine in this portion. It is a perfect amount to have with dinner. However, the wine itself wasn't something I would order again.    On both of our visits the service was slow. Be prepared for a drawn-out dinner.   Overall, True Foods isn't a place that I would personally recommend."}
{"text":"We have visited this place three times this month. Typically we like the people or the food, but here we have really been enjoying both. We drive 90 minutes each way. :)  We came by around thanksgiving for the first time with a party of six including a pair of six year olds. The service was top notch. The waitress was SUPER nice to our kids and Sam the manager was warm, personable and engaging while he helped us navigate the menu. Since then we have been hooked.   Everything is locally and sustainably sourced but the prices are still very reasonable.   The kale salad is our favorite appetizer. It's somewhat akin to guacamole dip but has an interesting and unique flavor.   The bison burger is probably my favorite thing on the menu. It's easy to over-cook bison but his was excellent (I ordered it medium-rare).   Sea bass tacos were good too. We split the entree and ordered four - two each. The bass was perfectly cooked, but I was surprised by how good the beans that came with the tacos were.   For drinks my favorite is the ginger drink that I think was called \"the natural\". I prefer it warm.   Dessert is definitively the highlight though. My wife likes the chia seed pudding and I LOVE the squash pie. It's like a pumpkin pie but more flavorful and the crust is sweet without being overwhelming.   Thanks to Sam and the team for a great experience. We will be back soon. :)"}
{"text":"As a fan of all things Unhealthy and Greasy you wouldn't expect me and true foods to get along.I went in (was dragged by the husband) with a preconception that i would hate the food. It was Monday (Veg day) and we conveniently happened to be in biltmore so i decided to brave it out.  We Ordered ~Medicine Man (Pomegranate, Cranberry,Honey, Black Tea & Soda) $6 ~Root & Remedy (Beet, Carrot, Ginger, Turmeric & Honey Lemonade) $6 ~Edamame Dumplings (Daikon Radish & White Truffle Oil) $9 ~Spaghetti squash casserole (Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Tomato & Zucchini) $13 ~Flourless Chocolate cake (Cocoa, Vanilla Ice Cream, Almond Butter & Caramel) $7  Let me start by saying how beautiful the drinks looked when they arrived,very appetizing.The Medicine Man has a dominant taste of black tea with hints of other ingredients while Root & Remedy is more like a ginger and honey lemonade.It is impossible to guess what goes into the drinks unless you read the ingredients which i think is great.I technically did drink a lot of vegetables and healthy stuff compared to a regular Soda.The Edamame dumplings were great i wish they would serve more than four.My spaghetti squash casserole was delish, again i would have never guessed it had zucchini (which i isolate from my dishes). The only thing i wasn't a fan of was the flourless Chocolate cake, not that it tasted bad but it there was more caramel than chocolate.  Our server Jessica was wonderful and friendly.The food got to the table pretty fast.A lot of the items on their menu are gluten free.In the End my taste buds were happy and i will definitely be back for some more of that Healthy Delicious Experience.  Don't forget to validate your Parking.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"After a huge disappointment at a Thai restaurant - our party went to a place called \"True Foods\". I had been to the one in Scottsdale and liked it and this one in Phoenix proved to be on par with the other.  My wife and I both had the Tuscan Kale salad with grilled chicken, son had Street Tacos and DIL had Asian Noodles - ALL of the meals were purdy darn good - except my wife's Chicken was a bit dry - mine was nice and juicy, but it came late - a small issue! We also decided to share two deserts among the four of us - a Chi Pudding with Banana and Coconut and a Strawberry and Rhubarb Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream - ending our trip to True Foods was VERY GOOD!  The restrooms were clean, the rest of the place was showroom and the food that you are going to receive is right our on display. They validate your parking so you get two hours for free.   Credit cards are accepted and you won't be disappointed. We each tried something different and were very happy with our choices - I'd still like to try their pizzas because they looked incredible on their way to other tables. The place was buzzing - a true sign that you were getting true GOOD food!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I have been coming here for a year, probably at least once a week. The menu changes with the season which is awesome, the food is always fresh and delicious, the service is always on point. The juices are amazing...no complaints."}
{"text":"I went here for a group lunch, and it was a good space to meet since there was a wide variety of food, with options for people with all sorts of dietary restrictions. Everyone seemed happy with their selection. I ordered the grass fed steak tacos, which were pretty tasty with lots of toppings--avocado, greek yogurt, cilantro, pickled onion, anasazi bean, cotija cheese for an explosion of flavors. I ordered tulsi tea for my beverage and was surprised that it cost four dollars for a tea bag in a mug, so I'll go for the apple soda next time instead--it was a real hit!"}
{"text":"Great food and service for casual dining, date night, or take out!"}
{"text":"My favorite dish is the kale salad with chicken. Everything taste delish and fresh. Centrally located and a great date spot. Excellent service every single visit."}
{"text":"Have gone here many times, and quality SEEMS OK. Expensive for what you get, and the \"grass fed beef\" one night I was there was not beef at all. I know as a fact that it had moose meat in it. I will not go into how I know, other than to say it was tested by a third party using specialized test equipment.  I don't know if their supplier did this to them or what, but they need to be a bit more on top of things esp. since many food-conscious people, some extremely so, go here."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing menu of creative dishes. You can add different meat or fish options or keep it vegetarian. There are also plenty of vegan dishes and they accommodate any special need. The service is super friendly. The prices are elevated but the quality if the food is extremely good. Additionally the location is great, we loved the outside seating area."}
{"text":"Just had to update my review after another great lunch. The service was amazing as always and the pizza was out of this world.   You should also try the spicy chicken soup if it's on the menu and order the kale dip for an appetizer."}
{"text":"This place has been on my 'must eat list' for a while. I finally stopped by after a walking around Kierland Commons and Scottsdale Quarter. I plopped myself by the bar and after debating between a salad (my coworker raves about their kale salad), decided on the quinoa burger. I was so excited to find out that a kale salad came with it! I forgot to order dressing on the side, but to my surprise, they did not drench the salad with dressing and it was delicious! The quinoa burger was just as amazing.  Being a hummus snob, I had to order one to go for dinner. Wow. It's a little Americanized but was still really good.   FYI you can mix and match your salad! If you see a salad that you like, you can ask them to switch the greens base (ie kale instead of lettuce). They make their food on the spot, with organic ingredients, and no preservatives. Definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered True Food Kitchen a few years ago on a trip to Phoenix. Since our hometown of St. Louis doesn't have one, we always try to have a meal at one of their locations when we are traveling. Since this is the original TFK, they definitely get everything right. Our server was very friendly and all of our food was excellent. Definitely a fan of the health food focus, but there is something on the menu for everyone. For drinks, you can't go wrong with the kale-aid or the chia pomegranate lemonade."}
{"text":"True Food rates as a 3.5 for me.  It's a good choice for those that are wanting to eat some healthier, lighter fare.  It's also a good choice for vegetarians, as there are many items on the menu that, while lacking meat, are so flavorful that you don't really need the meat in it.  I've had the hummus and the edamame dumplings, and both have been quite good.  I've also tried the banh-mi wrap and the TLT, and although both are very tasty, I liked the TLT a little more (perhaps due to the smoky bacon-like taste of the tempeh).  Drinks, while expensive, are freshly made, and the Red moon I tried was delicious.    The sides I had with the sandwich were just OK.  The sweet potato hash was overcooked so there were a lot of burnt bits on my plate, and the kale salad tasted too sour to me.  In general, prices are a bit high, but that's probably to be expected for this area."}
{"text":"We have tried this place three different times, and have ordered different items each time, only to be completely disappointed.  I love Dr. Weil, and WISH I could give this place a good review, but the food is flavorless, boring, unseasoned, and DULL.  I am about worthless in the kitchen myself, and the dishes are about as imaginative as my own awful cooking, but with less flavor.  We give up."}
{"text":"To preface this review, I will mention that the day we visited True Food was the day after Christmas. I don't know what possessed my mom and I to brave the insanity that is the day after Christmas shopping in Scottsdale. We must have just been really craving \"True Food\" after gorging ourselves on cheese, wine, and cookies for a week (or two).   So--the place was super packed. My biggest gripe was getting seated. You walk in (there's 2 entrances) and then you're kind of just standing there wondering what to do. Apparently we were supposed to check in to be put on the list outside, but we didn't know know that. There are 2 hostesses, who honestly just seemed like they were twiddling their thumbs, staring off into space. After about 10 minutes, they finally acknowledged us, and told us it would be an almost 2 hour wait.. Luckily, there is a long communal bar/dining area that's first come, first serve. We snagged a pair of seats and our waiter was with us soon after.   To drink, my mom had the ginger Tulsi tea, which is \"adaptogenic\"...which apparently means that it's some magical voodoo tea that can figure our what's wrong inside of you--and fix it. Sounds good to me! And it was actually super delicious. I should have ordered one as well, but my wino instincts ordered the Chenin Blanc from India--- so good!! Highly recommend.   To eat, we ordered the seasonal vegetable salad, and the red chili noodles. The waiter offered to split the dishes so we could share, which was really nice. Despite how busy they were, the service was relatively quick, no frills, and the food came out surprisingly quick. Everything was tasty- not mind blowing- and we didn't feel fat and sluggish after (+1 star). I scoped out some of my neighbors dishes, and they all looked fantastic as well.  Since we were dining at the community table, we sat across from a lovely couple from Sedona, and ended up having great conversation. My mom and I both enjoyed this aspect of the meal, but if you are one to not exactly enjoy the company of strangers while you're eating, I'd recommend making a reservation/waiting for an actual table.   All in all, I think this is a great healthy option for when you're out and about shopping in Scottsdale. I would avoid during lunch rush, and definitely consider making a reservation. The seating process was confusing, but I can overlook that. I will definitely return the next time I make my way through the desert..."}
{"text":"Promoting themselves as healthy dinner options we had some pretty tasty food.  The vegetable dip appetizer with ranch and an olive did were good.  The sea bass I had was excellent as was my wife's pasta.    One area to improve. How about some ice in the water.  Luke warm served water was just horrible.  Is there a health advantage to serving warm water (maybe there is).    Service was good with them being crowded."}
{"text":"Had AMAZING SERVICE tonight at true foods! It's one of my favorite restaurants my family and I go to all the time. Ask for Caitlin! She was very attentive, sweet, and very knowledgable of the menu. Shout out to you girl! Thanks for taking care of us tonight."}
{"text":"Best salad I have ever had in my life!!!  It was the chicken cranberry one.  OMG!!!    Customer service could be better....................."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, the food is healthy and presented so well, my only gripe is that's is expensive and portions are small. I'm the kind of person that if I'm eating an appetizer and an entree I will likely take some home to go, here I eat everything and I maybe hungry still.   The menu is has juices, and other health foods. Perfect place for health nuts or those who want a nutritious meal.  Unfortunately this place does attract hipster douchebags and people who like to show off their money.  Overall it's a well made restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. I love that I can enjoy delicious food at Truefood that's actually nutritious. Great selections for vegans, like myself. I recommend the TLT with kale salad and the medicine man elixir! The patio is wonderful, even in the hot summer months, thanks to their fans and misters. Very friendly and knowledgeable servers. Great lunch date spot."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's \"Vegetarian\" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!  I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!  I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!  We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!  For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was \"stuffed.\" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion.   We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.  The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people \"off\" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.  We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!"}
{"text":"A couple of things about my recent visit.  First of all, I had the Teriyaki Brown Rice, Local Vegetables, Sesame & Avocado with Tofu.  Since I'm vegan, it was one of the options conveniently marked as such.  And it was delicious!  Flavorful and hearty, I truly enjoyed it.  I took my mother here for her birthday, and both my mother and brother enjoyed it.  I've been a couple of times for lunch, and I have enjoyed it, but neither my mom nor brother eat a lot of food that follows this concept.  My brother, a near carnivore, liked the steak tacos, but thought that the tortilla was bland.  We ordered a bottle of delicious wine, and thoroughly enjoyed the strawberry hemp-milk ice cream.  That should definitely become a permanent selection, because I am vegan and I did not see another vegan dessert option.  And finally, the waiters and staff were awesome.  Our waiter was friendly, polite, and incredibly helpful.  I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for some local selections, a unique mix of (mostly) healthier food, and anyone wanting to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Let me just begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts.  I had heard so much about True Food Kitchen, so I decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  While previously on their website, I was drooling over their Ahi Tuna Sliders; as a result, I ordered them.  I must add that I believe that wasabi (a prominent flavor) BELONGS with anything ahi related.  These sliders came with a wasabi aioli, but it was very bland, and you could not even identify that wasabi was involved.  I asked if there was another wasabi sauce available that was stronger, but instead, the chef gave me a Sriracha aioli which was more mayonnaise (again) than anything else.  The server saw that I was still not enjoying the sandwich (it all lacked flavor, even the fish), so she had the chef make a stronger aioli.  It was ALMOST there.  It was not even hot, only a hit of wasabi.    I know that everyone has a different heat preference, but all I was asking was to TASTE the wasabi.  I needed lunch and needed to jet so I finished the meal with the last wasabi aioli attempt.  I was ready to pay, and to my surprise, the server comped my meal!  It was a pleasant surprise.  I was not impressed at all by my first experience with the food, but because of the nice gesture by the server, I will return again.    True Food Kitchen has a great atmosphere and a friendly and attentive staff.  Try it for yourself. :)"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to update my review :(  We eat at this location 3x a week since it's walking distance from our place. The past month we have been visiting we get our usual dishes. My husband orders the red chili noodles with steak and the first time he ordered this was a month ago for lunch. Wow was it good!! The steak was cooked perfect and the natural juices from the steak gave the noodles a lovely sauce.  The next week we went back for dinner, and we both orders the noodles.. we were so disappointed this time. The steak was over cooked and something in the noodles got burnt because all you could taste was charred burnt pieces. I hate to complain but I did tell the bartender and he said that's the way it's prepared. I left it at that.  Today I ordered the noodles again for lunch thinking maybe the same chef from the first lunch visit would be possibly be there... another disappointment. My noodles were so gummy and overcooked, the steak overcooked and no flavor.  Anytime I leave feedback to the manager or waiter, nothing happens, so I'm not sure what's going on with this location but I'm so sad because it use to be our favorite."}
{"text":"Really well prepared & tasty dishes. I love that I can go here as a vegetarian & pretty much eat anything, but that it also has options for meat eaters."}
{"text":"As a vegan visiting the Phoenix area, I patronized True Food because a family member chose it. I liked the outdoor seating and the \"freshness\" of all of the menu items. There are not very many choices for vegans. The things I was able to order, were good, my favorite being an appetizer of roast root veggies and dips. That seemed to be a hit with everyone at my table. It was a nice portion for the price. I ordered a salad for my main course, which I hate to do. It was just ok. I'm not a big fan of salad dressings, but I think I only had one other option for a meal.   I think I'd like True Food for a pricey cocktail and appetizer, but not again for a meal.  As a final note, I do not know anything about the anti-inflammatory diet, but I find the whole \"grass fed beef\" thing disturbing. Beef does not eat grass, a cow does. Sustainable fish is as impossible as the idea of \"humane meat\"."}
{"text":"This place is great, good food and great selection that always changes. If eat here all the time if I was closer. An experience is love to have more often."}
{"text":"True food is a definite staple if you live in the north Scottsdale area. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. All of the servers are so nice and helpful and the menu options are not only healthy, but so delicious. True has become one of my favorite restaurants. I love coming here and sitting outside & it's such a bonus that they have pressed juices! From the salads to the homemade guacamole you can't go wrong. If you haven't been you should def go!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find such a great natural/organic food place in Scottsdale Arizona.    My wife and I were really happy with it - If you go and are vegetarian, especially try the Tofu wrap and the quinoa pancakes."}
{"text":"The best, healthiest food around. Every city needs at least one of these!!! Hands down my favorite restaurant. Fresh food, organic, you just feel good after eating here. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"I'm a 30 year vegetarian and I loved it! So did my carnivorous friends. I had the Brussels sprouts, herb hummus, Thai basil martini, and teriyaki quinoa with tofu. I would recommend all if it! Yum."}
{"text":"True foods is the best gluten free restaurant ever. Everything is made in house and fresh. I can be certain when I eat there that I will not feel sick! I love the pizza on the gluten free pita, the Farmers Market Crudités is also amazing with the olive tapenade, and the bowls. The service is always friendly and delicious. The only thing I have gotten that I didn't like was the spaghetti squash because it was rather bland. The chocolate cake is amazing! It's gluten free and the ice cream is vegan and made in house. The best thing is that you would never know the ice cream was not dairy and that the cake is gluten free. It is the best gluten free chocolate cake I have ever had."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a whim. We needed a dog friendly patio. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I had the street tacos with sea bass. Amazing! My husband had the bison burger with the kale salad. He loved it. The cocktails were fantastic. I wish Fox would open one here in Tucson."}
{"text":"This place is a five star! Love the food! Love their drinks! My favorite drink is the red moon and i heard if you add vodka it tastes great! There's inside and outside seating. A great atmosphere and the food is just awesome and if you want healthy but tastes awesome then go here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant over 25 times and it use to be a favorite.  The quality and the service have been going downhill.  In June when my friends treated me here to my birthday, we all commented how lousy the service and food were becoming.  Last night was my last night ever going to this place.  My daughter was in from out of town and requested we go here because I would not have chosen True Food again.  We were seated at a table with food all over the floor underneath and a menu laying there as well.  We waited 10 min and many server walked by us but no one acknowledged us.  I finally got up and went to the receptionist to ask if our table could be cleaned and if we could see a server.  Our server let us know he was eating his dinner....really?  My daughter ordered the tacos vegetarian with tofu, I ordered a salad.  My daughter began with a field green salad for $4.  This salad is only lettuce, like TF dumped out a cup of mixed field green out of a bag.  I had to continually stop other servers for more ice or more ice tea.  When our server would approach the table he was still chewing from eating his dinner.   When our entrees were served they did not bring my daughters.  I had to flag down several servers to check on her order.  Our server was nowhere in site since he was enjoying his dinner.  My daughters tacos had only a cabbage mix, no tofu, nothing else.  I wanted to have them redone but we were both so over this place and the quality.  This restaurant use to be trendy and the service spot on but the menu is tired and needs to be revamped, the servers no longer even look hip and trendy.  I am over this place."}
{"text":"True Food Kitchen is somewhere I'd go if I really enjoying over paying for generic non flavorful food. I've been here on dates with girls who are vegetarian / health enthusiasts which I don't mind but why sacrifice flavor.   The only saving grace is the tasty juices."}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in a while.. The chicken teriyaki bowl is perfect.. Wouldn't change a thing, and it's the perfect serving size. My friend has the miso soup and the shrimp with noodles entree, and she loved her options also! The Root and Remedy juice was too earthy for me, but my friend who loves beets really enjoyed it! Perfect outdoor restaurant for lunch before it gets too hot!  Came back today for lunch. Ordered ancient grains bowl, and it was incredible. Perfect flavor on all components and portion. Mom had the turkey wrap with sweet potatoes side. She said it's the best turkey wrap she's ever had, highlighting the avocado and hummus mixture. I had the apple, carrot, ginger juice and will order it every time I visit!!!"}
{"text":"Quality organic food that tastes good. Food is clean and delicious , but i gotta day bring back the bison burger !"}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to go for lunch this past weekend.  He suggested since it is the New Year and we are looking to eat on the healthier side, that we try this new restaurant called True Food Kitchen.    We arrived and at first glance I thought, this place is pretty cool.  It's located where the old Coffee Plantation used to be in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  It's over-sized dramatic lights and open \"Cafeteria style\" seating with a hip twist was interesting to me.   Bringing the kitchen to the middle of the dinning room was certainly a new concept.  They had food prep and pasta making in the middle of the room.  Not sure how well that goes over with the Health Department, but it certainly was innovative.    We were seated and immediately approached by our waitress who was very nice and helpful.  She took our drink order (oh no soda by the way) and returned to take orders. We both decided on salads. I went with the Harvest Chopped Salad, Butternut Squash, Apples, Walnuts, Goat Cheese & Balsamic Vinaigrette.   Meanwhile I saw the table next to us was served soup, and that sounded good, so I asked the waitress to add the Miso soup.   After all was delivered it was honestly very delicious!  The Goat Cheese was SO creamy and with the tangy vinaigrette and other added items in the salad it was such a good meal!    Now for the bad news...I guess it depends on the person but I thought for the portion sizes, It was a little pricey.  At first a $10 salad didn't seem like a big deal to me based on my experience on salads at other establishments, but honestly this was more like the size of a side salad.  I know the ingredients are \"Organic\" and \"Fresh\" but where do we draw lines?  Mind you, I am not complaining about the portion size, because I agree we as Americans over-eat, however the comparability to the price was off.  I don't think I am a cheap, but I just question why we pay more for food that is healthy?  This never really made sense to me.  Just some \"Food for thought\"."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to stop by here on our way back to california. And we were so glad we did! The place is really cute, and such fresh vibrant colors. we sat outside in the super comfortable chairs.   He had this grass-fed bison burger and it was extremely good! I wanted his meal more than mine, but I was trying to eat a little healthier. And to my surprise my choice was also really good! I ordered the street tacos.  The drinks we ordered was the hangover rx and the green arnie. Both were very good, and the hangover one tasted like an orange julius. I don't live in arizona, so I can't wait to try the True Food Kitchen in Santa Monica. I hope it is just as good."}
{"text":"Really very good. Delicious smoked salmon, and the kid's pizza was the best quality I have seen. The chili shrimp was great, and there were super healthy, non-alcoholic cocktails in addition to a really nice wine list and alcoholic cocktails as well, although I didn't try them. True Food Kitchen is not cheap, but the quality is terrific."}
{"text":"The food itself was okay, not bad but also not great.  I would not go again but what really killed the place for me was the lousy service.  Once glass of water, took 20 minutes to get a juice and I gave up on trying to get more catch up or a box.  Skip it, I can save $70 and feel judged with lousy service by having dinner at my mother's house."}
{"text":"Good and fresh! My turkey burger was a bit salty but still good. The squash pie was great."}
{"text":"THEY TAKE YOUR FOOD AND DRINK BEFORE YOU'RE FINISHED AND DON'T EVEN ASK YOU!   Well, I felt the need to change my review here because I had an over zealous server who, not once, but twice pickup my drink or food without asking if I was done!!!!  First she pickup my martini that was only 2/3 finished and than had the audacity to charge me for another one!  Then I ordered the chicken dish and eat less than half of it and next thing I know it was gone from my table!!!  She didn't even ask me if I was finished!  Last time I'm going here!"}
{"text":"Amazing artisan cocktails and great eats. The tacos where excellent."}
{"text":"Please save our hearing! If you are so healthy minded then you should care about this sense. Good grief from the moment I walked in it was blaring and once the room was getting full you almost couldn't hear it but you know no one turned it down. Ruined the experience for me."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance. A bit pricey - we got two non-alcoholic drinks and an appetizer to share and the bill came up to 30$ before tip."}
{"text":"So, always been a fan of this place until I started eating there regularly since I work in the area. So now I can poke holes through this place...kind of like when you stay at a friend's house a while, you start finding out things that you didn't suspect.  Some dishes I will never grow tired of: the caramelized onion tart, kale salad, curry, and the big bowl of raw veggies with the two dips. All outstanding. Other dishes vary from just ok to not at all my flavor profile. I won't hold it against them. But there are a couple of rip offs... ALL DRINKS. All rip offs. Medicine man whatever...watered down. So expensive, flushed with soda water, full of ice. There is literally two sips in the glass.  Totally not worth it at $6 each. At least. Say yes to a refill? Get charged an other $6.  Salads are teeny tiny. I still pay $8 for the tangy kale salad since I'm a bit addicted, but the chicken chopped at $14 is a total joke. I ordered it to go just a few days ago and it looked like a $3 salad. Not even an once of chicken, a few tiny pieces of manchego and ONE date. ONE!!! The container was about 6 inches long and had about an inch tall of salad. Not even appetizer size. With tax, it was over $16. That makes me angry. And that makes me give only two stars."}
{"text":"It's so incredibly rare to find a restaurant at the intersection of healthy and delicious. I give True Foods major kudos for executing on this combo really well. My husband had a really tasty Red Chili Shrimp dish, and my kids had healthy turkey burgers with (baked, not fried) sweet potato bits. They loved their homemade honey lemonade and grapefruit sodas. The hummus appetizer and gluten free pita were to die for. A must for gluten-free vegetarians!  I liked the open kitchen concept but the decor was a bit sterile and chain-y for my preferences (only reason I didn't give it a 5). I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I couldn't WAIT to check this place out. It's another Fox Concept restaurant (and really, they're all delicious). We had friends in town who are mostly vegetarian like us. They love a variety of veggies and aren't afraid to take risks with us.  It's real food, so it's hardly a \"risk\" but the server even said their most popular dish is the chicken salad and not because he thinks it's the best, but because people just select their go-to because they know it's safe and what they like.   We tried the butternut squash pizza (good), ancient grains bowl (amazing spicy sweet potatoes!), Mediterranean salad with sliced raw tuna and fish tacos. We also had the guacamole and charred cauliflower. Of all the food options, the cauliflower was my favorite, but I liked everything.  One thing worth mentioning are the cocktails. YOU GUYS. I know they are a pretty penny, but you will be SO impressed. We tried 3 different ones and loved them all.   It was a wonderfully enjoyable dinner. With 4 alcoholic drinks, 4 entrees and a kid's meal, it came to $152. It was such a lovely evening out. Yum."}
{"text":"I was out for a business dinner last night and a client recommended True Food in North Scottsdale.  The restaurant itself was trendy and had an awesome atmosphere.  It sits in a lifestyle shopping center, but feels like it is by itself.  The entire place opens up to the elements and you feel like you are sitting outside even if in the middle of the place.  The tables outside wrap around the restaurant like a horseshoe.    Cool menu with very fresh ingredients and refreshing beverages.  I had the Cool Spring Salad (over ate on this trip and needed something light).  The salad had a balsamic vinaigrette dressing with strawberries and blue cheese.  It was delicious!    The service was great, yet everyone had bronzed tans, which made my Wisconsin style like whiteness even more noticeable in the AZ sunset...  Definitely a great place for a casual dinner or date..."}
{"text":"I've heard the name before, but my manager was in town last week and she decided to take us here for dinner. It was surprisingly busy for a Thursday night, but we hung out on the patio until our table was ready. I really like the layout of the restaurant, open kitchen, open layout, lots of green and natural materials. Our server was nice and took great care of us. I had their green tea which was good, and had the miso soup and tuscan kale salad with chicken, both of which were really good. Being very \"green\", I didn't feel guilty after eating, especially since the portions were just the right size. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"\"No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd\"   (picture it.....the original Hairspray movie....this was said to me with the same inflection and tone of  Tracy Turblad when speaking to her Geometry Teacher about her hair.. \"Its feathered....not ratted\")     True Food is a better choice for other people.   I finally was able to eat here... as most everyone I know has already been here and raved.  Why?  That.. I'm not sure about.   The place has warm inviting \"butter\" tones with wood accents that all come together to create this bright and spacious restaurant.  It features an \"exposition\" style kitchen with basic comfortable seating.    The first thing I noticed was the STAFF! ... so many..... so available... so...so... Visible.  There was no place for the staff to hide and compare notes on bad tippers or to avoid refilling your water.  Quickly looking around the place, I counted 14 servers, a few bartenders and a few bus/host persons... all to serve about 60 of us that were in for an early dinner (6:30).  The restaurant, when full, seats 120. The staff moved about the place like a dance troupe (yes.. in all sense of the word) , all young , fresh , energy infused servers..Smiling, helping each other out.. it was kinda sickening to see such a large group get along so well... I'm thinking that antidepressants are served with the employee meals.    I noticed a great perk in the refreshments menu, you can add a shot of organic vodka to any of the natural drinks for a $3.00 up charge!  See mom... you were totally wrong.. Drinking CAN be healthy!!  We started our meals with the Shrimp Dumplings and the herb hummus.  When I asked if the dumplings were steamed or pan fried our waiter replied \"No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd\"... silly me and all this time I thought a wok was a pan.    The plump wok'd dumplings were very good, served in a mild mushroom broth with cilantro and scallions  ($10) the creamy hummus was delicious with fresh pita ($8).  The \"salad\" in the menu's description was basically just a small bit of salad place on top of the 2/3c portion of hummus.  Impressed by the apps were really looking forward to the entrees.  Being pressured to choose an entree, I opted for the steak tacos ($14) (What the hell was I thinking? ), my friends ordered the butternut squash ravioli with mushrooms ($13)  and also the natural pan roasted chicken ($18).  2 losers 1 winner arrived...I shouldn't say losers... because, they were ok... just not equal.     The steak tacos were just that... YAWN... I blame myself for not taking the time to review the menu.  2 large steak tacos with a large side of yummy, spicy Anasazi beans.. if I closed my eyes and tasted the tacos, I don't think I could tell if I were at Baja Fresh or True Food... Honestly.. Order the chicken.  The Squash Ravioli were very good, but it was agreed by all that the sweetness of the filling did not pair very well with the scrumptious (yes... scrumptious)  mushroom sauce.  What a shame, the sauce over simple pasta would have fared better in our eyes.  The star of the night, or shall I said DIVA... was the chicken... OH MY GOD.. who would have guessed a boneless, free range chicken would be soooooooooo delicious.  The chicken was pan fried to perfection (skin on to retain moisture) with a light savory seasoning, served over farro (a new whole grain for me).    THIS WAS THE MOST DELIOUS CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN..so very juicy, the flavors so subtle ,  I was pissed the server did not steer me in that direction.   We all ended up eating the chicken since we were all impressed by it.  I hear that the Kale salad paired with the pan roasted chicken is the meal of the gods.    All in all we enjoyed our time there.. but not over the top impressed... I can tell you we will never order the ravioli or tacos again.. but the kale salad and the chicken...that's a different story.  I hear from the manager that the restaurant will be getting tons of attention from both local and nationwide media, so this concept might become the next healthy Chili's.  When leaving the restaurant we noticed a \"protected\" private dining area in the back of the place... may want to inquire if you're with a larger group."}
{"text":"True Foods does not disappoint. If you have a desire to eat a nutritious meal with good flavor, True Foods is your choice. They have refreshing drinks with ginger and lime - yummy. They serve a variety of meals to appeal to different palates. It may be a bit too healthy for some. And for dessert, one of the best chocolate cakes with caramel and vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I love the concept.  Healthy food with a trendy flare.   A cool, hip staff and an incredible buildout make this place a pleasure to eat at.  I've never had a bad experience with the staff.  The food is good, the soup is amazing.  My only quibble: How can you market yourself as a place that makes \"true food\" and sell farmed salmon?"}
{"text":"A very pleasant atmosphere.  Sited in an upscale shopping area it is a good pick if you are interested in so-called healthy dining.  The menu is good with options for all tastes unless you think fine dining is found at Applebee's. Pricing is very reasonable for this area. Wait staff was good and the person greeting us at the door did not flinch or seem peeved when I rejected the table near the door she attempted to foist upon us. (All restaurant staff know to fill the less desirable tables first.)."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. Everything  was delicious... the quinoa burger, the spaghetti  squash casserole were to die for. Service was incredible, everyone was super  nice !  The cucumber lemonade was soo refreshing. It is one of the yummiest places i have ever been to !"}
{"text":"Really great food and the experience is always amazing. Try their mixed drinks/juices too, the freshness is unbeatable. I love taking clients, friends and family when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious.  The drink selection is interesting but expensive.  Hummus appetizer is very good.  Dumpling appetizer a little too \"fishy\" for me.  The bison burger is perfect.  Love eating on the terrace."}
{"text":"Wow the food was so delicious! I Oder the Spaghetti Squash and the mediterranean salad,they were amazing. For drinks I Oder a pina colada also a good choice. Last but not least,  for dessert I Oder the cranberry almond cake it was a little dry, so  defiantly getting their flourless chocolate  cake next time. The service was outstanding, our server was very helpful and sweet."}
{"text":"Ok this place I can go to 5 days a week, just because I need to cook a couple of days at home. I call this place my \"other kitchen\". Yesterday I enjoyed their Citrus Skinny Mojito and just had to have another; which having just one at lunch (non-work) is an anomaly. Keep up the amazing work! And THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"First time trying True Food Kitchen. Very hip and trendy place. Food is impressive in its freshness, simplicity and flavor.  Lots of vegetable/organic options to choose from.  Good place to meet new clients for a quick lunch.  Will try again."}
{"text":"I know this is kind of a yuppy healthy chain, but I gotta say, I like it. Having just changed my diet, this is one place where I can stay within my restrictions and still eat great tasting food -- here's an even better hint: I order all sauce/dressing on the side and the food tastes just as good or better without it!!"}
{"text":"Had a great waitress, excellent food and first class wine and drinks at the Kitchen last night. The waitress, who is part Columbian and part Lebanese was extremely attentive and helpful. We had the Penang curry which was very tasteful and authentic, and the Farmers Market salad. The Truchard Pinot was pricey but worth it.  misters kept us cool despite the incredible heat of the evening. The AC was due to be replaced and inside it was muggy so sitting outside was a fair option. Would recommend this place and never saw or heard any examples of snootiness from anyone. 1/6/13 - have to update on this place as last night we were not happy with our meal. I had my staple ( yes I have it every time I go there) the Penang Curry, usually it is very good but have noticed over the last two visits that it is getting very watered down, and last night it was way too fluidic and had very little Tofu or rice in it. Not impressed, and Diane had the the roast chicken which was not very good, lots of chicken but very little else and she was I'll when we got home. Going downhill or just a bad night, who knows?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I'm sorry... I ate my food and didn't take a photo. It was just SO GOOD I couldn't contain myself. First of all the location is wonderful and the large glass windows make it so welcoming. It's always busy and they do take reservations. The menu is always changing and that's what makes it so interesting. I had the turkey burger and it was super juicy and flavourful. It tasted healthy not greasy. The TLT is PACKED with Tempeh and all around overly stuffed!! My friend got one of the bowls and said it was delicious. I also treated myself to the honey lemonade and it was a different taste which was super refreshing. Overall this experience was 10/10. You are eating delicious food in a great environment."}
{"text":"I usually go to the True Food in the Biltmore for lunch, but came here for date night on Friday. We were offered the patio seating which was low/patio furniture type seating because the wait was long.  We were sat in comfortable chairs next to a fire pit (too hot to turn on), with a view of the courtyard with trees and lighting. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the weather was perfect. My boyfriend ordered green tea, and we both tried something new- the curry. The waitress let us know that we could do half order of shrimp/half chicken. It was delicious!! Warning: it comes out extremely hot! I usually order either the tacos or the chicken teryaki bowl, which are both also very good. You really can't go wrong with anything you order, including the different lemonades and other pressed juices! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Camby and next door was the Biltmore Fashion Park. I wanted to try something new in Scottsdale. True food is not new but 1st choice of crepes didn't work out since they were closing in 15 mins.  The waiter was very welcoming and asked if we had been to True Food. I said yes in Houston.  He was cool this one is the original.  The food, decor, and service was good and consistent between the locations.  I got a nice light dinner of spaghetti squash casserole and was happy."}
{"text":"True food was all I was hoping it would be!  I am always up for a restaurant that serves fresh, healthy VEGGIE food.  I think I am in love with the harvest pomegranate salad--it has butternut squash, nuts, goat cheese, apples and pom seed vinaigrette.  Then I had the butternut squash ravioli which was all I could hope for as well.  The restaurant is light, open and the staff is all wearing yoga style outfits--very Andrew Weil!  I still miss coffee plantation, but I am happy to have True Food in its place."}
{"text":"Good food that is healthy! Yes please! Went with a couple people and everyone's was happy with their food. I ordered the turkey lasagna which was really good and flavorful. My husband had the teriyaki chicken bowl which was really yummy too! I don't think my husband expected to like food with only healthy options ha!!! Service was slow and the restaurant was pretty slow during a Thursday night but the waiter was nice. Overall this restaurant is def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"OMG, YES, YES, YESSSS! As a food-a-phile this was fantorgasmic! Healthy, they understood allergies, they used organic food. They made the most freaking delicious raw fish specials that I've ever had. Ate there every freaking day when I was in Phoenix. They care about everything down to the service. CLEAN, DELICIOUS...What can I say, if I had my way the future of all restaurants would be going in this direction! Seriously, if I ruled the world...they would be in every airport.   Thank you Dr. Andrew Weil, thank you caring people at True Foods. Thank you to whoever the manager is there as they keep the place rocking and on top of it. I love the juices, fantabulous! Absolutely fantabulous.  Love the Nojito, the buddha, the medicine man. Told them I had a soy allergy they understood. The sweet potato hash rocks. Can you tell that I sort of love this place???   Oh yeah, even the bathrooms are cool...Check out the cool hand dryers, so jet space age."}
{"text":"Spot on delicious! Super fresh food. Try the grapefruit martini to start. We had sea bass over the top sweet and moist, cooked to perfection with ancient grains and broccoli ingredients. Edemami dumplings were tender and tasty. Burnt cauliflower was to die for, and last but not least were the desserts. We had squash pie with coconut cream whipped cream and dark graham cracker crust and flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.   Go, go now! Not inexpensive, but worth every bit of it.  The only thing keeping it back from a 5 Star was the level of service. It was haphazard and inattentive although the food came out hot and quickly"}
{"text":"I have been to the True Food in LA and loved everything about it. Last night I brought my parents in with my 3 year old daughter. Our waitress Katie (name was on the check) was absolutely amazing. I was very impressed with her attention to my daughter and asking if she could get her meal out right away for her. Also the edamame dumplings and guacamole are so amazing. Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. Food was poor at best.  Don't let the concept fool you, it's no good..."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. The atmosphere is awesome, service is always great, and the food always tastes wonderful! I am a big fan of the Pita and Hummus. They also have a wonderful selection of drinks, however I always resort back to their delicious Black tea. Prices are reasonable, given it's a healthy menu. You pay for what you get!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had a pleasant experience because they accommodated us very well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a healthier option."}
{"text":"I had a delicious lunch at True Food. Went on a Sunday and they were packed but we were able to find a table outside with no wait. The weather was gorgeous so we took a seat and ordered sparkling iced teas, they were refreshing and tart and perfect for a fall day.  I split the quinoa burger with sweet potato hash and the chicken chop salad. The quinoa burger was served \"inside out\" with no bun, basically two quinoa patties covering lettuce, tomato, feta and some dill dressing. It was really good and the sweet potato hash was the perfect pairing.   The chop salad was excellent, chicken, canberries, dates, jicama, manchego cheese, almonds and champagne vinaigrette.   This would be a 4 star experience except for the fact that the wait was incredibly long. Long to order, get our food and pay our bill. This is a reoccurring theme this place needs to work out. Otherwise if time isn't an issue this is a great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  We have been sitting here for 10 minutes...waitress finally comes over to ask if we have been helped. I respond...no we have been waiting for someone to come over.  She gives a sarcastic smile and says... Ok let me take your drink order.  Meanwhile the other 5 plus waiters are wondering around the restaurant doing nothing.  If it wasn't for the fact that I know the food is good we would have left.  This location needs some serious training in customer service!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of True Food and what it is all about, but honestly I don't know if any of the dishes I've had here make me want to scream from the rooftops. I had the spaghetti squash casserole and I feel like I've made it at home before. We got the sweet potato pie, which a friend raved about, and I found it to be just \"okay\". Same with the charred cauliflower. I did enjoy the people watching, however."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go here for a while and am so glad I finally made it here. The food was so fresh and delicious and I felt great just eating it. I had half a harvest salad and half a kale salad with chicken. Also a glass of delicious Parducci. My husband had the chicken sausage pizza and it was delicious. The crudites were popular according to what other people had on their tables, so can only imagine that was good. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Healthy options here...it's true....foods kitchen!  I love their Seabass entree. I haven't had the spaghetti squash casserole in a long time, but I remember liking it at the time. Their pizza is yummy too!  Restaurant week came by not too long ago and I felt like going here twice because the first time was that good!   So on a weekday and the weekend, I basically ate the same thing.   First course:  Shitaki lettuce cups (tofu, jicama, Thai basil, cashew, sambal) & hummus - both very flavorful, tofu mix tasted hearty for a vegan appetizer  Wild caught albacore tataki w/avocado, jalapeño, yuzu ponzu - this was presented and tasted sharp and salty in a good way  Second course:  Scottish Steelhead Salmon w/smoked onion farro, arugula, corn, roasted beets, pumpkin seeds - I loved this entree! Salmon was cooked medium ish medium rare with a soft pink flesh center. The combo is genius! Flavor, colors and textures were perfect!   Dessert:  flourless chocolate cake w/vanilla ice cream, caramel, cocoa nibs - decadent chocolate but balances well with the vanilla and the nibs give it a solid crunch The chia seed pudding came with bananas and toasted coconut - a nice and light dessert if you don't want something heavy  I also got the refreshing seasonal watermelon drink!   Battle of weekday vs weekend:  Weekday: I enjoyed the albacore tataki this day maybe because it had more avocado, heartier and bigger bowl of shitaki tofu app, great service  Weekend: the shitaki lettuce cups just tasted a bit more overcooked and didn't seem as big in portion as the weekday.  Refill was available on the watermelon refresher as it was not on the weekday. The forever nightmare - friend had the grass-fed steak tacos. Good stuff right? Until she got to the middle of the second taco. A dark think piece of short hair. Hard not to gag, but so sad the rest of that taco went to waste. So sad. And sad I have to envision that hair because I love tacos!  Winner = Starboy weekday  Loser = weekend weak end"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants!!  I love all the delicious healthy options.  I feel that this location at Scottsdale Quarter is much better than the Biltmore location.  The atmosphere and food are both better here.  Everything I have tried here is great, including their drinks, so you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  The only person who might not like this restaurant is someone who prefers \"unhealthy\" or greasy foods ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food ! Organic healthy . Love it . We need more restaurants like this one!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food and fantastic service every time we drop in! We used to go to the Santa Monica location and now that we live in Scottsdale this has quickly become a favorite. The juices are fabulous and the TLT sandwich is perfect for lunch. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I ordered the winter ingredient salad and even tho there were no greens it still was delish. I loved the natural flavors and the subtle vinaigrette drizzled. Fun menu and loved that most everything is local and organic. Def would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super healthy, good food that always leaves me satisfied without guilt.  Really good food and customer service. Good for business lunches."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! It is such a great restaurant! Not too pricy! The decoration adds a great touch and the outdoors patio has a shade which is great-especially during the summer! Outstanding food! Very nice staff and great service!"}
{"text":"The hummus and pita was appetizer was to die for!  I took the servers recommendation and ordered the breakfast sandwich special.  It was delicious and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We have been to True Food at the Quarter about 4 times - it is definitely our favorite Fox restaurant geared after Dr. Andrew Weil's Diet.  The food is good some are better then others.  The mushroom pizza was good the first time but not so good the 2nd time.  The appetizer with all the fresh organic veggies is good but the price of $11.00 is kind of high for veggies with two sauces. All portions are very small so if you are very hungry you might go elsewhere or get 2 entrees.  The appetizers some are bigger than others so ask how many you get before ordering.  Lots of the entrees have soy in them and they do not have Non-GMO soy so this is a downer and not all of the ingredients is Organic so make sure you ask before you order.  The dairy free pudding and the lemon cake were a hit.  the flourless cake was way too little for the price tag.  Expect to pay a lot for little portions and some good food and you will be okay.  the atmosphere in the quarters with the mist outside is great and the wait staff rocks, they will answer all your questions and bring you samples of all the food before you order. Great customer service"}
{"text":"We haven't visit True Food in a few years but someone gave us a gift card so we ventured out.  They updated their menu and it is very very very small. One page with maybe 15 items on it....Not much of a selection, limited options for someone who is soy free and gluten free to less than a handful...  I  ordered the Lasagna which was way overpowering with spices it burned my tongue and very very spicy.  I ordered the ancient grain bowl with no miso and sunflower seeds rather than hemp seeds and it was very good and filling, would order it again.  Wish they had more vegan options and the menu was a little bigger.  My brother had the a bowl as well and we also ordered a coconut refresher.  Two bowls, one refresher drink it came out to about $25.per person....Wish they had GF pizza.  It was cool enough to sit outside but lots of flies, Good place for healthy food if you can find something on the menu but if you have allergies the choices are limited.  The Ancient Grain Bowl I would go back for plus they have Key Lime Pie Yummy"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I had the kale salad, the smoked salmon and the raviolis. All executed to perfection. We certainly miss Michael Stebner's cooking in San Diego.. Now I ll have to come to Scottsdale more often :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I can get anything I want and not feel poorly afterwards. I always get the turkey wrap with extra lemon dressing on the side and a side of sweet potatoes. We have also tried and loved the hummus and pita, kale grapefruit guacamole, some of their specialty drinks, the margherita pizza, their bowls, their burger, and tacos. Everything is great. Service is great. If you are going to go to Fox restaurants often, get the $100 gift card at Costco for $79.99. It's worth it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Whenever I go, it's usually with vegan friends, and yet I am able to find something to fill me up. Great decore and atmosphere. Will return again and again."}
{"text":"I was here for a business lunch. Was in town for a meeting 2-3 weeks ago & it was a nice find. I had the fish taco plate & lemonade.  It's not something you find out in LA, so I thought it was quite interesting and lively.  I like how the restaurant is laid out.  The atmosphere was quite lively & it's hard to talk business, but aside from that, I'd come back again if I were ever in town.  I saw that they had another location in Scottsdale too.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Good but not great. The ingredients do make you feel better about what you're eating (it's healthier) but I can't say the taste is great. I have always had good service here. Flatbreads and salads are different, kinda weird. They have a chia seed banana pudding that's really yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale, and that says a lot because there are so many great ones to choose from.  Yes it is a chain restaurant but it does not feel like one.  The food is unbelievable and very healthy, the staff are all very friendly, and the atmosphere is kind of like a hispster organic vibe but without being pretentious.  I would highly recommend it for a casual weekend brunch or a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I decided to go out on a limb and eat Ahi tuna sushi in the Poke bowl. I usually don't eat sushi. The bowl was an eclectic mix of flavors that mostly worked well together. I'm glad I tried it."}
{"text":"The food here is really awesome. Love going here bc there's a variety of options for everyone. The menu is quite refreshing! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the staff is really friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I am on week one of moving to scottsdale and I am soo happy to see many somewhat healthy restaurants or at least GF choices - this place was good.  I'm thinking scottsdale maybe 2nd place behind SF for the healthy and upscale foodie stuff.  So while I think this place it good, and pretty, they could be even better - I'm not an agave fan, i'd rather see raw honey or natural sugar being used - i am fructose sensitive and from what i've read agave is actually high on the fructose side and not that balanced of a sugar - not as healthy as people think it is.  I'd also like to see more veggies.  Other than that - - great place."}
{"text":"Lots of unique, healthy choices here. Often very busy, so expect to wait. Seems to be well staffed and well managed. Food is earthy and tasty. Prices are high, but Scottsdale Quarter, so... valet your Bentley and enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was good and the ambiance was nice. They were able to accommodate our large group of almost 12 pregnant/new mom plus babies group.  Only thing I had a big issue with was the price for the quantity. I ordered a bowl of the soup of the day and it look more like a cup in most other restaurants. I would have been okay with it if I didn't have to pay $9 for it. I also paid $5 for the kale juice and it was almost all ice and no juice in the cup. I felt a little cheated as I could have just made a batch of both the soup and kale juice at home :( I don't know what the other ladies paid for their portions and everyone got something very different.  So I left feeling hungry and kinda bummed... Oh well. Hanging out with my other hot mamas made up for it. However, I don't know if I will be returning too soon.   Nice spot to go shopping after!"}
{"text":"Great selection of natural, local (when possible) food.  Menu changes with the season.  I had the Steak Tacos which were great.  A bit small, but they were very good.  I tried an off menu watermelon soda (that they make there) and it was really good.  Not a huge watermelon fan, but the drink turned me into one!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love True Foods, so much so that I don't mind the prices. I recommend the chicken salad with farro and dates, the butternut squash pizza, and the chicken curry. Their cocktails are also very good, and their patio is nice. Their healthy drinks are also tasty, too.  Good service every time I go, and I've never had to wait for a table. I also love their open kitchen.   I just wish they had a happy hour."}
{"text":"I am a fan of True Food in San Diego and this Phoenix location did not disappoint.  My Kale salad was perfectly yummy. I tried the steak street tacos and they were tasty. 3 tacos were a blend of the warm steak bits, and yummy veggies with some sour cream. my son in law had the chicken sausage pizza on a gluten free crust. again, very tasty! The food is tasty and comes out attractively prepared. Our waitress was a delight-helpful and knowledgeable.   This location is in the Biltmore shopping center. Parking is validated."}
{"text":"If I had 6 stars to give to one single restaurant, I would definitely give them to True Food! By far my ultimate favorite restaurant. Healthy but great tasting food, excellent customer service and great atmosphere.   I have gone there several times and loved every dish I have ordered. My friends options were excellent as well! Their Kale salad is really good, but the shrimp & goat cheese pizza is to die for!!! I am also a big fan of their turkey burger. The sea bass melts away in your mouth. Yummy!   There is nothing I dislike about this restaurant (with exception of sometimes having to wait to be seated during lunch hours)! I love the concept. Ingredients used are organic, hormone and anti-biotic free, and locally grown. Plenty of gluten free, vegan and vegeterian dishes.   Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's difficult to rate this place because I truly do factor in value when I rate a location and I have a hard time justifying the prices here. I know it's in a prime spot on Camelback but I just don't like spending $5 on hot tea or $10 on a small portion of guacamole.   I know, I know... The ingredients are seasonal! And if that's what you value in a restaurant then this place gets 5 stars all day. Tasty food - delicious, really. Friendly staff, cool ambiance - you're fine in a t-shirt or sports jacket. I get the vegan pizza every time, and as far as vegan pizzas go, this is one of the best. Great, memorable flavors ensure this is always part of my order. Everything else is good but can be a little underwhelming.   If you're vegan you need to order the vegan key lime pie. It's stupid good"}
{"text":"The ambience and look was terrific-- I admit, I had to touch what appeared to be the wheatgrass covered hostess podium.  Dined indoors, but their patio looked to be a comfortable option if not for the triple digit heat (to which I'm not acclimated.)  The kale salad was fantastic-- never had it served that way and really enjoyed it.  The entrees were tasty, fairly simple.   The service was attentive, when you add it up in the end, not particularly a deal, but good place to go."}
{"text":"I think I'll have to go again to try what others rave about...  I experienced friendly, attentive service, refreshing cucumber, citrus margarita but the Tuscan Kale salad- blah! The Kale was well-prepared and very good, but the dish needed something more than a dry slab of salmon. Boring!    Also, we had to wait for a table, but nearly every table of two was sitting at a table for 4 that was designed to be split for more seating- why wouldn't they use their available seating to it's potential?!?! Annoying."}
{"text":"Me: steak and potatoes, maybe a salad before hand. This place: eat your vegetables!!!!  OK, so I don't come here because unlike the food. I come here because my wife does and they sneak veggies into my meals. I do t love anything here, but that's because the focus is on veggies. I eat veggies, I'm trying to eat more, so this place is good for that. However, its not my first choice.   That said, the food is always cooked well and my wife loves this place. Is prefer if they used more simple stuff. I hate arugula, but places like this love to put it on burgers.  I love the atmosphere and location though. If you want to eat healthy this is the place to go"}
{"text":"I love all Fox Concepts restaurants and True Foods was all I'd hoped for and more.  Fresh delicious foods and great service. Love the concept and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hmmm... what to say about True Food Kitchen.  It seems to have take Coffee Plantation's spot at the Biltmore Shopping Center (Coffee Plantation sucked donkey) so Hooray!    TFK  looks fucking sweet from the outside with its floor to ceiling window/walls, but  it's a bit of a tangle on the inside.  While I can see what the owners/desingers where aiming at (wait maybe I can't I've never designed a restaurant...)  ,  I could not find a unifying theme for all of the decorative elements inside. Neon green tiles near the open kitchen , 70's wood pannel lamps in the dinning room, dark stone near the bathroom, and astro turf covering the hostess stand.  The place feels like a mix between fresh and easy and put-put golf.  The wait staff were dressed like car-hops working a veggy-brave-new-world drive thu..  I did like the wobbly butcher block tables.  Neat.    So who gives a crap about how a restaurant looks right?  I'm in it for the food.  I had the ahi tuna sliders (rare of course) with a side of sweet potatoe hash.  Sliders = derishious.  SPH = sadness :(  I loved the tuna, but god damn if the hash didn't come off as icky.   My date had the Teriyaki chicken with bown rice and veggies.  The chicken was overcooked and the bed of rice it came served over was saturated in Teryakie sauce that was rather tasty but became snail killing salty after 3 bites.  She also caught a snag of hot pepper on her first bite that made her scared the dish was spicy.  Keepy Spicey Separately.    Overall it was edible.  Have I had better?  Yup.  Do they have delish drink options, like natural ginger ale and organic honey lemonade? yesh!   But will all the neat stuff about this place and the fact that, like the Tuck Shop, they don't charge and arm and a leg, I still don't see myself ever comming back.  ."}
{"text":"Celebration dinner for 9 ladies.  They let us make reservations.  The table was ready.  Trendy decor unfortunately it was too loud in the big open room and hard to have converesations. They were willing to work with us on our adds and deletes to menu selections.  I added shrimp to an appetizer and it turned out being a great meal.  The wine pourer was very entertaining."}
{"text":"I had brunch here on a Sunday morning; it was fairly crowded and loud, which was fine by me. We opted to sit indoors since there was a 20 minute wait for the patio seating. Plenty of high chairs available, and we were asked to park our stroller in the front of the restaurant. We were seated in what felt like the kids corner-which suited us..our daughter was having a ball smiling at another kid in front of us. The menu was interesting-lots of drinks available.  I loved that they had almond milk available for my coffee. hooray! I had the blueberry muffin with almonds-it was amazingly good, and I had the tofu scramble with chorizo. Waaaayyyyy tooo spicy for me, so unfortunately, I can't give that a good review. It gave me horrible indigestion for hours and hours. I'd definitely go back and try something else.  The menu was inventive and choices colorful-though not a lot of variety.   NO idea if there was a changing table in the rest room. It was completely occupied when I went in, so I opted for the public restroom across the way (right next to the escalator)."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I ate a buffalo burger at True Food Kitchen, and ever since I stopped eating the meats I've been anticipating another visit.   The menu these days looks really good. With various vegetarian options and vegan opt-ins you won't have to read too far through the items before something catches your eye (and taste buds).   For the most part, true food is prepared with healthful ingredients that leave a clean aftertaste. Much care and precision go into the dishes and the young staff is trained in presentation and pleasantries.  This was a genuinely beautiful autumn afternoon and although there were some cons with the service, I may not have paid full attention so - giving the benefit of the doubt - I won't mark that against the restaurant. It gets a solid 4 stars from me.  - wrong order was promptly corrected - questions were asked about our experience - motions were made to please us  It was just like fine dining. Yes, dining there was just that fine. Fine, let me tell you what I ordered...a couple of plates from the \"Vegetables and Fruit\" section and one from \"Sandwiches.\"   1. Torched Avocado:  slices of blackened avocado on top of cucumber noodles, mushrooms, snap pea, watermelon radish, black sesame seeds, and drizzle of turmeric ponzu.  This is DELICIOUSly savory and I will order it again in a heartbeat.  2. Charred Cauliflower:  florets of cauliflower mixed with medjool dates, dill, mint, and pistachio nuts all covered in harissa tahini. This is good, but heavy on the dates. I don't like starting meals with sweetness so if I order this again I'll eat it last - right before dessert.  3. Quinoa Burger:  quinoa patties (actual grains of quinoa shaped into patties and used as buns) that sandwiched a smear of hummus, tzatziki, tomato, cucumber, red onion, avocado, and feta. I ordered this sans the dairy stuff. No likely. Not for me. Not this lifetime.  4. Vegan Pizza:  small thin crust pizza with skimpy toppings. We added nut \"cheese\" too and without this, the pizza wouldn't have been worth it.    If I could have a do-over, I would order 1 and 2 and request a side of fries to fill me up. Mmmm that sounds good. You might see me at TFK again for another meal sooner than I expected."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the openness of the restaurant with it's brightness and open kitchen.  There were literally people preparing food several feet from us.  They definitely don't have anything to hide in their kitchen.  Upon quick glance of the menu I found a couple vegan options to choose from and had a tough time deciding between \"Andy's Favorite 'TLT'\" and the \"Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl\" but when with Andy's Favorite \"TLT\" which Tempeh, Lettuce. Tomato. Avocado, Vegenaise, and Whole Grain Bread.  I had the choice to pair it with a kale salad or sweet potato hash and went with the hash.  While it was tasty and I'd say our experience at True Food Kitchen was unique I must say the prices are a bit steep for the amount of food you receive.  I understand it's healthier food and often that comes with a price tag, but $10 for a basic sandwich is a bit much in my opinion."}
{"text":"I got the lasagna bolognese and it was tasty. The ginger beer was to die for. I would come back just for their ginger beer. They were very busy and our server was just OK. We didn't make a reservation and waited about 20 minutes which was understandable."}
{"text":"Love this place- great food and service. Everything is consistent. They are expensive, but you get great quality food. A must try"}
{"text":"I finally tried TFK and you should believe the hype.  Thai shrimp dumplings with basil, mint & red chili.....amazing!!!!  Panang curry w/ brown rice & shrimp....fantastic, but needed a little sriracha.  Organic corn & eggplant pizza with sweet onion, roasted garlic, goat cheese & basil....outstanding.   Nectarine & berry cobbler w/ vanilla ice cream....so very good!!!!!!!  Not everyone will enjoy the food as much as I did, but I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"When one of our spa guests asked me yesterday where she could get a gluten-free pizza that tasted good, I couldn't wait to tell her about True Foods! My girlfriends and I had eaten there last week and we couldnt believe our luck. We had the mediteranean salad which was a revelation, and the kale pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes. Who knew good food could taste this good?! As the owner of Arizona's largest freestanding resort-style spa, guests expect me to eat healthy. Now I actually want to!   Heidi Lamar, Spa Lamar"}
{"text":"I don't think you will ever be disappointed in this place no matter what you order. You will also feel happy after getting full because most likely you ended up eating something healthy. For sure 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really like True Food. Most of my meals there have left me feeling satsified but not full. We went this Sunday for Breakfast/Brunch & sat outside, which is always nice before the impending doom of summer. We had the greek frittata and chicken hash. Unfortunately both of our meals were just \"eh\" but I'll go back for more again. I love the concept. Hoping for some changes to the menu soon!"}
{"text":"This is the place my co-workers and I go to for lunch every now and then. I am not really sure why lol... It's good but I am bored with the menu. It is just ok and it's always busy. Is it because we think it's healthy? Not sure... I like what I get which always the same... The turkey pita with sweet potatoes. It is decent and pricey."}
{"text":"First time here last week and I'm extremely bitter I hadn't made it over here sooner. Loved my Ancient grains with chicken. Can't wait to come back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Yum! Clean, fresh vibe to the place. Wonderful veggie options and adult beverages?! A rarity for veg friendly restaurants in the valley. Only complaint is the seating. I hate being in the middle of the room and most of the seating leaves you feeling exposed."}
{"text":"First the good stuff. We could get a table on a Saturday night with no wait just by calling ahead a bit. They have a lot of fresh, in-season, and organic food. They cater to people with food allergies, so my gluten-free and dairy-free requests weren't considered at all difficult. Nice variety on the menu. They had 4 desserts, 2 of which I could eat! That alone scores major points with me. The squash pie with coconut cream was a bit heavy on the cinnamon and sweet for my taste, but still delicious. I didn't try the banana-coconut chia pudding, but it sounded good. Staff was very attentive and friendly.  Now the not-so-good stuff. It's in a large shopping center, so parking is quite difficult especially on a Saturday night. The music is very loud, which makes all the customers talk loud, so the ambience felt \"trendy\" but it's annoying to have to almost shout to your friends and family. The drinks are delicious but watered down and over priced. I'd avoid them next time. Food portions on some dishes are quite small. Husband's salmon came with just a small side of mixed greens."}
{"text":"says they are open at 9am on Sunday well we just got here and they aren't opening until 10 soooooo .... um weird"}
{"text":"says they are open at 9am on Sunday well we just got here and they aren't opening until 10 soooooo .... um weird"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this well-priced, quality restaurant that focuses on clean and healthy food choices. Roomy eating area. Plenty if parking. August (server) was terrific, knowledgeable, professional, knew the menu, and did a great job. Enjoyed my edamame appetizer, and loved my teriyaki quinoa bowl selection, which was prepared Prefecture and was a generous sized meal. Menu offers pizzas, bowls, sandwiches, and entrees, and so many things sounded good. Moderately priced. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I didn't realize how close this place was after hearing about it.  I was staying at the Westin and thought walking over in 90 degree heat would be a fabulous idea.  It was packed on a Wednesday.  I figured I would pass the time and talk with coworkers while having a drink.  I liked the concept a lot and the bar scene.  I ended up having a chicken entree, and shared a salad appetizer and hummus with colleagues.  I wasn't so blown away by the place but I enjoyed the vibe.  The food was okay and the hummus was great. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! Everything I have tried on the menu is absolutely amazing. The food was seasoned perfectly and the drinks were mixed well. I love the ability to never feel full even though I ate too much..."}
{"text":"They allow dogs in a restaurant?  They do here and no it was not a medical dog. This dog was barking and wondering around. Trained dogs do not do that they sit or lay down and behave. So if you would not like dog hair in your food find another place to eat."}
{"text":"In a land full of diners, sports bars, and fast food chains, I was delighted to find True Food, a truly unique restaurant that's both health-conscious and delicious. I stopped in for dinner with my brother, sister-in-law, and nephew on the night before our 7-summit hike. We needed fuel to get us ready.  We each had a fun beverage to start. They have an impressive list of 'Natural Refreshers' consisting of various concoctions of veggies, tea, spices, and fruit. I ordered the Honey Bee Ginger Beer, which is a mix of ginger honey, chai spice, lime, and sparkling water. I like all of those ingredients individually, but wasn't sure how they'd taste together. Was I going to have a 'Rachel's trifle' situation on my hands? Maybe, but I went all Joey on this one and loved it. Very refreshing and cleansing. My sister-in-law had the Sparkling Apple Soda, which was basically apple pie in liquid form. She was a fan.  Our entrees arrived quickly:  Turkey Burger for me, Inside-Out Quinoa Burger for her, Seared Spicy Wild Caught Tuna Wrap for bro, and a pizza for the little one. My turkey burger was pretty good despite the weird tasting flax seed bun. I had a choice of kale salad, sweet potato hash, or both as a side and obvi got both. The kale salad was so satisfying with it's perfectly chopped kale, tart dressing and parmesan cheese. I could have eaten a whole plate of those sweet potatoes. Sis and bro both devoured their plates, so I think they liked theirs too. My nephew, who's 2 years old, had a pizza off the kids menu which was ENORMOUS. Easily an adult-sized individual pizza. I think he ate a slice, but luckily it was also delicious so the rest of us had no problem helping him out :)  The ambiance is pretty cool too. It's a large, open, airy restaurant with big windows, exposed stainless steel prep tables, and a big kitchen right in front of you. Service was good, though bro and I both think our server could've let up a bit on the eye-contact-intensity.   Awesome spot overall. Can't wait to go back and try the butternut squash pizza!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there, the place is always packed. Once you eat there you will know why. The food was amazing. We ordered this \"The natural\" drink, ohh the flavors I loved them. Then came the Mediterranean salad, very good, then the Kale something pizza, which was totally completely unique... We ordered cheese ravioli from the kids menu for my son. My son just loved it, i mean i know my son, he is so picky and fussy about his food and it was just 6 o clock and he ate his meal very nicely, that means it was sure was delicious.  We are vegans so great for us. The food was so healthy and fresh, we just loved it"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. They have this raw veggies appetizer and it's nothing like I'd ever seen before. When i say raw, I mean it seems like they have a garden in the back and they just picked them.   Their edamame and dumplings are so good. They are flavorful! I wish the portion was bigger. I always get their squash casserole and it's one of the best tasting foods I have ever had. I find myself craving it at random times very frequently.   I love eating here because you can taste the fresh quality in every bite of the food but also because you don't feel like you're gonna have a heart attack after you eat."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I was looking to take my mom out for her birthday and wanted to dine at a restaurant that gave us that going out for a fancy dinner feel, while still being healthy. My parents were slightly skeptical (it was a drive for us) but once we arrived they were pleased with every plate we ordered. My dad had the poke bowl and he was in heaven! It made me happy to see my parents enjoy such a good meal that was HEALTHY. The roasted veggies to start were also phenomenal. I don't live in AZ though and I was looking forward to being reunited with the edamame dumplings and they were out which really made me sad! Guess I'll have to wait another few years to have a bite of those!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place, food is healthy and atmosphere is great. Price is a little high but it's a Fox Restaurant in Scottsdale Quarter so it's to be expected. If you're looking for something filling go with the Bison Burger."}
{"text":"I love to go out to dinner or lunch or really any meal. It makes that meal a little extra special. As much as I like making a meal into something special, I literally crave to go to some place and feel like I haven't eaten something that just added 20 pounds to my stomach. True Foods did something that I have rarely experienced, I walked out not only feeling not heavy, but feeling better than I walked in.   I admit, I like the unhealthy, bad for you, nasty, ginormous amount of calories, full of not so good for you food. I fully admit to that. I like that good tasting but not nice to your body stuff. I do, however crave something that is a little on the healthy side. Nay. I crave that even more! I would love to go to a restaurant and say, lay some thing in front of me that doesn't weigh me down! Slide me something that will soothe my hunger and tease my taste buds in to nirvana. Yet, that place is such a perplexity of possibility that I rarely ever find it.   Then I come to Phoenix.   A client suggested that on a recent trip to Sedona, when I had a little layover in Phoenix, I slide on over to True Foods. I am a fan of Dr Andrew Weil. I think and feel his philosophy of eating things that are nutritionally sound is quite up my alley many times, and when my client told me about his place, I knew I had to venture forth in to the great unknown to me of Phoenix and have lunch.   Parking, I did so in the back. Need I place myself among such fancy schmanzy cars up front? Nay! I am fine rounding myself around back. But then I nearly stumbled in. Weary from the two hour drive I just slaved over, needing sustenance that would not only revive but rejuvenate my wilting body. Holla! I made my way to the bar for refreshment and refreshing meal. I sat down, about ready to gnaw an arm or two off when I saw the enlightened menu. So many choices, such little room for all of it. I had to choose wisely. I started off with a green nojito. Refreshing indeed! Certainly my taste buds as well as my body were singing high praises!  I settled on a certainly reserved lunch. the Teriyaki brown rice stir fry with chicken. Exciting? No. But it was damn good. Avocado, bok choy and spinach with tender pieces of chicken. Hello! I could have munched all day on that, but to do so I needed a little more drinky drink. Off to the green Arnold, more tea that I thought but the final product placed a happy smile on my face.   What threw another smile on my face? The friendly and smiling service I got not from one, nor two, but from three separate staff members. Nice. I like.   The price was fine, nothing I wasn't surprised about, but really when I left I not only felt good, I felt great. I felt like I was energized and ready to go. Honestly that is a hard thing to find when I eat out. Rumor has it this place is expanding. Um suggestion? Chicago would love to embrace a healthier eating lifestyle, okay... I would love, no LOVE for you to expand out my way. I would fight Andrea R for a spot for first in line, but I know I would win. I can elbow harder.  Okay... I can... but I would be happy to be second in line just as I had a place to have some place healthier to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered the Harvest Chopped Salad and Banana, Espresso, Pistachio, and Date Muffin. The salad had the best combination of fresh fruits, creamy goat cheese, and dressing. I would not complain if I ate one of those every day! The muffin was so delicious, what a combination of flavors! The only down side for me is that it was quite pricey. Don't get me wrong, the food was mouth-watering, but I wouldn't want to spend that much money on a regular basis."}
{"text":"So grateful for this organic oasis! Some seating more interesting ambiance- avoid outdoor corners which are not your best choice. Despite any wait or funny service this food is remarkable and delicious and you feel gratefully absent of GMOs when u go. Try the grapefruit"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We had lunch and enjoyed some salad and peanut butter, strawberry, banana sandwich. Loved it all!  Our hostess and waiter were both fantastic. Will be back to this location, way to go Fox."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times and \"take away\" 3 times since their opening and have had great \"clean, organic, healthy\" food each time.  Love it and it makes you feel so good.  Great decor, I practice the diet philosophy and really appreciate the extra hard work that goes into the prep.  The salmon, wild Alaska sockeye, sustainably harvested--thank you.  More US restaurants need to buy wild Alaskan fish. The salmon was as good as my Alaska summer salmon eating experience at Cafe Orca.    Not overcooked--thank you again.  The black cod is fabulous, paired nicely with a sake.  The salmon came with a delicious kale salad, simply flavored with ?pecorino? cheese, evoo and lemon--wonderful and great for my health concerns.  Have had all the appetizers and each is great in its own right and you really can't loose.  Now I just have to get beyond the fish and try some of the other entree's.  I like that they don't offer any chemicals and feature organics and take away is dished up in biodegradable packaging.  Service is efficient, friendly and unpretentious.  Only one fault, once, the hostesses were too busy with their personal conversation to say good bye--no biggie, since I go for the food which you can't get anywhere else.  Price is good considering the extra expense they incur for procuring higher quality ingredients and the extra cost of food prep requiring more labor.  A good choice for lifestyle conscious dining, so take that really fussy, eccentric, quirky friend that is never pleased and watch the smile return to their critical face.  Worth every penny!  One itty bitty suggestion for Sam and Andrew--Alaskan Oysters on the half shell!  I'll be back--soon!"}
{"text":"This place has all the amazing potential in the world. It's a cool concept and I certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available, but I gotta say: bland, boring, blah.  The hummus was good, but certainly not the \"best in the valley\" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.  My \"LTL\" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.  The vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.  I appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate \"water bottle waste\" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.  The honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).  Our service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.  I am all for health and I support the cause, but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes."}
{"text":"A fun stylish and energetic restaurant. Service dance to be friendly and upbeat.  Pros: Decor Energetic mood  Nice varieties of dining areas High quality ingredients Unusual ingredients that can be tasty You can get healthy food that will satisfy almost anyone  Cons: Menu context not necessarily as healthy as they seem to advertise Can get really busy"}
{"text":"The Wild Ahi Sliders from True Food Kitchen come with wasabi, radishes, cucumber and a sesame brioche. Don't be mislead, the wasabi is merely a nice little portion which gives you a perfect essence, no epic nasal burns here. I ordered mine with the sweet potato hash which was absolutely amazing and the Green Arnie (Matcha Green Tea & Honey Lemonade) for my drink which was very refreshing and a perfect match. If you get the opportunity to stop in, look for Nate he's the cool guy at the bar. He'll get you squared away. True Food Kitchen is a cool place, great atmosphere, with awesome people. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretentious Snottsdale  restaurant.  Service good, therefore a star is given.  No happy hours just regular prices. It was very difficult for me to find anything that I felt I may like.  I finally decided on the chicken salad.  I have eaten chicken salad at MANY restaurants and they are all normal chicken salad.  This was more of a tossed greens salad with a small amount of cubed chicken pieces.  Not what I classify chicken salad.  And to top it off $12 is what they charge for this plate of salad greens.  I was so disappointed that I sent it back and decided not to eat anything there. Sandwich prices start at $10 (for a tomato and lettuce sandwich) to $16 for a bison burger. I do not plan to go back there again or any of their other True Food locations.  It is a good restaurant for rabbits."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with True Food Kitchen on a trip to Scottsdale. The restaurant was recommended by a coworker familiar with the area, this was exactly what the doctor ordered after shopping through Scottsdale Quarter. There was a 30 minute wait, which was super easy and well worth it! I had the seasonal salad with roasted butternut squash and Brussels. Our waiter, Laurian, was perfectly attentive and effortlessly friendly. He even surprised me with a birthday pie after hearing my birthday was close by! Not only would I recommend this place, I will also be buying the cookbook to try my hand at a few of the recipes at home!"}
{"text":"LOVE their coconut chia banana pudding & their fresh kale juice!!! Their food always tastes so fresh & healthy. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food with healthy ingredients & options. Lovely juices. Love their chia pudding. Their butternut squash pizza is fantastic. Their sea bass is good as long as you ask for the disgusting sauce on the side & don't eat that. Great salads. Nice, open kitchen & open air setting. There's almost always a long wait for a table, though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the concept - fresh, healthy dishes you don't have to feel bad about consuming. Lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options and plenty for meat eaters too - I think True Food can probably accommodate most people's dietary needs.  I saw a turkey burger on the menu and was sold - I love turkey burgers with all of my heart and had high hopes that the True Food one would be amazing. In fact, it was pretty \"meh\" - dry and definitely overcooked which gave me a sad. I do love that they happily let you split your side choice so I got 1/2 sweet potato hash (also \"ok\") and 1/2 kale salad (absolutely amazing).   I wish there were more options for unsweetened drinks - most of the tasty items included honey lemonade or sweetened tea. That said, a plain house iced tea was good & freshly brewed. Service was great - friendly, prompt and enthusiastic.   Although I was pretty disappointed with my burger, the rest of the menu looked amazing and I would have no problem returning to check some other items out."}
{"text":"My sister and I are obsessed with True Food.  The staff is always on par & occasionally serve up some free drinks or appetizers (which are all so tasty). Our favorites are: the kale salad with chicken, a side of the butternut squash w/ ketchup & that onion/garlic cheese tart as an appetizer.  The vegetable krudite and the hummus are both great ways to start your meal.  We ordered the butternut squash ravioli by accident, and loved this dish! The spaghetti squash casserole is also amazing.  Make sure you order their housemade lemonade and also try their desserts.  True Food is simply amazing :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night and we enjoyed it! The atmosphere was very laid back and casual. All of the staff was very friendly and our waitress did a great job of answering any questions we had about the menu.   I had the inside out quinoa burger and my husband has the bison burger. We got a mix of both sides and they were delicious! My fav was the kale salad. Very fresh and vibrant. The sweet potato hash was great as well! I didn't try the bison burger but my husband seemed to like it. We also tried the Medicine Man and Cranberry Limeade drinks. Delicious. My husband was surprised they didn't serve sodas but I love the fact that they keep everything natural and healthy.   The only thing I would say was everything seemed to need salt. Which is fine because you can add as much as you want with the salt shaker, but it would of been nice to already have it seasoned. We plan on going back though for sure!"}
{"text":"Service was great; staff was very friendly. As I was lunching alone, they made great conversation and recommendations about what to have. I had the kale aid to drink, edamame dumplings, on a suggestion from a friend, and the ancient grains bowl with steak. It was all fabulous!!!  Must go when you're in the quarter."}
{"text":"Not sure about this place and its amazing reviews.  The service was slow and food came out cold.  We got a pizza and burger both came out super cold, it took so long that we didn't even send it back because we were starving.  Might do a retry but nothing was so amazing that made me want to go back."}
{"text":"I'm confused a little on this place and here's why.   1)Spiffy new, contemporary interior but it seems more like a fancy Pei Wei than an upscale restaurant. The prep table is in the front of the house, and why do I need to see people cut up vegetables as part of the dining experience?   2) The first thing you see on the menu are fresh healthy fruit drinks then at the bottom of the list they say \"add a shot of vodka for $3\". Seemed very strange to me.   3) We had great service, actually some of the best I've had in a long time, but there were easily 10+ staffers hovering around as you walked in which kinda made it like I had just pulled into a used car lot with all the salespeople getting ready to pounce on me. I'm guessing there were 30 employees total that night and about 60 guests in the place.   4) Food: Had an onion tart, butternut squash raviolis and a side of fresh green vegetables. Can't complain much food was really good, but in that healthy, locally grown, organic, blah blah blah way.   I like this place, but it's in the Biltmore and I don't typically go here often at all. Food is good, simple and fresh so maybe a better lunch stop with the girls than a hearty dinner destination with the boys."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time this past Thursday evening and it was amazing. I like the inside of the restaurant, it was really nice. Well, I ordered a pizza, but I couldn't decide between a traditional style pizza or the wild mushroom which had mushrooms, asparagus, and a garlic base. The waitress was nice enough to let me get a half and half with the two. After I got my food, my pizza looked so good, I couldn't wait to take a bite. It was heaven when I did. The crust is amazing! There's so much to say, I'll leave it at that,  but I would totally come back to this place."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and a high quality of food.  Usually pretty busy and can get a little noisey"}
{"text":"The first time I visited, I had the Spicy panang curry with shrimp. It was pretty good! The shrimp was cooked perfectly, curry sauce was spicy and satisfying and it made you happy without sending you into a food coma.  The restaurant itself is nice, plenty of outdoors seating, service was efficient and the staff friendly. I also ordered delivery from here once. I had the ancient grains bowl with chicken. And while every component of the dish was good, it was bathing in oil... which was disappointing.  Willing to go back and see if they can be more consistent. Because otherwise its nice to have a place that has healthy food that is very yummy (and close by!"}
{"text":"The healthiest brunch restaurant I've been to! Atmosphere: pretty place with an open indoor space & outdoor seating. It was a bit pretentious & took too long to be seated, especially since it wasn't busy. Food: I had a coffee, banana bread, & breakfast sandwhich with sweet potatoes hash. Most made with organic ingredients. Flavorful. Fresh. Tasty. Pleased. Price: more than fair, especially for organic ingredients & large portions.  Service: good. Prompt. Most were young servers with decent enough attitudes :/"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now. The first time I went was for lunch. I got the TLT sandwich with kale salad and sweet potato hash on the side and a 'medicine man' drink. The food was spot-on and I loved every bite. The drink was fabulous. The service was adequate. The second visit was for dinner on a Saturday night. This time we shared shrimp dumplings which were delicious. We also shared the daily raw fish appetizer, which was yellowtail. Yellowtail is my favorite sushi fish but it was cut too fine and was overpowered by the radish  - just ok. My husband had the prawn ramen which he raved about (and looked great). I had sea bass which tasted good and was very satisfying. We each got cocktails which were tasty and not weak. Service was fabulous and we had a great meal. The third time was with a large group of about 14 and the service was really efficient, friendly, and together. Everyone enjoyed their food. No, it's not cheap but it is quality, tasty, sustainable food. This restaurant is now a firm favorite and we will be going back often."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about True Foods and so we decided to try it since we live so close by.   The restaurant is modern deco type of place with wood floors and wood tables with lots of green booths inside. Seems like the place is warm and welcoming. The only thing about the inside is that the air conditions is on low and was blowing right at our table. So it was a little cold for our liking but we survived.   I had the bison burger with sweet potato hash. The burger was cooked just right and very juicy. On top of the burger was mushrooms, unmelted provolone cheese, and greens. It was really good. The sweet potato hash was different. Potatoes cut in tiny chunks. I thought that was pretty good as a side with the burger. My wife had the Brown Rice bowl with chicken. It had a lot of green vegetables and was very tasty. My wife said the greens weren't overpowering and just right. Not too much salt. She really enjoyed the bowl. The one thing is they don't give out too big of portions. I would say on the medium side. We all left still a little hungry but to food was very good.   The service was pretty good. The waitress greeted us once we got to our table and she really knew the menu. She was able to tell us what was the most popular and what she liked. She always made sure we were okay and filled our cups but she really didn't have a personality. Can't blame her cause she was very busy with other table.   Overall, the meal was good and we enjoyed it. We'll probably be back but when who knows."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times, and I feel that I can paint you a (not so) pretty picture of the place.  Let me start by applauding their separation from Sam Fox, the Chef Boyardee of overpriced cardboard.  Maybe they will find genuine inspiration and give the audience something more original and exciting.  I've had the grass fed burger, which is pretty good - served with parmesan, mushroom and caramelized onions.  But so is anything with parmesan, mushroom and caramelized onions.  I may be willing to eat tree bark covered in that.  So it's not exciting.  Neither is the Inside Out Burger, which is in no relation to the movie Inside Out nor a distant cousin of In N Out Burger.  No - this is high-falutin, grade A health movement swill.  Come to think of it, I was a little depressed after eating it, so maybe there is a hint of Pixar in it.  The Poke bowls, again, are Yardhouse quality re-branded as the latest Keto/Paleo/Rowan Atkinson/Richard Simmons catering health food.  They are good, but even better because the health nuts have a Mecca to pray at while they eat the Yardhouse food.  True Food Kitchen is the leader of the Dadaist movement on health food.  They have taken the artistic works of so many great restaurants and put a mustache across them, hoping you will eat mustache \"because, you know, it's healthy for you.\"  But don't look for originality."}
{"text":"The food scene in Scottsdale is top notch and True Food Kitchen was no exception. I wandered in for lunch. Since I was dining alone, I sat at the bar, which was the perfect place for people watching and observing the bustling lunchtime scene.   I ordered the Organic kale Tuscan salad to start. It was phenomenal. The dressing was tart and packed a lot of flavor. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Ancient grain bowl which was served hemp seed, a few vegetables, and the meat of your choice. It actually was amazing. I wasn't expecting to like it as my ch as I did. It was so simple, yet was very satisfying. It was served with a lemon based dressing that brought life to the vegetables and grains in the bowl.  I really had a phenomenal meal at True Food, and would highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area, particularly if you appreciate healthy foods stripped down to the basics."}
{"text":"Dissapointing.  The service was good, and that is about the end of the positive comments.  The spirits and beer selection is pretty minimal.  I had the cheese and artichoke pizza which was very bland and a bit burnt.  The only real flavor was the goat cheese.  The artichoke was visibly there but tasted like almost nothing and there was virtually no sauce or seasoning of any type.  The other meal was a bun-less quinoa burger, again pretty much tasteless.  it looked very good and interesting but totally lacked any seasoning.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at true foods! This particular location at Scottsdale Quarter has incredible service too! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here twice in one week because I loved it so much. The location is gorgeous and since I went during the holidays, outdoor seating was very scenic. The kale salad was my favorite and the butternut squash spagetti a close second. I wish it wasnt as overpriced as it is for how big the portions are but I guess fresh ingredients come with a price!   Am excited to go back and try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"update: my contribution changed the vote results for kid friendly. :)   I don't know why the header says its not good for kids. Why? Because there isn't a mascot? or flashing lights, tv's, games? Well thank you very much it was a wonderful experience for my family including my 3 year old boy.   Atmosphere was calm and clean. I loved the design and the organic everything. The food and the concept is  outstanding, and very pro kids! Especially ones that you don't want to raise on drive-thru food or that have a particular diet.  Little boy ordered turkey burger, fresh lemonade and we got the tacos.    Its pricy!  But I suppose that's what I get for being in that part of town."}
{"text":"My family of four were all very happy with our dinner:   Hummus, pita to start with the crudités add-on ($4).   Very interesting and fresh raw veggies on the plate.   Kiddos shared the miso soup with mixed mushrooms, tofu and scallion and I tasted- delicious.  Hubby thought was salty.   To drink we all got various drinks and all happy:  I got hot ginger with agave and asked for extra ginger.  We all loved it.  Kiddos got two different pomegranate drinks-- one with chia.   Both thoroughly enjoyed.  Hubbie and I also enjoyed our own cocktails-- his with bourbon and mine was some Thai basil, grapefruit martini and asked for muddled ginger.  That shows flexibility!  For entrees, I got sea bass with sauce and bed of purple roasted potatoes, And Brussels sprouts.   Kids ordered from kid menu and got the chicken with brown rice and veggies and because they are growing, opted to share a third dish: margarita pizza.  Hubbie got shrimp and noddles with sesame.     Finally for dessert we shared the chocolate flourless cake with vanilla ice cream and the date and pear cake with ginger fro yo.   Kiddos shared the pot of chamomile tea and hubby got the soy cappuccino. Both also very good.     Server was attentive and patient while answering all of our questions.   Total bill was $150-- a bit high for four but we did got a lot of food.  Bottom line: recommend highly"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. I love the all-natural, healthy menu, and all the wonderful beverages - not the usual sodas. The atmosphere is very contemporary and trendy with a garden feel. It's a fun place to go for lunch with the girl friends!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with this restaurant. We dined at the one in Scottsdale, there were four of us and everyone tried something different. I had the Seabass and I'll have to say that was the most delicious dish I think I've ever tasted! My friends had the salads, the Thai dish and appetizers but all were very good! great service, can't wait to go back!! which they would open one in Chandler or Tucson!"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant I can go to and have a large selection of non-dairy entrees!  Ever since going non dairy one thing I've really missed has been pizza but no problem here with the butternut squash and almond ricotta pizza...excellent! Highly recommend True Foods Kitchen!"}
{"text":"We were here visiting the Phoenix/Tucson areas and it happened to be Valentines day so we stopped in for a nice dinner.   It was a nice start to a wonderful weekend. I had the Salmon and my husband ordered the steak street tacos.    What a romantic and delicious meal we had that night.  The  salmon was melt in your mouth good. My husband doesn't usually care for salmon and even he loved it.   He  loved his steak tacos too.    Gobbled them right up.  For dessert we had a dessert trio and that was also very good. Service was excellent as usual.  We have been to the Newport Beach location and have always enjoyed True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most amazing health food! The fat and carbs that other restaurants contain in their foods and dishes are not in this food and are not missed. The wait staff is AMAZING and the head chef is beyond kind and humble. The vibe is very relaxed yet energizing. I definitely recommend this restaurant. We live in Houston and after speaking with the chef I will be a frequent visitor to the one there."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, talk about great atmosphere, incredible customer service, great attitudes, and... of course incredible... healthy food. I don't get to come down here much, but when I do, the steak taco's are incredible. Anytime I have a visitor in from out of town, I make a point to come to True Food. The only drawback?.. its popular, its good, so you have to be patient and wait for a table on a busy day. All-in-All, one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Phoenix restaurant. I'm not good at commitment (don't tell my wife), so I'm the guy who asks waitstaff for recommendations. When I couldn't decide, she offered me two half portions of a salad and some curry thing. Loved both! The lemonade is tasty too!"}
{"text":"The menu looked fab, so we ordered a lot. The food was so delicious, we couldn't stop eating and in the end asked for it to go. Love this place, I will certainly be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and had to wait 35 min extra to be seted with a 2 years old in our party. After they give us a table we waited and waited to get a server. Food was made incorrectly for 2 of the guests and nobody seemed to care. We invited our family from out of town to celebrate our 2 year old son... and everything was a complete mess."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, that leaves you feeling totaly satisfied and healthier then when you came in."}
{"text":"I was dying to get this place and at first I thought it wouldn't be good but it was amazing!!! Very nice ambiance. Delicious food. And great service! The kale guacamole is to DIE FOR, as well as the Ginger Lemon drink on the menu. I can't wait to go again!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food! As a vegan, it's refreshing to go to a restaurant that has several plant-based options. The food was always fresh and tasty.  However, certain dishes had too much oil (in my opinion).  I tried the Butternut Squash pizza which was delicious, but it was doused in oil.  The Sweet Potato Hash also was very oily and burnt sometimes.  Everything else I tried was fabulous.  The Ancient Grains Bowl is the best dish on the menu! Friendly staff and great outdoor seating.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great vibes, drinks and food but almost two noisy and long long waits.  The best margaritas with cucumber.  Best idea is to score seats at the bar when the wait is long which is often is the case.    Came up from downtown Phoenix on a business trip and was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing squash pie! Have to try it!! A little bit of heaven!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night and absolutely loved it.  The food is extremely fresh, tasty, and the options are various and interesting.  Our server recommended that we try their fresh squeezed juices and we each ordered them, one being called the hangover.  Very yummy and if you want, you can add alcohol to them.  Our server was great, explaining the menu and the vision behind True Food and everything they make.  Its for the most part local and organic food and you feel good eating it! There's an italian side to it and an asian side to it, we did both and were very satisfied! I highly recommend the turkey bolognese and mediterranean salad."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place to eat in Phoenix. And i make sure to eat here at least once during my 1/month trip.  After many visits this is the first time I have reason to complain. The food per normal was fabulous (love the tuna tataki) but couldn't get anyone to take my drink order or food order.  Ate my appetizer before drink arrived!  Place feels different, hope they aren't under new mgmt. food IS amazing. Flavorful but healthy!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to find high quality organic foods for reasonable pricing.  We were able to sit outside at a table with a fire pit which just made the experience even better.  The drink list is extensive and all that we had were super good.  Will be going back to try something new on their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat here atleast twice a week! The food is fabulous and there is something for everyone! My favorite is the ancient grains! So delicious! I highly  recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fresh and great flavor. I love how the menu changes so it doesn't get boring.  This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time squelching my inner cynic here. Every single menu item comes with a side of karma, or guilt, whichever you prefer...  I think this place is having an identity crisis: they tout local vegetables and wild-caught Alaskan salmon on the same page...it seems they are more concerned with promoting the appearance of soul rather than actually making good on the barely-unspoken claim to be \"good for you.\" They know exactly which keywords to highlight to draw in the suckers who think Organic=Virtuous.  The food was good. I had the hummus appetizer (very garlicky and I cleaned the plate) and the squash ravioli (too \"squashy\" for my taste). Nothing to write home about, and nothing to draw me back for a second time."}
{"text":"There's now one in Santa Monica, CA - yeah buddy!!!  YUM."}
{"text":"Service was fast, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.   The pizzas are 10 inch, six slices of culinary perfection. The nut ricotta is curd balm. Perfect texture and saltiness.   As for the guacamole, I was not impressed. Grapefruit is a great idea but in practice it was inferior in more than one way, lacking a citrus flavour as well as missing a sour or zangy tongue taste. Also the pablano pepper offered no barbeque or smokiness nor was it spicy. A guacamole that wasn't tangy of spicy is like a Mulligan.   The char califour did not live up to expectations for me, but anyone with a sweet tooth will enjoy the dates and mint. Honestly without that sweetness it would have been great. It has a great kick of flavour but I was told it would spicy. Just not a fan.   I would love to come back and try the TDL tempeh blt crossover. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a true foods - met a friend there and immediately was impressed by the vibe, energy of the waitresses, and even the friendliness of the manager who stopped by to greet us and chatted - we were immediately made to feel at home.  I decided to be adventurous, since I'm not really an organic eater, and let the waitress, Kayla, order for me. She talked it over with another waitress, Rebecca and the manager and served up the most unbelievable entrées and dessert I've had in a long time. I don't even know what it's called, I just know that if you ask for Kayla or Rebecca and let them pick, they will blow your mind.  You know it's an amazing meal when you laugh every bite. I literally want to go back for my next meal and experience it all over again. Curtis is doing a phenomenal job leading his staff, and this is something I intend to repeat again and again."}
{"text":"Trendy spot, local ingredients & strong service   Location: True Food is in a bit of an upscale outdoor mall area; there's a bunch of valet parking (with validation) but also free parking in the north section as well. You may like this but I wasn't crazy about it.   Food: We came here for brunch and quickly exclaimed at all the interesting choices for vegetarians, vegans and people who are neither. The Sunrise Bowl was great: the egg was well cooked and the bowl had fresh ingredients in it. The portions weren't super large. The Garden Scramble was okay too, though the eggs a bit tasteless. The squash pie was a highlight of the meal: light and tasted a bit like pumpkin. The whipped cream was a good pair and not too heavy.   Environment: The decor was open and modernly decorated. They also had some heat lamps in their more outdoor area, which felt nice.   Service: Our server was attentive without being annoying. He seemed to appear at all the right times - pure efficiency."}
{"text":"Great to go service for the out of town diner looking for a quality meal.  I had the spaghetti squash casserole.  The size was right- in fact plenty.  I also had a artichoke pesto pizza, as I had read the squash casserole was small.  It was too much food- but I don't feel guilty.  I feel great.  Great food for a healthy life!"}
{"text":"Okay, this place really got on my nerves, and this is why:   I went there for dinner at the hotel receptionist's suggestion for a local vegetarian restaurant. I walk in around 7 pm and sit at what looks like a juice bar. I pick from the menu something called \"medicine man\" which purportly contains pomegranate juice.   I ask the 20-something server, \"This is real fresh juice you make yourself, correct?\"   \"Everything you see here is made here,\" he says - a brilliantly vague answer considering the sham he is about the serve me.   \"So you actually have the pomegranates and then you juice them yourself?\" and he nods affirmatively. I see a commercial juicer so I believe the little punk.  Guess what I got? For $6 + tax, I get this pinkish watery thing in an 8-ounce plastic cup, at least half of it filled with ice.   No, this gotta be a mistake. Maybe it tastes like heavily watered down Kool-Aide because the ice has melted. So I send it back and ask for juice without ice.   I am informed that without ice I would get half as much, which was fine with me, thinking now I'm going to get something that actually tastes like fruit.   I watch him return almost instantly with a smaller glass cup. Wow, he's gotta be the fastest juice-man on the planet, I joke, but inside I am cringing because freshness and instantaneous don't go together and the realization that I've been had is beginning to settle in.    Yes, it tastes the same. It's the same pinkish watery crap with all of four blueberries floating on top.   \"I thought you said you have fresh juice.\"  \"It is fresh,\" he insists matter-of-factly. \"We just sell so much of it that we have to make it in the morning.\"   \"And why does it taste so watery?\"  \"Oh, we top it off with soda water.\"  I ask to see how it is done. He shows me a large dented metal coffee urn, labeled \"medicine man.\" He pours the now day-old \"fresh juice\" and then tops it off with a soda gun.   There is nothing fresh about the pomegranate either. It's right out of a POM bottle.   I paid, even left a tip, and strolled out, hungry but polite. Even thanked my server.   The kid wouldn't know fresh if it crashed into his forehead. But I was more anguished for not having the guts to do what needed to be done: refuse to pay, throw the \"fresh juice\" into the little pissant's face and hollered curses at the corporate jackasses that pull this off on the unsuspecting public.  Why am I such a chicken? Oh, I'm in some fancy shopping mall with all these model suburbanite's cluelessly huffing down soda and old juice and congratulating themselves for being healthy. Doing what needed to be done would've precipitated the painful jamming of my head between the floor and the flabby but insistent ass cheeks of the nearest security guard.  By the way, there is absolutely nothing vegetarian about this fake of a place. My quick scan of the menu didn't spot a single meatless entree.   And to add insult to injury, these shameless lovers of the planet serve sea bass!  True Food, my ass.   Or maybe they're just being ironic.  Stung by audaciously corrupt capitalism, I took refuge at a true vegetarian place, here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/organic-shores-phoenix?hrid=6Unfw6K79UO3B6q1edEjzA"}
{"text":"Everything seemed delicious but even though we told our server about our kids' food allergies (nuts/peanuts), both of them threw up their lunch w/in 20 minutes of eating.  Very scary! This was the only restaurant in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale Arizona where they had an allergy problem.  I went to their website and basically they don't guarantee no cross contamination.  Seems like they didn't even try.  Also, I noticed their nutrition info.  A vegetable salad w/ shrimp cost me 775 calories ie 2.5 workouts.  Holy moly!"}
{"text":"It's a tad pricey but it was the best meal and service I've had at a restaurant all summer!  If health is important to you but you want to have a great meal out, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Great dinner!  I have several food allergies but was easily able to accommodate here.  The salmon and quinoa was delicious and the flourless chocolate cake was decadent with homemade caramel. (reservations accepted only for larger groups)"}
{"text":"Even my steak loving brother in law liked the place. It had a cool eco-friendly look very helpful staff and very fresh. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my absolute FAVORITE! The Hangover RX drink is a sip of heaven, we started with the herb hummus that came with cucumbers, onions, and feta inside and was delicious. I had the teriyaki quinoa bowl with chicken and my mom had the fish tacos, bowl were great. Service and atmosphere were great, we'll always return here when we're in town!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting here from Las Vegas and first I would say, go get your buzzer and then shop nearby because it's a medium wait for a table, they usually tell you 45 min.   I'm iffy about this place I'll tell you my thoughts: the place is really clean, they have indoor, outdoor, and bar seating (first come, first serve) there is a juice bar on the side where you can take-out juices.  I'll commend them on the juices and the freshness of the food! i had the lettuce wraps and harvest salad, which were good but had too much sauce that made the lettuce soggy.   That was the problem with most of my food, too much sauce or dressing and it made my greens too soggy!   I tried my dad's breakfast burrito but it just wasn't good. Sorry, I've had better and fresher from another similar restaurant :/"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by the food here. This is where I take my parents when they visit and where we go when we want to relax over a bottle of wine and consistently tasty food. Service can be a little.. silly... seems like they hire a lot of high school kids, but it's never been a problem, just a source of entertainment.   Anyway, we don't go here too much because it's kind of pricey but for a quieter sort of special evening, sit on the patio in the comfy outdoor seating and be sure to order the chocolate cake dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Always a great, fresh, healthy meal, Service and outdoor seating year round.  The pricing is a bit high for the quantity of servings.  My son loves the kids burger.  The fish entrees are always so delicious."}
{"text":"While the menu looked promising, have no idea if the food is any good since the hostess failed to even acknowledge our presence when we walked in the door.   We patiently stood there for several minutes while she walked around us to greet and seat two other parties.   Since we were still unable to get her attention,  we left and went to Tommy Bahama across the street."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the half sized kale salad and pizza. It was great!"}
{"text":"I seriously could eat here every day. I love that everything is organic and locally grown and follows the anti-inflammatory diet. Its healthy and delicious. The fresh juice blends were delightful, and the food is flavorful and filling. I like that you find dishes that are within just about any means of a specific diet i.e. gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, dairy-free. The flourless chocolate cake was a great ending, and my inner health nut shouted cheers of joy at finding a healthy and delicious place to eat at. Anyone who thinks healthy food has no flavor and taste will be converted by one bite of any of the dishes at true food kitchen."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent! I brought my cousin here from NYC and she absolutely loved it. We got the green tea which was very refreshing, the quinoa Johnny cakes (a bit of a cheat meal), the market scramble... (Which needed more meat) and the salmon plate. All were excellent. \"I feel like crap after eating healthy - said no one ever\""}
{"text":"True Food is my go to place - brunch is excellent and so is dinner. True foods is a healthy fast place in the middle of the mall.   For brunch - the quinoa cakes are AMAZING!!! And the avocado egg sandwich pairs really well with that :).   For dinner - I love the chicken teriyaki!   Always get a drink, sometimes seem pricey but they're great and super light!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food clearly accounts for why we were told it was going to be a long wait for a table. No worries, we decided for immediate seating at a shared high top table near the bar. Excellent decision on our part. Being from out-of-town, it gave us a great opportunity to sit and talk to a few other friendly diners that are seasonal-locals from the Scottsdale area.   Located in an outside mall, it stands alone with lots of seating both inside and out. It's surrounded by tall lighted palm trees. Vegetarians will love the food here...more than just sides to choose. Our waitress could not have been more welcoming, helpful, or appropriately attentive. Will plan on returning next time we're in town.  A very comfy, high end cinema is a walk away should you want to have a dinner and a movie kind-of-night."}
{"text":"Healthy food...small portions..good hummus and pita but spicy shrimp noodles were not spicy at all...chicken sausage pizza was pretty good and ziti was well made..."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant since they first opened in Scottsdale Quarter. I recommend it to anyone visiting the area and make sure I take all of my friends and family here. The service isn't always amazing but the food and atmosphere make up for it every time. I eat here at least 2 days a week!"}
{"text":"If you want healthy food at fair prices look no further. Great service. The waiters are friendly and very helpful. No matter how crowded the food comes out fast and YUMMY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients? Inventive menu items? Yes please!  After a long day of travel I wasn't in the mood for a heavy dinner, and True Food really delivered on all fronts. Being a Monday night, there was plenty of seating available, and our group of five scored a really cool table in the middle of the dining area. Service was on point and we all had drinks right away! I wanted to try a cocktail, but after a long weekend of fun I had to settle for iced green tea. I don't know if I was just really thirsty or what, but it was some of the best green tea I've ever had.  We started with the hummus and the vegetable crudites, both of which were amazing. The veggies were so fresh and piled on ice, and came with two different sauces. I wish I had one of those in my fridge at all times. It was so nice to be eating things out that were so ridiculously healthy and good!  For my entree, I ordered the panang curry with brown rice, potatoes, broccoli, ginger, carrots, mushrooms, and coconut shellfish broth. It was seriously great and had the perfect amount of spice, and I wish I wasn't already almost full when I started eating it! The flavors were fantastic and I could see it being the perfect dish for a cold day (although we are in Phoenix...) Maybe I need to figure out how to make it at home in St. Louis.  Really lovely space for healthy food and and a fun atmosphere. Thanks for a great night True Food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Scottsdale! Great selection of food, very yummy and heathy options. Location is great and love the aestic. My friends and I frequently come here for lunch and order out all the time. The hummus, mediterranean salad and kale aid are some of my fave's!"}
{"text":"As we all know, the food we eat is a great part of what make us healthy.   True Food Kitchen's Scottsdale Quarter provides a calming patio setting, the menu is derived from a food pyramid with chocolate at the top and is green certified. Mature trees cast off fresh air and shade. The house is comfortable, busy and prides itself in preparing foods that can help people achieve and maintain optimum health.   So, I asked for the steak tacos made with avocado, cotija cheese, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, and anasazi bean. 14. These tacos were top top. I ordered a tasty glass of dark beer to accompany my excellent meal. When I was finished with my entree, I enjoyed an outstanding bowl of chocolate pudding with seasonal fruit. There was a sprig of spearmint placed in the center of the pudding that says it all.  I'm not quite convinced that the Scottsdale Quarter is all that but this restaurant implements subtle differences in their offerings we all need."}
{"text":"I had an out of town guest with me, I thought shopping in Kierland and having dinner at True Foods would be a delightful evening.  Well shopping was wonderful.....however, our experience at True Food doesn't even deserve a one star!!!  Upon arrival, gave my name and we were told 10 to 15 minute wait, it was more like 35 minutes.  We wanted to have a drink and we had to order from the bar and then go sit at a table waiting to be call for our dinner table.  It should be we can sit down at the waiting table and have a server take our drink order and have the ability to add to our food bill.  Finally, we got to the table, wasn't clean, service was slow, understanding it was busy.  Food finally arrived cold... asked the server to get a manager, and telling the manager the food was cold, he looked at us like we had 3 heads.  Finally, our server, Adele, came over and he said before the manager spoke, that he would take care of it. Why do you need a manager if the server can handle it better.  Terrible management.  Hostess was terribly disorganized.  Will not dine there again!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular. Such a fad, tries way too hard, and HAS to be for people who think they are being cool, trendy and healthy. No one can possibly come here starving because they will leave hungry as the portions are tiny and the food super bland. I've been here twice and both times thought YUCK. I'm all for healthy eating but the dishes here are just not worth it."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here. I ordered the Watermelon Heirloom Tomato Salad. It was good because I like watermelon and tomatoes.. but for $12 for maybe 4 chunks of watermelon,  yellow melon, tomatoes.... with basil, goat cheese, and cashews sprinkled around... I don't think it's very worthwhile. I also tried the turkey burger with sweet potato has, which was also good. burger was kinda dry, but the avocado in there made it good.   They use an open space concept, so you can imagine the noise level is a bit high. The ambiance is hip and natural.   It gets a 4 because I left the place knowing I ate healthily, at least."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. Watermelon salad, turkey sandwich, and lasagna are all amazing and the staff is very friendly. These will be all over the country in no time."}
{"text":"I went here while I was in PHX OMG!  I fell in love with it!  What a great place.  Natural, and fresh ingredients.  The menu is more for a vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten free diet.  I truly feel that a Portland OR location would be a HUGE success!!"}
{"text":"Two years after visiting this restaurant, I still remember what we ordered and how we enjoyed the food and atmosphere... what does that tell you? It was good and memorable! The atmosphere is a little artsy, but the staff was welcoming and friendly.  Since the prices are a little higher, we decided not to get any appetizers, smoothies (which looked great), or drinks.  When we went, we were able to get half size salads and some of the entrees were allowed to be halved (not sure if they still do this). I started with half of a Sashimi Tuna salad. Dressing was sweet and delicious; plenty of salad for half the cost.  For our entrees we ordered a half Turkey Bolognese and a full Pan Seared Sea Bass. The turkey was moist, tender, and flavorful. Sauce was great, and the pasta did not seem overly \"brown rice\".  The sea bass's portion size was a little small, but it is an expensive fish. Fish was perfecty cooked; fork tender. The umami sauce was perfectly seasoned and complemented the fish and vegetables.  There are many things on the menu we wanted to try, so we'll have to come back again.  Pros: Stevia packets on the table (more restaurants need this!), healthy and tasty food, good selection, and the no-guilt feeling afterwards.  Cons: Have to get parking validated (it ends up being free), it is far for someone in the East Valley who wants to come more often, and it is a little expensive for the portions (but it's healthy!)."}
{"text":"I'm actually excited to share this experience. I've only had the lasagna or a salad, for a while the lasagna was taken off the menu. Although it's been brought back it's not the same. So I tried something different the Grass Feed Burger sub provolone and it was Delicious! However, that's not why I'm giving 5 stars, my side was some sweet potato cubes. Anyone who knows me knows that French Fries are my WEAKNESS! I joked with my server Kayla about wanting fries SEVERAL times & we laughed. Kayla obvious saw my disappointment. She took it to another level & surprised me by going & getting fries from another restaurant! I was in absolute awe!! I wanted to jump up a kiss her! Whoever hired her was brilliant! She's kind, genuine, attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. When I was trying to figure out what to order she knew exactly what I would like based on my \"pickiness\".  Although, that could be because she has Husker blood in her!  Best dining experience to date. Top Notch! Above & Beyond service."}
{"text":"I come into true foods at least twice a week. I keep coming back for the energy of the restaurant and the friendly nature of the employees. It feels good to be acknowledged by first name whenever I walk in. No matter how busy or who's working I know the service will always be outstanding and I can count on the food being of the highest quality. If you happen to be working while Ari one of the managers is there or can grab a seat the bar with Nate or Chris be prepared for an exceptional experience."}
{"text":"What a great concept!  Fresh, healthful food with a wide ranging menu that offers plenty of options for vegetarians, vegans and omnivors. Could not be happier with every aspect of my meal -- delicious local greens salad; vegan pizza with rich tomato sauce on a tasty organic flour/spelt/flax crust; and a chocolate soy ice cream. Nice selection of organic and bio wines.  Very reasonably priced. The only complaint was a slightly wobbly table.  But for someone from Boston to be eating such a wonderful mean outdoors at 8pm in mid-Feb, it doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"I came for dinner and the menu had a wide array of different foods on the menu. I went with the steak taco's and I have to say this was the first time I've put salt on my food at a restaurant. The food was just bland and didn't seem to have much flavor.  I like having healthy food but, there are plenty of ways to keep things fresh and still have flavor. There wasn't anything I had worth coming back for but, there's lots on the menu. The hummus pretty good and I tried I bite of the flour less cake and it was better than I expected."}
{"text":"I can't stand it, it's so yummy! Fresh seasonal selections with the tastiest somewhat unique dishes. I really love this place. The atmosphere is cool and open. Nice wine selection. Excellent wait staff. I can't say enough good things about True Food. If you enjoy healthy tasty foodie type menus you must try True Food. Gluten Free and Vegetarian entrees that are spectacular!"}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night for dinner after happy hour at seasons 52. Without knowing it, I found out that it was a very healthy restaurant. I am on a diet so I have to find something low carb and they had this amazing salmon that they prepared with a cauliflower side dish. It was delicious and I didn't feel guilty afterwards. I believe that the food is all organic and free range meat . My husband had the street tacos and I had to try them and wow, they were even better than my salmon of course.  I recommend those tacos. The environment felt upscale and modern. The patio was pretty and the service was great."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch. My teriyaki bowl with tofu was excellent.  The server was above and beyond amazing.  When back in town, will definitely go back.  Price point was perfect."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food, delicious drinks, fun environment- but the best part is the staff. A friendly and down-to-earth team, functioning as a well oiled machine. As an out of towner, I'm making a point of coming back to this establishment every time I visit. I wish I could give this way more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"The KALE SALAD is worth the wait and the price. How they combine those simple ingredients and make me have passion for kale is miraculous.   Got crazy after devouring the salad and ordered the thin crust margherita pizza - figured they'd do well with fresh herbs & simple ingredients. NOPE. It was truly mediocre. BORING. NOT amazing crust, NOT amazing sauce, cheese was meh, and a shockingly weenie amount of fresh basil (I'd at least expect True Foods to prominently scatter their organic herbs!). Adding red peppers just made it spicy-boring.  But their lowest-tier $6 glass red wine was darn good, no reason to pony up to anything more expensive.  I know, I know - pizza should be left to a good PIZZA place. TF just fell off it's pedestal. I'm concerned other items at those prices are as \"good-not-great.\" I'm sticking with Kale Salad & wine."}
{"text":"Delicious. Red chili shrimp was everything expected. I almost substituted the shirataki noodles and the waitress suggested the sesame noodles. It was so flavorful. The service was excellent and we were seated promptly upon arriving.  My beverage was the matcha green tea lemonade and it was very refreshing. Just enough lemonade not to wash out the green tea. The Spanish lentil soup was the best ever!"}
{"text":"Superb combo of tasty food, comfortable setting, and good for you.  We started with the shrimp dumplings (pretty good) and the chicken tortilla soup (yummy though I usually hate beans).  We weren't sure about the kids' menu items.  They sound like synonyms for \"twigs\" and \"gravel\", but the apple, banana; strawberry sandwich was a hit.    Grass Fed Bison Burger and the Fish Tacos were uber yum.  My wife isn't a fan of mushrooms, but the shiitake add flavor and texture with the parmesan flakes. I chose the kale salad as my side and found myself scarfing it down.  The fish tacos were very flavorful.  Chose the Almond Cake for dessert-- small but fresh and tasty.    Left thinking, \"Yes, I scarfed kale.  Who knew it could be good?\"  We'll definitely hit this place again."}
{"text":"Superb food, service, and decor  I'm a fan of TFK.  Everyone in our family likes the food. It's a very nice setting for a meal and deserves some interior design awards. And I feel a tad better about myself after eating there-- as if the healthy menu someone cleanses me more than 30 Hail Marys and Our Fathers.  Our girls usually are stoked to have the Watermelon Lemonade with Almond Butter, Strawberry & Banana Sandwich.  I love the Kale Salad with chicken added.  And my wife tends to go for pretty much anything on the Pizza or Entrées menu that doesn't have mushrooms associated with it.  Service was the usual attentive standard we're used to.  The girl even had some hiragana tattooed behind her ear, allowing me to inconspicuously refresh my reading skills.  We'll be back, again.  I still need to try their juice bar options."}
{"text":"Unprofessional,  Called to make a reservation for my sister's 24th birthday dinner. The lady who answered the phone asked me the quantity of the party and then stated she needs to speak to her manager so she places me on hold. Then she returns and states I should call Biltmore because they're full, which is HILARIOUS to me because she failed to even ask for the date of the event which threw me off. So I stated to her wouldn't you like to hear what day it's on before denying the event... Then she said yes I told her Saturday and she goes yeah we are unable to. I was so upset I asked to speak to her unhelpful manager who took 15 minutes to get on the phone just to say the same thing. I understand if you're booked on parties but at least have the decency to check. Customer service is trash, I don't even plan to EVER visit this location."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, drinks were great, atmosphere was fun, waitress knowledgeable attentive and friendly. What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Fresh, healthy, yummy food! I love the Quinoa tabouleh with roasted beets! A perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This seems to be my wife's favorite place lately. The food is always fresh and good! I just wished it wasn't in the middle of the shopping center."}
{"text":"Good service & good food. It's fresh and yummy. ...but I never find myself craving their food. For whatever reason, I just find the food good. Never excellent. I do like the ambiance - lively & fun with a light & airy aesthetic. It's very loud, but that doesn't bother me much.  I'm just not that into their menu, despite it being well-balanced to cater to all diets (not just vegetarian & vegan - you can order animal proteins, too!) The flavor is average, that's all."}
{"text":"We used to love True Food, but since Sam Fox sold the restaurant the prices have gone way up and the amount of food has gone went way down. $17 for two tiny street tacos is absolutely ridiculous (went and had a second dinner after) and the old order used to come with three. My mother went in the other day and was served chicken noodle soup with two pieces of chicken and one noodle. She said something to the waitress who brought back another bowl that was exactly the same. Good healthy food and nice service, but not worth the price and small serving size."}
{"text":"The restaurant has an excellent atmosphere, service, and mission. I love that it uses local ingredients supporting farmers close by. The menu has a lot of different options and there are plenty of healthy drinks and non healthy ones to chose from. I love the feel of the place and the patio that goes around the restaurant. The wooden tables and the casual chairs give it a retro but laid back vibe. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the dining experience we had here. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is amazing. The outside seating is nice and toasty under heat lamps and perfect for dining at night or when cold out. The cocktails are well-crafted and made from freshly squeezed juices, which was a big plus. Food is fresh and you feel good about what you eat here, no matter what it is. Lastly, the service was top-notch with a friendly and efficient waitstaff."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for organic and healthy eating...so when my date suggested we meet at True Food, I was so excited!  The menu has many options, not just the typical salads and sandwiches.  I tried the Spicy Panang Curry with chicken, and it was amazing.  They hit the flavor exactly like one of my favorite Thai restaurants, and that's hard to do.  As expected, the ingredients were all healthy, fresh, and delicious.  I also tried a Pinot Noir, and it was great.  My date enjoyed his tacos and iced tea.  This is a place I need to come back and try more things on the menu, but it will be hard not to have the Panang Curry Dish next time.  Another bonus for me was that they kept it very warm on a cold night, and that was true even in the outdoor area, where I was able to sit under a heater."}
{"text":"Since my previous review the manager has reached out to me to discuss the experience I had. He was very understanding and you can definitely tell he cares, about his restaurant and his patrons. I am happy to update my review and I will definitely be giving them another try. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I love all of the Vegan and Vegetarian Options at True Foods. I also love that I feel good about eating the food there. It is fresh, clean and organic.  The decor of the restaurant is simple, and they have an awesome patio that wraps around the outside of the restaurant. There is a little herb garden on the patio as well. I love that you know where a good amount of the herbs are grown. Scottsdale Quarter is beautiful as well, and I enjoy sitting outside and seeing people enjoy the public space. The patio also has good misters.  The Natural Refreshers are a great option. Organic and interesting tonics. I enjoy the Natural (ginger, agave, soda).  I love the Miso Soup. I've heard people complain that it is too salty, but I like salty so it works for me. It's also a Vegan Miso soup which is great because I won't eat a Miso with Fish.  The Hummus Appetizer is delicious. I love the Greek Chop Chop served on top and often ask for extra which the wait staff is happy to bring. The hummus can lean towards a little too much garlic depending on the day.  The Local Vegetable Crudite, is literally HUGE fresh vegetables. It is a little awkward to eat, but the dips that were served with it are pretty good.  I like the Mediterranean Chopped Salad, It should be noted that the salad it very quinoa heavy, which to me is a good thing.  I've been wanting to try the Roasted Corn and Kale Pesto Pizza, but unfortunately, I think it's a Summer Menu option, so I'll have to wait. Hopefully they bring it back!  My husband has gotten the Steak Tacos, and was not impressed by the portion, it was relatively small for what you can expect at True Foods. He now goes with the Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl with Chicken. He really enjoys it.  The best part of the whole meal is DESSERT. They usual have a VEGAN Ice Cream which I enjoy, not because I'm Vegan but because I\"m lactose intolerant. I love LOVE love LOVE love (get it?) the Warm Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble with Vegan Vanilla Ice Cream. Sweet, Tart, it's just incredible!  For the Winter it switches to a Warm Apple Crisp with a Pecan Ice Cream (Vegan). It's really wonderful. It's very oat and fruit heavy and just delightful. For $7 you really can't beat this dessert.  We have also tried a Lemon dessert in the summer, and Olive Oil Cake in the Winter, both were good, but the Crumbles are really where it's at. For the quality of food, the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday on a Friday night. The wait was only 10-15 min and the staff was very nice in putting the cake I brought in the fridge and bringing it out with candles. A little expensive but the food is good and the stmosphere is nice. I just wish it were brighter so I could see my food and I wish they would have warned that the sweet potato hash isn't very good. Overall it was a nice experience but i wouldn't travel the 20 min and pay 20 bucks to eat here often"}
{"text":"You know a place is good when you come on a Wednesday night, at 8pm (1 hour before closing), and there's a 30 minute wait, and the restaurant is packed!  It was sure worth the wait though! A waitress said the dessert was \"To Die For\". And she wasn't kidding!   The food is very natural, unique, and very healthy. You can tell the makers put a lot of thought in finding the right spices and flavors in creating healthy choice dishes.   We had:  House Smoked Salmon. Rating: 4.5/5 Edamame Dumplings. Rating: 4/5 Shrimp & Sundried Tomato Pizza: Rating: 5/5 Wild Ahi Sliders. Rating: 3/5 Sweet Potatoes. Rating: 3.5/5 Banana Chocolate Tart. Rating: 4.5/5  Bill came out to be $65 including tax and tip for 3 people. Delish decision!"}
{"text":"I feel similarly about True Food as I do about Seasons 52.  When I was a healthy eater, I cared a lot more about going there than I do now. Their food is healthy but if you're not a vegetarian or counting your calories, it can be a challenge to find something that you actually WANT I do go here with friends but I can't say that I leave here feeling satisfied or  like I had a meal I can't forget."}
{"text":"Stay away today plenty of empty tables but still waiting 45 minutes must be a staffing issue"}
{"text":"I've been here about 2 or 3 times and each experience has been pleasant.   The drink concoctions are delicious! I have tried the Kale-aid and the Apple Carrot Ginger tonic. Both were very crisp and refreshing. I felt \"healthily renewed\" after the first sip!  Their fresh ingredients are what will keep me coming back. Service is good too! No complaints."}
{"text":"I just had the best dinner I've had in a while here. In Phoenix of all places! (Says the restaurant-jaded New Yorker) The ancient grains bowl with tofu is delicious and tastes very fresh. The kale juice is a bit on the sour side but still very tasty. If you are vegetarian, absolutely come here and treat yourself."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners went to True Food Kitchen. We had appetizers of lettuce wraps with tofu which was absolutely delicious because they mixed little chunks of smoked tofu with peanuts. Heirloom Tomato bruschetta with some olive oil and some almond feta. Again absolutely delicious. My mom's entree was chicken noodle soup. My sister's entree was a mushroom vegetarian pizza, and my entree was a sandwich called the TLT. It had tempeh, guacamole, tomatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. Now the food was good, but that wasn't the best part of the whole experience. The best part was the service! The waitress was absolutely flawless. She was able to get me a Diet Pepsi and an order of french fries and even though the True Foods Kitchen doesn't  serve those items, she went next door to a place called The Zen Burger to get the items that I wanted as a part of my meal. I was stunned because I've never had someone go to those lengths to fulfill my needs as a diner and a guest. We definitely recommend True Food Kitchen for anyone who wants a great meal with vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan menu options - but also fantastic service, a great atmosphere, with both inside and out dining, and some pretty good music. The Jolly Diners rate True Food Kitchen a 5 of 5. We couldn't have been more pleased or had a better time dining outside, under the water misters, with a nice breeze, and great food."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what it was. Almost $20 for a bland salad. If you're looking for a place that resides on \"cool factor\" rather than taste and an appropriate price point this is for you."}
{"text":"Great  menu  Great staff and food  Any allergies Always adhered to  Go here You will not be disappointed  Outdoor seating really nuce"}
{"text":"Showed up at this restaurant for a early dinner reservation.  Table for four people..  The restaurant was empty.   The hostess immediately tries to seat us at the worse location in the whole restaurant.   Should have known  When we were seated at a better table and we had ordered our dinner I had asked for one of the Poke Bowls.  Making sure to tell the waiter NO MISO or Salt on the dish (Sweet Potatoes especially)  Can't have soy and on a low salt diet..   The dinner comes out super Slow service.. and as I am starting to eat it--realize that it is salty/spicy and the Miso Glaze is on the dish.. When I tell the waiter he says--Oh I forgot to put that in the notes to the kitchen.   So I waited for my dish, while the others ate.   It came out correctly BUT nothing was done at all--we were on our way to the baseball game.. so I had to rush to finish my meal (we however missed the start) because of the mishap  (we showed up at 5 pm and the game started at 7 pm)   ridiculous      Will not go back again  and if you have food allergies.. I suggest you skip this one"}
{"text":"My indulgence! Moderately priced. Loving your to go hut to get my kale aid on. Many options to choose from and there's something for everyone. Wish I could go more often."}
{"text":"Solid three stars. The menu is \"globally inspired\" but still manages to come off as little more than another New American restaurant riding on its gluten-free, veg 'n' vegan laurels. If you think Pei Wei is \"globally inspired\" good eats, you'll probably dig True Foods. Or if you're looking for a place to take even the pickiest of eaters be they bland food lovers or gluten-lactose intolerant vegetarians.  Tip 1: Beware the nouveau health guru buzz words on the menu.   Enjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.  Tip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.  The apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.  The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.  Tip 3. Your food will take freakin' forever to get to you.  The service is obsequious and annoying, but also manages to come off as condescending, impersonal, and rushed? WTH? Doubly annoying since the food usually takes a loooong time to reach your table."}
{"text":"I liked my food, drink, service and the ambiance.   I noticed people complaining about portion size and price.   I think if you want to eat \"healthy\" you should eat high quality food in smaller portions.   I thoroughly enjoyed my entree; my husband enjoyed his and we were all happy.   Four of us had dinner including: Salmon, spaghetti squash, steak tacos and cod with bok choy and mushrooms.   The sweet potato hash was a hit with everyone.  Drinks were delicious.   It was all good.  Bit noisy but comfy table for a big group,   Surrounding \"mall\" was beautiful and very upscale.   I liked it."}
{"text":"The customer service was great as was the meal. I didn't feel like I was picking health over taste, as the food was both very nutritious and flavorful. I had the hummus and the quinoa burger and was satisfied with both. I just wish they'd have one on the west valley!"}
{"text":"On vacation with my wife in Scottdale and saw this while walking in the mall... half hour wiat for table (not bad), and had nice drinks while waiting.  Really neat open resturant, and excellent server.... Thai dumplings for app were excellent.  Wife had the grilled tuna sliders.. well prepared and very tasty, I had the pan seared sea bass which was very good.... dessert was wonderful (flourless choc. cake) and although pricy, good food ad good service are always worth the extra bucks... did not know that they have a location in Newport Beach, so I am sure we will make a trip there in the future to eat this food again."}
{"text":"Amazing and healthy! They are very concerned with health and provide a menu suitable for most diets. I am vegan and ate the TLT (Tempeh Lettuce Tomato) sandwich and it was one of the best sandwiches ever! I also had the Cucumber Cooler to start, which was a perfect compliment to the meal and very refreshing."}
{"text":"Best lasagna I've ever had! Beautiful restaurant & patio views-they also allow dogs on their patio. Not too busy, quick service- our waiter Marshall gave us very great entree recommendations. Petite Syrah was delicious- chicken and rice soup was decent, chicken was a little dry and bland but I still ate the whole bowl because the flavor was delicious !"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at a True Food and this experience was really wonderful.  Our server explained the concept of anti-inflammatory foods in a way that was just right (not condescending, just really healthful.) while I didn't love the Kale-aid juice, I did like the concept of it-  I think it needed watermelon and a little less ginger/celery (too much bite) in this drink for my taste.    The food was mostly perfect this dinner!   I highly recommend the turkey lasagna!!! OMG.  Tender and cheesy but not too heavy.  The kids turkey sloppy joes was a hit too.  The Moroccan chicken was absolutely perfect-  crispy skin and juicy meat.   The only two real false notes:  an overly salty miso soup and a too dry almond butter kids sandwich (needed honey.)   Service was outstanding, especially for a busy night and our large party.   Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy night I had trying to figure out how to spend my Fox Restaurant $25 gift card. I wanted to go to Blanco, but it was packed and I didn't want to wait. Olive and Ivy was the same story, so I decided to head back into the city almost forgetting True Food.   I was the only one at the bar, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. Didn't hurt that she was gorgeous as well, but that is besides the point completely. The whole restaurant is distinctively Sam Fox with the raw woods, bright colors, and really unique lighting. I hit the bathroom right away and that was the coolest part of the restaurant (I'm a sucker for neat-o bathrooms since I'm working on a remodel of mine) with the water-free urinal and Dyson Airblade hand dryers. I'd never seen those things before, and I must say they are the first air dryer that I have ever found to be worth a crap.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sliders, which were unbelievably delicious, and at $13, not a bank breaker. They came with a Sweet Potato Hash that was great as well. The Hummus was also phenomenal, and probably the best I've had in quite some time. The menu featured plenty of organic, vegan, and and vegetarian offerings as well as some boutique wines. I never knew there was a type of wine that was both organic and sustainable using recycled products. There was a lot of thought that went into the menu here and I think they should be applauded for it.  The restaurant is instantly one of my favorites, from the list of $20 bottles of wine, to the awesome food, to the neat-o restrooms and the spot on service. Everything about the place screamed greatness. $31 for 2 beers, an appetizer, and an entree is very reasonable in my book, especially considering the quality. If you're looking for a big filling greasy meal, skip true food. If what you want is a healthy, delicious meal that won't leave you feeling like a fat grease-ball, eat here and be happy you just found your new favorite Biltmore restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and surprisingly you'll find here a great skinny margaritas. Bit on the pricey side, but you'll get a good quality, all-natural meal."}
{"text":"Amazing! The restaurant is beautiful. Service is great. The server was very helpful with allergies. The food and drinks were superb. The food was healthful and flavorful. The only drawback is a bit of a parking hassle due to the location."}
{"text":"I must start with, I love True Foods Kitchen. However today I found a dead bug on my lettuce in the lettuce wraps. I wouldn't write a bad review except that management handled this horribly with zero concern or care.  Check your food for bugs or just go to Camelback location."}
{"text":"Had a yummy tuna slider here with wasabi aioli and sides of sweet potato hash and a kale salad. So good!!!  Restaurant had a cool vibe. Very west coast given the airy feeling you get from the big windows to the high vaulted (at least that's what I remember) ceilings. Great place for lunch in the scottsdale quarter."}
{"text":"Hey, I'm a hipster: I need my martini. So I bypassed the health-smoothies on the left side of the menu that were the focus of the waiter's spiel. They did look appealing I guess. But I wasn't in the mood for a spa experience.  So the martini came without olives. As did the kale and mushroom pizza on whole wheat crust.   But both tasted great. Even my kid thought enough of the kale pizza to eat half of it. He's four, and roasted kale is usually a hard sell.   Anyway, quick service, pleasant surroundings. Family-friendly enough to make me feel comfortable with my kid (despite the occasional stares of couples who probably have Childfree.org stickers on their BMW's, where the man is tallying stock options and the woman is trying to silence the wails of her empty and yearning womb. Of course I'm used to that.)  Anyway, I liked the place. I'll be back. I don't think I like it as much as I liked Coffee Plantation when it was in the same spot 15 years ago. But never mind this old fart. Sawgrass smoothies are where it's at today!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant. Their food tastes so fresh and earthy, along with the restaurant theme itself. When you walk inside it feels like they have combined nature and a modern, simplistic look to it. If you don't want to wait for 30+ minutes, come on a weeknight. Friday and Saturday nights seem to be the busiest, and I'm assuming business lunch hours are busy as well. They have a simple menu with quite a variety of food from pizza to salad to sandwiches and more complex meals. My favorite dish is the Teryaki Brown Rice Bowl. I usually get it with tofu. As an appetizer I recommend the vegetable crudités, as it comes with an array of fresh veggies and some strange tasting bean dip and delicious tzatziki dip. If you want something to drink, try the Honey Lemonade because it comes with free refills. As a dessert, I am in LOVE with the chocolate cake. It is wheat free. I love how everything tastes here-- different-- yet fresh! Most people on the average deep-fried American diet will probably not like it at first.  Now, the only downside to this restaurant is the prices. It's a little expensive for the portion size. If it was cheaper, I'd give this 5 stars."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, fresh healthy and organic food and bevs, even the cocktails and wine have organic options! Great for those that are watching their diets, want gluten free etc. but can leave the big guys hungry!"}
{"text":"Great Fox restaurant with more veggie-friendly plates. The squash casserole is so good!  I also ALWAYS order a honey lemonade.  If its nice weather an you want something light, check it out."}
{"text":"Ooo, i am most certainly a fan of True Food Kitchen! The restaurant is basically one big open box with the patio wrapping around 3 sides of it. Definitely a great place to take a lunch break when you are out shopping in this really cool area of Scottsdale.   The staff all seemed really fun and cheerful. To start off with I had a honey infused lemonade that was fantastic! Then came the vegetable crudites, wow, there's a show stopper for you! I huge bowl of absolutely beautiful vegetables - you can order a half order and I highly suggest it, between two of us we probably ate about half. Then for my main I had a perfectly spiced Panang curry rice bowl with wonderful jumbo prawns. Mmmm! I would order that again in a heartbeat!   Thanks so much to Gabi M for taking me to this really fun spot. I can't wait to go back and actually do some shopping along with the eating!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! It was the first time we were at this location,Biltmore, the food was perfect. I never had Sea bass before and I loved it. It was a bit pricey I think but it was well worth the price. It was very tasty with mushrooms, purple potatoes, snap peas and a little asparagus. It had some tasty sauce on it just a little, not too much sort of around the fish. The fish was on top and the veggies were underneath, I will order this again for sure. My hubby had the turkey burger and kale salad and loved it as well.He did say my turkey burgers are better LOL. I do't mind paying higher than usual for dinner as long as it is good and this totally was worth the $24 range."}
{"text":"How do they do it?  How do they make simple ingredients taste so dang good!!  This place has become my go-to-fav!  The menu has choices for a variety of pallets. They use fresh, local organic ingredients.  On our first visit my daughter ordered a quinoa burger, I won't lie I had my doubts but it was great!  The meal came with a kale salad the dressing was superb. I ordered the tri tip street tacos the meat was tender and extremely flavorful.  I hear breakfasts' here are really good too, this review will definitely have a part 2!"}
{"text":"Got the Ancient Grains Bowl with Chicken and it was soooo good.  The food was clean and I feel ready to rock! The service was great and we got the food quickly.  My wife got the Turkey Burger and she said it hit the spot. I recommend this place to anybody wanting amazing food and a super cool place to chill."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here.  Kale salad is great.  However I would like the carrots chopped in the crudite.  I felt a little like a baby rabbit."}
{"text":"Loved the GF mushroom soup, GF spicy chicken pizza. The ginger soda was very refreshing!  Fast service even in the lunch hour!   I'll look for other locations when I get home."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Biltmore location and were psyched when this location opened (closer to us). You always feel good leaving this place. Yummy and healthy! I really like their unique drinks too. The open atmosphere (same buildings as the Green House I think) is very cool and I can see why others said it reminded them of San Fran."}
{"text":"Wow! Love this place and what it is about. Great tasting healthy food. They have meat options so you don't have to be a Vegan to like this place. I had the inside out quinoa burger with kale salad and sweet potato hash. I also ordered a side of hummus and pittas. Highly recommend both of them. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love it here! I love that the staff is educated on vegetarianism and veganism! It's awesome and the food is so delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually only lurk on Yelp but felt compelled to write my first review to warn others about how much this restaurant sucks.  I gave up $30 tonight for what might have been the least tasty food I've eaten in at least 6 months. In fact, to say that it was the least tasty food I've had eaten in at least 6 months doesn't even begin to adequately describe the horrific culinary abominations I consumed against my better judgment at this \"establishment\".  When I first heard about True Food, I was excited to try it out. With my pita, green tea soba noodles and chocolate pudding, however, I was incredibly disappointed. Actually, \"incredibly disappointed\" is an understatement. I was beyond disgusted. I do not like to waste food so I always try to finish everything I order. However, I was unable to eat all of the \"noodle\" dish. If I had forced myself to do so I fear I might have had to make a run to the restroom for a quick vomit before \"dessert\".  This food is not just subpar, it is a disgrace to the culinary arts in general. This is some of the worst \"food\" I have had the misfortune of choking down in my short life and yet they have the nerve to charge those prices for it. Perhaps they are charging for ambiance. The food certainly is not worth that much.  When I had pancreatitis a couple of years back, I vomited bile the color of green antifreeze. I could not make it to a toilet in time so I had to attempt to swallow the bile. I can say with total honesty that the bile tasted as good as - if not better than - the \"meal\" I ate tonight.  I would quite honestly rather die an excruciatingly painful death than ever dine here again. I am not exaggerating. I will be avoiding it at all costs and advising all of my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"I loved Truefood Kitchen at one point. They cared about the quality of the ingredients. Now that PF Changs has taken over many of the ingredients have gotten cheaper and less nutritious. Ex: they got rid of watercress from the Med chop salad."}
{"text":"Recently got lunch carryout form here.  Service was exceptionally friendly.  I ordered the veggie panang curry.  The broth was OK but it had no substance to it.  I mean there was one sliced carrot, a couple of pieces of potato, perhaps 1/4 of a small onion, and one bok choy.  It cost me $18!  Although the flavor was OK I had to go get lunch... after eating my lunch!  For $18 bucks (all-in) I expect more.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"For business travelers maintaining a healthy diet is SO difficult. This is the PERFECT solution to maintain a healthy diet while being forced to eat out while traveling. Excellent & healthy options. The ingredients are always fresh and quality. Great choice! I come to True Foods Kitchen any city I find it in when on business."}
{"text":"Everyone I've been too is an A+. Food, service and atmosphere are all lovely. The honey lemonade is delicious for anytime of year, great juices and everything I've had off their menu has been wonderful. Can never go wrong with fresh, wholesome ingredients."}
{"text":"This would be getting 5 stars if not for the service I have received.  I've been three times and twice felt neglected for long periods of time (and my \"service\" measuring stick is low - be friendly and keep an eye on my wine glass and you're my best friend).  I love the concept.  There are too many corporate chain restaurants (I know, True Food could be considered a corporate chain but I prefer not to think of it that way) that serve heaping plates of fat and salt filled belly bombs (Cheesecake factory) to clientele that has no business eating like that (Buy a mirror people!).  For those of us that try to keep up appearences, its nice to have a healthy option that makes a great attempt at pleasing the pallette in cool surroundings.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten at True Food, and I did not feel any bloated guilt when I left."}
{"text":"Great place to have a vegan, tasty meal. Staff is always upbeat, knowledgeable, and friendly. Never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"I feel strange giving Tru Foods Camelback a low rating when everyone is slapping five stars on but YUCK. This is my second time here. I keep wanting to like it. I love the concept of quality ingredients etc but the food is actually GROSS. My main complaint is SALT. And I'm a person who likes salt, adds salt to my food, uses salt. I don't go out of my way to avoid salt but the food, and I mean all the dishes we tried, were excessively sickeningly SALTY. We got the daily special soup to start and hubby got Moroccan chicken and I got bison burger with sweet potato hash. Everything was way too salty. Not just me. Hubby thought so too. My burger came out NOT as I had ordered it and the manager was very sweet about trying to make it right but we didn't have the time to wait for a whole new entree. The burger was lukewarm, over salted and weirdly mushy. I'm not even concerned about salt in general but this was grossly over salted.   One more thing. I know I sound like a partypooper by now but if I go to a nice restaurant for a Friday night date, I would like that experience to be dog-free. The patio seating was absolutely infested with dogs. You had to push them out of the way to get in the door. I saw a server pet one on his way by! (What does Health Department have to say about that??) and one dog was doing a lot of barking.   A great disappointment."}
{"text":"Healthy, creative, and delicious. This restaurant puts thought into their dishes. I've eaten at a few of the locations and am always pleased when I walk away."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. I love the bison burger, hands down the best burger I've ever had (and I'm from Texas, I know my burgers). I took my bf and his friend here and they also agreed - best. burger. ever.  It doesn't stop there, everything I have tried on their menu is delicious. I'm getting cravings just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The menu has vegan and vegetarian options.  But, OMG, they are sooooo inconsistent!!! Yestersay we ordered the hummus to start with veggies instead of pita. Lovely. Today I again ordered the hummus to start with veggies instead of pita. There were about half the veggies, no drizzle of olive oil on the hummus, and... today they charged me $4.00 for the few veggies they gave me. Ordinarily, hummus comes with 2 carrots, 2 cucumber and pita (at least it comes with that at the Biltmore location). Today I got barely more than that for an additional $4.   Their inconsistency is so frustrating!! One day the charred cauliflower is a nice portion and another day it's a tiny portion.  They need to get it together!!"}
{"text":"Eh. Kinda a hippie place based on poor science. The food was well a little dull. Not many spices although it was healthy I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"This location is always busy so expect to wait a good hour or so. Having dined here twice, I'm not what the fuss is about. Had the turkey burger and a salad and both were alright with nothing spectacular about them. Because it's so busy, the waiting staff can get a little impatient if you're taking a bit longer than usual to eat (problem of being a slow salad eater). With so many options to choose around the area, I don't think the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"This time around we had the lentil & turkey sausage soup, ahi sliders, turkey pita and of course the ahi salad. Solid!"}
{"text":"Worth a try.  Went here based on a strong recommendation to try the sea bass tacos. Unfortunately they overcooked the bejeezus out of the seabass so it was more like charred fish chip tacos.  However, our really nice server insisted on bringing us another serving, which was phenomenal, so in my mind they made things right.  Service was slow but very courteous and ambiance was great. I'll give them another go and maybe try more of the veggie-based dishes & cocktails recommended by others."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few weeks ago on a Friday night with some friends. My friends had been there before.  The atmosphere was great.  We were seated outdoors.  Mist sprays were running so temperature was great.  In addition to dishes containing seafood and chicken, this place has numerous vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options.  I am a vegetarian and several in our party were vegan.  The drinks menu was also good and had enough options for everyone.  My friend and I ordered some red wine. We ordered the kale guacamole.  A must order dish. I'm not a fan of kale but this was phenomenal.  We also had the edamame dumplings which were delicious.  i would get those again too.  My friends split the tomato and arugula pizza.  We also had the Mizo glazed eggplant and Ancient grains bowl.  The food was very tasty and unique.  I give this place kudos for making tasty, healthy and unique food.  We finished wit the Chia pudding, made with coconut milk.  You can't miss the chance to try this dish.  Excellent.  This restaurant is in Scottsdale...so subject to the Scottsdale prices.  I think it is overpriced, but not by too much to make it ridiculous.  Just enough that I can't frequent it too much, unless I have a gift card or something.  Good place for a date or for just a night out with friends.  Our meal took about 2.5 hours because we took our time.  The waitress did not lose patience with us.  She was great."}
{"text":"A great spot for delicious and fresh food. I had never been to any of the True Food locations, but I will certainly return. Although the hostesses seemed to have no idea what exactly was going on, once we were seated, the rest of the experience and meal was great. We started with the crudité plate which was surprisingly really delicious. Even as a vegetarian, I wouldn't normally order a crudité appetizer, but this was both beautifully served and super tasty! I had the spicy panang curry with tofu which was just the right amount of spice and extremely flavorful. The others had the spaghetti squash casserole and summer squash pizza (I tried bites of both and can attest that they were also really tasty!) Overall, a really enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.  On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent.   On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a \"taste\" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.  With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Dear True Food executive chef, Spices and flavor are organic too!  The food was good, it was just bland. I ordered an iced green tea, got black tea.  Whatever, I still drank it since it arrived while I was in the restroom and couldn't immediately send it back and I was thirsty. We shared a hummus appetizer which was really good and obviously very fresh.  Even better when the onions, feta, olives were included in my scoop. Next up was what sounded very delicious, the soup du jour: saffron potato.  I added quite a bit of pepper to it so it had some flavor.  It wasn't bad by any means.  I ate two spoonfuls that had saffron in them and those were tasty bites.  I really wished there would have been more saffron in my cup of saffron soup. I ordered the chicken sausage pizza.  The marinara sauce was sweet and I don't like sweet marinara.  I gave half my pizza to other diners to try.  It needed something like onions or peppers to compliment the taste of the sweet marinara and mild chicken sausage. One of the other diners ordered the chicken with asparagus which was very moist and tender, mainly because it was cooked and served with the skin on.   Overall, it was ok.  I'm not going to request to go here ever.  If someone is having a dinner or lunch here, I'd probably meet up with them later.   I think this place is fantastic for people that eat healthy or have sensitive stomachs.  It's not really the ideal restaurant for people who think of dining out as a possible adventure."}
{"text":"Excellent food with knowledgeable wait staff. Great experience. I had one of my all time favorite dishes Cashew Pad Thai and it was outstanding.  We started with hummus and pita. The glute free pita was even better than their regular pita.  Wine recommendations by our waitress were perfect.   Clean true food - Something good for everyone."}
{"text":"This a health nut/vegetarian's paradise!  We came here for brunch with friends this past Sunday and were pleasantly surprised.   My fiancé is more of a burger and fries type of guy and when he first glanced over the menu, wasn't too sure he'd find something he'd like. Even from a health nut perspective, I was a bit unsure myself as I studied the menu. A lot of the meal descriptions have a list of odd and peculiar combinations of ingredients.. It was hard to picture what the dish might look like or if the flavors would go well together.  We played it pretty safe - He went with the breakfast burrito and I went with kale salad + chicken. We both really enjoyed our meals and felt guilt free about our food choices. Everything was fresh, service was attentive, and surprisingly there was no wait at 11:45 AM on the weekend in a popular area of town.  Great covered patio that allows for ample seating in the shade. Inside is trendy and allows full visibility into the kitchen so that patrons may see the staff prepping everything from scratch."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at True Foods in Kierland, but the prices for the food are over the top for the quantity of  food you actually get.  I had \"Johnny Cakes,\" which are priced at $10.  When the meal came it consisted of 2 small to medium size pancakes.  I also had a small glass of juice.  It cost $6, but it had more ice than juice.  I left True Foods still hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, healthy food. I had the seasonal vegetable salad and sat out on the patio and thoroughly enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about! Went for lunch. We were starved. Took about 40 minutes to get a lasagna and pizza. Pizza was burnt. Lasagna was cold. Waitress never came to check on how our food was. So, we just ate it (like I said, we were starved). Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. Their pizza is bomb, its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for. Their turkey lasagna is also my go to. Their flavored margerita's are also really good...... and i dont even like margaritas. that is all."}
{"text":"I am literally OBSESSED with this place, particularly the cauliflower. Please get the cauliflower. I'm in Phoenix for work sometimes and even at home I rant about it. And also, the drinks (alcoholic/non alcoholic) are also absolutely delicious. Honestly everything is. I'm a vegetarian and have probably had every veggie option on the menu and it never gets old. Love the atmosphere too. Will continue to eat here as often as possible!!"}
{"text":"Overall, True Food is a pretty good restaurant. I love the healthy options, but the food can sometimes be bland. For example, the kale guacamole has absolutely no spice to it. You have to add salt-and-pepper, but once you do, it goes really well with the pita chips. 5/5. The spicy curry chicken is pretty darn good. It does have some kick to it - which I like - but some people might find it a bit spicy. 5/5. The only shortcomings of this restaurant is the wait and service time can be somewhat lacking. Overall, a good place to have lunch or dinner if you are in a healthy mood."}
{"text":"Went to check it out last Sat night on a whim. Didn't have reservations, so had to wait 15min, not a big deal, hung out and played with gadgets in the Apple store across the way.  they have a cool text feature when your table is ready. (i love this!)  The restaurant is flanked by two large patios with comfy looking seating.  We opted for inside, brrrr...too cold out for me!  It is pretty loud inside acoustically, but I like the open concept.  Giant square bar in front of the open kitchen,  very modern, clean lines, crisp green nature accents alongside toffee colored woods and surrounded by giant sliding door/windows.   We started out with the shrimp dumplings. They were surprisingly good. 4 juicy dumplings, nice ginger flavor-very light, the wonton skin was tender and better than I expected it would be. (I'd hope so for $11!) Comes in a nice subtle broth with some asian veggies and fresh shiitake mushrooms. I just have to keep reminding myself that we are not in LA :(    Also had the 'chicken noodle soup' with it's slightly asian influence being that the soup itself has a 'hot and sour' note to it.  It was decent. The noodles in it did remind me of campbells soup in a thin and overcooked way.   I had the Panang chicken curry....MMMMM YUMMMMY!  I love this dish!  It comes in a big white bowl with a very soupy, tamer version on 'Panang' but I still love it.  (even for $15) Has the normal root veggies, and still has a kick that creeps up on you a little at the end, but not too spicy by any means. It comes with brown rice that needs to be dug out of the bottom of the bowl. (they provide you with a spoon for this) I wish they would put a touch more rice in it.  The curry-to-rice-ratio is a little off.  I would come back and eat this for sure...  Significant other (S.O.)  had the salmon with lemon salad.  Salmon, (so-so) lacked a little flavor and was a bit boring. The lemon salad and red quinoa (the sides) got eaten first. Salad was small, bright, lemony, speckled with diced beets. My S.O. doesn't usually like quinoa and he ate every last speck of it.  They know how to cook it here.  Now he is asking why I don't make it at home haha.   Dessert. Apple cranberry crumble with maple ice cream.  It was a-okay.  I am very picky when it comes to desserts. Apples, cranberry, and some granola-y topping with some ice cream on top...it got eaten because it wasn't super rich and heavy, and it was nice and warm!  Service-This is probably one of the first times I've ever been to a FRC restaurant (especially a new one) and the service wasn't spot on.  Our server was a little slow on timing. We almost skipped dessert because we were wondering if we wanted to stay another 30+ minutes. Well, we did get it and we did end up staying later. No ice tea refill for my S.O. until dessert and forever to get the check....etc. just little things like that. nothing major, but still! I definitely will think twice about heading to True Food if I want a quick meal!"}
{"text":"As a vegan, I was extremely pleased with this restaurant. I ordered the lettuce cups which were spicy and flavorful as an appetizer and then a pizza with vegan ricotta, truffle, and tomatoes as a main. The vegan ricotta with bits of truffle was incredible. I absolutely loved it and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"True Food is a fantastic establishment with a variety of options for guests with food allergies which I greatly appreciate. The service was absolutely fantastic and the servers are genuinely so attentive and caring, especially Maddie, Adam, and Brent. I will always recommend this establishment to friends as it largely outshines the surrounding restaurants in every facet, drinks to dessert. Very happy I visited!"}
{"text":"Another place that I do want to mention I'm not a super healthy person nor do I have dietary restrictions, but once again I really enjoy this place.   The space is great. It's in the middle of Scottsdale quarter and on all sides they have doors/huge windows that open to the outside. Great patio that wraps around the building which has heaters on if it's a little too chilly. We sat outside and liked the vibe.   In the past I've been here for dinner and I really enjoy the dinner menu, and have to say the flourless chocolate cake is to die for as a dessert. This visit though, we got to sample the brunch menu.   Two of us opted for the special which was a breakfast sandwich that hasn't made it to the menu yet. It had tomato, avocado, an egg, and I believe a chicken sausage patty. The bun was also to die for. It came with sweet potato hash, which was pretty decent. Our third ordered the simple margherita pizza and liked it as well.   They have great lemonade and a good selection of tea and other beverages that do not include soda.   Our waitress was super friendly and they are always coming by to refill your water cups. Great service at a great place."}
{"text":"Pretty mixed I'd say, had the green tea soba dish, it was pretty flavorful but the vegetables, snowpeas and green beans mostly, were waaaaay undercooked. With only a small amount of these really thin soba noodles, it was like chewing through hunks of wood, and too much cilantro, every so often you'd just chomp down on an entire sprig of it it seemed. Still tasted pretty good though, just needs some refining.   The juice drink I had was really interesting and I liked it quite a bit. It was agave and Ginger, which gave it a nice bite but was still very refreshing and light feeling.  Overall it was not a bad experience, the atmosphere was nice (with the right company) and the wait-staff seemed helpful.  But for the price I would expect a little more concentration on their cooking not just the ingredients..."}
{"text":"Sissy eats much healthier than me, so she thought that Fox Restaurant Concept's True Food Kitchen would be a good middle ground for us.  She was spot-on!  I think True Food is the perfect mix of a healthy-ish meal with foodie flair.  It's not just for yogis, and I really think everyone can find something yummy.  I drank the Honey Lemonade, which was so refreshing after my long flight!  We ate outside on the terrace so I could enjoy the weather.  We kicked off our meal with Shiitake & Tofu Lettuce Cups.  This is not something I would normally order, but I found them to be very flavorful.  The filling was warm, a little nuttier than I prefer, but good!  For my main dish, I had the Turkey Lasagna (Sissy had a delish Spaghetti Squash Casserole) and LOVED it.  It was very hot coming out of the oven, but it was soooo good.  The portion was perfect, and the green spinach noodles and fresh ricotta were awesome.  I ate every bit.  And scraped the dish for sauce and cheese after.  Yum."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went here for the first time at around 12:30 with my mom for lunch and I had an amazing time here! We could either wait 5-010 minutes for a table or get seated right away outside and we chose the outside tables, misters outside are awesome and the area is completely shaded so I was not hot at all. The staff is so nice and everyone there is helpful and there's always someone walking around which is good if you need something. I tried the Pomegranate Limeade and it was so good! Definitely will be getting that again! I got the Mediterranean salad and added Chicken and it was to die for! Best salad ever so I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a salad here! The food and drinks came out super fast which makes this place so much better! Definitly will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to try True Food Kitchen. I tried Lyfe Kitchen a year ago in Denver and felt a bit under whelmed with the experience.   This expirence was much of the same. Don't get me wrong. The place is beautiful with big windows, plants and fresh food all around. I loved the open kitchen and watching the food prep go on right next to us.   The waitstaff was very, very friendly. But very, very slow. We were really hungry after hiking and really needed food and drinks to replenish. We did a lot of waiting which made us a bit hangry. It also seemed more like a fast casual place than a full service type ambiance so we really just wanted to eat and run, which is what most people around us were doing. We also noticed how people who arrived after us received their food before us which was irritating.   We tried their juices which were fresh and tasty. They also had a nice presentation. But again, took 15 minutes to come out. Then we had the soup of the day which was a Thai Curry chicken soup. It was amazing. It was spicy and the flavor was spot on. We then had a fall vegetable salad that I felt was very tasty for what it was. My husband didn't agree and he wasn't too happy with it. I'd definitely give it another try since I love whole, fresh foods. I'd come here if there were one close to me  and try other stuff since it seems like all the options may not be consistent. I love that there are chefs out there creating unique and flavorful plant based dishes. Hopefully this trend will continue to spread!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and like most of the Fox restaurants, the food was delicious.  Had the quinona chicken salad, flourless chocolate cake (well a bite or two) and one of the non-alcoholic juice beverages.  Very pleased with the experience and great price point."}
{"text":"Slow, rude, decent food but not worth the money. A customer shouldn't feel as if they are burdening the staff by being there. I've been there more than once and every time I'm treated poorly or ignored completely. Not impressed with the Biltmore snobbery in the least."}
{"text":"WOW!  I am very sorry that it took me so long to convince Bri D. to go here.  We went for brunch and it was amazing.  Absolutely one of the best breakfasts I have ever had.  The johnny cakes were out of this world!  They have a granola-y taste to them, are filled with blueberries, and topped with yogurt and real maple syrup.  It is this awesome combo of sweet and tart that is great.  Despite being three pancakes, they weren't heavy and dense like normal ones.  They made me feel satisfied but not \"stuffed\" and gave me lots of energy throughout the day.  That's exactly what the awesome waitress said they would do.  I love this place!  It is beautiful inside, I love their theme, I love their concept, and I love the food.  Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. A beautiful location, great outdoor patio, and excellent service. The veggie crudité and spaghetti squash casserole were both excellently prepared, presented, and arrived at the right time. I would go back any day of the week."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The dishes are incredibly unique and the atmosphere is perfect. The portions aren't too big and I always leave feeling healthier. I can't imagine a more perfect concept for a restaurant. I have no complaints!!"}
{"text":"Are you a health nut with boat loads of cash?   If so, this place is for you, otherwise, not so much. I can't argue with the notion of healthy, unprocessed, organic food, but this place takes it too far. Consider the beverage choices, ranging in price between $3-5. Offerings include the Red Moon (pink grapefruit, yuzu, agave and soda) and Andy's Elixir (olivella juice, agave nectar and soda water). I Googled olivella juice when I got home and it's made from sea buckthorn berries? In fairness, when I asked the waitress about the bizarre beverage offerings, she told me that Pepsi products were available, but not on the menu.   The food menu encompasses a range of odd ingredients such as kale, tempeh, Anasazi beans, and tofu lettuce cups. To be \"safe\" I ordered the Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl. The entree was 90% vegetables, containing minimal chicken and even less rice. It was so dry; I kept digging for even a pocket of teriyaki sauce. Even so, the dish was artfully presented.   The man behind the True Food's brand is Dr. Andy Weil. While I admire him as a physician and originator of integrative medicine, I think he should stay out of the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and just about everything on the menu!  Even their beverages and cocktails are made with all natural ingredients and are super refreshing.  Service is always reliable and friendly as well.  It's a pricier lunch, but always so delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great contemporary cuisine restaurant. Modern atmosphere, great menu, good service. A favorite for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great location, great views.  The patio is a great place to relax and visit with friends while people watching.   The palm tree lights in the courtyard give a soft, relaxing feeling.  Fun weekend night out!"}
{"text":"Really cool, foodie restaurant in scottsdale. All the food was fresh and original. The service was quick and pleasant, and definitely a place to consider to eat. It's not the cheapest restaurant but worth the price. This place definitely belongs in Scottsdale as is more upscale and you could sense it from the decor and service."}
{"text":"Brilliant!  The drinks and food are amazing.  Staff is knowledgeable, quick and happy to be of service. Atmosphere is terrific too."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and been here a ton, and I don't usually write reviews but I wanted to say our waiter Ted was so nice :) probably the nicest I've had anywhere in a very very long time!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place after all of the excellent reviews.  Unfortunately, nobody from my table of 6+ enjoyed at all what they ate.    It really does taste \"healthy\", in that it doesn't have a lot of flavor, and is more like running on a treadmill.  Yeah, it's good for you, but it's not really how I'd like to spend my time and money with friends.  The kale salad was fine, considering it was kale.  The only semblance of enjoyable dish was the beef/steak tacos, which a friend got."}
{"text":"Great Service.    Food is pretty good as well. Don't recommend it for a a romantic dinner/date night.  Seating tables are too close..."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. I love everything about it. Atmosphere, service, quality and portions of food, drinks.. everything! I loved everything! Me and the bf got two apps and 3 entrees and they brought everything to us split already which earned xtra brownie points for sure!! Everything looked so good we had a hard time narrowing down so we just went all out and had no regrets.  Can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"Family dinner (we have a lot of those) with kids and they were as happy as we were here.  The crudite' appetizer was delicious and I'm pretty sure we all got about 2 days worth of our veggies here.  We did need a second fill of the tzatsiki sauce though.  The kale salad was great too.  But the star of this meal was my daughter's squash, walnut, and arugula pizza.  I am grateful that she shared a slice with me but next time I will get one of my own!"}
{"text":"A really good organic restauraunt. Not the best because it's pretty commercialized as a fox restaurant concept. I prefer herb box and Cafe tryst. However if you like organic food and you are going to be at scottsdale quarter there is no better option."}
{"text":"Impressed every single time! I've been to the Scottsdale location 5 or 6 times. We've never had poor service; the wait can be long but that's because the food is quality and we all want it. The gluten free lasagna is the perfect comfort food + inflammation friendly. The pad thai is my go to, and it always hits the spot. It's full of inflammation friendly veggies. The edamame dumplings are so flavorful and creamy. The dashi is a nice touch- I could literally just eat 20 of these and I'd be so satsified. I'm hoping they bring back the blackened avocado this summer as a seasonal item, because I've yet to master it at home. Lastly, we met Barney during our last visit. His service is remarkable. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and encouraged our guests to try whatever looked good, and offered to replace it if they didn't like it. They obviously LOVED it, but his communication and service embodies the culture of the organization and separated him from your average server."}
{"text":"Loved it. Very fresh and didn't feel guilty after eating delicious food. Try the Sashimi Tuna Salad."}
{"text":"The food was good and healthy but, the portion sizes are very skimpy for the high price you will pay.  Plus, you will pay a premium and might not get enough to eat and you might not receive great service.  Based on my experience, I received poor service from the moment I walked in the entrance of True Food Kitchen.  The hostess was very rude and had an unpleasant and ugly attitude.  It was shocking to encounter a hostess at a restaurant at Biltmore Fashion Park with a nasty attitude.  The hostess had clearly not been trained about how to provide good hospitality.  She set the pace for the rest of the unpleasant dining experience.  A host or hostess should be pleasant, friendly, courteous, respectful and polite.  None of these qualities were exhibited by the hostess at True Food Kitchen.  I expressed my concerns with the manager and he did not seem very concerned about the issues.  It is very disappointing to visit a restaurant that seems like it should provide great service with good food and to encounter poor service instead.  It is not acceptable for a restaurant to charge a premium price for food and to offer substandard service.  I am not satisfied with the type of service I received and I want to let others know about it.  There are many other great restaurants you should try instead of this one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bison burger, turkey wrap, autumn salad, kale salad, sweet potato hash, seasonal sodas are all delicious! Especially the bison burger... Juicy and tasty! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Great food! Hubby & I are visiting Scottsdale & got this recommendation from Yelp. It's a great place with great food... The ambiance was energetic, very positive and service in the bar was quick. There was a 25 minute wait for seats but the bar was a great alternative. Will look for them in California."}
{"text":"When I found out this restaurant was by Sam Fox, I thought YES!!!!!  From the window, this restaurant is very visually appealing .... HUGE kitchen, lots of people busily cooking, chopping, etc., bright and fresh colors.  I especially liked the butcher block table/industrial chair combo.  The kitchen extends into the dining area, so there a certain entertainment factor.  I have no idea what is going conceptually with the cuisine.  I get the whole \"healthy ingredients\" idea.  But, for goodness sake, pick a genre!  It's like a pizza joint meets Asian fusion diner meets Italian pasta joint meets new American cuisine (for lack of better description) meets juice bar.  There is nothing really tying the menu together, except quality ingredients, which just does not seem to work.  The server is far from stellar, and there were WAY too many servers per patron.  We never saw the same waiter/waitress twice.  Someone greets you, someone seats you, anther person takes your drink order, another brings the drinks, another takes your food order... you get my drift.  It took my dining partner and I asking three times to get our drinks - in fact, we finished our first course before we even got ice water.  Each time the waiter/waitress seemed put out by our request.  We shared a salad, soup and pizza - which evidently is a no-no at True Food.  Those who choose to share because they do not have a huge appetite and do not like leftovers are seriously looked down upon.    Apart from bad service, the food was not good.... at all.  The chicken minestrone soup and the sausage fennel pizza were very bland.  It was like they focused so much on the \"healthy\" aspect, that they forgot to flavor or season anything.  The pizza was tantamount to eating crispy cardboard.  I have a history of liking Fox restaurants, so this was, to say the least, was very disappointing.  I actually gave the restaurant the benefit-of-the-doubt due to it being a Fox restaurant and went back for another meal hoping it would redeem itself... yeah, it didn't.  I'd stay away from True Food.... there are a lot better options in the general vicinity that off MUCH better cuisine/service."}
{"text":"It's okay. To me it seems a tad over-hyped but that's just me. Our hipster server forgot my glass of wine and brought us the wrong order, but in all fairness I think he was having a bad hair day and we've all been there at one time or another."}
{"text":"Love this place. They food is consistently great and you feel pretty darn good about yourself for eating a healthy meal. I personally love the chopped Chicken Salad. Bummer that they took the Bison Burger off the menu but their grass -fed burger is a good substitute. Also, try the pita and hummus. The pitas they make are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the grass fed burger with sweet potatoes and kale.  Disappointed that they don't have any sodas."}
{"text":"I love True Food mainly because they are non-gmo and organic! This place has a very natural classy ambience. The service is usually good even though they are soooooooo busy all the time!  I love the TLT and Teriyaki brown rice bowl.. wish they had more vegan options! Awesome drinks.. Natural refreshments and the cocktails!"}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting more. While I dig the clean open vibe and the location, the menu left me wanting more. I was hoping for more wheat, soy and dairy free options...  On this trip I sat at the bar and decided on the Seared Aji Sliders and was given the options of roasted sweet potatoes or the kale salad. When the waitress/bartender saw my difficulty in trying to decide she offered up half of each. That was easy! I have to agree with a few Yelpers here I will be going back for the Kale Salad. The flavor was zesty and the texture wonderful although I will ask them to pass on the crumb topping next time. And while a fan of sweet potatoes in general, I found these to be over roasted dry/chewy tidbits I chased around my plate trying to eat and generally unimpressive. As for the sliders themselves. I was wishing for more of the wasabi aoli and sprouts. I wish the sear was on a hotter grill because they ended up slightly overcooked and not really seared.  For my beverage I had the Nojito.  I have had and I make something similar at home frequently  with fresh ginger, mint and fresh lemons and/or limes sweetened with either stevia, honey or agave nectar (depending on what I have on hand).  I was expecting the same quality, however the lemon juice tasted bottled and not fresh, it was just ok.   Over all I would probably go back as I do value their organic natural approach but for the price I may just stick to the options I get around the corner at Phoenix Public Market and I keep it local."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend, P, for her birthday lunch. We were both excited to try it and had heard good. I had tried a couple of bites from them at corks and forks and nothing tasted great but cooking for a bunch of people at a festival like that can be difficult so I chalked that up to a fluke, skipped breakfast and came prepared wearing my eating pants.   We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated then got a nice table towards the back where we could watch the beautiful Scottsdale/Arcadia moms lunch behind the glass. Why they were behind glass in their own separate room, I don't know.   What seemed to be the most promising part of the meal was the delicious juice concoctions on the menu THAT YOU CAN ADD VODKA TO!!! That's my dream. Why can't you do this everywhere? P ordered the Ginger Nojito and I got the New Dew. Our beautiful spiked drinks arrived in tall, pretty glasses and while P's was quite good, mine tasted like a tea made from old sweaty gym socks. I was pretty sure at this point it was just me because everything here is supposed to be really good so she tried it to and yup, gym socks. Once we got the waiter back we explained my drink's disgusting nature and while I wanted a little sympathy, he seemed to just think I didn't like it. Surely this wasn't the way it's meant to be served. It tasted nothing like honeydew, mint or limes. I went with what P had at that point because it was safe (I hate having to do that) and we decided to order.   We started with the Caramelized Onion Tart with Figs and Gorgonzola, added on the Edamame Dumplings at the recommendation of our waiter and rounded out our meal with Curry with Rice Noodle, Cauliflower, Cashews and Chicken. Everything came out pretty much at once but we started on the tart. It was near paper thin with the onions and figs a sweet contrast against the salty, skunky Gorgonzola. I could have eaten four of the them. Anybody who goes here, order this tart. It is so delicious, probably the best thing on the menu. The edamame dumplings proved to be bland, mush filled dough balls sitting in a pool of broth. They didn't taste particularly bad, just bland but that filling was so mushy inside. We couldn't get over the texture and textures don't normally bother me. Finally, our entree. It unfortunately was not much better than the dumplings. Cauliflower was described in the title but it only came with a few pieces. The sauce had a little bite but was still on the bland side at the same time. Does that make sense? It was spicy-ish, but without flavor. It tasted like a high quality TV dinner.   My husband went for a business lunch a couple weeks later and I told him to order the onion tart. He had pretty much the same experience. The tart was the best thing they ordered. We truly must be missing something because it seems that most people love this place. I won't be coming back unless it's a business dinner and I have no choice in the matter, but what could I say then."}
{"text":"What a terrific spot! My salad blew me away.   If you aren't familiar with Fox Restaurant Concepts, they operate a variety of restaurants that emphasize locally sourced, fresh ingredients. This location was new to me but I knew of the brand & their reliably good menus (wild flower).   I had the chicken salad- the manchego cheese, paired with the marcona almonds, the medjool dates, the crunchy jicama- wow, what a pairing! The dehydrated cranberries offered a tart compliment & texture to the sweet dates & both paired well with the manchego. It's topped with a champagne vinaigrette, which is ideal. I ordered it without any farro but it was still filling and absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet, but sweet enough that you feel like you're getting both lunch & dessert.  They had a fantastic selection of juices & tea options! I hear the Hangover beverage with coconut, honey & pineapple is one of their best.  I opted for the iced green tea which I really enjoyed.  I found the ambiance to be cool, hip, with a nice outside seating area. The ceilings were high & you can see into the open kitchen. I was enamored watching the chef dig out multiple spaghetti squash. I think I found a new technique.   With the wood floors, high ceilings and lots of glass, it's pretty noisy. I wish they'd install some noise absorbing material but that aside, I've found a new go to PHX lunch spot."}
{"text":"Crudités, steak street tacos & the cucumber refresher - always perfect. The service is great and the decor is fun. It is nice to have healthy, enjoyable options that still offer great flavor."}
{"text":"For me, this place is amazing! I have to say I don't think it's for everyone though, simply because the food is, well.... true and delicious!  You can actually taste what you are eating, see the flavors on your plate and taste them on your tongue; your palate is not confused by an over abundance of sauce and seasonings like in so many other restaurants.... The menu is relatively limited, which means every plate is consistently good and made to order; having a fresh selection of food and none of that leftover \"soup of the day\" and frozen made-up dishes you get in restaurants with menus that are 3 pages long! They do have a soup of the day, but it's made, as the name says, with veggies available at that time of year at the market - same as I make at home and yes, I recognize what's in it  Last time we dined at True we shared the Edamame Dumplings: I wish we had each ordered a plate they were sooo good!! they were made white truffle oil, dashi and asian herbs, the dumplings themselves were cooked perfectly and the puddle of sauce was delicious too.... we were all looking at the last lone dumpling on the plate: nobody making a move. I was determined to have it so I snaked my hand out to grab it - only to find my nephew's fingers doing the same! we split (tore!) that lil'dumpling in half and smacked our lips in satisfied happiness! The selection of drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic is quite good; there are teas & smoothies, kombucha & juices, beer & cider, martinis margaritas & other cocktails. To follow I had the Wild Mushroom Pizza with roasted garlic, taleggio, asparagus: my favorite cheese and vegs on a perfect sized and baked pizza - delicious  The others had a Steelhead salmon, yum! a Spicy Panang Curry Bowl, I think someone had the Tacos but not sure, I was too busy eating my pizza and drinking my Ginger Margarita to really notice, sorry....and a Spaghetti Squash Casserole that looked amazing. Everyone finished everything so that is absolutely a great sign !! I of course just had to have dessert, so ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake, another of my faves, and oh my was it good  I had to keep an eye on all those forks jabbing at it from around the table! Do go to True Food Kitchen wether you love good, real food and know all about quinoa and ginger or you want to taste real, good food and maybe venture out a bit into new flavors : you will love this restaurant !"}
{"text":"What I wouldn't give to have this restaurant that's just bursting with good healthy fresh food - packed with vegetables, no less - in my city.  Our party of 5 was seated at a king sized wooden tables, of which there are many. I remark on this because I'm from two cities where they cram us all in so that we're intimate with strangers. I realize I might not mind this too much. We pretty much had to shout across the table to each other, the tables are so large! I'd be more bugged by that if I wasn't so in love with the concept and food. Regardless, it's good to know that large groups can be accommodated (10 probably could have fit at our table!)  Our shared apps:  -crudité with dips (loved the black olive!)  I really *really* wish huge bowls of fresh, crunchy veggies would become an American restaurant trend, ruling over the damn bacon or *insert your unhealthy comfort food* trends that I'm positive only exist  thanks to a backfire that BS fat-free 90s food trend. Anyway, I fully accept such a trend probably won't happen anytime soon.   -herbed hummus (divine! It has a unique taste and excellent texture).  I ordered and did *not* share because it was so good I conveniently forgot:  -the mouthwatering Tuscan Kale salad (one of the best I've ever had in a restaurant)  -TLT with avocado (piles of freshness: lettuce, beautiful tomato, lush avocado and crispy tempeh SO plentiful, I should have stopped at one half but I couldn't stop!!)  Dessert? Oh, I would have tried, believe me, if half as good as all that preceded it, no doubt would have been incredible. But I was immobile by meal's end.  True Food is the healthiest franchise I've ever had the fortune of experiencing! Here's to hoping they branch out to New Orleans."}
{"text":"True foods used to be so so good. Lately we have had stale bread, missing items, etc. They have also changed up some of their ingredients. They're Mediterranean salad is now regular lettuce instead of the dark healthy greens they used to use. (They also forgot my salmon) and the albacore tataki appetizer is different too.. and not for the better. I am in town visiting and was super excited to order their salad but unfortunately it was a disappointment. Go back to your old ingredient combinations!"}
{"text":"I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months. This is one of my mom's favorite places to eat and I can understand why. The ravioli and the miso soup are so delicious! The wine was ok and I would recommend one of their elixirs over an alcohol beverage. Still a pretty delicious place to go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Can't deny that TFK has great food, great service and all at great prices. Yes it get's crowded and inside is louder than out but it's one of the best places to get good healthy food in scottsdale@"}
{"text":"Interesting and unusual offerings was the attraction. Nice decor, friendly staff. The cauliflower appetizer was great. The Cashew Pad Thai strayed way too far from traditional Thai. Flavors were not Thai-like at all. Too smokey and overbearing seasoning. Parking was a hassle and GPS was dumbfounded by the building not actually being located on the street the address indicated. In the Kierland complex."}
{"text":"After shopping in the Quarter, I wanted something light to eat so I decided to finally give TFK a try.  It was barely noon on a Saturday, but the inside was already packed and people were waiting to be seated.  The hostess said I could wait for inside seating or I could be seated immediately on their heated patio.  But it was cold outside. Heater or not, I moved away from a cold region so I would've have to endure the cold. * enter tummy-bursting wolf growl*... Ok, I'll take the patio.  It was a nice, large wrap around patio; partially enclosed with covering, but the outside air creeped in through the openings.  However, the overhead heaters were quite powerful and efficient, even for me.   Their menu items are labeled as vegan or vegetarian, and the symbols are different for each (thank you!).    ANDY'S TLT (vegan): Think BLT with tempeh taking bacon's place, and of course I omitted the tomatoes.  $10, but it ended up being worth it.  A nice sized sandwich, cut in half, served with plenty of what looked like butter lettuce, Vegenaise, tempeh bacon, and avocado, on toasted bread.  And let me tell you, they were not skimpy on the tempeh or the avocado. I was very pleased with the portions. It was delicious.  Everything was very fresh (no brown or day old avocado here!) and the tempeh was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I've tried and tried, and cannot get my home-cooked tempeh to turn out like that.  Also, it came with a yummy kale salad.   I only ate half of my meal.  Partially because I was almost full, but honestly? I wanted dessert!  I inquired about their vegan dessert options. I had read reviews which mentioned a seasonal vegan cobbler and I was really hoping to try that.  The waiter asked the chef and unfortunately, no vegan cobbler for me that day.  They offered a Chia Pudding or some other banana flavored dessert.  Not a big fan of the nana, so I inquired about their vegan ice cream.  The waiter offered sorbet. I wasn't impressed... Until he said \"maple.\" Maple sorbet? Let's give it a go.  MAPLE SORBET (vegan): $2.50 per scoop. It was amazing! Creamy, delicious, maple-infused sorbet, which tasted like ice cream more than a sorbet.  The only thing that would've made it better if it had been served on top of a vegan cobbler.    Good food and service.  Nice restaurant and atmosphere.  I'd like to return to try more vegan food items, and... vegan cobbler?"}
{"text":"I like that True Food Kitchen is steadfast in its offerings of delicious, seasonal, and flavorful vegan options year round.  The Andy's TLT, a vegan version of the American classic BLT, using Vegenaise and cruelty-free tempeh instead of bacon, is my favorite go-to.  The Organic Tuscan Kale Salad, sans the cheese, is delicious.  They've recently added new vegan items, like the Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Charred Cauliflower dish, and a Beet Bruschetta.  So far, I've tried the Brussels Sprouts, which were very good.   As for the desserts, the squash pie (seasonal item, usually available autumn to winter), and the Apple Goji Crisp (basically, an apple cobbler) a la mode, courtesy of a delicious coconut ice cream, are all scrumptious!  This location has messed up my carry-out orders so be sure to double-check your orders before leaving."}
{"text":"Just do it.   The food is healthy, but not vegetarian.   The nail the mix of ambiance, solid food and healthy.   The heirloom carrots and ancient grain bowl are 10/10's"}
{"text":"Amazing menu and the pomegranate sorbet is so scrumptious!!! Great, fun, healthy, hip restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to try a new restaurant. Thanks Yelp! We work Saturday nights so I forgot how Saturday night crowds are. The restaurant was pretty busy (Obviously a good sign) so we sat at the bar. Fortunately the full menu is available   We started with the lettuce wraps - delicious! I had the panang curry chicken. It was delicious as well. It was just the right amount of spicy. My husband had the squash casarole. It was super yummy but a little sweet and could use a side dish.  We also had the flour less cake. Ridiculously delicious."}
{"text":"This review comes a little bit late, but I wanted to make sure I came back to comment on the outstanding service we received from one of your servers, Rory (Raury?).  A group of 4 of us came to celebrate my aunt's birthday the weekend before Halloween, and from the service to the food, everything was outstanding.  Rory and the staff went to every length to make sure we had everything we needed, from tastes of wine to extra veggies & pita for the hummus appetizer (which was fantastic).  I had the sea bass, which was savory as Rory had described.  I decided I wanted a little pop of flavor with a sauce and Rory brought me some sort of lemon dressing that was fantastic.  For dessert, I had the banana chia pudding which as always, was to die for.  I can't wait to be back.  Thanks Rory & staff!"}
{"text":"What an amazing, no pressure dining experience. We had the seasonal ingredient salad with shrimp and the quinoa teriyaki bowl.  A great thing about this place is they will split your food for you so a meal is easily shared.  Now let's talk food...  The seasonal ingredient was a harmonious blend of seasonal vegetables in a light, but flavorful vinaigrette.   The teriyaki bowl is an incredible mix of high fiber, gluten free grains (gluten free until you add an optional protein).  Hearty and satisfying, this heart healthy meal will leave with a guiltlessly full belly.  We added chicken which added a whole different element, elevating the bowls flavor profile."}
{"text":"Have not been disappointed.  Excellent food with varied menu selection.  I have had the Ahi sliders, fish, hummus and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not ony is the food outstanding but the service is amazing. We went to the Scottsdale Quarter on a Saturday and a group of bicycle riders hit, kicked, and spat on my mother's car after they rode out into the street in front of her, she is a 67 year old woman, no reason to threaten her, especially after they broke the law. She was terribly shaken and our server, Shannon was so sweet, gave my mom a hug and turned her day around. She was attentive, quick, helpful, and went the extra mile to make my mom feel better. The food is consistently excellent and it is definitely one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Food is decent.   This place is on the pretentious side.   Won't be a regular here."}
{"text":"I have never had bad service or food here. Love their seasonal menu enhancements.The ancient grains bowl is surprising and tasty!"}
{"text":"A great selection of fresh, healthy food options. Birkenstock sandals optional  . Every dish we tried was full of flavor. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great ambiance.  Excellent service.  If you're looking for a vibrant atmosphere, with delicious (and healthy) fare, do yourself a favor and try True Food Kitchen.  The food is good, but the service is impeccable.  EVERY single time my wife and I have dined here, we have been welcomed warmly and have been treated like regulars.  The staff is efficient, and is never in a hurry to just take your order and leave the table. The management is to be commended for hiring/training such a great staff.  The Scottsdale Quarter vibe means there is much to take in and some excellent people watching as a side note.  If you want to feel like your business is appreciated, and you want to support local business - make a point to eat here soon."}
{"text":"We had two Bowl meals with our wine. Very tasty. Great setting, excellent service, very good Key Lime Pie."}
{"text":"Great decor. Great service.  Worth the wait.  Versatile menu that changes with season appropriate ingredients. Keep getting stuck on the pizza and salads,...yet they will definitely push me to come back for a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"Although I am not a huge fan of True Food during the week, the weekend brunch menu is fantastic and I go just about every weekend for it. The service is solid and the prices are reasonable. The real star for us though is one of the managers (Arie -- although I'm sure I spelled her name wrong). She is incredibly friendly and helpful. We love her!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, you have to go to this place!! I always order the Grilled Steelhead Salmon, Chia Pudding, and Kale Aid. Never do I get tired of this combination.   Salmon is slightly grilled and is perfectly integrated into a crisp corn and freekah salad. It's quite healthy and delicious. The Chia Pudding isn't the most health conscious item on the menu, but it may rate in the top five desserts that I've had in my lifetime so far. Kale Aid is pretty standard kale juice. If you like kale, then you'll like this drink.   My only complaint is that the service is SO SLOW. It takes around 30 minutes to get your entree and then 20 minutes in between for drinks and dessert. I don't understand why it takes so long. The last time we went, we placed all of our orders up front and then told them to bring them as soon as possible so that we could finish dinner in 90 minutes. Also, the place seems to be under utilizing a lot of tables. They seat two people groups at 4 person tables and then seem to \"run out of space.\"  You can ask to be seated outside, but it's going to be terribly hot. They have mist sprays for the tables outside, but they never seem to hit my face.   Two Tips -  1. Call ahead and make reservations.  2. Order everything up front.   Also, get your parking validated at the restaurant. Parking is free for up to two hours in the parking lot across from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well... I tried doing at the local spot numerous times. I'm gluten free all picky is good. The menu looks perfect.. but every time I stop in (2-3) I can't seem to fight out what to order. So I finally ate there tonight. Lovely food.. Different out eclectic taste. Nothing was typical, which doesn't mean the new was outstanding. I could post a couple of booboos that were made, but they were excellent for staff."}
{"text":"I had held off on trying True Food for a long time because.....well.....  the food they serve here is like the food I cook at home but costs a lot more money. I came here with my book club for brunch. The food was.... fine. I had the huevos rancheros on our waiter's rec.... it was really bland. A friend had the quinoa burger, which I thought was pretty tasty. Overall, I feel like when I spend a decent amount of money, I really want something more delicious than what I make at home... but if you feel like something healthy ish and don't mind spending 15$ or so for said food, this place will do."}
{"text":"Great food, service has been oddly bad the last 2 times I've been there.  We had to correct our check because the server couldn't figure it out and we didn't have time to wait another 15 minutes for them to sort it out.  I'd avoid this place."}
{"text":"Truly over rated. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good either. I made a pledge I would from now on seek out local restaurants with fewer ratings for a more wide range of experiences. The lure of organic, fresh, cosmopolitan drew us in to True Food Kitchen. We had to see what all the hype was. A walk by the chefs taking charge of vegetables got us excited about the menu. Simply cool place. We waited quite awhile to be served on the swell outdoor patio. The make shift grilled cheese was disappointing for the ten-year old. My sea bass tacos were sadly bland but my husband raved about the turkey burger. His entire plate swallowed ours. After waiting for quite a period for our check and to pay, I reminded myself why I wanted to get off the beaten path."}
{"text":"Phoenix, encapsulated: You can order a plate of spring vegetables in August, but the chef has no idea what \"spring vegetables\" are.  The salmon more than made up for the roasted veggie entree... I'll go back for just the fish. Ditto for the shrimp dumpling app. Both simply made, but delicious.  Service was excellent, from the girl who opened the door with a huge smile, to the server who stopped by every five minutes to make sure everything was perfect. The server was amazing... She knew everything about everything on the menu. Management is obviously taking good care of the place, so I'll definitely be back.  Bonus points for the minimalist, trendy LA decor and American Apparel server outfits. It's cliched, but it works.   I actually felt like a better person for eating here."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome food, great service and such a charismatic ambience. The location is very hip and there is a lot of ongoings to keep the meal interesting. The veggies are delicious and fresh. The main courses are just as good, better in fact. Very happy with this place and will be going again. 10/10!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but not anymore. Terrible management, cheap drinks. My reservation for birthday got cancelled a day before it , which was booked a week in advance. Do not recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. It does sometime have a wait and it takes a while to get seated but I understand so many people like to come here for dinner. We ended up seating at the bar which is fun as well.   I usually order the edamame dumplings to start and get the goat cheese pizza. These are my favorite items on the menu. Top it off with their champagne bottle and we've got a great dinner.   Awesome service, great food."}
{"text":"True Food is a healthy alternative to your typical restaurant. The Kale salad is amazing! I didn't think I would like kale. Also amazing are the Spaghetti Squash Casserole and the Turkey Pita. They also have a large variety of specialty sodas in addition to beer and wine. The staff is very knowledgeable on all food too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for an early dinner on Saturday night and were quite impressed! Even early though on Saturday we had about a 15 minute wait but got a great table on the patio. The only take reservations for parties of 8 or more.   Started off with the edamame dumplings which were fresh and delicious. Then I had the white shrimp ramen and my husband had the chicken curry panang. Both were absolutely wonderful! You could taste the whole grain goodness, yet they both were full of flavor and just enough spiciness to keep that happy feeling in your mouth last. I don't know who was com planing about the portions but they were definitely enough for dinner. We ended up with the banana tart dessert which was also wonderful. Fresh and not overwhelmingly sweet like so many restaurant desserts.   Overall a great experience and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have often thought maybe I should move to Scottsdale just so I can eat True Food. I could eat olive oil almond cake everyday!!  It is very very good and I've had really good service everytime I've come so not sure what the other comments about bad service are about."}
{"text":"Love this place. Amazing food and atmosphere. The curry with tofu is great."}
{"text":"The food just was not that great for the price point. Additionally, the noodle dish I ordered was DRENCHED in oil. It gave me a stomach ache shortly after."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and very healthy food choices. I love to sit outside.in the winter time and watch the kids play in the water fountains. The place is all lit up at night. Great place for a date and a movie next to it IPic. We love yhe quinoa bowls with steak. The avocado appertizer is to die for. Highly recommended.  We never get sick when we eat here."}
{"text":"True foods is a fun, modern-feeling restaurant that offers very fresh and unique meals. In general, when I read the description of a dish here, I only know what half of the ingredients are, tops. So there is a certain element of guess work involved.  Will I like gai lan, purslane, or manchego? I have no idea.  And you'd better like kale if you go to this place. Seriously. They are all about kale.  I've eaten here several times and while I've liked the food, I haven't LOVED it and I tend to walk away feeling like I want more. I can't identify what that \"more\" might be, but I can tell that it's missing. Everything has just been \"ok\", with the exception of the spring market salad, which I absolutely *FELL IN LOVE* with. Only to return and find it was gone for the season. Bummer.   Overall, a 3.5."}
{"text":"After years of driving by True Food we finally committed to going in and giving it a try. We have lost a lot of weight and thought perhaps they will have some healthy options otherwise there was likely no way I was getting my caveman husband to consider this place. Being in the Biltmore doesn't help as all the plastic, Botox joker faces walk around with their snoots in the air. We were greeted at the door by Jordan and Scout two of the friendliest hostess staff I have met.  They encouraged us to try a drink from the bar while we waited for a table. My husband went to the bar and returned with an Old Fashioned that was simple delish. He reported the bartender Chris was absolutely the nicest guy ever. He the turned to greet Scott the assistant GM who also was super cordial and welcoming. In short order our table was ready and Scout brought us over. Our waiter was Mike down to earth and pretty laid back provided great customer service and explained the concept of the food. We ordered starting with hummus.  Umm...yea it was awesome. I ordered steak street tacos and the husband lasagna. Both of them were really good. The beans with the street tacos had a great flavor. The lasagna was really good we enjoyed it a great deal will have to come back for it again. We chatted with the floor manager Arianna for a long time and she had a dessert brought to the table the flourless chocolate cake and it was like wow yummy. It was not low fat for sure but it tasted so flippen good. We will definitely be back we only think one thing would have added to the meal and that was filtered water. Phoenix tap water is not so tasty. We loved it!!!!!"}
{"text":"True to its name, True Food kitchen focuses on nourishing foods that taste good. I didn't think the food was amazing, but it's a very good option if you're traveling and want something that is decently healthy and not super expensive. There are also tons of vegan/vegetarian options, but the menu wasn't that creative as far as \"healthy\" or vegan options go. It didn't have a wow factor that I would have expected in this Kierland Commons area. I had the Panang Curry Bowl with tofu, which was very heavy on the potatoes, a tad too salty, and it only came with three cubes of tofu, despite the $3 up-charge. However, my companions' other bowls looked much better and the squash pie for dessert was very good. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but hey, the decor is nice, service is pretty fast, and it's a good option for satisfying varying dietary preferences, especially in a large group."}
{"text":"fresh, fruity, affordable, and deeee-lightful!  True Food Kitchen makes you believe that all other food might be - *gasp* - fake! this is seriously healthy food with flavor flare and creativity. not only that, but they truly exude the organic way of life with their considerate service and bouncy personalities to match.  Now don't go ordering something you wouldn't usually order just b/c you think it will be healthy. If you like fish, eat the fish, don't eat the steak tacos just b/c you think it'll be healthy - of course you will be less inclined to like it!   so far, i have had their soba noodles entree - it is a plentiful serving of cold green tea noodles tossed with peas, bok choy, and ginger. seriously good for you and excitingly tasty!  i have also had the tuna sliders, which come with no sides, so i suggest the sweet potato hash for something filling. the wasabi mayo, pickled onions, and avocado go deliciously well with the seared tuna patties.   last a-ha! tasteI had was trying the sustainable red wine from Arizona! Who woulda thunk that this glass would be so well-balanced -- and good for the earth too. Yay!  in a land where all i thought i could get was steak and deep fried tacos, True Food Kitchen is truly my home kitchen away from home!"}
{"text":"I have always loved there food , yet time and time again worst service . Perfect example tonight .. we got in , took 10 min... just to get acknowledged , then when we  ordered cocktails ... and food . From that point wrong food came, then my appetizer finally came . The worst part was all our food came, before we ever got our cocktail which is pricey in the first place . . I then realized I've never , not  once have  got even mediocre service . Tonight has prevailed . Last time I will come here when I spend the money for this place time and time again the service is disappointing Especially for the price of the food."}
{"text":"TFK Scottsdale is amazing! I have been in town for a couple weeks now and have been in 4 times. Every time whether my server is someone new or one that I have had before, the hospitality is welcoming, friendly, and personal. Every step from getting a great table on the patio, to a welcoming server, to the amazing, fresh food is exactly what I am looking for when dining. My server Cassandra last night especially was so wonderful. I will always come back to TFK Scottsdale and highly recommend it to anyone in town or in Phx."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great stop for vegetarians, vegans, or carnivores like me who just want to be healthy. The food is always good and they have a lot of options for everyone. Try the Mediterranean Chop Salad with chicken. It's fabulous!"}
{"text":"TFK is my favorite spot in Scottsdale Quarter. The food is always fresh and healthy. When I visit, I enjoy the spaghetti? squash with tofu or the vegan pizza. The guacamole is also so delicious. It has a cool atmosphere that feels light and bright. I always look forward to my next meal at True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite restaurant in the valley. Both locations have wonderful staff and amazing dishes. Our waiters and waitresses know the ingredients and the menu so well that my celiac husband always feels safe dining here.   All of their drinks and many of their dishes are gluten free. I've tried many of the refreshers and each one is delicious. My favorite dishes are the red chili shrimp noodles and the panang curry. My husband loves the street tacos, pizzas, or the short ribs. We like to start with the tuna tataki. Almost every meal here ends with the chia seed pudding.   This restaurant has a great variety, and I always feel good afterwards."}
{"text":"The staff was nice, so that was a plus. However, I ordered the summer salad which was $13.00. When it came out it was tiny! The server asked if I wanted chicken so I said yes and that was $5.50. For 1 small chicken breast! The dressing was kind of bland tasted like oil. Overall I was not impressed. My bill with an Ice team came to about $25.50 for me by myself. I won't be going back! I left hungry and Broke.  :-("}
{"text":"The food is OK, but over-priced for the atmosphere.  The decor --or lack thereof-- is a bit too casual for my taste.  Do I really need to see produce stacked under prep tables?  The service, although attentive, is way too casual for this senior citizen.    I definitely do not care for a restaurant whose staff wears white T-shirts and jeans or khakis, thrusting full-sleeve tattoos in my face as they reach across the table.  I suppose it's a generation thing, but anyone under 50 who goes here should be fore-warned."}
{"text":"Fox Concepts owns a number of restaurants around the Phoenix area and have branched out to adjacent states like California and Colorado. They are known in Phoenix for Zinburger, Sauce, Olive & Ivy, among others.  I'd first like to admit that I've been to True Foods more than I can count. Out of all the Fox Concept restaurants, it is the best of the bunch. Concidering that there are now six locations, it amazingly does not feel commercialized whatsoever. The open kitchen, tall ceilings and cool lighting really adds to the localized feel that I've come to love about the restaurant. The wait staff is incredibly friendly, always bending backwards for their patrons. On a slight downside, expect to wait during peak hours, like Saturday at noon or on a Weekend night. I ended up ordering take-out tonight since the wait was about an hour. I take no points off from having a wait - Means the food is good, right?  Well it turns out the food is good. I'd go as far to say that the food is consistently excellent. The fresh ingredients and natural approach caters towards vegans, organic foodies and anyone else looking for a meal with a straight out of the garden taste.  This past meal, I had the Thai Shrimp Dumplings, the Tuscan Kale salad with Salmon, and the Mediterranean Salad with chicken. Everything was terrific, however the salmon was overcooked. Knowing their staff, it would not have been an issue sending the fish back for another, had I not ordered it as takeout.  While lunch and dinner are excellent, the forté of True Foods is their breakfast. My highest recommendations go to their Quinoa Johnny Cakes and their scramble dishes. I've had most of their breakfast items and let me say, you really can't go wrong with anything. Be sure to try one of their non-alcoholic refreshment drinks, like the Medicine Man. Delicious!  So even with a few miss-hits (overcooked salmon), True Foods is a must try. It is certainly worth the wait if you're there during peak hours, especially if going for brunch!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for lunch in Scottsdale. We eat here every time we are in town. We always start with the yummy hummus. They have a great fresh environment with plenty of outdoor seating. The menu changes seasonally but it is always fresh, local ingredients.  They also have a great variety of fresh juice drinks with optional alcohol, so tasty!!!"}
{"text":"I guess everything was good enough. The service was pretty decent but we got seated right by a busy walk way when there was plenty of open tables away from foot traffic. All the male servers on the shift looked creepily alike, I guess they hire a type. It was kinda funny. Parking is always a pain at the Biltmore but at least I didn't lose my token! They do validate."}
{"text":"I loved it and the concept. The food is fresh, healthy and tasty. Services is fantastic and its a fun, cool place. I think it's got potential to be a national hit if they want to go there. Loved It"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The food was amazing and extremely close to home. My friend and I tried the special promo they had going on during Phoenix Restaurant Week..  Definitely try this place! Its worth it!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great drinks.  Large menu with lots of healthy choices.  Odd they won't reveal their nutritional information though.  This place is too popular for its own good...I tried going on a Friday afternoon, and there was an hour wait.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki bowl with tofu is absolutely delicious!!  I seriously love love love this restaurant. They have something for everyone here and it's all healthy food. I'm a vegan and they have vegan items on the menu...and they'll also customize things for your dietary needs.   The vegetable crudites are awesome as well. I get it with a side of hummus for dipping. It's the perfect appetizer."}
{"text":"Great menu, great service, great atmosphere! I have eaten here before but tonight was my first time actually eating in the restaurant. The summer menu is still in full swing, which is cool since it's still 108° outside.   I ordered the ancient greens bowl with tofu and the server was telling me how it's a new item to their menu and that it is really popular. I can see why, it's awesome! Loaded with superfoods like quinoa, avocado, and shiitake mushrooms, this bowl is complete and packed with flavor. I don't even like mushrooms (it's a texture thing) but these babies were divine!  I also caved and ordered desert (sorry hips!). The lemon tart is nothing short of amazing! Seriously, do they sell this in a fat guy version because it was so good, the large slice they give you, though plentiful and generous isn't enough for the fat boy in me. Lol. It comes with a coconut whip and blueberries. Ugh, so good!   Everything I ate was vegan and therefore responsible (sorry to get preachy on ya!) but I'm so happy to see more vegan options at this joint...can't wait for the fall menu!!!!"}
{"text":"Love sitting at the bar to grab a quick lunch. Food & service is great. Healthy food.  Always fresh and comes out hot (unless it's a salad of course.) Great location"}
{"text":"It's refreshing to find a restaurant concept that features natural produce and healthy fare in truly remarkable flavor combinations. I adore True Food, particularly the local vegetable crudités with tzatziki and olive dip. The heirloom carrots, crunchy radishes, baby bell peppers and other earthly treats are fabulous. I also highly recommend the steelhead salmon or turkey bolognese. The servers are respectful of food allergies or preferences, and they are happy to customize drinks if your palate is being particular."}
{"text":"First, our server Rowen was the absolute best. Very thoughtful, quick and just knows how to make your stay really nice without too much. The food is excellent as always, so fresh. This is our go-to whenever we're in Phoenix, up from Tucson, which is at least every 5 weeks. I'm so fond of it that when I found the True Food in Atlanta, I ate there every day for 5 straight days (I needed healthy food). My faves: tulsi ginger lemon tea, kale-aid with no ice, a breakfast bowl w/perfectly sunny side up eggs(replace ancient grains with kale). ONLY CRITICISM: the music can be a bit too frenetic, too high BPMs for a relaxing meal. That was a bit annoying, as if they wanted you to eat super fast and get out, which I'm sure is not at all intended. So  I knocked off a star for the music because it ruins the relaxing effect of sitting with friends enjoying the palm trees outside and mindfully eating good food"}
{"text":"Talk about making healthy food fun and tasty, this place does just that. It is an upscale casual, and is on the pricey side for casual, but you are paying for your health. The dishes are all sourced from local farmers and you can taste it. Even for someone that is not used to eating healthy, there are things on the menu for them.  I had the burger for example, which is bison meat. It was every but as juicy as a beef burger and had a great kick to it. They have all kinds of foods, including tacos and Thai dumplings, which I had for an appetizer. These were decent, but not the best.  The service was great and the outdoor area is well heated with lamps on those cold nights. Oh, and their kale is the best here, a great place to introduce someone to it!"}
{"text":"Went here for a second time. I do like how you come away feeling less guilty about eating out because their menu seems so health-conscious. I like their off-the-beaten-path drink menu. Honey and cucumber lemonade, who'd have thunk? Extremely refreshing. Looking forward to trying more drinks in the future.  Last time I was there, I had the shrimp dumplings, which were fine, and butternut squash ravioli. Really good but not as filling as I would've liked. This time, I munched on edamame dumplings for an appetizer. They mash them up really well. Not sure if everyone would like the paste-like texture but it was yummy to me. Had just a hint of spiciness and was wading in sesame-oil broth. I had a grilled sustainable salmon fillet on a piece of wheat bread with cilantro aioli and I went for the sweet potato hash. The hash is worth a trip here. It wasn't greasy. I like it loads better than home fried potatoes. May try making it on my own sometime.  Sitting inside is kind of neat because you can observe staff prepping some items on open islands. Staff has seemed perfectly nice so far. A friend said she got looks from some people when she went for how casual she dressed. I didn't get the sense today as one guy came in with a bulky backpack and someone else was in jeans. And nobody should be criticizing as the wait staff themselves are allowed to wear Keds or whatever sneaker wear. Anyway, I'd bring visitors or native friends here. Lunch for two with appetizer and a drink was about $40 before tip."}
{"text":"Although the food and drinks are delicious, they're a bit stingy on the meat and the prices are super high. The drinks, both alcoholic and not, are always on point.  Vibe is great and it's an open, welcome environment. Great place for a casual or more formal dinner. Perfect, centralized location in Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Boooooooring. What a disappointment!  I'm all about healthy, organic food. The meals here did not wow our tastebuds at all. The reason most people shy away from healthier fare.  We asked the waitress a question that she clearly did not know the answer to but attempted to come across as knowledgeable. If I remember what it was, I will repost.  It has been several months, but it was definitely un remarkable. He had a boring pizza with the most boring of crusts. And I had the Goat Cheese ravioli. It was like eating sterile food for someone with health issues. Bland and forgettable. Healthy doesn't have to be boring.   And who cares that Andrew Weil had any hand in this place. Am I the only one who doesn't see why we should not be taking healthy eating advice from this overweight M.D.?  We may try it out one more time to be sure, but I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit apprehensive about this place and I`m not a vegan! But came here two nights ago and was pleasantly surprised!! Ordered the edamame ravioli, delish! And had the lasagne butternut squash casserole, yummy! They do serve wine, tea and other drink fusions. I just might be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on line and went with a couple of friends. The pizza was delicious. Also sampled kale salad, which was equally delicious. Also shared the chocolate cake which was served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a perfect end to a lovely meal."}
{"text":"Kale salad is big and delicious and server even remembered to ask if I was ok with Parmesan and bread crumbs, which I am not, so great service. Also enjoy the ice tea, out door patio, light music, and every dish I have tried is great. The environment is relaxing outside, but a little load inside."}
{"text":"We love True Food.  Street Tacos are awesome, and so is the Miso Blackened Cod.  This is one of our favorite places to go for two reasons:  It's healthy, and it's consistent.  Everything about it is consistent, including the high quality/friendly service.  I've eaten here at least 10 times and never had a bad experience.  Be prepared to wait for a table - it's usually busy (since it's awesome)...  but it's well worth the wait and both the Biltmore and Quarter are nice locations to walk around while you wait for your table!"}
{"text":"Expensive but seriously amazing. The atmosphere and the food all deserve 5 stars. I've also never had a negative experience with the service. So many food options for people with allergies or diet restrictions. I personally love their quinoa salad with shrimp or chicken. It's so fresh and guilt free!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place!  There was nothing on the menu that I wouldn't get along with.  It took me a while to decide because everything sounded fantastic.  I started with one of their fresh squeezed/blended juices (ginger, agave and soda).  It was light, refreshing and REALLY good.  Highly recommend this one.  I finally decided on the tuna sliders which comes with a side of kale salad or roasted sweet potatoes per the menu.  Our server told us that we could get it with 'half and half' sides.  So, of course, I went half kale salad and half sweet potatoes.  The sliders were good but the size of the tuna in each was not real consistent - the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  Another person in our group also ordered the sliders.  For my two, one of my sliders had a really thin piece of tuna and the other one had about a 1/2 thick chunk.  The other order had different size pieces too - strange.  I usually don't order dessert but was really tempted by the 'stellar' Banana Chocolate Caramel Tart as described by our server.  'Stellar' was the perfect description for this masterpiece.  The chocolate crust contained mesquite flour which I found really unusual as I had never had it before.  We visited the Desert Botanical Garden and learned about the mesquite tree/shrub and the guide told us how they make flour from it.  Service was absolutely top notch FANTASTIC!  Our server was super helpful and knew that menu backwards and forwards and knew all the ingredients/spices in everything.   I wish we had this kind of a place in central Illinois!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale is fortunate to have a restaurant that cares so much about getting it right! Another great experience sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"Yet another great Sam Fox concept. Great decor and architecture open space fresh made to order food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Very very good. Sat outside for lunch with some friends on one hot summer day in AZ and started off with their clementine & cucumber margarita. Sound good and was not disappointment. My one friend got their blackberry smash cockatiel, also quite refreshing. For lunch I decided with the turkey lasagna which was perfect. Couldn't have been happier. Wish I had gotten a chance to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"This is why I typically wait until I've been to a restaurant more than once to write a review. Consistency means a lot - I don't care if the service is consistent, but the food should be. Especially if you're trying to sport a \"healthy eco-friendly\" image capable of reaching naysayer-veggie-haters that have only had bad experiences with healthy cuisine. My experience would certainly not have convinced any timid diners that they should try new foods. Which is unfortunate and makes me sad as a healthy food lover.  My first experience in February was absolutely lovely. Went for a friend's birthday and had the private room in the back. I ordered the green tea soba noodles with tofu and extra veggies - simply delicious. Everything I wanted...light, healthy, flavorful and a good glass of wine to boot. Service was spectacular and dessert was delightful.  My second experience really let me down. Fine if the service wasn't outstanding, I can get over my awkward waitress. The wine was fine. The food was not. I ordered the roasted vegetables with farro. Both the veggies and farro were undercooked and barely lukewarm. I don't like mushy vegetables, but al dente would be nicer to my jaw. And PS - those weren't figs. Definitely not figs.  I'd like to go back and try something else on the menu to see if this was just an off night, so for the time being I will deposit this mediocre review in hopes to have my confidence restored next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic find for delicious, healthy food and good service!!   A local friend said that they'd heard good things but hadn't been yet. They asked us to check it out., so we went for a late lunch mid-week and it was still jam packed (30 minute wait) at 1:30 p.m.. We sat at the bar and received terrific service. The fish tacos, steak tacos, bison burger and desserts were all delicious.  It is an open-air style restaurant where you can see into the kitchen. All ingredients are super fresh and the culinary quality is extremely high given that they can make even the healthiest things taste wonderful. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a healthy food alternative."}
{"text":"To begin, this place sets the stage as another one of those nondescript trendy, organic restaurants that charges extra for \"grass fed\" cows and all natural vegetables. I don't know if this is supposed to make me feel better about having eaten pricey and tasteless mush; as if I'll walk away thinking, \"well, at least it was healthy.\" Anyhow, I'll describe the scene that was our experience. To begin, my friend ordered a beer that was promptly delivered to the table and majestically poured into a tall glass--from a can. I've never seen so much drama for a can of beer. Next out comes some shrimp dumplings with a fancy name; $11 for five small pieces that easily fit in the palm of your hand. There were four of us; we each had one with an extra remaining. We literally fought not to eat the last piece. That dumpling stayed on the table until right before we left. My wife salvaged the shrimp by scooping it out and leaving the dough. I suppose doing that may have made it slightly more palatable. Next, I ate the chicken sausage pizza. Perhaps it was all natural, but it tasted worse than digiorno's pizza. My friend had the bison burger. Honestly, the bison burger was good enough not to warrant a complaint. My friend's wife had the mushroom pizza. Again, see previous comment on the pizza. The grand finale was my wife's shirataki noodles. This was the coup de grace that prompted my review. It was atrocious. From the presentation to the texture and taste; it was beyond disappointing. Let me describe how bad it was: my wife is Korean and constantly yearns for Asian cuisine. She will often turn down fine gourmet western cooking for a bowl of instant ramen. Well, in the case of these noodles, not only did she decline to finish them, but she whispered in my ear, \"Honey, next time let's just go to In and Out.\"  To be fair, I have no complaints about the service or staff.  In conclusion, True Food Kitchen serves as an example of why I have really cut back on eating out. We were eager to get home and have a salad and bbq pork.  After tax and tip, the above experience was close to $100. Yes hon, next time, let's just go to In and Out."}
{"text":"We were a group of four. The food was very good we weren't terribly hungry but it hit the spot. One person's food was not hot and it should've been. Edamame dumplings were delicious a grilled chicken salad was also delicious. The staff was excellent and the atmosphere very comfortable we recommend it."}
{"text":"I ate here when I stayed at the Ritz Carlton a couple of weeks ago for business.  I was in vegetarian heaven.  The dishes were so delicious, even my non-vegetarian coworker chose a vegetarian dish and loved it.  My favorites were the cucumber martini and the butternut squash pizza."}
{"text":"My fatty Koala friend loved this place.  Koalas like vegetables and salads with fish.  The ingredients here are very fresh.  This place made me feel like I was in Berkeley.  Gross.  The mushroom pizza was delicious paired with my strawberry salad.  After dinner I felt too healthy so I ate a block of butter for dessert.  Fatties rule!"}
{"text":"This is the most poorly managed location.  We waited for 75 min only to have a group of 3 walk in and be seated immediately before us, without any wait.  The manager had no explanation.  Grimaldi's was happy to take the business.  Keep up the poor service.  I will take my business outside Fox restaurants!"}
{"text":"Let's just say, I've truly enjoyed every visit I've had here.  So far, their kale salad is the bomb.  Just the right amount of lemon juice mixed with parmesan.  Their turkey burger, protein style, is perfect here at the PHX location.  I had one at their Scottsdale location and it was underseasoned to say the least.  Their cod dish is delicious.  When they serve himachi as their \"raw fish of the day\", it was perfect.  I'm also a fan of their sweet potato hash.  The chicken chopped salad is good.  And, last but not least, their mushroom pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"To be so healthy, their food is surprisingly good.  The sashimi tuna salad is my fave!!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in Scottsdale, Iooked around for some new options to try out and True came out as a place that I had to try.  I got to throw out some props to Adrian, who was our server.  She was friendly, attentive, knowledgable about the menu and even where the food was sourced.  One individual in the party has a gluten allergy and got their gluten free pizza and it was phenomenal.  We asked jokingly if they sold the recipe, because anyone who loves gluten free pizza knows, a good recipe is hard to come by.  She stated it was one of the very limited items that they don't make onsite and told us where they get it from.  We were very impressed.  She was supported by a very attentive team that knew exactly who ordered what.  The desert we tried was, a Chia Seed Pudding, was unbelievable.  When we commented on how awesome it was, Adrian knew how many calories it was.  This place was definitely worth the the wait.  That is the one \"negative\", if you want to call it that, if you try to come here during normal dining times, get ready to wait.  When we tried to lunch there on a Saturday at 2pm there was nearly a 75 minute wait."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner and as usual there was a wait. Trying to call in ahead to get on the list doesn't work you need to be present to get on the list. Our wait time was about 1/2 hour and they don't take reservations. The food preparation and service was great! Very tasty and healthy but the portions are small especially for the men who were still hungry after spending close to $100.00 per couple with drinks. I had the miso black cod, very tasty, our friends had the special which was the scallops, they were about  6 the size of a quarter  in the plate but they tasted great. My husband had the kale salad and spaghetti squash also very good  The men were impressed though that the price of a double shot of a decent bourbon was only $10.00. We would go again but would definitely need to order more food."}
{"text":"If you are into extremely healthy food than this place is for you. I had the teriyaki rice bowl with chicken and it left some flavour to be desired. It gave me brown rice, and a bit of flavour in the chicken but over all felt like I needed a bit more. The over all ambiance of the restaurant was gorgeous and the servers were amazing.   I had their juice and juice bar a few times and they were fabulous."}
{"text":"Two things I am not...your typical Sam Fox food disciple and the type of person who would seek out healthy food.  So True food Kitchen,  is not the the type of face I would inhereantly rave about.  However, I am open minded and I do love a great product and service, so True truly nails it.  It is well documented that the food is great, match that with attentive, crisp, knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks.  After a couple of visits it is now definately on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, engaging, pleasant waitress. Great cocktail menu. Try the ginger margarita and the sangria. For dinner i recommend the edamame dumplings, the papaya salad and the panang curry. The fish special was an excellent striped bass. Great value for your dining dollar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  Great concept, very healthy food, vibe is very cool, and service was outstanding.  There are few places where I want to try everything on the menu and this place is one of them.   I can't wait to go back.   PS Open a location in Miami"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love True Food Kitchen?  First time at the location and it did not disappoint.  I tried the ancient grains bowl with chicken which was a hearty and delicious meal.  The desserts and drinks are also a standout.  Everything here is made from scratch.  Unique flavors and delicious."}
{"text":"So good. This place is amazing and healthy. They also had very unique drinks and juices."}
{"text":"After 9 days on the road from Florida to Phoenix, we were in desperate need of some vegetables. Boyfriend had the inside out quinoa burger with half and half kale salad and sweet potato hash which was delicious. I had the turkey burger with half kale salad and sweet potato hash.   The meal was delicious, by far the best kale salad I have ever had. But my sweet potatoes were a tad undercooked. I also ordered the citrus skinny margarita which was awesome, fruity with the right amount of Anejo tequila.  At the end we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the gluten free key lime pie. We absolutely loved the flourless chocolate cake. It came with vanilla ice cream, caramel and cocoa nibs which added a nice bit of crunch and a balance of flavors. but I still missed my graham cracker crust. Overall, it was a really good meal. Service was super friendly & attentive. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"\"I really regret eating healthy today.\" - said no one ever.  This is what a sign says between the bar and the open kitchen at True Food. Wonderful place for those craving healthy AND delicious food. As a gluten-free eater, I appreciate the abundant menu options. Lots of healthy and fresh salads, sandwiches, starters, pizzas and entrees. Expect a long wait during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Lunch for four family members.   Good: --Fresh --Lots of choices --Service  Bad: --Skimpy.  We were hungry an hour later --Price.  $85 for 4 before drinks or tip  Overall we liked the food, but it is a poor value.  Go and feel good about your choice of eclectic, healthy veggies and tofu, just know that it is expensive and you will be eating again very soon."}
{"text":"I crave the Tuscan Kale Salad.  And the service is always excellent.  Always."}
{"text":"I over-hyped myself on this one. Chris and I liked our lunches while the less healthy eaters amongst us were not impressed. Service and decor were fabulous, and I felt good knowing I was eating well but something was missing. It's no Chaco Canyon (Seattle), but it's no Chez Panisse in a mall either. Maybe it just needs to blaze its own trail for a while.  If I lived close by, I'd certainly meet people there for lunch but maybe not worth going out of my way for, and I'm a HUGE Dr. Weil fan."}
{"text":"We are here at least twice a week. The menu is diverse and clean. I recommend it to anyone who is health conscious. The people watching is fun too."}
{"text":"What a rip-off. Just ordered a chicken chopped salad to go - it was $15.14 and is the tiniest salad I have ever seen, for this price & I'm from NYC- it is hardly what I would call a true chopped salad & was bland and boring. Only a few tiny pieces of chicken were \"chopped\". Total waste of my time and money. Get over yourselves - your food is no where near that good that you should be charging NYC prices."}
{"text":"My husband I stopped off for a quick lunch because I heard rave reviews about the kale salad. The Hubby doesn't like Kale (or wouldn't choose it ) so we shared a Mediterranean salad and fish tacos. I know they don't go together , but the food was super fresh and delicious and some worked together. We kept looking over at each other sayin \"this so yummy\" and flawless. The salad had the perfect consistency of crunch and lightness. The Fish in the tacos was moist and flaky and seasons light and just right.  We also had the retail therapy cocktail, it was also delightful, not too sweet and very refreshing and made you want more , but then who would drive us home. I hope to figure out the cocktail recipe to make at home, may need to try a few more first ."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! We love coming here and are obsessed with the fish tacos! The menu is seasonal and there are many delicious items but we have a hard time not getting the fish tacos because they are that good. The my have an awesome menu of interesting drinks that are quite delicious and the deserts are usually pretty tasty as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place (no matter the location) and my stomach is always so happy with my choice to go there.  Everything is healthy, flavorful, and perfectly portioned so that you feel full but not too full.    Get the roasted cauliflower appetizer.  Tasty and fabulous - a hint of tahini and peanut with fresh mint and dill sprinkled on - yum!  I had the poke bowl (minus rice).  I asked for greens to replace the rice but I just got a huge portion of ginger.  Not ideal but the food was great even without and filler.  Interesting combo of mushrooms, avocado, cucumber, tuna, and some radish/beet type veggie.  Interesting but tasty.  My friend ordered the pad Thai and it was delish!  It was spicy, hot, and very flavorful.  For drinks - she got the Bloody Mary (she said good, unique, and not a normal/average one but tasty), and I got the honeydew sparkler which was refreshing, mildly sweet, and a little spicy from the ginger.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Wish they had one of these in Dallas! We love the food so much and dined there at least 3 times while visiting. The shiritaki noodles are amazeballs! Acorn Squash pizza was nice as well! I highly recommend coming to this place and trying everything out even the cocktails and elixirs!"}
{"text":"Great place for healthy food. Dr. Andrew Weil was a part of this restaurant concept, and since I am a yoga teacher, I like to support local, organic food places when i can.  Been here a few times with wife and the family, always good service and great food. Nice place for a date, although the movie place is expensive next door."}
{"text":"I'm certainly not opposed to healthy food options and this place is certainly popular but it was not for me.  This place will be heaven for a vegetarian or vegan, but it you like your food hearty and rich, well choose another option.  I had the spaghetti squash casserole and it was good although a very small portion.  My wife had the street tacos and they were also good as were the grilled veggie plate that our friend had.  So for those into veggies go for it.  The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service. The food was amazing, 3 different dishes, 3 great flavors. Our waitress was amazing, someone had flung their hair at the moment she was bringing our plates into the food, quick to turn around and return the plate and even remove it from our bill. Definitely will return to try other plates."}
{"text":"Great menu that can serve almost any taste type. Roasted veggies, fresh salad and an amazing bison burger. This is my second visit and I am enjoying the healthy selections."}
{"text":"Local healthy food, with dishes based on Dr. Weil's anti inflamamtory diet. I personally have an inflammatory condition, so when I eat here I really feel like I am treating my body properly. I always get the cashew/tofu lettuce wrap appetizer. Its so tasty! (And I'm not vegan). I know others said they felt the food here was bland, I tend to disagree. I felt like the lettuce wraps had just enough flavoring. Any extra would be too much."}
{"text":"This place is great--love the decor both inside & on the patio! Their Inside Out Quinoa Burger is fantastic along with their kale/sweet potato sides & green iced tea. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"True Food does a brilliant job of combining flavor and healthy food.  They change their menu to serve seasonal foods and they really know what they are doing.  The setting is a very pretty restaurant that usually does have a wait, especially in the winter with all of the winter visitors.  This is likely the only downside. Yesterday we were all happy with our selections of kale salad, the inside out quinoa burger (YUM!) and the teriyaki bowl with tofu.  Don't miss out on their drinks.  They serve delightful drinks with ginger, cucumber, and pomegranate .  My new favorite is the honey bee ginger beer. They only serve fresh ingredients and the price reflects that. Service is always prompt. Yesterday Ali was our server and she was enthusiastic and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab lunch. A broad and healthy menu with great service. One of my favorite in the Quarter"}
{"text":"Be sure to read the menu BEFORE sitting down. Not everyone can find food they will like here.   I ended up here with some friends on search for brunch. Not really a breakfast place unless you want lunch items. Food was perhaps too healthy for our tastes - kale with a burger? I asked to see the kid's menu hoping that they may have something more traditional on that, but alas, more items concocted from a health food store. Food was a bit bland and tasted like what I make at home.  This restaurant is great for people who love 'super healthy' food, but not folks looking for healthy/normal food."}
{"text":"This was my first time at True Foods. I got the turkey burger and it came with half side of kale salad and half sweet potatoes (recommended by our server). Didn't really care too much for the burger it was just a little blain for me but the bun was good and so were the sides. I don't even eat kale and it was great. Super fresh and had maybe olive oil and pramasan drizzled on it. Oh I also asked our sever for some hot tea and she offered some lemon, honey, ginger tea. LOVED IT! This was a risk for me because I don't like the taste of ginger but it was masked by the honey lemon goodness. Sorry I'm not sure if the name of the tea. I'll definitely come again and see if I have any better luck with another entrée and most likely pick up some tea even if I'm just in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Moving some of my old reviews over to Yelp. This review was originally written/posted on 1 Jul 2009.  Great Upscale Fast-Casual Restaurant in AZ True Foods is in an upscale mall/area in Phoenix. I came here during lunch on a Friday and they were very busy, so prepare for a wait during lunch time. The place was decorated well and the employees were very nice. I ordered the curried cauliflower soup and the hummus platter. It was very good, especially the soup. The food is definitely good and that explains their prices as well; those two items cost $20 together."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing true food- I had a friend who worked back of house and got to try a few delicious items but never had the dining experience until now! I enjoyed the atmosphere- we sat out on the patio and even in the midst of all this heat it was enjoyable and pleasant! Definitely a busy and popular restaurant- and a good idea to make reservations as the lines were flooding out the door! I love that the Fox Concepts provide an array of food options that are unique and made freshly in house- which makes me enjoy eating at the restaurants. True food is especially popular for their endless vegan options, and is a healthy alternative to many restaurants at the quarter.  Chris was our waiter, and was attentive to our fairly large group! All in all, it was a great experience and look forward to trying more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I ordered a Turkey Burger thinking I couldn't go wrong, BUT I was.  I felt like it needed a lot of SALT and other seasoning.  Honestly, it tasted like cardboard! The unsalted, unseasoned sweet potatoes were just as bad.  It was just OK for an organic entrée.  I guess you just have to either change your mentality, life style or be a vegan to enjoy this place.    This is a FOX concept, so expect a clean modern decor."}
{"text":"This place is cute and seems to be loved by many. I came on a Sunday mid morning but I wasn't very impressed with the brunch menu though. I look forward to coming back for dinner perhaps"}
{"text":"The most deliciously guiltless meal you could ever have.  Came in for the first time with my sister on Saturday for brunch. The place was packed - and righteously so. We had to wait for probably ten minutes as we came in asking simply for the next available table (rather than asking to sit outside... The weather was gorgeous but satiating our hunger mattered more at that point :)).   My sister ordered the red chili shrimp, I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole with grilled chicken. We asked if we could share a Weekend Warrior, and the server told us Sure! without hesitation.   Red Chili Shrimp was spot on. The flavors were great, and we were honestly surprised. Usually when an American restaurant takes on Asian/Asian-inspired menu items, we can tell that it's for an Americanized palate. My only note: the server warned my sister that her dish was spicy. To my Asian brothers and sisters who savor the heat from an authentic Thai dish, or Vietnamese bun bo hue, or a hearty Indian curry.... the meaning of \"spicy\" here and the meaning of \"spicy\" to your palate most likely aren't equal. Yes, you could taste the spice, but you couldn't FEEL the spice (and I'm a gal that typically likes to FEEL the spice). Not knocking the dish, because it was cooked to perfection, but I just wanted to put that out there for those who might be expecting more of a kick.   The Spaghetti Squash Casserole was absolutely satisfying. Everything went together perfectly. The tomato sauce had great flavor and saucy thickness to it as one would expect for a typical pasta dish. The chicken was grilled to perfection. Didn't leave my mouth with any gritty taste of burnt, but a real grilled flavor that more chefs could use to master. The fresh mozzarella was definitely the irresistible icing on the cake. Melted to the right consistency to meld with the rest of the rich flavors of the dish. If I could have spaghetti in squash form more often, I'd definitely go for it. Well done, TFK. Hats off to you!  And holy cow, I've honestly been craving a Weekend Warrior since I finished my cup. Speaking of, they brought it out in two separate cups, which my sister and I certainly appreciated. Before getting the drink I thought they would've just given us two straws to share. Happy they didn't go that route. :) Simply good service.  Anyway, who knew almond butter and flax could go well in a smoothie? If TFK broke off a part of its business to specialize in smoothies, I would happily be a dedicated customer even solely to that. Seriously, Jamba Juice -  can you learn something from TFK?!   Really great service. Attentive enough to make you comfortable and never needing anything, and giving you and your company the privacy you want.   A great casual dining experience I'd recommend to all. Can't wait to return!  P.S. It'd be much appreciated if you introduce this great thing you've got going on with the rest of the states. AZ, CA, and CO can't be the ones who have all the luck!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars to start...they will have to work for he fifth star but they will get it. Sam Fox borders on \"genius\" and True Food is another masterful creation. The look...it's brash, fresh and it erased 5 years off my age. The vibe....well knows how to get the buzz in the community. Bathrooms....well he takes attention to detail about as far as you can take it at this point. By the way, True Food looks like it defies the recession and rightfully so. Positive Vibe. Kudos to you Sam.  Oh yes, the food. Well, it's a \"healthy\" offering, so I thought...could taste like so much of healthy food, bland, boring and I usually have to go to Jack in the Box and order 2 tacos to feel full. This is NOT case. I had the Turkey Burger. It was downright astonishingly flavorful and filling. The turkey was zestful and spicy. I was pleasantly surprised. Add to that, the side salad with Tuscan Kale....like a first kiss. Anyway, will be there for dinner this week and the fifth star is probably earned on that trip. Again, Sam....you had me at \"hello\"."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have been back several times and always enjoy whatever I order.  The gluten free pizzas are really good, drinks are always good and the salads are always fresh and creative.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that all the menu items are healthful and delicious.  Never had a boring or bad meal here.   Have had only lunch items but they've all been great.  The service is fine and the atmosphere is cheery.  Great place to have a business lunch."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!  While visiting in AZ stopped in for a late lunch, shared a stir fry veggie bowl with tofu, it was delicious!!!  The cocktails are even more amazing, had the skinny margarita with slices of fruit (cucumbers & oranges)  so refreshing.  My daughter had the cucumber martini which was even better then my drink.  I could have stayed and just drank cocktails all afternoon.  Uber cool hip healthy food restaurant. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.  Kudo's to AZ for it's great healthy restaurants."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I wish there was one of these in Denver!  I LOVE that this restaurant offers vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.  My first trip here I got the butternut squash ravioli (which I don't see on the menu anymore, boo!) and it was perfect! It was spicy, sweet, savory, and creamy all at the same time.  I also had a super-tasty mock-tail called Cucumber Refresher (sooooooooo DELICIOUS).  On a couple other visits I got a cashew-curry pasta dish with chicken (normally with tofu, but they put chicken in it for me....I also don't see this on the online menu...sad face) that was creamy and it makes me drool just remembering how tasty it was.  I LOVE that the restaurant also strives to buy local and be eco-friendly (the staff even wears American Apparel uniforms because they are made in the USA).  I miss living near this place!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I'm in heaven! Feeling sluggish and dragging our weary, bloated feet (sorry for the visual!), we flopped around a corner at the mall and bumped into this heavenly place.   Anywhere that starts you off with fresh, cold-pressed vegetable juice AND gracefully and yummily accommodates a gluten- and dairy-allergy AND a vegan gets my enthusiastic vote.   We started with kale-aids, honey lemonades and carrot lemonades all round, and moved on to the most heavenly healthy fare this side of Grandma Flo's farm - red chilli shrimp, farmers market salad, gluten free pizza and more.   Only problem: I can't seem to stop eating. That can't be healthy.   Or can it?"}
{"text":"Went here on my Birthday. Well isn't this an odd little place that will make your health food kick diet smile. Positives- the hummus- I love hummus and this is the best I have had so far. Now that is saying a lot because I love the hummus at Pita Jungle and I never thought I would ever dethrone their dish, but alas I have. Be forewarned it is very garlicky!( Probably why I love it so much!)  I had the shrimp dumplings and shaved turkey sandwich with Sweet Potato Hash( bland) . It was good but nothing to write home about. They have funny non alcoholic drinks with cute names that my friends say are great though I did not have one.( NOjito for no alcohol Mojito-funny!) I would say check it out but be forewarned it is a bit BILTMORE STUFFY for an average Joe or Josephine and it is very expensive. The service was outstanding. At one point I had 5 servers waiting on me at once. Some people do not like that, but I sure do!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with True Food as they always have something good on the menu.  Great wait staff and selection.  Definitely for those who want to eat healthy but enough taste for those who are more of the steak and potatoes type.  I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend who was looking for restaurants with healthier menus.  I told him to pick and he picked True Food Kitchen.  We ordered the $9 Grilled Shrimp Spring Roll appetizer to share.  Neither one of us enjoyed it.  My friend picked the shrimp out of the two rolls and left the wrappers and other fillings.  I ate half of one, but the shrimp tasted a little... dirty.  The  $13 Spaghetti Squash Casserole I ordered was quite good, but I was looking for it to have some other dimension to it.  It was simple - spaghetti squash, a little tomato sauce and cheese.  I ate nearly all of it, but I left thinking that I could make it a little better at home with massive amounts of garlic.  My friend ordered the $16 Bison burger with the sweet potato hash and kale salad as sides.  The waiter awesomely allowed him to have half a side of each because he could not decide.  He also said that if he wanted more of one or the other, he would be happy to bring a little extra.  Very cool.  Overall, we had an okay meal here.  I'd say for food, we'd give it a 3.5* rating.  The waiter was so stellar, it raises the place to 4 stars.  The space is very modern and \"clean.\"  Would i eat here again on my own?  Truthfully, probably not.  I prefer some of the other Fox Restaurant Concepts to this one, namely Modern Steak and The Arrogant Butcher.  Still, it is a cool idea for people looking to eat healthier.  P.S. I noticed HORDES of beautiful women dining here, most of them very well dressed and in good shape.  I figured I would add that tidbit because either the food is working or... they have all those ladies tricked.  Still, it might be a good place to hang out if you were a single dude looking for a date."}
{"text":"Wow, I really am disappointed that it took me so long to come here.  To be fair though, I didn't want to try it until I read their breakfast menu, where practically everything looks delectable.  In any event, we have been here for breakfast a couple times and I have enjoyed it immensely both times.  On our first outing I got the blueberry quinoa johnny cakes and the mango/pineapple (or something like that) smoothie.  The johnny cakes were so good and so filling.  It was served with REAL maple syrup and complemented beautifully with a dollop of greek yogurt.  There was way too much for me to eat and it kept me energized and full for hours.  The smoothie was wonderful too, but a little pricey.  The second time I went with the 2 egg breakfast that came with turkey bacon and sweet potato hash.  The eggs were surprisingly greasy compared to all my other stuff.  They still tasted good though.  The turkey bacon was surprisingly good to me, and I don't usually go along with \"substitutes\" like that.  The winner of the plate was definitely the sweet potato hash.  There was some seriously awesome caramelization going on in there and the potatoes were perfectly sweet, only made better with a little bit of salt.  After my two visits have clearly shown me that healthy food does not mean bad tasting, I am much more inclined to try this place for dinner sometime.  I am also intrigued by the philosophies of the co-founder Dr. Andrew Weil and I would like to experience more of it through the culinary delights at True Food Kitchen."}
{"text":"Awesome place for clean and fresh eating! Great sweet potato hash is awesome. I love that you can watch the chefs prep in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in the Scottsdale Quarter Shopping Plaza.  Sam Fox Restaurant doing the health thing.  Healthy eating at it's best. Not large portions but enough food to let you leave satisfied.   All entrees are calorie conscious and perfect for each person.   Ordered the Miso Blackened Cod with Bok Choy and Wild Mushrooms. Ordered the hummus and Margarita Pizza.  The Miso Blackened Cod is without a doubt an awesome entrée and would highly recommend this dish to everyone. Great mixture of miso sauce mushrooms and bok choy,  if you dine here this is the one entrée to order.   The hummus is very good, but the margarita pizza is like a cheese pizza with basil.  The service is great the restaurant is impeccable.   This restaurant will last for a long time and look forward to coming back many more times.  One tip is if you can purchase some Fox Restaurant Gift Cards at Costco try to get them while you can. During Christmas time the gift cards are sold for $79 worth $100"}
{"text":"They have a good kids menu but my nanny went here today for lunch and found hair in both her meal and in my daughter's food. That is enough for me to decide not to go there. They refunded her money but it grosses me out.  I feel very disappointed as this place is cool and right by the splash pad which makes it very convenient. Hair in one plate is accidental but hair in two plates is just unsanitary. Hair me once shame on you, hair me twice shame on me!"}
{"text":"All the stars are for the excellent wait staff. As for food...it's lacking.  I know why kids in America don't eat their veggies. The preparation lacking... if this food was given to me growing up, I too would have looked at vegetarians as poor souls missing on basic pleasures of life. We ordered the lentil soup, TLT,Teriyaki bowl, inside out quinoa burger, edamame dumplings. Couple of the dishes came with side of kale and sweet potato fries. Except for sweet potato fries and dumplings, everything was bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Even during the lunch rush, the food came fast, the service was excellent! Our waitress Cheryl was fabulous and had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place for healthy, fresh food! Lots of Vegetarian/Vegan options as well as gluten free. The menu seems to be slightly inspired by Japanese cuisine as many Japanese ingredients are featured (like yuzu and umami). In fact, I had pan seared sea bass with a umami sauce with shitake mushrooms, purple potatoes, grilled brussel sprouts....it was so good! The umami (a paste made out of a Japanese plum, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is fermented) added a nice layer of flavor...very savory, almost like salt with extra flavor.  We also ordered some appetizers, the raw fish of the day was albacore and was SO FRESH!! WOW, that stuff was good! We also ordered the edamame dumplings, which had mixed reviews at our table........My husband ordered the curry, which he LOVED, though it was a bit too spicy for him, but he said it was so good, he still couldn't stop eating it (they brought him extra rice to absorb the heat, lol)  Desserts were so exciting! Thank you for the dairy-free options! I had apple-crisp with vanilla mapple ice cream, which was completely vegan and very rich (I couldn't finish!)  Our waitress was super friendly and very helpful. A+ service!!!   The restaurant itself is very sleek looking with a kind of a 'green' vibe....check out their herb garden in the back of the restaurant  There were many things that looked good on the menu, I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more!"}
{"text":"I like the way this place is set up.  I like the super open kitchen.  The interior is lovely.  I appreciate concept.  I've been twice and both times I wasn't really thrilled with the value.  Really good hummus though.  And I loved the \"cucumber cooler\" just wish there were refills.   Small portions, high prices, high concept.  Good service although a little on the overzealous side.  Good place to take a vegetarian.  I might be back."}
{"text":"A new fig appetizer, sea bass and stake tacos.... \"Peace maker\"alcohol drink with bourbon the best!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Came here for a late lunch/early dinner. Started out with a kale juice which was super tasty!!!! Then, we did the beet bruschetta as an appetizer. It was so flavorful!!!! The perfect mix of sweetness and crunch with the bruschetta and arugula.  Next, I had the grilled chicken salad. Finally a salad with a hearty portion of chicken!!!! Amazing blend of apples, manchego, and crunch!   My partner had the grass fed burger with the sweet potato hash. The sweet potato was just the right amount of savory and I tried a bite of the burger- my oh my!!!! Highly recommend!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"True Food is full of sensory surprises - and a little full of itself. I genuinely like having such a distinct menu in the neighborhood, but the food, service and entire operation is uneven.   TASTE: pan seared chicken with root vegetables is one of my favorite dishes in the Valley. It not only tastes good, my whole body feels better after I eat it. No zippy sauces, just simply and deliciously prepared. The rest of the fare, like pizzas, teriyaki bowls and signature drinks,  disappoint as often as not.    HEARING: It can be loud as a bar inside - too loud for a concept restaurant focused on conversational food. Our waitress was also one of those softtalkers, so I caught a verb in the specials - and what I believe was a noun just before dessert.   SIGHT - It's an attractive, contemporary space but not well lit, and I couldnt read the printed menu.  We were seated under a Bunyanesque dim sum steamer masquerading as a light source, so I walked under an actual lamp at the bar to read about these entrees they whisper of.  My eyes arent the greatest, but I can drive without hitting brightly clad pedestrians, so for a place to be open over a year and be this opaque seems, well, opaque.   SMELL - There's a perfume of pretense.  Small portions married with high prices, and the whole earnestly ballyhooed dietary schtick whose taste and execution is hit and miss. I will say the servers have been uniformly nice, which goes a long way. They just forget stuff and dont seem to have the cadence and rhythm thing down too well for a Biltmore-priced eatery.      TOUCH - there are some nice touches. The patio is a pleasant place to sit. They wrap up To Go orders really well. The people watching is good (my wife spotted Sandra Bernhard last time).  And you can order things here you probably cant anywhere else. That's notable and fun.   But there's an oddness too. Nothing sinister or belligerent, just amateurish. I'll give you the silliest little example.  You know how top kitchens resemble machines, with staff bustling to make it all work?  Everyone gliding past one another, in a purposeful way?  True Food service seems more an artist colony than machine, compromised by individual quirk and ethic more than guiding principle or practice.     A young lady brought our To Go order to the table. It was in a heavy paper bag and she presented it with a big smile. Perfect.  But when she walked away, back towards the kitchen and bar area, I noticed she was wearing unusually high heels and could barely walk in them. Her job, or part of it, is to walk around - and I'm serious - she can barely balance herself and locomote in these things.  I know that's a goofy little observation but it struck me as emblematic of an establishment too eager to make the wrong impression, and maybe a little confused as to what makes a fine restaurant."}
