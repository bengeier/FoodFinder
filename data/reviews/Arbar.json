{"text":"I happened to stumble upon Arbar on Yelp when I was searching for food options in the area. It seems relatively new, located in a cluster of other restaurants like Hunters Landing at CityPlace. Our group of 7 grabbed a late lunch here on the weekend. Mimosas are $6 until 4pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Most of us ordered either the burger or the eggs benedict. I had the eggs benny with smoked salmon. Portion was decent and it tasted good but not the most memorable. Would still recommend if you're looking for brunch in the area."}
{"text":"So glad Fort York is getting more food/dining options! Its a lovely cozy wine bar tucked away in the back behind macho radio bar. Admittedly I didn't get a very good look at their extensive wine list because as soon as I saw \"$5 Sangria\" I was sold. Their wine cellar isn't dominating but it does look intense sitting in the back. I did notice they had Angels Gate's Riesling which is near the top of my (very bougie) fave wines. Their sangria was delicious, fruity and light (I had the white). We had the Bolognese, the AR burger, and the Zoodles (zucchini noodles) which were all great choices. The Bolognese was a unanimous fave amongst us (they make the pasta in house). The burger was solid but nothing special about it. The Zoodles were a great low carb option and very tasty. The sauce seemed a bit watery but didn't lack flavors. For appetizers we had the yam fries and the focaccia. The yam fries were perfectly deep fried but we all agreed the chipotle aioli was the star of the show, we had to ask for more! I will say that the fries at the bottom started to get a bit soggy :( I think it was because it was served in a ceramic bowl and it kept all the heat in but all the moisture too. A basket would be a better choice for these delicious fries. The focaccia was disappointing unfortunately. Nothing special about it, just three small slices of focaccia bread (wasn't very herb-y like focaccia usually is) and one was kinda burnt sadly.  This was more than compensated for with our wonderful server. He was super helpful, prompt, and funny! He made us laugh and was just an overall great presence. 

Overall though, the food options were all delicious, the atmosphere cozy, and our waiter was great.  we had a great time and we can't wait for the patio to open in the summer."}
{"text":"Wine is all from Ontario. Limited by the glass selection. Food was mediocre. Overall, pretty standard for what you'd find in City Place. Walk a few extra blocks to Le Select for a decent wine."}
{"text":"Been to Arbar a few times. Service has always been friendly and the food great. My personal favourite dish is the sweet potato spinach bowl. The daily drink specials are surprisingly solid value!"}

{"text":"Had the Chicken Bruschetta Burger, and it was absolutely amazing! They made a mistake about the mixed drinks special and honored it. Definitely a great place to check out of you're in the area."}
{"text":"I had been hearing a-lot about how great the Arbar was.   I am pleased to report the experience lived up to the buzz.   The ambiance was comfortable and relaxed on the patio with a talented vocalist and guitarist in the background.  The food was delicious and the service was friendly and on-point. Thanks for a great experience."}
