{"text":"Great spot for a good breakfast. Family owned diner with great service. Chef has much higher skill set than the menu reflects. He sometimes shows this with the non-menu specials. Breakfast Lasagna is a home run!"}
{"text":"The food is different for the area but don't let that stop you from trying it. They have breakfast and lunch special prices as well as a Sunday lunch special. The family who own and run it are warm and friendly, not to mention talented in the kitchen. They have a rather eclectic taste when it comes to decore but it lends to the charm. You never know who will be serving you, and don't be surprised if its their young son or daughter, they are really great folks."}
{"text":"It has been over a year since I have eaten here. It's a kinda out of sight-out of mind location. I was in the area (lunch time) and was hungry and thought of them. I was glad I did. 
The food is fresh and prepared by the owner. The mashed potatoes had (good) lumps and the gravy was thick and homemade as well. Homemade biscuit was a Bojangles rival. 
The hamburger steak I had along with the above was good sized and juicy. 
The menu is quite extensive. Maybe too much to choose from.
On the down side though; the tea was a little too weak. I ended up changing to water. The green beans lacked a little seasoning, though still good.
The wait staff was friendly and very casual.
Overall, I wish they were more centrally located so I could visit more often. 
The owner is a true chef having come from larger venues.
A restaurant that I would recommend to anyone."}
