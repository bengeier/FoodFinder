{"text":"I was quite impressed with the food and packaging. The food is actually very good especially considering the price. I couldn't finish mine, it was a pretty large portion. All the bento boxes cost 7.25 plus tax. They give it to you packed nicely in a large paper bag. I ordered the pork belly bento and I can say I am coming back for sure. It's more of a take out place but there are a few small tables to sit at. It's a delicious cheap eat but they only speak Mandarin. (They'll understand you)"}
{"text":"Delicious bento to go! It has seats for people to dine in as well. Bentos are served in very big portions and cheap ! Deep fried spicy pork hock recommended. 

The front lady is always nice and kind !"}
{"text":"Designed to be a quick bite, grab & go kind of place. It has a selection of Asian style bento with hint of Taiwanese and Japanese influence. The portion was generous for an average person. But for a big eater, their bento might not be filling enough. Their pork cutlet was crispy and flavourful.  But their signature pork feet was a bit underwhelming. We also ordered some snacks on the side such as shrimp cake and fried chicken leg. They were crispy and well seasoned. Overall I find their food are worth its value. And I'd come back again to try other bentos."}
{"text":"Food: Very good.
Value: GREAT! A whole lunch under $10? Done.

I came here with a coworker to try it out. There is a small menu of bento boxes, an ordering counter and a couple of tables. Seating is pretty sparse.

The dishes are huge, I don't think I finished my rice. We ordered the pigs feet and red yeast bentos. Both were excellent, particularly the red yeast.  The red yeast bento is fried, breaded pork with a nice umami flavour to it. Very very good."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I tried their pork hock bento and the chicken leg bento (non-fried) to be honest I was pleasantly surprised. Generous portions with veggies and overall pretty good. Would recommend trying those"}
{"text":"They have awesome bento boxes. Place smells amazing as soon as you enter it. Staff was nice. Their sechuwan  noodles were super delicious. The meat itself was fresh and tender. Great variety of menu items to try from. Do visit."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to warn people....I generally have a strong stomach as I grew up eating outside food, but after I had lunch here yesterday my stomach has been constantly hurting and even now I'm sitting on my couch in pain. I did notice the food was quite oily, but it must be more than that. I really wanted to like this place, but just in case I'd stay clear as the Taiwanese restaurant right next to theirs has MUCH better food and bigger portions. The ladies there were nice enough, although they were kind of slow for a \"takeout\" place and the staff only speaks mainland Chinese."}
{"text":"Run away from Running Pig!

Ok, it's not THAT bad. But:

1. Food is over priced 
2. Not only was there no service, but the girls there are rude. This one girl was yawning at me with her mouth wide open while taking my order. 
3. Portion is small (and when I say portion is small, I do mean it is small) 

I ordered the salty fried pork hock. There was only 8 tiny tiny pieces of hock. I do admit it's quite an unique item, the skin of the hock is all crispy after frying them. My friend ordered a pork bento, nothing special about it. 

Unlikely to return. Even if I am in the plaza again, I will go next door to get Taiwanese popcorn chicken dinner for $7, much tastier and much fuller. 

One last word: unsatisfied."}
{"text":"New restaurant that opened at metro plaza. 

It is next to another Taiwanese take out and between Asian legend.  The renovation of this place is clean, modern and simple.  With 3 small tables, this place is mainly for take out.  They have a simple menu with bento boxes or snacks. 

We tried combo 5 and 6 today.  We were the first ones to walk in, then soon a whole bunch of people followed and came in.  The owners speak cantonese and Mandarin.  

The bento boxes were a cute design, cylinder like a dim sum steamer, but the bottom was made of paper, so it was a little flimsy. 
We ordered at 7:16pm, and sat at one of the tables waiting, we watched as everybody got their food and left out the door, soon it was empty, maybe 7 or 8 guests after us has already left.  So at 7:30 we asked if our orders were ready.  She looked at our receipt, and probably realized that our order got missed, but instead of apologizing, she said to us in English it's not ready.  It's not ready yet.  Then in Cantonese went to the kitchen to put in our order.  I had high hopes for this place, but that answer didn't make sense.  We finally got our order at 7:40. For a take out place, that is unacceptable. 

The box was 3/4 filled with rice, there was one egg, one bean curd, 2 pieces of vegetables, one daikon radish, 2 pieces of meat and some pickled vegetables. The taste wasn't spectacular, just seemed a little skimpy on toppings. 

Unfortunately I don't think I will come again with that service (maybe because I didn't speak mandarin), and quality of food.  Will go next door and get myself some good popcorn chicken and choice of 3 sides."}
{"text":"Order their specialty.  Pig trotters/hock/knuckle.


I ordered trotters and it was very tender and tasty.  Side dishes that come with it are good too.  Not as much variety in side dish as other shops but the quality is good!

The rice was good as well--just right.

One thing to watch out for:
When ordering TAKEOUT the boxes and lids don't line up.  They will put an elastic but you gotta be careful or the sauce will definitely spill."}
{"text":"Out of all the various lunch box choices at/bear Metro Square, this place has become my number one choice. I had the #4 pork chop bento and was mind blown. I have pretty high standards for Taiwanese food and this bento box hit all the right buttons. The only downside is that they don't have comfortable seating or even lots of seating rather, and I only got one stick of vegetable. Nonetheless after eating mine I bought 5 more to bring home for family and friends! Good Taiwanese food isn't easy to come by!"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents, we all had combo A. The service was actually quite good, but I attribute this to the fact that the restaurant was empty besides us, and that we also speak Chinese and thus were able to communicate with them our preferences. When I when I told the owner that I loved the yellow radish, they gave me five pieces instead of just a single piece. 
The food itself is quite good. The pork feet in combo one is tender. Each Bento box comes with two pork feet. However, the restaurant doesn't serve any hot drinks or even free water because they don't have cups!
All in all 3/5. I would definitely come here again for combo one."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see such low rating for this place! I've came here probably 5 or 6 times already and the food was great each time. The price is reasonable. Other lunch boxes like these often only give you half an egg. but with running pig you get a woke egg! One time they got my order wrong but not only did they correct it, we also got extra pork for free.  Yes there's no table service like a typical restaurant but keep in mind you don't have to tip here even if you eat in. The staff is always really friendly and I'm sure if you speak to them in English they would reply you in English. They might just be more comfortable using Chinese. The only thing I don't like is they only accept cash."}
{"text":"This place is meant to be a quick takeout spot, but they do offer seating for people who choose to eat there.  Having said that, that does NOT equate to actually getting table service like you would at a proper restaurant.  This place is still meant to be a takeout and go place.  

Now that that's out of the way, I must say : eating there has its perks.  The food was quite decent, and even though my friends and I decided to sit in to eat, the people working there weren't trying to shoo us away quickly, and even moved the tables around so all 4 of us could sit together.  She then offered to tell us that, if we were still hungry, the rice and sides were available for free refills.  I mean, sure, the rice and sides isn't what we're after, we're after the meat, but it was nice that that was an option.  I did leave feeling slightly hungry, but I was satisfied with what I had. Refills for the rice/sides probably would have been welcome, but I was not ready to only eat rice and sides without another serving of the famed hock/knuckle.

I was playing it safe, so I ordered box number 4.  I was relatively satisfied.  The food was a bit salty, and I did feel a bit thirsty afterwards, so this is one thing that did affect my enjoyment.  There was also another issue, which was the availability.  My friends all ended up with the chicken leg because whatever they had wanted wasn't available (two of them wanted box 3 if I recall correctly).  I should definitely go back for the hock/knuckle next time.  It's just that those are relatively messy foods to be eating away from the comfort of home, where you kind of have to get your face a little dirty while eating.  There doesn't appear to be a washroom on site, so I didn't want to risk it.  Having said that, these would make for a great takeout option.

Now, here's where things is a bit of a kicker.  It's not an issue for me, but I can see how some people would have a problem with this.  The people working there spoke with me exclusively in Mandarin.  I'm not proficient at it, but I can get by, and I understood what they said, and in spite of my more Cantonese tones in my Mandarin skills, they seemed to understand me alright.  So, this can be a problem to some people who don't speak the language, and I can understand only too well why.  However, my rating was based mainly on food, and I did leave a little hungry, and a little extra thirsty from the food.  I have a feeling there was a bit of MSG involved (let's face it, what food made outside of home is not loaded with MSG?), and considering all factors, the slightly mediocre rating.  

Will I be back?  Simple answer, yes.  I don't usually swing by that area after work on those few nights where I don't feel in the mood to cook.  I did mention the place does offer seating, but I think you are better off enjoying the food from the comfort of home.  If you haven't been before, I say it's worth going, just remember to brush up on your Mandarin first."}
{"text":"I dislike the service. They expect you to speak different language just because they don't understand simple English. I am Asian and I can speak mandarin but it's flat out rude to cut off a customer when they he or she tries to speak. The pork chop was very bad. It tasted like sour and It was not fresh. The meat probably expired long time ago. If you are craving for some Taiwanese food please stay away this place."}
{"text":"Running Pig is worth visiting if you want to pick up some Taiwanese style bento box. The menu is simple as you just choose your protein. Pig trotters and knuckles are their specialties! Those are braised for hours with their special recipe.

#4 Braised Pork Chop Bento was disappointing. The pork chop was battered and fried before putting in the braising sauce. The sauce is tasty but the batter was gooey and soggy since it was in the sauce for so long. I would not recommend that and would not order that next time.

The sides are good. I would have ate the bento with just the sides instead.

#3 Pork Hock Bento = Pork Belly. I think I would give that a try next time.

Service is fast and friendly. 

Cash Only!"}
