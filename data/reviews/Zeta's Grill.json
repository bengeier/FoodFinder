{"text":"Awesome. Seriously, from the atmosphere to the service to the food... My husband and I were blown away. We were looking for something different and we found it here. 
I had the vegetable platter from the appetizer menu (my staple first order when I try a new Mediterranean place) and he had the gyro plate. Fresh pita was warm and soft, out of this world best falafel I've ever tasted. My husband raved about the lamb. He literally said \"now I know why you say you could eat Mediterranean food every day.\" Everything was delicious. Our server was friendly and everyone there made an effort to make us feel welcome. The prices are extremely reasonable and they offer an array of wines, beers, and shots as well. Will definitely come back!!!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We had a very positive experience at the grill.
Service was personable and attentive. Good variety of Middle Eastern Food. The lamb I had was probably the best I've ever had. Yummy.
Fresh, crisp salads, delicious breads. I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! Can't believe we now have a great restaurant like this. My husband and I love Lebanese food and we were not disappointed. 
Food,  excellent. 
Service /brand new server ; eager to please. 
Atmosphere, excellent as well. 
Going to be regulars here."}
{"text":"Just found Zeta's tonight for the first time.  If you enjoy Mediterranian food, this place is the best we have found in the valley in the 9 years we have lived here.  The Kibbee Nayeh was very good but the Lamb Shish Kabob was tasty, moist and tender, and the best I have had since leaving Michigan (where great Middle Eastern food is in abundance).  Additionally, both the Fattoush and Tabouli salads were excellent.  Everything was excellent and very traditional.

Nicholas was our server and he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and that everything was perfect for our experience.  Prices are reasonable as well, especially consider the price on lamb nowadays.  

If you are in the area this restaurant should be on your must-stop list.  If you live a little further out, it's well worth the drive.  We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"We loved it here.  Very nice environment,  and we really enjoyed the food.  Fed our 2.5yo from our plates and an appetizer (and desert for us) and we all got full.  Enjoyed some kabobs,  rice,  potatoes, and such.  We saw a few things we want to try next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go it has a authentic taste hot fresh food and the service is fantastic they truly treat you like family here I highly recommend coming to Zeta Grill."}
{"text":"As someone who knows the Middle East and especially Lebanon, I find the meals in this establishment to be as near as I can possible think to Beirut cooking and dining. The ingredients are fresh, healthy and plentiful. The bread baked there, and the dishes have the perfect delicate flavors you can only expect to get in the country. I go there to eat often since I sit and take myself back to Beirut and to the beautiful country. Please try the place, I personally recommend it, which is something that I would never do otherwise. The family run place, and the wonderful atmosphere always finds its way to your appetite through the wonderful intro to Zaatar as a taste introduction to the flavors. Dipping pita bread in the olive oil infused with Zaatar spices is indeed a heavenly experience. I know I am going overboard, but please do go try for your self and see what I mean. This is again form someone who lived and tried all of the meals served there. Again, with a family running the place, and a Lebanese Chef in the Kitchen who comes with Beirut experience, you can't go wrong. Eating there is like sitting on the Kornish in Beirut. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place was a great yelp find. Nicholas our waiter was very attentive suggested the Lebanese wine great suggestion. Service is amazing. We had the gyro plate and the mixed grill both were full of flavor the grilled vegetables were perfect. We wanted to try a little something for desert Nicholas brought us a sample of their favorites yummy. Great date night."}
{"text":"WOW, I decided to have dinner at Zeta's, Kristin, my waitress,  made the evening a joy. The food was prepared perfectly and the presentation was spot on. The food tasted as good as it looked. I will be back often."}
{"text":"The food here was outstanding. We got the salmon and shrimp and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was my first order and I must tell you, I am very impressed. 

Nicholas answered all my questions, my food was delivered free of charge, and all I can say is this meal is very, very, good!!! Yes, I'll be calling again and again! 
Delivery was quick and food was hot! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Had another great meal at Zeta's Grill. We had the kibbeh shell which is minced meat and spices in a round shell. They were very, very good. Again we had the Gyro platter which is always very good. The meat was tender and there was so much we had some for lunch the next day. I also have to add that their vegetables are just wonderful. We got them instead of the saffron rice (although we love their saffron rice). There were a lot of mixed veggies and even an olive or two in there. Just great. We also had the Kofta kebob which is pretty much our new favorite meat. The spices are just wonderful. I love the cinnamon and enjoy it with the lamb. The kebob was very tender and the grilled taste just adds to the flavor. We were too full to have any dessert this time. But again, totally worth it and will go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this new place and were quite impressed. The Food was excellent and also the service. I had a chicken shawarma sandwich and my wife had the chicken kabob's with the spicy potatoes and both were outstanding. For desert I had the rum cake which was out of this world. It was a nice change of pace from the usual restaurant's in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped into Zetas Grill for a bite after a Bikram hot yoga class. Just a little bite, we had Greek fries with gyro meat. All was tasty,and the best part was the impressive young man who offered us a sample of 'white coffee' afterwards. Very nice!"}
{"text":"First time trying after yoga and have to say the gyro and the falafel were excellent and staff was very friendly! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have visited Zetas twice now and I love the place, the food is fresh, exciting and tasty. The servers are wonderful, friendly and helpful. The manager makes her presence felt and very pleasant.
Goodyear/Avondale needed a fresh, non fastfood chain eatery and this is greatly welcomed.
I will recommend Zetas to everyone and will be a regular guest.
I wish the owners good luck with their new business."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant.  Lebanese food is similar to Greek food.  Some of the items on the menu are Greek.  Their Gyros is the best I've even eaten in the US!!!  The meat is always tender and NEVER over cooked.  They give you enough food to eat for two days.  We have frequented this restaurant for the Gyros plate with Saffron Rice and a Salad.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great new family restaurant. Salad was great that came with the entree. Lamb and chicken were perfect. Good service. Baklava selection was large. Looking forward to bringing my friends to try it out."}
{"text":"First impression about the food. I got the Greek salad with chicken kabob. $16.81 for maybe 4 oz of chicken, some romaine lettuce, tomatoes, olives and some mediocre dressing. This was definitely not worth the price. This place needs to think about VALUE for it's customers."}
{"text":"Moved less than a mile away from zetas grill and need a new gyro place.  I went with my family and I ordered the gyro plate.  I have to say it worst probably the worst gyro plate I've had.   Zetas, let me spell out the issues simply.  You cut the gyro meat like an inch thick like a steak and did not shave the meat.  That takes 2 stars off.  Gross.  Second the gyro meat way dry.  Third there was not much flavor to the meat and the cucumber sauce was kind of runny.  I would highly recommend you go to Chicago gyros on 7th ave and union hills so you can see how to do it right."}
{"text":"We choose this restaurant based on reviews online and were not disappointed. Service was top notch. We met the owner and he asked if everything was well, we said Excellent. Staff was fast, efficient and very knowledgeable. Food was very authentic and tasted great. Our family of 10 was very happy!! When in area again we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood spots. Love the appetizer sampler! Like sitting on the patio with a glass of wine at sunset. Food and service has always been delish for us!"}
{"text":"Finally. Some good middle eastern food! And it's nice and local! I'm from Illinois and it wasn't hard to find some authentic middle eastern food back home, but finding one in AZ was hard. Finding any authentic food in this state is hard period. Lucky Yelp sent us here and we've been hooked on it ever since! Our guy Nick is super nice and always takes care of us. Everything taste super fresh and delish. Try it out asap!!! We've become regulars, so will you!"}
{"text":"They greated me at the door with a huge smile. They were very nice. I ordered food to go and they still offered me some water. Food did not take long at all to get but still tasted great. One of the best resturants in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Surprising! Great service, ambiance, menu and extensive bar choices. The baba, hummus and tabbouleh were spot on and complex. Chicken kabob was smokey and perfectly done. We will definitely be back! BTW the price was fab at $30 for two for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them just now and am super excited. I dined in a few weeks ago and the food and service were both great!  So nice to find good Mediterranean food in the west valley!  Huge bonus that they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma pita and grape leaves. The grape leaves were delicious, I would go there just for those. However, I wasn't impressed with my pita, there were French fries in it which threw me off. I re read the description of what came in it and it doesn't mention anything about fries. The pita was ok, next time I'll be ordering something else."}
{"text":"This place was great. The staff were very friendly and the food was delivered in a timely manner. I highly recommend going to this establishment as the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent service, I honestly have never tried this place before and I drive by it everyday on the way home from work, just changing up my diet for the week I guess I decided to go to Zeta's ( which by the way is a pretty cool name) and it was quick and easy to eat, definitely a upcoming favorite quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"This place is really good! Me and boyfriend enjoyed the service, the food, and they definitely treat you like family. They offered to let us try something on the menu since we weren't comfortable and we ended up loving the appetizer, entrees and desert! Give this place a try, I promise you'll start coming here often!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This family owned business is charming. They pay attention to all of the little details. The food is as beautiful as it is delicious. And on top of all that, it's healthy too! The menu is full of variety and includes vegetarian and vegan options as well as the standard Mediterranean fare. The food was traditional but with some small but truly inspired finishing touches that made Zeta's, the best babaganoush I have ever tasted. Courtesy, quality, kindness and outstanding service have found a home at Zeta's. I loved the food so much,  that I ordered extra to take home with me. And on the way out, saw the sign that offered ...wait for it...DELIVERY! They will even deliver outside of their standard area if it's not too busy. There is an additional charge for the further distance but it was reasonable. And, at least for me, worth every penny. So go visit Zeta's for a wonderful dining experience with a lovely atmosphere that is a cut above most neighboring establishments. Go! Eat! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing addition to the west valley. The food and service were excellent!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled for this place to open near me.  We have been there twice.  The menu is great, and the atmosphere is nice.  The waitstaff and the owner are very attentive.  Kids liked the pizza, my Greek salad was good and lamb kebabs good too.  I'm giving them 4 stars because they're new and have potential.

Problems-- these may well be growing pains.  First visit--the salad for my Mom's dish didn't come until we reminded them about it.  I asked for my dressing on the side but it came on it--the waiter said if I didn't like it he could take it back.  I'm sure he doesn't know that people get it on the side to control how much dressing they use--not just because they're unsure if they will like it or not.  I said OK. 

2nd visit, I asked what came on the kid's burgers--\"nothing, they are plain\"  OK that's perfect.  But when they came out with generous dollops of mayonnaise, my kids wouldn't eat them.  We send them back.  They came back with new buns and most of the mayonnaise scraped off--now cold.  Sent back again.  If I hadn't asked to make sure they would be plain I might've taken the hit, but not when it's clearly not my fault.  Now adults are done with our food and kids don't have theirs yet.  No discount on the bill.  

I want this place to succeed, but they've got to know that kids' meals have to be as described--and the simpler the better.  Also, strange spice in my husband's rice--probably authentic, but he wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner and ordered the four people grilled combo and oh my gosh it said more than four people everything was fresh to order the rice was well seasoned potatoes were perfect and the kebabs were delicious we got beef lamb and chicken and they were all juicy and tender the salad was very fresh and crisp very impressed I will definitely be back to try some more goodies"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Lebanese food, and this is as good as it gets. 

Everything is home cooked in their brick oven. The hot pita bread almost has a sourdough flavor, but is thin yet soft on the inside with just a bit of a crunch on the outside. It is served with a dipping sauce that makes it as addicting as OxyContin. We had hummus for appetizer, and it was perfectly seasoned with excellent consistency. My husband had a pita, and the meat and bread and sauce were so good. I will probably steal his leftovers. I had their special, which was a cubed New York Strip, cooked rare in a mushroom cream sauce served with saffron rice. It is truly an art to cook steak correctly, and this place has mastered it. The sauce was perfect, with fresh mushrooms. The rice was moist and scented... took me back to my childhood. We filled up so we ordered homemade baklava to go. It was amazing. Our waitress, Savannah, had impeccable manners and excelled at her job. Ask for her, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, and excellent service. The restaurant is nice too. I usually go here for lunch and get the gyro pita but I've had other dishes too and it's always good."}
{"text":"Zeta's is my go-to spot for lunch in between classes. The dining room is cool and comfortable, the staff is always super-friendly, and the food--especially the Zeta's chicken--is delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to give Zeta's a try for
Something different. We weren't disappointed!! Our waiter was great at explaining everything on the menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Recently visited for dinner. Nice ambiance and helpful wait staff. A recent article in the newspaper indicated gyros was on the menu. Had to get there to get some. Ordered two gyros platters, one for each of us. Salad was crispy and fresh. The pita (made in house) was excellent, however, the gyros, not so much so. The gyros meat was NOT cooked on a spit (vertical broiler) allowing it to brown and  then be sliced thin as gyros is typically served in Greek/Mediterranean restaurants back east. The meat provided was deli style gyros that was sliced like lunch meat and cooked on a grill with a different consistency and taste than real gyros. When I questioned our server, she indicated they had previously cooked it on a spit, however customers complained it was too thick and dry so they went to the lunch meat type gyros. I suggested to her that if the spit version had been rotated properly with the correct temperature, and the staff taught how to slice it, that there may have been a better outcome. I'm hoping that they will retry the spit cooked gyros and master it so I can savor this delectable treat at Zeta's. The other local choices for gyros,are few."}
{"text":"I wish, I could write a review about some of the entrees on their menu, which looked really yummy.  Alas, I can't:  dinner consisted of appetizers and a salad (with way too much pita bread ... my bad) and that was more than enough for me.  It also helped that it was a beautiful afternoon turning into evening when we got there, so a light meal of spicy hummus, fatoush salad, tzaziki, and babaganoush was just right.

My first compliment might seem to be a strange one, but I really enjoyed the music.  This might seem something odd to rave about in a restaurant review -- especially when we're not talking about live entertainment -- but when you consider that there are way too many restaurants that either blast their music or try and drown out customer groans with loud TVs, it's nice to be able to sit in a spaciously airy, subtly decorated restaurant with light jazz playing in the background, which compliments the atmosphere; not dominates it.  So subtle is the music, in fact, that the person with me didn't even know there was music playing when we talked about it afterwards.

For the food and its portions, the prices are reasonable and service was more than friendly.  To be fair, it was a slow, holiday night and that might have accounted for the constant and attentive service we received (in comparison to other reviews, which have stated that the place was so busy, service was lacking).

As much as I'm sure that I'm a fan, I'm not sure this restaurant is in the right place.  It's across from Estrella Community College, which should be a good thing, since students tend to be more open-minded and willing to try other cultures and cuisines.  But that only means this restaurant should be in Tempe, near ASU, not Estrella.  Most of the students at the community college simply couldn't afford to eat here, though, like I said, prices are far from unreasonable.  Also, Goodyear/Avondale does not (yet) have the \"yuppie\" base which would patronize a restaurant like this.  It was starting to get that way before the Great Depression of 2008 struck, but then all those plans for a mall and upscale restaurants pretty much came to a grinding halt.  Things are very slowly starting to turn around, so maybe we'll get that base soon enough.  For now, we can only hope, that enough people dare to walk away from Taco Bell and the Olive Garden to try something \"new\".  

The West Valley is a real culinary desert when it comes to food other than tacos, hamburgers and pizza.  Do your part to keep places like this alive:  your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"This is by far the one of the best restaurants i've eaten at in a very long time. Every dish is freshly made with care and is consistently delicious. We dine there frequently and each time we go, we are pleasantly surprised that our meal is just as great as the time before.  We both have dietary \"issues\" and they are pleased to accommodate them every time. Nico, the head waiter is delightful, totally dialed and always remembers our preferences. It's like going to grandmothers house for dinner, except they are way better cooks. Give it a try...you will walk away completely satisfied."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Food was excellent, services was excellent, waitress was very through at explaining dishes. I am a vegan, so I ask about soup base used. The lentil soup is delicious, spinach pies are very good. We also ordered the appetizer sampler, hummas was very tasty, my friend got the mookaasaa, she said was good. Also the pita bread is great, made at restaurant and given as much as you want. The owner, I think, came out to see if the food was to our liking. Weather permitted us to eat on the patio, very nice. I will be back and will advise family and friends to go. PS baklava was also very good. Prices also good, I feel I got a very good meal at a very decent price."}
{"text":"First time here great atmosphere prompt seating waiter Zack provided great service. Had lamb kabob plate. Very tender lamb and the fat posh salad with chicken shawarma was excellent. Price wise was very reasonable. Would definitely eat here again and would recommend it to anyone. Yasou!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good/unique flavors (without over dependence on salt), this is the place.

The saffron rice, lamb and kafta kabobs alone are enough for me to give this 5 stars (the chicken that came with both in the mixed grill is also great).

For appetizers the falafel and baba ghanouj are excellent and the sanbousek meat was very good.

Reasonably priced and great service."}
{"text":"Was trying this place on a whim and boy was I surprised fantastic food and service. The Gyro plate was the best I have had in the US."}
{"text":"Phenomenal staff. Phenomenal food. I really enjoy their bread (any of their bread). Always am greeted with a smile by staff that is ready to serve! I had checked out a few Greek places for their Gyros and Zetas is by far my favorite. I have 4 stars because I wish they had more locations!!! Other than that, amazing Greek and Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, everyone is real nice and greets you with a smile. The place was has a lovely design that makes it feel so relaxing. The large windows let you look out and see the sky. It's so authentic from the food to the music. Rich food with lots of different flavors.
My server Mariah was amazing. She was able to answer many questions and make suggestions. She wasn't clingy yet still attentive."}
{"text":"Upscale Lebanese, moderate price.  Split a vegetarian combo, spinach pies and Kibbee
First spinach pie i found in Arizona, made the Lebanese way, 3 in a serving, Kibbee comes raw or cooked,
 My husband is Lebanese, we've eaten Lebanese food many places including his mother's house, and Zeta's Cafe has a genuine chef in the kitchen, 
Fresh ingredients, nicely presented, excellent service.  
This time we ate on the patio, its shady and comfortable, dog friendly
Oh, and authentic baklava, delicious
So much more I want to try"}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was starving and it definitely hit the spot. I can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"This place is that good especially the shrimp and salmon kabob a real disappointment and a waste of money considering the portion size with 3 small shrimp and 3 pieces of salmon  the chicken was cool but the salad was worse and couldn't tell I was eating a Mediterranean salad what so ever. A waste of money never again this is the first time I had kabobs without veggies and missing skewers."}
{"text":"It has been almost exactly one year since I have not returned to Zeta Grill.   

I looked at this private comment from \"John S. of Detroit, MI\" based on my last review, and I just HAD to include it.

\"Now I know why you have a shopping bag on your head :) Dont make stupid statement by inviting our cooks to learn how to cook at Pita Kitchen. If you prefer Pita Kitchen then by all mean enjoy their beef . Also dont compare apple to orange and this also tells me how naiive your opinion in the food industry. Go and read the reviews on Zeta's Grill.\"

John S.: Your spelling, punctuation, and basic grammar errors really made me smile.  You wrote your comment at 11:23PM. Were you up late drinking?

John S., you admit to being _employed_ by Zeta Grill and you conveniently left yourself a 5-star rating!  Now we know why Zeta Grill \"appears\" to have fans! How utterly self-serving and dishonest.

The recent review by Daisy Y. on 5/29/2018 is spot on: \"However, I have to say the food was lackluster\"

The service and ambiance at Zeta Grill are nice, but the food is utterly average and forgettable.  Reviews brought me in, but the food pushed me away.

6/18/2018 - Private message from Madhi, the Owner of Zeta's Grill:

\"Can you just stop your low steam attitude and stop criticizing Zeta's grill . We know well your opinion and like we said there are many Mediterranean customers out there . Trust us we don't need customers like you in our restaurant . Why don't you open a culinary school and teach your nasty attitude in food to the public . You seem to be a sycho .  I bet you don't know how to cook couple eggs and you keep rising with fake stories :) we always respect our customers opinion about the food because we know they care, but your reviews mean nothing to us and go play somewhere else with your nasty attitude\"

Based on the grammar and spelling errors, I am guessing Mahdi is \"John S. Detroit, MI\".

Mahdi, I don't hate you or your restaurant. I just want to eat authentic Mediterranean food with _flavor_.  I didn't find that at Zeta's.  I gave your restaurant THREE tries, and was disappointed each time."}
{"text":"Took the family out to lunch here after reading other reviews. Very nice, fresh food, completely enjoyed it! Definitely recommend and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Being of Greek descent I am picky when it comes to Mediterranean food not cooked by my mother.  I'm happy to say Zeta's is a restaurant I will be coming back to!  The food is authentic and extremely tasty, not to mention the portions are very generous.  The staff was very friendly which made for a great experience.  I'm sure we will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"They greeted us at the door with smiles.
Opened and welcomed us inside.?we started with
Warm Pita bread and dipping sauce.
Tabouleh salad which I have never had before but defiantly would eat this again.
Chicken and rice soup seated nicely with lemon and herbs. Lots of chicken in the soup.
Mixed grill platter was delicious and saffron rice side dish. I'm a rice fan and thought it seasoned well but a bit dry.
Sambousek lamb was a first for me: it is fried and therefore not my go to plate. If I didn't have to watch what I eat- I would eat it again.
Indeed helpful  and friendly staff took the time to help me navigate the menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful, friendly service and great food.   We had the chicken shawarma and the beef shawarma.    Both were delicious.   The fresh pita was also delicious.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"3 1/2. Ordered the lamb shank and it's good and really solid. Also ordered a yogurt drink not on the menu and the cook made something pretty authentic, so that was cool. Have to come back to try some other things off the menu."}
{"text":"No it's not even close to Lebanese food it's impressing it's no words to explain the bad experience it's the worst ever"}
{"text":"Met family here for lunch. Their lunch items are very affordable. The hummus is to die for and the presentation was a nice touch. The actual lunch items weren't the best Middle Eastern food we've had, but it surely wasn't the worst either. I say it was a solid B on the grade scale. The gyros could use more sauce in them since the meats were on the dry side. The server was attentive and delightful."}
{"text":"Service was good, the place was clean with a nice atmosphere but the food was disappointing.  I got the chicken shwarma and it was pretty bland.  Wife wasn't impressed with her meal either (they didn't have the first item she ordered available)."}
{"text":"Food- The food was a slam dunk (nba finals in progress).  Gyro meat, humus, fresh pita bread, Greek salad -- on a hot summer night that just can't be more perfect.

Service- we had quick service and beer and water stayed full.  Waiter was great about bringing any sauces we wanted as well and even made recommendations.

Location- Plenty of parking, outside the city, but worth the drive. Restaurant had very romantic indoor and outdoor seating.

Price- typical pricing, but considering how nice the restaurant was I thought our bill would be higher."}
{"text":"Today, was my second visit. I loved my veggie sampler. My family members had a little bit of everything on the menu and it was all delish! 
No wait to get it, healthy options as well as great desert."}
{"text":"I really like this place, u can't get any better Mediterranean- Lebanese food in this area. They start u with fresh delicious bread with Zaatar and olive oil dip, I ordered the hummus and lamb, it was ok. I had the lentil soup, it was delicious. My wife ordered the shish Tawook with the side of potatoes. The potatoes r super good. In general this place is a great place to visit and try, it definitely provides u with food that u can't get in the west side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The West Valley has been needing some culture and it has been too long until now, Zeta's grill is a gem and I am already a regular after my visit earlier last month.

Often people ask me why I Yelp and share my experiences with the community?  Yes I love to devour food and I will travel across town and country to find places.  Places like this not only bring a new taste of food but they also can expose you to different cultures and unique flavors that you wouldn't get in your average shop or fast food joint, not too mention it's kind of in my back yard!  

When you consider Mediterranean food, look at the map and you will quickly see it is vast. There are regions throughout the Mediterranean that bring different flavors. This being said whether you go to Persian, Lebanese, Armenian restaurants most tend to share similar plates and although similar, each region has some different approaches to some of the oldest meals of time. Vegetarians this is the spot for you, all of the veggies are fresh and their hummus and falafel are too yummy. Meat lovers where you at? Do you like Croquets? Start by trying Kibbeh with beef, a great tasting appetizer that can fill you quickly but the savory taste and bite keep luring you for more.  You like marinated meats? Try their Kebabs which in my opinion have probably the best seasonings you can put on meat, the Kefta kebab is my bag. Finally top it off with some basmati rice (I like saffron) and before you know it you will be eating some amazing foods that you probably wouldn't experience unless you traveled to those regions of the world. Plus you get to take plenty home because it is a feast.

I keep coming back and order all different plates and frankly I have not been disappointed.  I like to read some of the reviewers comments to understand some concerns and there are not too many, perhaps the only one is pricing. You can always go to the Persian Room in Scottsdale and the costs are actually much higher and I will say for my neighborhood joint I am not too certain I am up for a 50 minute drive when the food here is very good. Mediterranean food is not cheap people, it requires plenty of love and prep time. We just had a meal for 3 along with some acohol and our bill was 61 bucks.. That is not too shabby if you saw the plates we had at the table. Please know when you pay for this food not only are you getting what you pay for, you are enjoying food from the hands of the owners that make this place special.

I encourage everyone to try new foods and visit Zeta's.  Be sure to ask for Nicholas one of the servers.. He's okay ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. We usually come during off hours so I'm not sure if it gets very busy- everything seems very fresh, the service is prompt. I've tried most other places in the area and although this place is far this is the place we end up craving and going to. Now that im writing this... I'm thinking we might go there for dinner tonight! haha"}
{"text":"I always have good food when I come in here. A great place to come with my family for birthdays, anniversaries, and such. I love Mediterranean, and always had Greek but the Lebanese versions of all the traditional food is incredible."}
{"text":"Kind and attentive staff. Relaxing atmosphere. Ordered veggie lasagna, saffron rice, giro, and Lebanese sausage... awesomeness!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:

We returned, today for lunch, at Mahdi(the owner)'s invitation. It was seriously like night and day compared to our first visit! They told us they had gotten rid of a chef, and the proof was in the food. The falafel was perfect, steaming hot, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; delicious with the tahini sauce. My order of Zeta's chicken(chargrilled on a bed of rice with tangy yogurt sauce) was juicy and delicious, with the lovely smoky flavor of the grill. My husband got some sort of spicy kafta kebab in a tomato sauce, with saffron rice. The sauce on his dish was incredible; building layers of juicy tomato and spices, with an even heat throughout. The meat was nowhere near dry, as it had been last time.

This was a surprising and delightful change from our first visit, and we will certainly return in the future, and recommend the exotic food and gracious service to our friends!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Lentil soup, lamb kabob, chicken kabob are all very good. The falafel is some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was good and a place definitely worth supporting.

I had the beef/lamb shawarma and my wife had the greek salad with gyro meet. We had hummus as an appetizer. It was all enjoyable.

The shawarma dinner only came with half a wrap shell and wasn't enough to eat the entire meal. Luckily I was able to order another order of the pita and eat the remaining meat in it. Would like to try some more exotic choices next time.

My wife said the salad was good.

We will go back but will try something different next time."}
{"text":"Great great great experience. Food was amazing, owner stopped by and gave my son some gelato, because why not, we got to sample some Turkish delight, which was delightful. Little on the higher side for price, but food was great."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the staff was very friendly. We wi definitely be going back to Zeta's again. We went for lunch. I had the meat shawarma pita and my husband had the gyro. We swapped bites and both were great! They serve pita bread and olive oil at the beginning. It was very good! Definitely homemade pita bread. We were on and out in about 30 minutes over the lunch hour."}
{"text":"We had the lobster ravioli and the shrimp kabobs with potatoes and OMG so delicious!!! It was our first time here and we'll definitely be back!! Go see Nicholas in the bar, he gave us superb service!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The best hummus I ever had. Prices are good, portions are great and service is fast and friendly. If you like garlic, try the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"When I gave this place one star due to bad service and gross food the owner reached out to me and called me negative and was extremely unprofessional and rude. Just confirms my dislike of this place even more!! I had a party of 5 with me and no one else liked their food either. 

(See Mr. Mahdi: I'm not promoting another business -- just reviewing your place as fairly as possible)...."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch & LOVED it!
Service was excellent (Nick)- quick, friendly, and helpful!  
Food was delicious! We ordered the chicken shwarma, chicken kabob with rice and salad, and the gyro pita.  Soooooo good!!  
Also ordered the fresh Apple juice (which was pressed) and that was delicious!!  The server initially brought out freshly made pita (which is made in house and you can definitely tell!).. it was so fluffy and warm, I'm still salivating over it.  We had a great experience and the atmosphere was really cool.  Very clean restaurant & bathrooms were clean too.  I look forward to coming back and trying more and more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing hummus with chicken shwarma, fatoush salad and grilled lamb. Being from Detroit/Dearborn MI I have had alot of Lebanese food and this was so delicious that we wanted to go back the next day despite living 40 miles away. This place is solid in all that they do that I am very impressed. It is so nice to have a well prepared and served meal that does not leave you feeling all bloated and uncomfortable afterwards."}
{"text":"If my experience was solely about this meal, the rating would have been much lower.  However, I have eaten here before and the gyros, hummus and some other items are amazing. I had a take out order and decided to try something new so I ordered the falafel (which I've had many times at other places and love).  It looked really odd to me.  It looked super dry and crispy.  It was completely void of flavor except for a nutmeg type spice flavor.  Which was also different, I personally didn't care for it and didn't eat them.  It may have been overcooked??  And I asked for pita chips with the hummus and I got this little pieces that resembled broken chips in the bottom of the bag.  Wayyyy to small, no way to scoop up hummus with them without getting it all over yourself.  And finally....pretty basic to make sure you put napkins and silverware in a take out order."}
{"text":"My company actually got our event catered by Zeta's Grill and we were completely blown away! Everything was so fresh and tasted SO unbelievably good. The chicken was probably my favorite just because it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I had the chicken shawarma and even though the ingredients are so simple, the taste is really intricate and unique. Definitely a must try! 

I really have nothing but amazing things to say about the food. Everything from the hummus to the falafels were divine! Will for sure be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Went to Zeta's while visiting my daughter in Avondale. I got the Kafta hummus combo and my daughter got the chicken kabob special. We liked the hummus so much we ordered an extra side order and gobbled up every drop. The service was prompt and friendly and brought us water multiple times. I will definitely return on my next trip. They also have some yummy imported candy and whatnots by the cash register, stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"The food is good but seems pricey for the amount of food you get. I was disappointed with the pita that comes with a take-out meal. They look like a thin store bought pita that you cut in 1/2 and stuff with lunch meat, but someone cut the top layer off, so all that's left is the really thin bottom layer. I do like the saffron rice, grilled chicken kabob and the little pickles a lot.

Update: I am amending my review and changing my rating to 4 stars after the owner reached out to me to understand what happened. I had originally included a note that the greek salad is a joke because it doesn't have feta cheese on it. I have since removed that from my review as we figured out that the salad that comes with the chicken kabob entrée is NOT a greek salad, and that's why it didn't have feta cheese on it (my misunderstanding). The owner also explained that the pita that comes with the take out meal is different from what is served when you dine in and that I can ask for a fresh thick pita with my take out order next time (which are made in-house and sound delicious).  I really appreciate the owner reaching out to me to understand what happened and the desire to make a customer happy. I am really impressed by that. I will try the food again, but this time order the greek salad and ask for the fresh thick pita!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! We came here on the hope that the food was similar to our fave restaurant in Portland. Well it far surpassed that place. And the service! Niko greeted us quickly and got us drinks. I asked for a crisp white wine and he suggested their Lebanese chardonnay. Delish. My husband got a tasty Gin & tonic.   
We decided on a mixed platter with a kafta kebob and lamb & beef shwarma.  We decided on these to see how their meats and sides are prepared - well they were great!  The kafta kebab was so tender and tasty.  The hummus, baba and tabouleh were perfect.  The lamb & beef shwarma  were  tender and perfectly prepared. 
Niko was so personable. He gave us pointers on other places in the valley to get good food & escaoe the summer heat.  
In all, a marvelous experience. We shall be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I am happy to say we have returned to Zita's Grill several times to find a huge improvement from my earlier review. Zeta's Combo Platter is a nice combination of fresh enjoyable bites of goodness. Tabouleh is not my favorite salad (prefer Fattoush)  but it is better than I have had at other Mediterranean restaurants. Very good food and service."}
{"text":"Their pita bread is awesome! Freshly made and delicious! Gyros are good and Greek salad is on point."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Nicholas was knowledgeable and cool. Really enjoyed the food, it was fresh, eye pleasing and delicious. The menu is large so it can get overwhelming to choose but just know it'll be a large portion. They also have a wide variety of Mediterranean pastries."}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean food, this is the place to go. Outstanding food, fabulous service (and our server was only 17) what more would you want."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler, i went to Zeta grill because of the pictures i saw on yelp specifically the fattouch and the chicken shawarma. first i was so impressed with how fast the service was! i got my food in not time!! the chicken shawarma sandwich was awesomeee i would definitely drive back there to eat it. I was kind of disappointed with the fattouch as it wasn't like the picture shown on Yelp but still i would give this place a 5 stars cz i loved it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, all-around establishment. Clean and welcoming location. Friendly and courteous staff - Nicholas was awesome. Good drinks and plenty of food choices. Bread basket is delish! Humans is magnificent. Love the lamb, beef and chicken all cooked to expectation. Spicy potatoes and Greek fries - . Highly recommend this location for something different. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding Mediterranean food.

When we were seated Noel brought us homemade petas with peppered olive oil.  At our request he recommended the evening meal and explained the details of each dish in such a way it made my mouth water.  He was an excellent server who was always there before we needed him.

I had the vegetarian sampler ($10), it had the most wonderfully unique baba ghanouj I have tasted.  Lightly smokey and well seasoned.  The hummus was very creamy and flavorful.  The falafel was good but a little on the dry side.

My wife had the ribeye kabobs ($16) medium well.  She said the meat melted in her mouth and was very savory.  The potatoes were also delicious but the grilled peppers were a little flat in flavor.

The restaurant was very clean and inviting.  Just the right lighting to make us comfortable.  The noise level was low so we could easily converse without raising our voices.

This could easily become one of my favorite date night sights."}
{"text":"I live so close to Zeta's and I am disappointed that I have waited so long to try it. Today I went with my two children and it was so good. I have absolutely no complaints. The staff was friendly, pleasant, competent and timely. The food was AMAZING! They brought out pita and olive oil with spices for dipping. It was delicious. I ordered the Gyro lunch special with Greek style fries...both were so yummy and big portions. For my children they shared a kids meal cheeseburger with fries and once again the portions were very big! The prices are great for the quality and amount of food you receive!We will for sure be returning!"}
{"text":"I must said that middle eastern food is my fav so I get a little fussy about it. Place is nice I had lunch in the patio, I ordered first the vegetarian platter: tabboule hummus babaganoush falafel, it was DELICIOUS but I dont think the price worth the small portions, I got the chicken shawarma not the best that I had for some reason comes with fries inside changing the flavor and the concept. My sister got the kabab shawarma, better tasting than mine. I will come back to try a different dish."}
{"text":"Besides wonderful food, we also received great service! The chicken shawarma and rice were delicious. My hubby and I hadn't been to the restaurant since it was opened. The experience was much better then our first. We will definitely be back to try some more options from the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here, the salad was light and refreshing. My date and I had the salmon kabob with spicy potatoes it was awesome!!! Definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great choices. Friendly staff. They bring you pitas and olive oil dip. I got the marinated chicken which came with a salad and choice of sides. The chicken was so tender and juicy, add a little of the garlic spread to it and it's magic!!"}
{"text":"Good service and an awesome, authentic, comprehensive selection of Lebanese favorites! This restaurant is a tremendous addition to the West Valley. My wife and I shared a tabouli salad, the Kibbeh Nayyeh, and the mixed Lebanese pickles for appetizers. The pickle dish was nowhere near as impressive as the picture on the website, but aside from this one small mistake, the rest of the meal has made us determined to share with everyone how great it is to find fresh Lebanese food in Avondale! The lemony tabouli dressing was delicious and so we'll be glad to pick this salad up in the future for a healthy lunch or light dinner. The kibbeh was the highlight, nicely spiced and served with onions and pine nuts, and although it might sound strange to order raw lamb, it's the best we've had anywhere. Try it! Because we ate three appetizers and all of the hot pita bread that came with oil and thyme before our meal, we kept the main course simple, each of us ordering a shawarma sandwich. I had the beef, and I'll be sure to order it again the future because the tahini sauce was perfect. My wife enjoyed the chicken. For dessert, we shared some baklava. We both hope that West Valley residents will support Zeta's!"}
{"text":"First, let me comment on the atmosphere and condition of the space. It was inviting, very clean, and the waitress was kind and attentive. I believe the atmosphere sets the tone for the food you are about to enjoy. However, I have to say the food was lackluster. 

We ordered lamb kabobs, chicken shawarma, and hummus chicken shawarma. When you sit down the waitress brings a basket of fresh pita bread and oil with spices to dip. I have no complaints about the pita bread. It had that homemade taste and soul warming quality. We were hopeful since the pita bread was quite enjoyable. 

My husband ordered the chicken shawarma and he has had a few in his lifetime, especially during his time in Eastern Europe. He wasn't very impressed with Zeta's version, Maybe because he has had some excellent shawarma? Any who, I ordered the hummus chicken shawarma and it was good. The hummus was creamy and the chicken was seasoned well. My main complaint, and my family agreed,  was with the lamb kabobs. The lamb was hard to chew, no flavor whatsoever, and the vegetables were on the raw side versus charred from ample time on grill. 

Overall, I find this place to be just average. I will be going back to taste other dishes in hopes of giving a more generous review if deserved. Maybe there is a dish they make that will blow my mind and I just missed it this visit. Staying hopeful and planning a future trip to test that theory."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. We came for a dinner and enjoyed every bite of it. Wonderful recommendation on Daily Special made my day! Thank you. I will recommend to try their babaganoush (I think I spelled it right). The best I've ever tried."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me after my negative review and offered an apology and a full refund.  I appreciate the gesture and will give Zeta's a second chance.  I'll update my review at that time."}
{"text":"The location is in a spot where you can easily pass by, but in a nice complex next to EOS fitness. The restaurant is very nice, spacious, and decorated very well. I would have loved to sit outside if the weather was better. The food was awesome! I had the Zeta's Chicken and was very tender and flavorful. My wife had the chicken Kabob pita and she loved it. We tried the spicy potatoes and those were very flavorful and tasty. The Pita bread was warm and fresh. Our service was excellent as our waiter was very knowledgable of the menu and very attentive. The chef came out and introduced himself which was a nice touch. Overall we were very satisfied and look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Don't know if I'm the best person to give a review because I am not that familiar with Mediterranean cuisine! I thought I would be adventurous and try some new food. I am of course a big fan of gyros and have tried quite a few places in the area. I tried the plate with hummus, falafel, green salad (already forgot name of) and lamb skewer. I loved the hummus right off but I was familiar with that, and that's kind of where the love ended. The green salad was very strong flavored, I tried to eat it but just could not, did not like the falafel either, I wanted to because I heard they were good. I did like the flavor of the lamb skewer but way over cooked! The pita was good, but did not stay soft but still liked it with the hummus! My hubby had the gyro with fries, he liked it and the fries were very good! I guess I will stick to what I know and if we return will definitely get the gyro! So in short go try it yourself as all taste are different, it's a very nice restaurant we were the only couple in there, for lunch as we were leaving one more couple arrived. The young lady who waited on us was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Zeta's grill is very authentic middle eastern food. The have a very extensive menu with meals for everyone. I have had a great deal of middle eastern food in my life and Zeta's is definitely among the best!  The beef shawarma pita is delicious and extremely flavorful! I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. The service is super friendly. Your choices are difficult because everything is so good. They have tons of fresh smoothies and even vegan choices. I came in today for the first time and I've been missing out on this little gem."}
{"text":"Had food from the lunch menu, it was awesome!  Chicken and yogurt then took desert to go that was traditional and amazing.  Service was perfect, staff friendly and clean well designed restaurant.  We will make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Drove from Peoria to have lunch today and check out Zeta. Not sure what to say. Maybe it was an off day for them. I was really disappointed because being Lebanese I was looking forward to it. We ordered the grape leaves for appetizer and they were ok, at least they were not canned. Then we ordered the vegetarian platter and that was disappointing. We were served 4 very small ramekins one had appx 1 tbsp of hummus, another with the same amount of baba ganoch, another with tanouli and the 4th had 3 small falafels. The baba ganoch and falafel were ok but the hummus and tabouli were so bland and dry I had to order some lemon and used the dipping oil to make them edible. The charge for that was $9.99... outrageous for 3 tbsps  of food and 3 small falafels. We also ordered the mix grill with saffron rice. The meat and chicken were excellent so was the rice but I could not eat the kefta kabob, it had a weird taste that I could not identify. I gave it 4 stars because just as I said maybe it was an off day and didn't want to hurt their rating.  Even the coke I ordered was flat then the waitress brought me a 20 oz bottle and that was also flat, poor girl was embarassed. But i was still charged $2 for it lol. Over all it is not a place that l will drive from peoria for but might give it another chance if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Wow - this place is delish! If you're a fan of Greek salad, be sure to get their Greek salad with Zeta chicken. The chicken is super tender and flavorful! They also offer a military discount - win win!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great! Will be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I had the scallop kabob & it was fantastic.  All the prices were very reasonable.  The service was friendly, although we did have to remind him to bring silverware a couple of times."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern spot in the West Valley. You can never go wrong with any of the dishes they offer. Very healthy and everything is fresh. Great service & great food. You will love it."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate dinner here last night & everything was wonderful! Service was excellent and food was great. I ordered the lamb kebab and my husband ordered the mixed grill. We got a lot of food for our money! I really hope this place sticks around. We absolutely loved that they offered a 10% military discount. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fresh, home cooked, attentive staff, and great flavors. I got the chicken shawarma and veggies - a little greasy for my liking but the flavor was great."}
{"text":"Asked if they had any gluten free options and the woman working there looked confused, then said no.  I took a menu with me and upon looking at it, I saw most allergens are listed (contains gluten, wheat, sesame etc).  I could have eaten there, but had already left at that point.  Why have someone working the front that doesn't know the menu, or to do more than look confused and say no?  If she doesn't know, she should find someone that would know."}
{"text":"Todo esta muy rico, y un excelente servicio .
Recomiendo:
Greek Salad
Veggie Falafel
Spicy Hummus!"}
{"text":"Great selection of starters.  I ordered ?Fatayer B'Sabenekh and a salad. The selection reminded me of the good food I have had in Turkey.

I have the chicken kabobs with saffron rice.  Very tasty.  On a previous visit I had the minced lamb kabobs.  Excellent selection of desserts too.

Next time I will order two or three starters and a salad.  In their culture starters are more important than the main dishes.

The restaurant was clean quiet and the staff/owner very attentive."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Lebanese food and seek it out whenever we travel. We have tried different restaurants all over the country and Zeta's continues to be one of our favorites . I recently hired them cater my fiancé's surprise birthday party and it was spectacular! They delivered all the way to Scottsdale and right on time . Thank you to the wonderful people at Zeta's for making the night a little more special. If you are in the area definitely stop in, you will be glad you did"}
{"text":"We're new (part-timers) to the area and found Zeta's about 2 months ago. We can not come to town without eating there! The food is so flavorful and reasonably priced - it's a real find. We've eaten there 5-6 times (including a few take-out meals) and every time have had excellent food and pleasant service. Can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"The gyro platter is outstanding, time after time, service is excellent and the restaurant is always spotless. We love eating here and bringing family and friends as well. Never a disappointment. Also delicious is their homemade hummus."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the salmon and shrimp kabob, it was very good. I had the lamb kabobs w/saffron rice, delicious. The spicy soujok was sooo good!  Savannah our waitress was great! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very nice, friendly staff. Gyro Lunch combo is a  good deal and much tastier than similarly priced fast food.  This place was a pleasant surprise when we first found it tucked into an average shopping center. It's a real sit down restaurant and nicer than your average sandwich joint, but they also do take out. The Chicken kebab wrap is my favorite, but we've enjoyed their gyros and spicy sausage (Kafka?) pitas too."}
{"text":"Excellent falafels, and the chicken swarma sandwich was fabulous.  Nice and clean and nice wait staff.  Definitely will come back and try other dishes. Great pitas too!!

This this a great place with fresh food and lots of choices. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with this restaurant. The hummus was very greasy and the serving was extremely small for the price. The pita bread was stale. The vegetable plate was expensive and small. We left hungry but spent more than $50 for 3 people with no alcohol. I would not return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Succulent! The most succulent lemon and garlic infused shrimp dish and salmon I've ever had in my life! The sauce.  Saffron rice!! Spicy potatoes. Whoever is cooking in the kitchen is pouring love into their cooking. Wow! This place needs more business. The drive is worth it. Best Lebanese food on the West side."}
{"text":"Great lamb .  No smell at all.   Haven't had lamb in 30 years because of the smell.  Great deserts also .  Can't  wait to try other items"}
{"text":"Top notch customer service. Food was absolutely delicious!!! Portions are huge. 
Fresh, homemade pita to start. Gyro platter... my mouth is watering just thinking of it.

There's so much on the menu, I hope I'm back in the area soon, because I'll miss this place!"}
{"text":"Zeta's Grill is proof of how well Yelp works!  My wife and I were staying in the area and were looking for quality, healthy eats when we stumbled upon Zeta's on Yelp. We liked the previous reviews and with one quick look at the menu we were sold. 
The restaurant is really clean, with good atmosphere and feel of Lebanese ethnicity and culture. Staff is friendly and makes you feel like family (thank you Nicholas!) Speaking of family, the food tastes home-cooked. For starters we were served warm bread with olive oil on the house (So good! Eat it while it's still warm!) For main course, i had the chicken shawarma with spicy potatoes, and my wife had the lamb kebab with grilled vegetables. The side salad that preceded the main course tasted really fresh and crunchy. The meat was perfectly seasoned and grilled (on-spit) and the spicy potatoes are a must! We absolutely loved the food and our waiter was attentive and polite. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic food with something that everyone would like. Prices are reasonable as well. Loved it! We'll have to drive all the way across the Valley to enjoy this joint again!"}
{"text":"Eveything was absolutely ahhhhmazing here...the waitress was nice and friendly...the restaurant was clean and inviting...the combo appetizer was very fresh-tasting and super flavorful- as was the mixed meat plate. It was not very busy when we had visited, so it was hard to tell how service would be if other tables needed our waitress's attention. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Passing through from Palm Springs. Amazing chicken plate with very well seasoned rice. Didn't try the dessert, i didn't have enough room left, but they have a very wide assortment of cakes and baklava. This is definitely a go to spot if you're in the area. The prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"After running around all day shopping my sister and I decided to grab a bite to eat.  We had heard about Zeta's and decided to stop by. 

 Zeta's Grill is clean, spacious, and inviting and the staff and service border on amazing.  I have to admit on my first visit to Zeta's I over ate because the food was so good.  My sister and I had the Hummus Shawarma Chicken, Spicy Potatos,  Fried Cauliflower, and the Mixed Grill Kebab.

 It was great to try a few different  dishes.  I was unprepared for how good the food was and I will return soon to sample more entrée's.  My first visit was pure enjoyment to find such a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my boyfriend. The service was great and so was the food!  We had chicken shawarma humus which was delicious, he had the mixed grill and saffron rice he enjoyed it and it was very filling. I had the chicken shawarma plate and it was also delicious, very flavorful and juicy. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good food.   Light and mild flavor.   I had the salmon & shrimp kabobs with fresh veggies -served with warm pita bread.  Enjoyed this meal and ambiance is open"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we will be back. Appetizers and lunch specials were delicious. Lamb and chicken....Yummy. Must try it..."}
{"text":"I work across the street so I decided to try this place. I went with my wife and saw a coworker there.  Sat down right away and ordered the lamb sausage panini. I thought it was delicious.  It was cooked with a pomegranate sauce wIth pickles and tomato inside of it, which gave it a great flavor.  Also got a side of rice. My wife ordered what looked to be an empanada (can't remember the name) and it was delicious. Wish it came with a side of some type of sauce but it was still good.  The meal overall was more than enough for lunch and it was about $12 which is great for lunch. We also got baklava and it was one of the best that I have had. Service was also great with about five to six other tables there.  It was a good light meal that filled me up"}
{"text":"The meat was very dry, and the food was just so so. I can't myself coming back here again. The only nice thing was the waitress."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night & thought it was fantastic. We were brought warm, just baked pita bread with a seasoned oil when we went to our table. It was delicious. As we studied the menu, everything looked  so interesting that we were in a dilemma as to what we were going to pick. Since I prepare baba gnouj, I was anxious to compare it so that was the first thing. It was so much better than mine, served with pomegranates and radishes. Not only was it delicious but the presentation was lovely. My husband ordered the lamb skewers served with salad & fries which he loved and I ordered chicken skewers which I had with salad & their seasoned spicy potatoes.  Everything was so fresh but we had to box some because we just couldn't eat it all. Of course we had to try their pistachio baklava with rose water. It was perfect not overly sweet and packed with pistachios. We thought it was the finest middle eastern food we have had and can't wait to return. Next time we will try some other things."}
{"text":"Zeta's is in my neighborhood and I drove past it many times before I gave it a try.  I then returned 3 times within a week.  They gyro platter or gyro in a pita are both fantastic - great flavor, well cooked and not greasy.  I also love the chicken shawarma is also very good and I love the garlic sauce.  Highly recommend it for eat in or carry out.  The lemon dressing on the side salad is super tasty, love the spicy potatoes as a side dish and the warm pita bread they bring out when you arrive is amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a ton of food the other day. Here is my experience.  Called in order, staff very friendly but could stand to learn the menu a bit more. Delivery was prompt and driver was friendly. 
The chicken kabobs were AMAZING. Grilled yet succulent, amazing flavor. 
The filet mignon kabobs were perfectly cooked (med-rare) and delish. 
The lemon cilantro wings and accompanying sauce were the best I've ever had. Flavorful and different. 
Tzatiki needed some flavor but overall ok. 
Spicy potatoes needed flavor as well but everything else was so good it didn't really matter at that point. 
Thyme pizza simple but surprisingly delicious. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was definitely on point. Food had great flavor and was delicious! My kids ate just about everything on their plate and they're extremely picky eaters. We will definitely be back to try more. Yummm!"}
{"text":"Very delicious I must say. Ordered the chicken & rice and the chicken is tender with lots of flavor. Customer service is great. It's very quiet and relaxing. I will be eating here again soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Service is always pleasant, atmosphere very nice & welcoming.  The chicken shawarma is to die for!"}
{"text":"Shawarma chicken extremely dry and the shrimp was ok no flavor just fire but the place was really clean and the waitress very nice and attentive sad the food was bad because this establishment has great potential just need the food revised the backlava was really good though lots of nuts"}
{"text":"Authentic? I'd say. Good service? Definitely. Nice atmosphere? Very much so. For the most part, a good experience. I wasn't too thrilled about some of the portion sizes. I was thinking that my plate might come with a little more meat on it, a little less salad. Some of the items were slightly lacking in flavor. With our plates, we ordered the usual side of gyro, and it was not as flavorful as some of our other favorite Mediterranean diners. 
Our server wore a fez hat and vest that helped set the tone, and the look of the place inside adds to that as well. I can tell the owner takes great pride in his restaurant. We may return sometime to give a few more items a try."}
{"text":"Very nice dinner and look forward to giving it another try. Maybe five stars next go around. Wife and I had hummus awarma (pine nuts and minced lamb) which was down right awesome and would highly recommend and for dinner we had the vegetable lasagna, which so very flavorful. Service was good but a little slow. Overall, a very nice meal and experience."}
{"text":"What a pleasant suprise. Stopped in after place was reccomended to us. Very tasty food ,  ordered the mixed grill with spicy potato. Lebanese coffee and baklava for dessert. We will add Zetas to our list as a place to visit regularly when going out to dinner."}
{"text":"Great service, lovely atmosphere, our meals were delicious, fresh and healthy. 
So good, saffron rice is amazing, I would walk five miles for that rice."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place that I love so much. They have the best hummus I have ever had. The wait staff is great, we come in often enough for them to ask if we want our usual. I haven't had anything on the menu except their hummus, but it's awesome and filling enough for a meal."}
{"text":"I had the Zetas grilled chicken and spinach salad. Food was fresh, high quality and service was excellent. My new favorite place to eat when staying in Goodyear."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place at all.  Chicken was grey and had funny taste.  Pita Kitchen off McDowell and 99th Ave is by far the best!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food! I eat Arabic food all the time and this food was fresh and delicious.  Great service."}
{"text":"Food is REALLY good! Service was awful. I requested no bell peppers with my kabob and guess what? I got bell or peppers.
My dining partner got the sample plate with baba ganoush, hummus, falafil, etc. But, they didn't bring her any pita bread. It took about 15 minutes to bring I've piece of bread. They brought her more, but much later. Then, I also had to ask for my salad...after a very long time. 
To top it off, the waitress called my dining partner \"sir,\" when she's clearly not a sir. 
I'll probably come back. The food was great. I hope they figure things out.
What Mediterranean restaurant runs out of pita? It wasn't very busy, either."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is so good and very authentic.  Service is great and the ambience is very inviting."}
{"text":"My husband, the kids and I went here to try something new. We are fans of basic (gyro, kabobs, pita etc) Mediterranean food. They gave is free pita bread with olive oil and spices, when we first sat down. The kids meals are only $4.25. They have a choice of cheese pizza, chicken nuggets or a hamburger. I had the gyro platter which is an \"assemble your own\" gyro with spicy potatoes. I got a lot of meat which was crispy around the edges and tender. We had the calamari as an appetizer. It was tender and had a light breading on it. I could have had that as my main meal. My husband had chicken and spicy potatoes. Our meals were very tasty and the service was great. We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Went there yesterday for the first time. I thought the price of my food was amazing! I had the gyro platter for 10.95$. You get bread at the beginning and a salad before your meal. Sooo yummy. I loved the gyro meat and the potatoes. I had the baklava for dessert for 3.95$. The pieces were small for the price so ill pass on that next time."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to this place and get some great Lebanese food, but it was such a disappointment! I ordered the Fattouch Salad. Now the picture on the website and in the menu shows a beautiful, colorful, chopped salad full of mixed greens and other vegetables.  I got a bowl of romaine lettuce with a couple of hunks of bell pepper on top (boy do I regret I didn't taken a picture of it!) Don't put a picture of a dish on your menu if it's not gonna look ANYTHING like it when served.  I also ordered the plain hummus and the \"spicy\" hummus.  Nobody at the table could tell from tasting the two which one was the \"spicy\" one.  I ordered the vegetable soup, and was brought a bowl of lentil soup.  When I pointed out the error, I was told \"We didn't make any vegetable soup today so we brought you this one\"  WHAT?!?! The wait staff was very friendly (hence they earned the 1 star) but extremely slow.  They only gave menus to half the people in our group, and we constantly had to flag someone down to order.  To be fair, we did have a large party (20+ people) but everyone's food came out at different times and some people's food was cold when it finally did arrive (we made the manager aware of this) This would have all been bearable, had the food been good but no one was impressed,...Where's the spices?!?!?! Every single person in the group agreed they wouldn't be returning."}
{"text":"Yes have been coming here for a while and only until now I have had the opportunity to review it. Ready?...It is awesome, great food, great service, at a reasonable prize. I recommended, tried once and then you will like it."}
{"text":"Exquisitely delicious!  We were greeted quickly with warm Pita and Greek Seasoned Olive Oil.  The server was friendly and very accommodating.   My grandson wanted to color, so our waiter gladly offered to get some sheets of paper and brought back a selection of colored ink pens.  

I ordered Chicken Kabobs, which were seasoned perfectly.  Instead of rice, I opted for a sautéed medley of Summer Squash, Zucchini, Red Onion, and Red Bell Peppers.  This was seasoned nicely, as well.  The Garlic Cream was not over powering, yet flavorful enough and a perfect companion to the rest of the flavors on my plate.  The Greek Salad I had ordered, was fresh and perfect too. They don't scrimp on portions.  My 3 year old grandson kept saying, \"UMM!  UMM!\" and gave me several thumbs up.   

This is the best Mediterranean I have eaten in Arizona ever!  They have a wide variety of menu choices.   I will be back as much as possible, whenever visiting this state.   

A worthwhile stop, although it was difficult to stop eating such flavorful yummy food!"}
{"text":"This isn't a comment on the food, it's rather on the service.  My wife, son, and I stopped in last night.  There were only two occupied tables at the time.  We were shown to a table, so far so good.  So we're looking over the menu, and looking, and looking some more, and start to realize that nobody has come to our table for five, ten, fifteen minutes and counting.  We see one gal working the other two tables; she looks our way a few times and then keeps on walking.  Maybe we unknowingly had our invisibility cloaks on?  Sure seemed that way.  So I turn around in my chair to face the kitchen, she comes out again, and completely ignores us.  At that point I looked at my wife and said \"let's go.\"  Which we did.

What was then funny is that there was a guy cleaning up in the bar area, and he happily calls out to us \"Thanks guys, have a nice evening!\" or something like that.  Holy moly.

Onward and upward to Senor Taco we went.

This is really a shame because we love Mediterranean, their food is good and we want to see non-chain restaurants succeed here in the west valley.  But if this keeps up, I can't see them staying in business for much longer."}
{"text":"We ordered grilled chicken shawarma, basmati rice, Greek fries, spicy hummus and a couple of Greek salads. All was very good and fast. We received more food than we expected. I have no complaints and recommend Zeta's Grill. One thing i would suggest is that you call the restaurant, I ordered from Yelp and they never received the order. I did get an order received from Yelp and the money did come from my credit card but when I went in to pick up, they never got the order. Everything did work out and we enjoyed the food. But do your self a favor and call into the restaurant you won't regret it. Thanks again to Zeta's Grill for making a bad situation easy."}
{"text":"It is difficult to locate a good middle eastern restaurant in this area. I came across this this little gem, while looking on YELP. We  visited here about 2 p.m.... the establishment only had 1 couple and a single diner.
We were greeted by a very friendly hostess. Our server, Niko appeared immediately. He gave us our drinks and then came back shortly to take our order. We started out with \"vines\" (rolled grape leaves). They were encased with rice and some very good spice. I liked that they were rolled tightly, and served with some pickled vegetables. 
My husband is from the middle east. His mother made some delicious Lebanese food. The old man grew up with this kind of food, so his expectations  are pretty high. A basket served with some puffy pita bread and olive oil/oregano arrived at our table.. Got to say, it was awesome! My s/o had the gyro which contains lamb and beef. I had the lamb kabob with a salad with Greek dressing. It was made to order (medium rare) and included grilled vegetables over a bed of Greek seasoned rice. To, I ordered baklava to go. Later that evening I enjoyed it. It was made with your choice of walnuts  or pistachios. I went for the pistachios. Yummy!
Some of the reviews mentioned the food was late coming out. This is not a fast food joint. The food is made to order, so that is expected.
We live in the Peoria/Glendale area. It was a bit of a drive, but well worth it.
One other observation I made is that a lot of gluten free and vegetarian food is offered. These items are clearly marked on the menu as such.
Do not forget to check out the specials. They have a large selections of beer and wine. I do not drink alcohol, so I can not say much about this. 
Next time we visit (which will be soon), I will get the lamb shank. I am pleased that we came across this little unobtrusive  restaurant that is hidden  in a strip mall.
I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Great food and fun enviroment- we will def be back and bring friends"}
{"text":"If you are ever in the Phoenix area and feel like a great meal give Zeta's Grill a try. Last night I had the Samke Harra(Red Snapper with a spicy sauce) and tonight I had the Castaleta Ghanam( Lamb Chops for my South African friends). Amazing and the Baba Ghanouj and Tabouleh with Pita bread made the meal. Of course the mint tea at the start would not have been enough so an Almaza beer followed by a bottle of Ksara Cabernet Reservation and then a Turkish coffee ended a perfect evening. This restaurant is worth the drive if you are in Phoenix, Glendale, Tempe area. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk into Zetas the smell of the food cooking is fabulous. You know the food is prepared with care and love. The staff is fantastic and helps you make the choices that are  right for you. Don't wait to go and enjoy a meal at Cedars grill it's fantastic."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way home after a round of golf.  It was around 5:30pm and there was only 1 other table occupied when we walked in.  With all of the crappy fast food and chain restaurants that proliferate the west valley, we couldn't understand why this place was so empty.  The food is fresh with lots of healthy options.  Everything was delicious and the service was friendly and attentive.  My husband had their signature lamb shank and I had the mixed grill.  Both were season and cooked perfectly.  To top it off, portions are generous and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"There are too many good things I could say about this place. Amazing food, superior service, and great atmosphere. Loved the Armenian spicy sausage and the baba ganoush. Stellar experience. Will definitely be back again and spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and very delicious Mediterranean cuisine. Outstanding service and elegant atmosphere suitable for small groups of family and friends... especially for a nice romantic date night. I'd give Zeta's 10 thumbs up... if I had 10 thumbs..."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great. Had chicken shawarma with hummus. One thing i would suggest is storing your red wines in a cooler environment, particularly during warm days (which Az gets a lot of). I almost spit out a red wine I tasted there because it was really warm and had a funky taste and smell. Wine goes bad easily during heat waves / when exposed to warm temperatures for extended periods of time."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my husband and I've gotta say it was pretty darn good. I had the chicken and rice and my husband had the lamb with spicy potatoes. Both dishes were tasty. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!  Wow!  This little gem is a little known wonder.  Inside ambiance is simple, but the food is really good."}
{"text":"Great service, very nice inside and has outdoor seating! Food was delicious and fairly priced. Has great Greek Gyros, schwarmas, and lots of options. The coffee was not my favorite but it was Turkish coffee which I'm not used too, some people love it."}
{"text":"We have had great stuff - the gyro and the chicken particularly. Our last visit we tried to go \"spicy\" but it didn't quite make it. The spicy hummus had unblended chickpeas which my husband didn't care for either. My son tried to order a burger and fries and our server talked him into a gyro sandwich, after a free taste too. Thank you for that! The interior is inviting, the service great. Nice to start with warm pita and oil. We've been many times and will go back many more."}
{"text":"There aren't many good Greek restaurants here in the valley so I was skeptical to try a new one. I'm happy I did though. I bought the gyro lunch combo and I'm very pleased. The portions were comparable to the price. The gyro was delicious and had just the right amount of Tatziki drizzled on the pita. The cashier when I walked in was pleasant and the atmosphere was inviting. I will definitely come by to have a sit down meal in the future!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and the food has been amazing each time! The steak/lamb shawarma is amazing (better than the chicken, in my opinion) as well as their signature lamb shank platter. The pita they give you while you wait is freshly made and you can tell; Zeta's continues to be one of our top three nearby restaurants!"}
{"text":"Lovely Mediterranean spot with a good food selection. Had a variety of the region's cuisine ranging from greek to morrocan dishes. Priced very reasonable you can afford to take the family for lunch or dinner on a budget.  They even sell a variety of turkish delights. Try the complimentary white coffee, delicious. Gracious, accomadating, its surprising that I didn't know about this place sooner.

PS: the offer a loyalty card and military discount."}
{"text":"Just gets better and better.. I am not an authority on Lebanese food, but Michigan has the largest middle-eastern population in the US.. so I have grown up with these dishes as a part of my youth... Zeta's is some of the most authentic middle-eastern food I've tasted since moving to Arizona... I have been there 3 times, food is always better than the last time. Staff are friendly and accommodating, every new dish more flavorful than the last. Mahdi, you've got a winner! Keep making these incredible dishes, and you can count on us to keep coming back for more! P.S., the Hummus Shawarma is now my favorite thing on the menu, and I honestly could eat that every day and not get tired of it!"}
{"text":"Very good food if you both enjoy Mediterranean food and garlic. Service was quick, informative, and friendly. The layout of the restaurant is stylish and modern having both a bar section and dining section. The prices seem worth it once you realize how many sides come with your main course and everything tasted fresh, not to mention seemed very healthy. I will be sure to try some other dishes as I personally wasn't a fan of the chicken kabobs, but do recall seeing other dishes on the menu that peeked my interest"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time & everything we've heard/read about Zeta's is 100% true. Having served in the military and spent my time overseas, I can say that this Mediterranean cuisine is authentic. I had the the lamb shank. So flavorful, so tender, so delicious!! My wife wanted to sample a few different flavors, so she ordered the dinner combo. It was all delicious, but she really enjoyed the Baba Ghanouj. Nicholas was our waiter & made the dining experience that much nicer. Very friendly young man. His service was outstanding. Again ... only our first visit, but definitely not our last. Can't wait to take our daughters when they come for a visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful lamb shank with pilaf! Typical mid-eastern cuisine. The owner came over to the table and asked how everything was, it was quite delicious and generous portions. The menu has kabobs, vegetarian, baba ganoush, tabouli, and gyros, quite an extensive menu.
An amazing selection of beer and wine, he even has organic wine. Also a cute outdoor eating area under umbrellas. I'm so full I had to bring half my meal home. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Spicy hummus so good with hot pita. And lamb cutlet. The food is fantastic. It might be the best hummus I have had in a long while. 

They were a little slow when I went but the service was great. I would come back here in a heart beat. The menu has plenty of variety and the prices are pretty good.

Server was named Mariah. She was very nice"}
{"text":"Great food you have to try the stuffed grape leaves they are the best I've ever had. Amazingly nice staff and very comfortable atmosphere. Also they deliver!!"}
{"text":"My son and I had been meaning to try this place but waited till the parking lot wasn't so full from all the gym member for Golds Gym - next door.   We were a little thrown off as we didn't expect it to be so elegant when we walked in.  We immediately felt way under dressed.  The place was completely empty so we were constantly stopped by the host and Im guessing manager asking how everything was while we were eating.  I think they were bored.

The food was good. Not great but was decent.  Prices were ok some of the prices I felt were high. But pricing for what we got was decent.  

I think its a good concept but with being placed next door to a gym, and across the street from a college, the business might do better if the places what changed to some sort of eatery to get your food faster and go and possibly lowering their prices a little to coincide with the surroundings."}
{"text":"First time visit today was very good. Our server Shannon was young and new but you could tell she was trying very hard to do a good job. The food was excellent. we were started off with a fresh pita and olive oil prior to our meal. You can tell it's a new restaurant there's still some uncertainty about the menu items and bar menu but overall the experience was very good. The food again was wonderful! 

I had lamb shank and my wife lamb kebabs which were tender and delicious. The saffron rice was outstanding.

Based on our service and food we will certainly be back. Nice place in the west valley for mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This place is real. I am from the Middle East originally. I ate at almost every city in the region. This one is definitely with the right flavor and the right hands in the kitchen. Try this place for your self. They serve many dishes not offered elsewhere. This what the others don't want you to know."}
{"text":"Great place! More people should come here. Excellent food (best hummus warma I've ever had!). Great service. Nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Greeted immediately. Food was great. Would visit again. I ordered the gyros. They were really meaty."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and has excellent lunch specials. The atmosphere is perfect and the meats are tender and flavorful. We will be back."}
{"text":"We just had a great experience here.  We brought in a large group and the entire staff was attentive and helpful when ordering.  They were very accommodating to our group and the food was out of this world!
Everyone was very pleased with their meals!
I cannot wait to return...this is very close to our new house.  Looking forward to trying many other menu items!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place especially the falafel pita the lunch portion was just right ! The fresh made hummus and the pita bread that's made in house and served warm was so good!"}
{"text":"Came to visit my family out here in AZ, we stopped by to eat since my parents have never tried Lebanese. I ordered they lamb/beef gyro with fries, and spicy cayenne hummus. The flavors were delicious. the gyro wasn't over drenched in the yogurt sauce, it was just right. The fries were nice & crispy. The hummus, man that is fire! Must try!!! My only issue with this place is my wife ordered an extra garlic spread,and they charged another $1.50 for this. I've at several Lebanese restaurants, they never charge. But, i'd suggest this place to anyone if your in the city of Avondale."}
{"text":"Customer service was ok. I got a lot of salad (which the dressing was great) and hardly any meat. My gf had three chunks of lamb and received lot of salad and hummus. Not happy with the lack of meat on both orders."}
{"text":"By far, the best restaurant here in Phoenix. The lamb with basmati rice was full of flavor. Also, we had the hummus topped with ground lamb, it was excellent soooooooo we decided to pair it with za'atar manakish...best combination. Ever had a Lebanese beer? Come by and try Almaza beer!The fish and chips won't disappoint. The food was excellent and the service Nicholas provided was four-star service. After this great dinner experience we were expecting an $80. Check...nope, $40. I can keep raving about Zeta's Grill but we have to head back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here great place. Good atmosphere, Great Food! Chicken so tender and very jucy"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try for awhile and finally decided tonight was the night! We are sad we waited so long!! The food was delicious. We started with Sanbousek Cheese ... then I had the gyro platter an my hubby got chicken schwarma. Our meals were plentiful! The meat was amazing!  Our server was new and super nice and helpful! 
We highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed our visit. Not sure which was better, the food or the service.  Both were 5 star. We couldn't decide what to get so we got some of almost everything we thought we wanted and were not dis"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow and our server forgot my husband's salad, but the food is good. I managed to thoroughly enjoy a simple Greek salad with the endless supply of the delicious pita. The hummus is thick and creamy and so flavorful. It's a great place that is different from the normal west valley fare."}
{"text":"A gem!  High quality ingredients, prepared to perfection resulting in great flavors.  Service was flawless.  Great value.  Outstanding Lebanese food.  Tell everyone."}
{"text":"The reason I gave this two stars is because two of the three gyros I ordered had overcooked meat in it.  As in hard chared ineatable crust on it. Its probably because I went at 4pm (in between lunch and dinner) so instead of cutting off that meat that has been overcooked on the spit in between services they went ahead and served it to me. Nasty. The only reason I gave two stars is because the one that had meat that was cooked properly was fair. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Maybe I just went there at the wrong time - 11:15 on a Monday - but I was extremely disappointed.

First of all, the food. The spinach salad was blah. I expected more than just a handful of spinach with a few onions and tomatoes. For 9.95? And the spinach pastry? The pastry was outstanding, but it wasn't \"stuffed with fresh spinach\"; rather it had a thin layer of blackened, strong-tasting spinach spread on one side of the inside of the puffy pastry. Horrible! Couldn't eat it! And the server didn't even notice.

Secondly, the service. When my friend and I arrived, there were only four other customers, yet we had to wait nearly ten minutes to order our drinks and food. After we ate and our plates were taken away, it took 20 MINUTES for our server to return with our check. Actually, our server did not return on her own; my friend got up and tracked her down. 

Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here! The lentil soup, steak (lamb) tartare appetizer, and mixed grill were phenomenal. Our waitress was a lovely young lady. She was efficient and had a terrific personality! If we didn't live so far away (Florida), we would definitely return :)"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing!!!!!We ordered different entrees tonight and so happy with all of the choices. We loved the Greek fries. I've never had fries like these these are a must try. The lamb was so juicy and tender. For dessert we had the cheesecake and it was delicious! I cannot wait to bring my family to try Zetas Grill."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and it never disappoints. The food is so fresh and delicious! The Armenian sausage is made is house and has such a good different flavor. The gyros are so good but if you feel adventurous pretty much everything on the menu is fresh and so flavorful."}
{"text":"Customer service is awesome, comfortable atmosphere, and the foods were DEEEELISH! Coming back again if I revisit the area. My pictures of my orders are posted"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Zeta's Grill was awesome. Our group of 7 were truly impressed with the great food, excellent service and friendly atmosphere. The owner, himself, made a point to come to our table after our entree to check on us. The plate of fresh fruit at the end of our meal was a delicious treat. It truly is the best Mediterranean/Lebanese food in the area. A jewel in the west Valley. Definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this afternoon. I was happy to see many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I ordered the Vegetarian Gallaya with sauteed vegetables. It also came with a salad and bread, and oil for dipping the bread. The portions were very generous and everything was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be going back, often!"}
{"text":"Very impressed! I enjoyed the salad and chicken!! Rice is yummmmmmy! Hummus and home made pita is delicious!! I recommend this restaurant for authentic Mediterranean cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"Always amazing fast and friendly. Being new to the neighborhood I am excited to find a place right by home! I love being a able to order on the phone and pick up on my way home. If you are in the area I highly recommend Zetas!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Mediterranean food! Loved their Turkish coffee. Everything is delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really had high hopes for this place. Really did. My mother (who is Lebanese) recommended this place a lot, so I finally took her there for lunch. Service was great. The two women we interacted with were fantastic. The dining room was super clean, but no music which was weird but whatever. The menu looked great and authentic, menu items in Arabic, from my childhood. We ordered, and our first course came out, vine leaves, or grape leaves whichever you prefer. Ooh boy what a surprise! The brine wasn't rinsed off the leaves! It tasted like you took a shot of pure olive juice. No big deal, we all make mistakes. Sent it back, and the server went to the kitchen to tell the \"chef\" (actually that's not fair to call him that, calling him that is insulting centuries of proud real chefs) the problem. That's where things went south. The hacks reaction to the plate being sent back was childish and unprofessional. He didn't even taste them and stared right at me. A chef, even a decent cook, tastes his food before it goes out of the kitchen, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT GETS SENT BACK!!! He didn't, he cursed and walked away without acknowledging the plate. That's when I walked because I'm not going to sit and pay for some angry, wannabe chef to destroy my lunch. I'm willing to give it another try, because of my mother, but if I walk in there and I see that \"whateveryouwanttocallhim\" I'm turning around and never giving it another thought. This man should really consider throwing in the towel and maybe doing construction. In the service industry you have to take criticism and when in a scratch kitchen you have to understand you make mistakes. And by the way, chef, if you think you're too good to make mistakes, how come you're slinging hash at another person's restaurant and not opening your own...."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I live in Chandler so it's quite a drive but it is SO worth it! I'm Lebanese and it's been hard to find authentic food in the valley. So happy I found zetas :)"}
{"text":"i got takeout, tried the Salmon and Shrimp Kabobs, a side of Humus and the Fried Cauliflower app.Had my order rather quickly, about 10 min maybe, the people taking care of me were very friendly and accommodating. Everything I needed was in the Takeout bag. The Shrimp and Salmon Entree which came with Basmati Rice and a Salad was excellent  and so was the Humus, Wasn't real impressed withe the Cauliflower, not bad but not memorable either. Will return and probably eat in, looked like a nice place."}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here.  The basket of freshly prepared pita bread was the first positive sign.  We have never seen pita bread that fluffy.  The falafil appetizer  was good, the spices may have been a bit over-powering to be an appetizer item, but the effect was excellent.  The vegetable lasagna was great and the shish tawook was very tasty and nicely presented under its pita bread \"blanket\".  I wasn't in the mood for a side salad, so I had the lentil soup...I'm glad I did, it was great.  We had so much to eat that we had to pass on desert, but the selection looked wonderful, and we will leave room for that next time.   We found a great place for good Mediterranean style food.
An interesting twist on the place is that you can get french fries with everything, I..think..that's good."}
{"text":"Once again, Zeta's hits one out of the park. Food was so flavorful, it made me hug myself. Mm mmm mmmm. Spicy potatoes, veggie gallaya, bak lava. This was my take out order which was cold by the time I got home.

But you know what? it was still good. Pass. The. Tahini!"}
{"text":"I never review restaurants, I don't like to review because I am a chef and I believe a place will stand alone on its food and merits with out any help or bashing. How ever this place deserves a honorable mention for quality of service and a very interesting menu.  This is not a place to come to be shy about trying something new.  Be brave and you will be rewarded. The dishes  are full flavored and have an interesting new flavor profile to try. My favorite so far is the house made spicy sausages. ( no idea the proper pronunciation.) The owner is in house and was so kind to come and talk to me as one chef to another discussing the food and restaurant life. So fully enjoyed my experience that I have already gone back twice. Every time I am trying a new dish. Go and try something that you can't say and all you will say as you leave will be\"that was so good\""}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Falafel Sandwich and French fries! Falafel balls are made with chickpeas and fava beans and were very moist and the seasoning was unique and so good. The young man that served us was great. He was very considerate and accommodating of our time restraint which we appreciated. We went around 1-2 pm and we sat outside since it was a perfect day. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I hope it sticks around. Family owned and operated, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious!! My friends had the falafel pita and I had the chicken kabob pita with a side of spicy potatoes. The wait staff was nice and the decor was clean. Zeta's is a hidden gem in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Food was really good..but even better the staff was polite and smiled.  I like that."}
{"text":"What a gem in the desert. The food was absolutely amazing. The mixed grill with chicken and beef kabobs as well as a skewer of Kafka was melt in your mouth tender. Great prices for the large portions you get.  The chef came out personally to make sure our food was good and if we had any questions. I truly felt like part of the family.  Our waiter Nicholas was over the top in customer service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Holly Pita!!! Woza.. home made pita. Nice, airy, and warm.. we had some
Hummus and proceeded to order. The hummus was awesome!  It had chickpeas in the center with just a touch of oil. It had the perfect flavor and consistency. They have a lunch menu and some lunch options on the back of the regular menu. I found that to be a bit confusing and I almost missed the possibility of eating the chicken kabab wrap. I also ordered a side salad which came out after the appetizer. The salad was fresh and pre-dressed. The food came out and the portions were huge. The food was great, nice and warm and a nice blend of tzatziki sauce and chicken. One person at my table ordered the lunch combo and I was a bit envious at the selection of various items. I ordered some baklava which I had the option of pistachio or pecan.  I had the pistachio and it was crispy and lightly honeyed. I really enjoyed eating here, it was nice, clean, friendly service which good prices and great food."}
{"text":"Knowing my wife, and the fact that she loves Mediterranean cuisine, I was excited to learn that Avondale, Arizona is playing host to Zeta's Grill. 

Having moved to West Phoenix in 2008, it has been quite some time since we have been able to enjoy a restaurant that prides itself on authentic flavors, as well as solid customer service. Zeta's Grill has both.

We arrived in time for lunch and were seated immediately. Our server was attentive and quick to refill our drinks, and she was patient in allowing us to fully view the menu - although we had done so online and had a fairly good idea as to what we were interested in. Our order was prepared quickly and delivered to our table in a timely manner, and we were pleased to see that along with her other customers, we were not made to feel unimportant. Everyone received the same type of courteous and timely service from the young woman. 

Upon completion of our meal, we were provided with the check, which I must readily admit was a little pricey for lunch. None the less, we felt that given the nature of the cuisine, and the service provided, it was worth the additional money we could have save by going elsewhere.

As a whole, we were satisfied with our meals, the atmosphere and the courtesy Zeta's Grill provided. While we agree it is not a weekly hot spot for us, we will definitely partake of their cuisine again.

**One side note: the website leaves a great deal to be desired as most of the page links are defunct and unable to access. That said, if you are interested in trying authentic Mediterranean cuisine, Zeta's Grill is a great place to experience."}
{"text":"Love be this place.  Food was superb.  Service was awesome.  Food came out hot .  Hummus was almost as good as mine.  Will be back."}
{"text":"10 STARS. AUTHENTIC Taste. Visiting from San Jose, CA. I highly disagree with the 3 star comment about the kebab. Although they were small, but for 10.95 platter you are purchasing a sampler platter (sort of) generous amount of hummus, beef kebab, Tzatziki and tabouleh. I have also been to Dish Dash in Milpitas and i'd say this place is way better in taste and you are paying near 50.00 for two. Hummus, Tzatziki, and falafel are best I've ever tasted. The prices are really low. The toubuloueh was perfection and they served unending pita bread to eat. Ordered baklava made fresh from pistachio and the portions were huge! Place is definitely worth going in."}
{"text":"I really liked Zeta's Grill. Three of us went for lunch and had Spicy Hummus for an appetizer which is, Chickpea puree mixed with cayene pepper, parsely, garlic and sesame paste (Tahini). Contains sesame. 

Each of us had the marinated chicken served in a pita. I can't remember the name of the item, so I can't put accurate details, but it was good. Of course I ordered desert!!! Lebanese Baklava and it was delicious. 

Our waiter was fabulous and friendly and the hostess or other waitress that helped me pick out the Turkish Delight was very nice and informative. Doug and I took some Turkish Delight home to try it. I have been wanting to try this for quite a while, in fact I'll have a piece now and take a picture !!
 We will be back."}
{"text":"I am not sure where the high reviews come from. The shawarma dishes were bland, very little seasoning on the meat. I could have made a comparable dinner by simply pan frying a chicken breast with light oil, no seasoning, and then chopping it up into tiny pieces. The kebabs were not good either, especially the beef, it tasted like very low quality meat, very chewy and rubbery, and had no seasoning at all. The chicken kebab was okay but the meat was questionably soft and juicy, and made me wonder if it was pre-packaged. There was one kebab which was like ground meats formed into a hotdog-like shape I think it was the minced lamb, and this one was better tasting but the spices used are very overpowering and I only took one bite of that one. Perhaps that is what Mediterranean food is supposed to taste like, but I found it unpleasant, and I have a widely varied pallet. Also, one thing that really bothered me about the kebab was that the veggies on the kebab- onions, tomato, and peppers-  were very underdone. They were barely charred by the grill at all, I ate only a few onions that seemed a little cooked but the rest of the veggies I left alone, and I enjoy veggies, I just don't think for a kebab they should be almost raw, I would have preferred them to be more cooked, and they could have used a marinate or something, so bland. I also tried something called Armenian spicy sausage, would not order again and did not even finish it, probably ate maybe 3 bites. It just tasted like an old dried out sausage. Nothing compelling about the flavor of that sausage whatsoever. The saffron rice on the side had hard pieces of rice mixed in, almost like new and old rice had been mixed together, and you can tell real saffron was not used as you couldn't even taste it in the rice. For all intents and purposes, the saffron rice was simply low quality rice with yellow coloring to it. In fact, most of the components of the meals selected seemed to use low quality ingredients, especially the meat. They even use olives with pits in them! Now that's low quality. It costs a fraction of a cent to get the container of olives without the pit. I was really upset when I threw the olive on the side into my mouth and bit down only to realize there was a pit, good thing I didn't break a tooth. French fries as a side were also terrible. How can you ruin french fries?? Yet they were, they were soggy from being underneath a pita and the warmth from the meat dishes causing water to condense on the plate. Side salads came with a Greek-style dressing, but it seemed like it was watered down, it was extremely clear and very liquidy, not thick like a salad dressing should be, and so did not coat the lettuce well. Tried the baklava also, it was flaky but left much to be desired, was not that sweet and had a thick layer of ghee which overpowered the pastry almost to the point where I felt like I was eating a hunk of clarified butter. And, it was pretty expensive for the small 3-ounce portion you get. Actually, everything was pretty expensive and it seemed like such low quality. I've had Meditteranean food before but haven't ever found a high quality Med restaurant yet, doesn't look like Zita's is it, either. 

The gyro pita was good but was light on the tzaziki sauce I wish they would have added more, or given a side of it to dip the pita into. The gyro was really the best thing they offered, and if I ordered from here again I would definitely order the gyro plate or pita but probably won't order from here again, ever."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Nice change of pace trying something new here each time I visit. I think my favorite would have to be the shawarma dish. Customer service is on point as well, always a friendly face and personality with each and every worker here!"}
{"text":"Do not know how I've missed this place! I think it's because from Dysart it looks like a sport's bar. 

Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and was nicely surprised by good service, pleasant atmosphere and a superb meal. The fresh pita and oil to start was delicious. Got the appetizer seasonal pickles and a chicken swarhma sandwich. All delicious.

I'll be back for dinner! The deserts on display look great. Will have to leave room next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been spending our winters here for 6 years.  I consider Zeta's Grill the best restaurant in the West Valley.  Ingredients are fresh, selection is surprisingly wide, the preparation of every single item we have ordered since Zeta's opened has been flawless, and the service has been super friendly and attentive without fail.  Some of our favorites have been  hummus, tabouli, shrimp kabobs, grilled chicken shwarma, and vegetarian gallaya."}
{"text":"I have been a few times and the have some of the best hummus! Definitely need to work on the meats because I've had it dry a few times but over all good flavored"}
{"text":"I have no experience with Lebanese food so my rating may be low.  Five us us went to Zeta's based on the Yelp reviews.  We were there for an hour or more and were the only customers in the place.  Needless to say the service was great.  The staff was very friendly, attentive and helpful.

We had three appetizers, four different entrees and pistachio baklava for dessert.  Everything was good, maybe it was great, not sure we would know.  I particularly enjoyed the calamari, scallops and baklava."}
{"text":"Driving home from a long road trip and had to stop at a pharmacy. We were looking for something healthy and found it. The house chicken soup was quite tasty and the gyro salad really hit the spot. The service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Really fresh flavorful friendly atmosphere. Staff very friendly and eager to take care of you really like having something like this on the west side of town"}
{"text":"I came here to have Shwarma and they were out of it. I tried Kabobs instead and it was undercooked.

Service: Poor. The waitress was nice but service was very poor"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Mediterranean food my wife and I were very excited to see this restaurant open in our neighborhood. We visited this restaurant the other day and overall our experience was very enjoyable. 

The cuisine, atmosphere, and service were all very good. If you never tried Mediterranean/Lebanese food you are in for a treat!

We started off our meal with the baba ghanouj and hommos with the freshly baked warm pita bread. The hommos and pita bread were the best I've had.

For the main course I had the mixed grill (A combination of charcoal - grilled skewers of Lamb, beef, and chicken Kebab). The meats were well grilled, tender, and flavorful. 

For a side dish I had the sautéed vegetables which were prepared in a way I had not had before. Very good. 

For dessert we had an assortment of baklava which were awesome and also the best we have had.

We will be regular customers and highly recommend Zeta's."}
{"text":"What a terrific surprise. Found it on Yelp while golfing in area. Alway enjoy Greek food so we decided to give it a try. Our waitress Marilela was very accommodating and patient in describing the menu and recommending dishes. Everything exceeded our expectations and the owners father even came out on the lovely and large patio to check on us. Surprisingly we were the only guests on the patio during this perfect evening. My wife and I shared our very generous portions of lamb uzi (lean sliced lamb over wonderful seasoned rice) and fish of the day which was wonderfully slightly breaded spicy seasoned cod in a delicious tahini sauce served with house potatoes which by themselves would have been worth the trip. Both meals came the choice of soup or salad. Both excellent. We enjoyed the lentil soup and salad with the house dressing. 

We are looking forward to returning and will not mind taking the 45 minute drive even if we are not golfing. It will be well worth the ride!

Returned a week later. Just as good. Everything we ordered was different."}
{"text":"Dined here last night.  Was informed after seated that an article in the local paper had brought in a crowd of business resulting in a shortage of supplies, exhausted kitchen staff and long waits.  We should have left right then.
So....long wait, small portions, and bad service.  The order we put in came out wrong but at that point we were so hungry, anything was good enough.  Won't be back.  2 stars for no food poisoning."}
{"text":"I've always had great service and extremely good food Zetas grill. I've been there several times, they have a great happy hour and I will continue going back. The gyros are the best around!

Best gyros hands down. I usually get my food take out but have dined in a few times as well. I've never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Great find! We wanted a healthy meal, but not just another salad. We were pleasantly surprised! We had the warm hummus, vine rolls and falafel! Delish !! We also shared the mixed grill and the kebabs were so good!!! 

The service was incredible also!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here tonight and tried it for our first time. We ordered the Falafel dinner combo the bean dish with garbanzo beans and fava beans and a Greek salad. The pita and olive oil came first and the pita was nice and warm and puffed up as if it came out of the oven just been. The Falafel dinner was great their baba ganoush was so smoky and perfectly flavored. I was very pleased with the hummus and it's lemony flavor. And the Greek dish was fresh with crunchy lettuce. If we had any more room I would have ordered the baklava."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We have been there several times and never been disappointed! Love the hummus and chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and arrived about 10 minutes before it was supposed to be ready! We spent another 30 minutes waiting for an order which was fairly uncomplicated. Just a few salads, a platter and a falafel sandwich. The place was not too busy and just had a few tables filled. Waitress was apologetic but they need to get operations in order."}
{"text":"The bar is open now and tastefully done it seems to fit in really well with the rest of the restaurant. No draft beer which is a little odd. Had the chicken shawarma the spicy potatoes... just fantastic. The best Middle Eastern themed restaurant on the west side by a bit oh, & a 10 percent off coupon attached to the check that I can use for my next visit. Happy happy!"}
{"text":"We went here last night, service was great, food was good. Today feel sick to stomach & feel like I got a touch of food poisoning. We had leftovers so my daughter is eating it & finds a partial band aid in our food we shared last night!  I'm grossed out & hoping the ill feeling I have is nothing too intense. Never going back & will not recommend this place! Grossed out!! 
***Update*** Owner denies any acknowledgement, said restaurant is always clean & sanitized.we have no proof & he's not willing to do anything! Such horrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Bland. Ordered the chicken schawarma and hubby got the lamb shank. I thought the chicken was very plain tasting and a bit dry. It also came with a slice of pita bread which was hard like toast (stale maybe?). I didn't even eat half of the meal and tossed it. Hubby's lamb shank had a weird fishy taste, yes I said fishy taste on a hunk of lamb  Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Went in today to get lunch with my mom. The service was amazing! Although I'm not the biggest fan of Greek food, the food was amazing as well. Me being as picky as I am, the waiter got everything I wanted. Super nice! Loved it and had a good time."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried has been amazing, I'm not sure if I just picked the right night but the place was empty so speedy, courteous service. They truly tend to you, I have had several waiters/waitresses and none of them have steered me wrong with their recommendations"}
{"text":"Wonderful cute place the good is amazing I got to try 4 diff dishes and all were amazing and the salad was so fresh and everything was beyond any good I've tried before so glad we tried this place it's soooo good you won't regret trying it"}
{"text":"Great place. I have been to Middle East and to Greece number of times and have been able to compare  it's ethnic food.  This is by far the best place for hummus and Greek food around. And they have a Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had a gyro lunch special for $7 (plus some change) and I substituted the fries for a house salad and soda w/ lemonade. I called in prior picking up the food to speed up the process and it was ready within my 10 minute drive to there. I was the only costumer on a weekday at 1130 for lunch, which I'm surprised about since eating the gyro, it tasted pretty good. I'd like to come back and try out their other food on the menu! I recommend for others to try!

So I've gone back a handful of times now and have found my favorite. The chicken shawarma and fatuous salad and an appetizer of calamari.The bread and oil dip is so delicious, also!"}
{"text":"I can't even express how amazing this place is. The atmosphere is great, Nikko our server was personable, knowledgeable and just all-around great, and the food is unbelievably delicious. 

We had the almaza lebanese beer, Jallab date juice, thyme pizza, the mixed grill kebabs and the baklava. So outstanding and flavorful. Each dish was just mouthwatering. The spicy potatoes with the entree were fantastic. They even had complimentary hot tea at the end that was cinnamon magic."}
{"text":"Dinner salad was crisp and well dressed. Chicken kebab was fantastic, flavorful and cooked juicy and tender. Side of mixed veggies was okay being too oily for my taste and rather soft-cooked. Fresh pita bread was amazing and I could almost live on that bread alone - warm and crisply tender. 

Atmosphere was quiet and casual and after we lingered for two hours the chef came out with complementary coffee-an unusual blend of honey and spices. 

I was a little put off by the location and exterior but inside was pleased with Mediterranean music and with decor. Waitress seemed bored but busser, chef and other staff were great."}
{"text":"Live close by and needed to try this place. Our first impression was a brightly lite with REAL live goods decorating the place. The fountain was a nice touch. The lunch chicken and rice was little dry however still full of flavor. Gyro combo meal was given thumbs up, meat was tender flavorful and the Frys were done well however I did add feta cheese that made them awesome and the beef stew didn't have enough meat, a lot of vegetables and good flavor just not enough meat. The service was good for it being 2:45pm and the waitress was attentive to drinks which is big plus for me."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today. Got a take-out order. The restaurant was very clean and orderly. The staff was very friendly and inviting. The gyro was loaded with meat and the fries were very tasty. Overall a great addition to the West Valley and I will return!"}
{"text":"Best hummus and baba ganoush I've ever tasted. Gyro is fantastic. Venue is clean and staff is friendly and helpful. Fresh baked pita. My only feedback is to keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"Hubby brought me here for date night! And I'm so glad he did! The food was amazing and the service was exceptional! Nick was our server and he was on point! I've read some reviews about \"small portions\" and can't help wondering if people are expecting a \"trough\" of food?! Portions here are plenty big at a great price. I'm not a salt user and found their gyro to be perfectly seasoned. Husband got the lamb shank and it was melt in your mouth delicious! I love that this place was close by and would definitely go back! Thank you Nick for such great service tonight! We appreciate you!"}
{"text":"Lack Luster Experience! Ordered two Gyro meals and a 1/2 chicken meal. Received two piles meals of old overly salted lamb meat with a few fries with no pita. Instead of a 1/2 chicken they decided for me that they would give me two miniature chicken breast instead of a breast a leg and a wing. No pita bread was included and when I went back I received old pita bread. WORST FOOD EVER!"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things about this place! Everything we ordered tasted amazing! There was enough left over for lunch the next day too. The out door seating was comfortable and clean. We went in late on a weeknight and got the whole patio to ourselves. We brought our 1 year old as well and even she likes the patio!

Our waitress was a very young lady who was quite friendly, and she did a phenominal job all night. She impressed me so much. Her attention to the details and her pleasant personality make her a very valuable asset to this restaurant. We never ran out of drinks, had enough napkins and pita bread, she even got us a special tiny spoon for the baby to use! (I will mention I had spent the whole week at the hospital with a friend and did not think it would be possible to get out of my terribly bad mood. Between the elicious vegetarian options for me, accommodations for my child, and the wonderful service, this restaurant completely turned my evening around.) 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took the family here tonight and truly enjoyed our meal!  This was our second time visiting Zeta's, but first for dinner.  We had the cauliflower, falafel and grape leaves as appetizers; FANTASTIC!   My husband had the spicy sausage, he really enjoyed it.  Our table had a mixture of entrees from the Gyro Platter, lamb entree and shrimp platter.  All very tasty, filling and so good!  We love having this option in the West Valley, and not another chain restaurant.  We will continue coming here for the amazing Mediterranean food!!  Nick, our server, was awesome at assisting us with the menu and making sure we were satisfied with our meal.  Great service and food!!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and they have Turkish beer!  Great appetizers. The staff is very friendly and it's just fun to eat here. Many beers & wines to choose from and they have Turkish food and snacks and sweets to go, and as well. Also have a nice assortment of baklava."}
{"text":"The fried cauliflower was AMAZING!!!!!! I had the spicy lamb kebab (khosh khash) with spicy potatoes and it was really tasty...but there was an herb present that wasn't 100% what my taste buds wanted.  My husband had the lamb gallaya which was really good!!! We ended the meal with the cinnamon walnut cake...yummy! 

Give it a shot, you will be pleasantly surprised :)"}
{"text":"After searching for Lebanese restaurants in the valley I was pleasantly surprised to see one was close by in the west valley. The wife and I decided to give it a go. First impressions were that the restaurant was fairly large and clean. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. 

Here is what we ordered:
-Hummus and Pita (hot out of the oven)
-Fattoush Salad
-Lentil and Carrot soup
-Mixed Grill (lamb kabob, chicken kabob, lamb kafta)
-Chicken Shawarma Plate

Everything we ate was excellent! If you like garlic make sure and get the garlic sauce...I could just eat that all by itself it is so good.

If you are looking to get your fix of Middle Eastern food then give Zeta's Grill a try. The wife and I are happy to find a new spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"Holy cow.  The absolute best Mediterranean food in the valley and one of the best I have had in the nation.  This is probably my 10th visit and every single item ordered has been a 5 star dish.  Everything from hummus, shawarma (both lamb and chicken), gyro, lamb shank, and even a simple salad is a flavor explosion.  The pita that is served before the meal with olive oil and spices could satisfy most just by itself.  Everything is made fresh.  Staff is super caring and courteous.  
I live clear on the other side of the valley bit my family and I make special trips.  An absolute must try if middle eastern/Mediterranean is your thing."}
{"text":"We went here for my Mother in Laws birthday celebration;) It was beautiful inside and very open.
It smelled like heaven! It's a family owned restaurant, which is our favorite. The service was top notch and the food was amazing! They sang Happy birthday and played it over the loud speaker in their language;) then served her a baklava w/ a candle in it! I highly recommend this place;)"}
{"text":"i was really impressed with this place.  we had a party of 8 which they were able to seat (we got there at 1pm).  the waiter was amazing.  friendly and got everyone's orders and crazy bill splitting handled without any issues.  And when someone dumped an entire water glass on the ground he didn't even blink - just got a rag, a mop, and a refill.  

I had the vegetarian taster and loved it.  the falafel was perfect as was the baba ganoush (sp?) and hummus.  

they also bring fresh made pita to the table along with an herbed oil -- amazing!  I've only had pita from the grocery store and have never been too impressed; but fresh was incredible!

and of course, i had to try the baklava.  its not my favorite dessert but i figured this place would know how to make it if anyone did.  It was flaky, and the flavor of pistachios wasn't overthrown by honey (like I'm used to).  in fact, these didn't have very much honey.  enough to make it sweet and stick together, but not messy. I could pick up the piece in my hand and not need to wash it afterwards.  Loved how the taste of the pistachio really \"shone\".

would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. So tasty and fresh. Rare to have the love of the owner preparing it all. Wish I lived here. I would have been a regular. Janice and Steve Fletcher"}
{"text":"Zoomed in late last night in a neighborhood I was not familiar with after running errands. Nice place. Thanks Yelp for the tip. 

* The Falafel and pickled garnish salad were great.

*The Greek fries were good

*I did not care for their style of pita bread but I think it just a  preference thing so no fault of theirs. I found it pretty tasteless. I like my pita bread soft, flavorful and thicker. Here it is more like a puff over with a consistency of a chip.

The service was outstanding. Noel was superb! I really enjoyed it here. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop in for lunch. It has the best lamb gyro was the bomb. The service was vary good. The people where really nice. I will be going back and I will take my family this time. Had a great experience."}
