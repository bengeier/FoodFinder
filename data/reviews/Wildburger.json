{"text":"I had been seeing a lot of ads for this place & saw a groupon for it & decided to buy it.

It wasn't very packed when we went, which was good. The hostess that greeted us was very friendly & helpful. I will agree with the other reviewer regarding the whole ordering thing. Fortunately we didn't have anyone waiting behind us. But I could definitely see where it might be troubling when it gets busy. 

I feel that maybe the lack of wait staff, seating yourself, ordering & paying up front has to do with keeping the costs down, seeing how its a small casino. 

The food was definitely on point though. I had a turkey burger & it was very tasty. The only downside to my burger was the fact that it had shredded lettuce & it just made things messy. My girl had the giant bacon wrapped hot dog. That thing was legit & super good! The fries aren't too bad either. The jalapeno ketchup is great & has the right amount of kick to it. Another disappointing factor is that they serve that inferior cola product that shall remain nameless. So, I opted for pink lemonade. 

Now for dessert...a homemade ding dong! I used to go nuts for those when I was a kid :) Basically brownies with vanilla cream or whipped cream sandwiched in between & covered in chocolate. Very rich & pretty decent. However, it wasn't quite as good as a real ding dong :( 

I also have to disagree with the other review as far as service. I felt it was very good & we were checked on quite a bit, by both the hostess & the guy who brought us our food, who may have also been the chef. He was very funny & personable. Unfortunately I may have offended him when he asked how the ding dong was, to which I replied, \"not bad\" & he made a sad face. Sorry buddy.

Overall it was great & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away inside of Wildfire Casino.  My friends that were in town lured me in to try a Groupon of Day special here... and I must say it was well worth it.  Groupon or not, expect a delicious burger and great service.  

On the menu, you can order a variety of things including special burgers, made-to-order burgers, salad's, chili, hot dog's, etc.  They even serve breakfast up to two in the afternoon.  I ended up getting a custom turkey burger (the best Turkey burger I've ever had) with some fixings and a bowl of chili.  We also had some chicken wings for the table and ended with a fried Twinkie.  It was all gluttony and I have no regrets.

The food is more than worth the value (especially if you grab a coupon or Groupon).  If not, you're still getting delicious food."}
{"text":"Tonight after much discussion we decided on burgers for dinner.  Yes even Hubby gets to the point  of no return on buffets, he wanted a real burger!  Hit the Groupon app on my phone just in case (if you dont groupon- you should!) and found Wildburger at the WildFire Lanes location on E Sunset.  $10 for $20 credit sounded good so off we went!

On the steps of Wildfire, I noticed the cigarette smell immediately, walking in confirmed it.  This isnt one of the mega-casinos with fancy filtration and circulation.  The Wildburger isnt too far from the doors but if smoke bothers you, be warned.  You order at the register on walking up, then seat yourself inside the restaurant space to eat.  I was concerned about how many people were in line ahead of us, but Ashley the cashier was quick, clear and cheerful to talk to.

Inside the tables were clean, well stocked, and the fresh brewed iced tea was great!  When it began to get low they immediately started another batch & it was out promptly.  When the server brought our food she asked if we needed anything and quickly filled the request.   The food was yummy!  Hubby's half pound Wildburger came out exactly as he likes, brioche bun, tillamook cheese & signature slaw making it tower over the plate.  At 7.99 including fries (also quite good) this is a very reasonably priced dinner.  My chicken breast was tasty & placed on a perfectly toasted sesame bun and I loved every bite!  The onion strings were good but the fries were better, just as Ashley told me when asked.

Seeing deep fried twinkies on the menu ($4.99) I asked & was told yes, they still have REAL twinkies, and she described it as being between a Krispy creme donut and a funnel cake - SOLD!   It was delicious - dusted with powdered sugar, though I would have liked a drizzle of raspberry sauce or something to take it to the next level.

Overall, not too smoky in the dining area, great burgers & sandwiches cooked to order, reasonable prices, good iced tea & a great dessert, and courteous & cheerful service = return visits!  After our groupon savings ($10) our dinner cost was $11 plus tip!  We'll be back!

{"text":"This is my 2nd time here... the first time I ordered@the bar ... 24 hours!  Awesome angus burgers.  Right now I'm @the restaraunt.  You order upfront with the hostess.  You get a number just like @ fatburgers.  You walk up to the drink concession and help yourself.  The waitress brings you your order.... awesome food and service!!!  Ok this is an edited review now and I was happened to be approached by the manager who asked to make sure everything was going ok... wow awesome service... will come again!!!  Sorry I should have been the first to post this review but it didn't post and was still in draft... Ok now this is my 3rd time here and I just discovered they have deep fried twinkies and oreos... OMFG!  Jim and the waitress Tedra was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! It's open until 10 PM for seating and 24 hrs for food from the bar. Service is rather quick. Employees are nice and it's typically not packed. You even seat yourselves!

I really like their boneless wings, but their burgers are good too. They have some cool desserts here (e.g. deep fried Twinkies), but I haven't tried any of them. They have a small selection of breakfast items as well. Did I mention drinks are refillable and that you refill them yourself? No more getting mad at your waiter/waitress for never coming to refill your drink.
 
The best part is that the food is super affordable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Wildburger after finding a Groupon NOW! deal. The groupon was $10 for $20 worth of food. 

Orders are put in at a counter and then you are sent to a table with a number to signify your order number. My boyfriend and I both ordered burgers with fries and we ordered a basket of onion strings on the side to share. 

Service-Great, enjoyed conversation with the cashier and the waitress was friendly and on top of things

Price-Pretty amazing with the groupon. I paid $10 for the groupon and then $4.25 cash for remainder with tip. So, $14.25 total (pretty much the same as any fast food burger chain) but enjoyed a much higher quality meal. 

Food- Excellent for the price. I had the WILDBURGER and it was delicious. The bun is outstanding and the toppings were fresh and abundant.


I am definitely excited to return for some WINGS and chili."}
{"text":"The food was quite good, but honestly - when your order is two burgers & fries (and the rather amazing homemade ding dong) and you're the only customers, waiting 30-40 mins for your food seems rather insane. Would give them one more shot, but the food is not that gourmet (or just good in general) to warrant such an excessive wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place Burger was good and so were wings!
The cashier/ waitress was awesome very friendly. 
We also had the deep fried Twinkies they tasted like funnel cake. Very good!"}
{"text":"they got a new sous chef by the name of Suzzane very bad customer service i come here at least once a week and thanks to her we wont be back and nobody else i know she basically challenged me to a fight over a oder of pancakes that they messed up only reason i put 2 stars is because of the manager Allen who happens to be a sweetheart and im happy she did what she did in front of  him"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.

We got a Groupon for this place and decided to give it a try.  We like the atmosphere and all the choices.  The service is very nice and they go above and beyond to explain the many options and give recommendations.  I like that there are hand wipes on the table and plenty of napkins.  Good iced tea and convenient self-serve drink refill station.

Be aware that, when requesting doneness, they tend to cook it a little more than you ask.  The onion strings and the ranch dressing didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"This was my second visit because we had a coupon.  This Wild Burger was located in the Wildfire Casino on S Rancho Dr in Las Vegas.

My friends still rave about their Classic Cheeseburger.  It wasn't anything special.  The onion strings were not freshly fried.

We ordered one burger to go and we told them to bring it out in 15 minutes.  They brought it out within 5 minutes and it just sat there on our table as we finished our burgers.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The girl who took our order was all about doing as little as humanly possible, but aside from that everything was good.

My husband and I split a classic cheeseburger. I'm a little biased...they use Tillamook cheese (which I love).

The star of the show, though, was the \"To Die For Desserts\". They have ice cream shakes, deep fried Twinkies, and house made Ding Dongs. We split the Ding Dong and it was fabulous. We both said afterwards that we'd go back just for that!! Shakes are $3 & the other 2 are $5/ea. Well worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Saw a review in the SEVEN Magazine, so we went.  Good decision because the burgers were 9 out of 10.  We were luck because no one was behind us.  Being first-timers, the cashier took her time in explaining the ordering process.  Having choices of bread, toppings, etc is great.  We didn't care if we paid upfront, big deal.  The place is small, but very clean.  The waitress passed us and said service would be slow because they were short of staff (someone didn't show up for work).  BUT our food came out fast and hot.  The burgers were made the way we wanted and were GREAT.   The casino is small, but the Wild Burger really rocks.  Then why not 10 out of 10.  They can not compete with Bachi Burger or BLT, but they are in a different category.  We will be going back with a better idea of what to order."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to disclaim that my to-go order took a tad over 30 mins. Normally, I'd complain about that, but the NBA game was on and the repeat of the Ben Henderson UFC fight was playing, so it's all good.

The burger chain is a pretty damn good deal even without a groupon. For a burger and seasoned fries, you're looking at $7. Not bad at all. I got the grilled chicken breast with cheddar, bacon, and a fried egg, along with the usual lettuce/pickles/tomato. The sandwich was awesome. Great flavor! I almost unhinged my jaw as swilled it whole.

My coleslaw was a bit ordinary, but that is how I like it. Green cabbage and slaw sauce binding it together. Nothing funky.

My wife got the burger and seasoned fries. The party was pretty good as well. A medium was cooked all the way through, not tough though. The fries were fresh, but a little too salty for me. 

Oh snap, we got wings too! I thought they were excellent. Not skimpy and not dripping with sauce. For 8 wings with celery and ranch, I want to say it was $6. Not too bad of a deal, to be honest.

All in all, I'll definite go back. The groupon makes the decision that much more simple. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Never would have thought to go here but my friend had a $20 for $10 Groupon. We both got a sandwich, side, and drink and it was almost $20. However on the way out I saw a sign (far away) that said they had a $4.99 lunch deal. Sneaky!
I got a grilled chicken breast on the signature brioche bun with gruyere cheese and the toasted bun was AMAZING! Pickle planks were good too. The french fries were fantastic and I got garlic ketchup which was really good and the fried onion strings were excellent too. They have a good drink selection and before we left they gave us to-go cups so we could take refills with us. Staff is friendly. Only complaint is it took a long time for us to get our food. The decor is trendy looking. I also noticed they serve breakfast till 1pm and have made from scratch ding dongs! I definitely will be back, just might get my order to go on my short lunch break. You get a lot of food and did I mention the toasted brioche bun was AMAZING?!"}
{"text":"Horrible place!! The customer service is horrible!! They took 10 minutes for me standings there  so they lady tells me what do u want..lol and when I order my food she did a face like if im ordering a dead body or something! Horrible place to go!"}
{"text":"Wild Burger sells a GREAT burger at a very INEXPENSIVE price!  4 stars for the food...5 stars for the VALUE :)

Sure, you can find better ones in town, but under the $8 mark with fries, this is about as GOOD as it gets!  

BBQ Bacon Burger ($7.99): Cheddar Cheese, BBQ Sauce, and Crispy Onion Straws. This was a solid burger at a great price! Very juicy, cooked perfectly MR, and there is a lot of flavor in the toppings!  I enjoyed each bite :)

They also have a 1/4lb special with fries for $2.99 (w/players card)! It's probably a basic burger/fry, but if the patty is the same as above, it'll be a great burger at a ridiculous price!  It's probably free to sign up like everywhere else in town...might give it a go next visit :D

I was also lookin for those deep fried twinkies everyone else is talkin about, but didn't notice them on the menu.  Guess I will ask about them next time :(

Either way, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  $10 for $20 coupon thanks to using the Player's card.  (score!)

Got 2 \"make your own burgers\" with a side of fries and water.  It's a 1/2 lb Angus burger and you can choose which cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, pepperjack, etc), toppings ($1 extra, include bacon, fried egg, coleslaw, etc) and bread (brioche all the way) you want.  The burgers come with fries or onion strings. 

DO NOT GET THE ONION STRINGS.  THEY WERE NOT GOOD. Honestly, the fries aren't that good either but when you're paying 50% your meal, the fries will do.  

The burgers on the other hand were delicious.  Tackling the first bite is tough because the burger is like 4 inches tall.  They also have bottled beer for sale. 

I will keep coming here as long as I get the coupons in the mail.  Other than that, Wild Burger is not good enough for me to go out of my way and eat here.  I'd rather go to Fat Burger or even In-N-Out...it's cheaper and more convenient. 

And side note: the casino needs better ventilation because gawd it smells like smoke so bad...notably the worse smelling casino I've been to.  And I've been to that small one with Ellis Island near the strip which didn't smell nearly as bad."}
{"text":"So I visited another Wildfire Casino, this one on N. Rancho Drive, which meant there is another WildBurger location to try out.  After visit two locations now, both appeared to share similar interior design implementation.  It is a casual local casino diner serving burgers, hotdogs, wings, and breakfast items, but looks pretty new and clean.

Last time I was at a WildBurger, I tried their WildBurger so I thought I try out their other signature burgers at this location.  That meant ordering The Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich and The Cajun Turkey Burger.  Both were good, but the clear winner was definitely The Cajun Turkey Burger (tasted better and not as heavy).

The Fried Onion String was also a lot better here than the one I tried before, and I killed it all this time around, instead of leaving most of it on the plate.

The Honey Garlic Boneless Wings had great flavor, was not spicy at all (for a medium), but it is made with cut up chicken breast pieces.  Even though it was fried perfectly and is moist inside, I think I will stick to the real chicken wings next time.

4 stars for good food at a reasonable price, friendly service in a clean casino diner that does not overly reek of cigarette smoke.  Plus there was no line to wait in to be seated or to place an order on my visit.

Oh yeah, in another month or so, they will expand their menu at all locations.  So will be interesting to see what else they cook up for the new menu."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago I would have given them 4 stars.  But they just changed their menu and got rid of the veggie burgers which is one of the reasons we came here. However, their hamburgers are still delicious. Service has always been slow. Average wait after ordering is about 20 min.    I think they have one cook and he cooks one thing at a time."}
