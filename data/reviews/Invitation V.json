{"text":"The Valentine's day special menu was overly seasoned, there was too much salt in most of the dishes. The service was slow even though they knew they were going to be full house on Valentine's day. It took the waiter 20 minutes to bring us a bottle of wine with two glasses. I was very unimpressed, the evening wasn't worth the 200$ (for two) we spent there."}
{"text":"A new fav!  Yummy, innovative vegan food in a beautiful space in central Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. And don't get held back by the vegan personality of this restaurant. The menu is very interesting. You will find yourself with hard choices to make, as many dishes will stimulate your tastebuds! And what to say about the triple chocolate mini cakes...absolutely scrumptious. If you're lucky, one of the owners, David, will be there. Be sure to stop and say hello...he is absolutely adorable!"}
{"text":"I live in BC and was visiting family in Montreal.  Due to allergies and other complicated health issues, I follow a vegan gluten free diet...again not by choice. This restaurant is completely vegan and has many gluten free options! It comes highly recommended for s nice bistro evening. Even my husband who is definitely a meat and potatoes kind of guys, really enjoyed his food  I will be going back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"I'm vegetarian with vegan leanings and I was so excited when this popped up a block from my house. The decor is beautiful and the service friendly, but the brunch was just...bland. Uninspired food that was wayy too expensive. A quinoa salad is an expected vegetarian option at a non-veg restaurant, but at a vegan place you'd expect more creativity!

Aside from the blandness of the food, the menu wasn't all descriptive. The \"veggie burger\" is a really heavy deep friend chickpea patty, the hash browns are actually a nest of crispy potatoes with a soft potato inside (these were actually pretty good). But again, the whole meal lacked seasoning and as a result we all left - $20+/each later - feeling unsatisfied. Hopefully the dinner menu is better!"}
{"text":"I've been to my share of vegan restaurants, and this one was the most unimpressive of all.
Exorbitant prices for the run of the mill and bland food you get in return."}
{"text":"best fries in the galaxy
the cheesecake will blow your mind
the cocktail menu is unique and interesting
amazing service, nice ambiance, I'm definitely a fan"}
{"text":"Great experience. The meal began with complimentary savoury potato pancakes and a shot of a refreshing veggie juice. The appetizer salads and soups were delicious, and the main courses great - in particular the hot pot, which was a show-stopper. Very friendly service and prices average for the area."}
{"text":"Just had brunch here and the food was absolutely delish. I had the asparagus omelette with hashbrowns, the flavors were great and the texture of the \"omelette\" was perfect.  

My friend was also very pleased with the quiche.  The side salad that came with the quiche was also very good... A fairly large portion for a side salad.  

The staff were super friendly and attentive as well... We will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Amazing is all I can say! Bravo to the chef for such a delicious exquisite and diverse menu! My husband and I spent the weekend in Montreal and had dinner and brunch here as well. It was incredible. Most memorable vegan meal in a long time. We are from nyc where there are many vegan restaurants to choose from. However, none like this one. Thank you for the delicious meals and wonderful friendly staff. An all time favorite! We will come back for sure!!

Please do yourself a favor and try the mango creme brûlée! Wow"}
{"text":"Last Tuesday, we were honored to be part of their new menu tasting event carefully concocted by Chef Kelvin Au-Leong.
To be honest, my favourite main course of their new menu was the creamy curry. The right mixture of flavours and spices was clearly present and the creaminess of the sauce was top notch!
Completely full from food and joyfully tipsy from the many glasses of white wine, I got home more than happy about my discovery and was telling myself that Invitation V had definitely made it on my list of my most loved restaurants in town.

{"text":"Mediocre and so over priced. We were 4 people and our bill was $200...for Vegan. I repeat, vegan. Not worth it, at all."}
{"text":"The food here is good and vegan which is a nice start however their service is negligent at best. When a friend and I went here for a special occasion we specified our allergies. When the food arrived it was discreetly riddled with the specified allergen which caused for a semi serious allergic reaction. When leaving they requested that we pay full price for what was ordered.

After some calls we were given a guarantee of a complimentary meal. We even called in advance the day before going to make sure it was still good to which we were told 'of course'. When we went the next day we were told that this was not the case and in fact the chef refused to serve us due to fear of cross contamination. We were then apologized to by the person who told is earlier that all was set and he simply stated that there was nothing he could do.

It is hard enough finding good vegan food, but to be turned away by one of the few who offer is greatly upsetting, let alone the poor attitude they had toward the mistake that they made."}
{"text":"Well I was disappointing to say the least. The food tasted good but it was food I could very well make at home-not like what I saw on their web-site. I asked for the dumplings in the afternoon and they said it was on the dinner menu. There wasn't a large selection of items to choose from. The music in the restaurant was loud and obnoxious-I was trying to relax and eat...It was right next to the street with the big windows open so you can also hear traffic.It was more expensive then I thought it would be. I told the waitress I avoid cane sugar and she brings me something with cane sugar in it.
It was annoying that all the desert had cane sugar in it.Could they at least use agave syrup or coconut sugar-how hard would that be?Course they take the safe easy route as most businesses do and use the cheapest sweetener.
I liked the seating though-nice comfortable benches."}
{"text":"The hot plate is worth the trip. 
Nice to eat out of and taste amazing! 
The kale chocolate cake is one of the best treats I've had. 
Classy and elegant vegan restaurant. 
Nice to come on a date or for longer meet ups."}
{"text":"À la recherche d'un restaurant Vegan sûr, les avis portaient sur ce bistro. Le décor est sympa, l'ambiance est plus chic que Bistro, le service un peu lent. Nous avons aimé la présentation et l'agencement des plats, seulement les portions étaient trop petite pour nous satisfaire complètement. Les recettes sont originales, le boeuf bourguignon revisité, les boulettes de Shiitake sont un délice, mais les brochettes de Satay (tempeh) nous ont laissées sur notre faim, le burger de pois chiche, malheureusement trop sec. Si le prix n'avait pas été aussi élevé, j'aurais revue ma note finale."}
{"text":"Really delicious vegan food - the shiitake sausage with cranberry sauce is to live for. Kind service, elegant setting and great location. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant hit the spot!  The garbanzo soup was heavenly, the vermicelli noodles delicious, and the hot pot divine. And don't forget dessert: mango creme brûlée was our favorite."}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan of Invitation V. My parents rarely visit me in Montreal, but when they do, they ask to go to Invitation V for a brunch or dinner. Today marked my last visit to this restaurant, breaking the loving TWO-YEAR relationship with this place. I will never ever visit Invitation V again.

Today we ordered omelette and two salads, none of them represented what the food was like. My mom ordered the tofu omelette, which was bland and tasted like uncooked dough warmed up in the microwave. The dish was drowning in the sauce to the point my mother did not finish the plate. She ate the fruits on the side and was left hungry. I had the kale salad, which was drowning in a vinaigrette dressing. Besides, the salad was nothing special - I do not believe that kale, radish and tomatoes alone deserve my $11. I could not finish a half of my plate either.

We asked the server whether the chef changed, she replied no. We politely asked for the bill, paid $65 something for the food that left us hungry and began to quietly leave the restaurant. This is where the story begins.

Before leaving Invitation V, I was stopped by the server. She held the credit card receipt from our payment and said we did not leave tips. I felt puzzled, but I replied that we did not enjoy food and, thus, did not leave tips. The server replied: \"You have to leave 15% minimum. It is by law in Quebec.\" WHAT THE HELL ON EARTH IS THIS!? I know I speak English, so I may not look like a local, but this is pure bull shit. She DEMANDED TIPS from me. 

Instead of arguing with stupidity, I assured the server that I also work in restaurant industry here in Quebec, I have never heard of this law. She replied that she will have to pay my bill to the restaurant because we did not leave tips. I advised her to find another job. 

Apparently, anything said before did not count for this lady. She came up with another way to make me pay the tip. She said we need to pay for the service, not the quality of the food. Again, my only response is that we did not like either of those two and will not pay the tip. If you remember, when she served us, we told we did not like food so she could take away our plates. The lady only shrugged, left us in silence, and did not even offer us to talk to the chef. 

Her final sentence was the \"by law in Quebec 15%\" bullshit, so I told her she either lets me leave the restaurant or I call the police. She let me go.

An advice to management - start paying your employees real wages and include that into the price of the food we pay for. It costs us, customers, the same price minus the embarrassment you put yourself into. An advice to the server lady - get your shit together and find another job."}
{"text":"When we arrived at Invitation V, we were impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. We inquired about which dishes on the menu were gluten-free (they were labeled on the website, but not on the menu). The manager pointed out the ones which were gluten-free and so we ordered away. The wine list is not long, but adequate since I don't think this is a place where one would be coming for the booze anyhow.

We had the dumplings, shiitake mushroom balls, sweet potato fries and tempeh skewers to start. I would recommend the shiitake and tempeh to other diners but the dumplings were a bit charred and salty. The fries were okay, but nothing really to write home about.

Mains consisted of the Hot Pot tray and the tofu bourguignon. I was quite disappointed with the Hot Pot. First, it was extremely small. It had just one cube of fried tofu, a small bundle of mushrooms and some carrots. Secondly, the broth was way too sweet, like maybe too much mirin or something of that sort. The sticky rice that came with it was good though, but when the focal point was supposed to be the hot pot, I was not satisfied.

The bourguignon was good, one that I could recommend. Sauce was on point and not too salty, with enough chickpeas, tofu and carrots to satiate someone. Mashed potatoes were good as well.

Dessert was the peach cheesecake and it was a bit of a mess taste wise. Too sweet, the base layer had none of the crumble that one is used to for a cheesecake and unless I told you what it was, you wouldn't have guessed it was trying to be a cheesecake.

There are better vegan options out there in Montreal, perhaps some finetuning of the menu might help."}
{"text":"Creative Vegan Bistro In Town!

You can surely taste true original creation by Chef Kelvin.  Vegan always give people an impression of \"Raw, Green Veggie Taste, Bland....\" But Invitation V brings Vegan style to the next level, a taste that never been introduced. 

The modern decor gives me a sense of peace and \"Invite\" me into the magical experience of chef Kelvin's original Vegan style.  

The \"Santé\" juice refreshed my taste bud and getting them ready to taste the amazing dishes.

For starter dish, I like the \"Spring Flower with Organic Greens\".  Crispy nest filled with thinly sliced mushroom, carrot and  bamboo shoots sitting on a bed of organic green, refreshing!  The peanut tahini sauce for the homemade satay is exception!

For main dish, I like the pizza, the risotto as well as the Hot Pot!   The pizza dough is freshly rolled everyday by the chef.  All veggies are so fresh and tasty.  Mushroom and Kale Risotto, my favorite dish! Chef uses creamy coconut to substitute the butter to give a true risotto feel. The crispy kale has added another texture to the sticky rice.  Speaking of sticky rice, the side dish of Hot Pot is special Sticky Rice topped with exotic peanut sauce, very tasty. The tofu in the Hot Pot is sooooooo smooth!

Oh my my, so difficult to decide which one to choose..... Both the Black Pearl (Sesame pudding with Tahiti Vanilla) and  Kale Chocolate cake taste soooooo good! The black pearl is so smooth with strong black sesame taste.  Highly recommend to try.   Gosh, the kale cake.... Did I mention kale cake?!? It is blended well with the dark chocolate.  Soooo well prepared!

The staffs and the manager are so friendly and I feel very welcome. They are very customer oriented and they work as a team!  The jazzy music background blends well with the new Vegan Style.  The friendly environment and the tasty food will definitely bring me back to try out their full menu."}
{"text":"For all those non vegetarians I know that vegan cuisine can seem overwhelming at times... sometimes there can be too many flavours at once... invitation V is a chique vegan restaurant, great food, great variety and well plated. I went with a group of 3, we all got different plates, each one presented in its own unique way. A little on the pricey side, but a great place for an evening out with a vegan friend;)"}
{"text":"Well, to start, the service was very friendly but the restaurant was nearly full and with only one person working the dining room even simple things lagged (water.)

My app was delicious, the hummus and bread, but for a main I had the cajun uncrab cakes. All I can really say about them is meh. The outside was crispy, but the inside was largely I unseasoned and a strange mush. The greens that came with were bitter and didn't go with the meal at all. The Cajun rice wasn't reminiscent of any Cajun rice I've ever had and tastes more like mushy risotto.

One of my companions had their risotto as well and left more than half of it.

The rest of the table enjoyed there meals, but I don't think I'd come back for the existing menu.

The prices were very high for what they offered as well."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here over three consecutive nights while visiting Montreal for work. The location at the edge of the Old Town was a very short distance from my accommodations and the Palais des congrès de Montréal where my meetings were - so a great location for convention goers - come out of the Palais onto Rue Saint-Antoine Ouest, cross that road and it's one short block up Rue Saint-François-Xavier.

The food was just perfect - one the first night I had a \"sausage\" dish with purees, chickpeas and vegetables and one the second and third night I had \"Butter Chicken\" which was a tofu dish where the tofu was lightly seasoned and flash fried to create a case and texture that was just perfect. The curry-like sauce covered some lovely fresh vegetables and it was served with rice. I also had the butter lettuce starter which was just full of flavors - I could eat that salad forever it was so interesting. The food was light and fresh which is so hard to get when traveling on business and tight for time.

The service was very friendly - important when one is dining alone. 

I just wish I had left room for dessert! Maybe when I return sometime."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner here while visiting Montreal. Service was friendly and quick. My husband greatly enjoyed his Vietnamese bowl and my butter chicken was outstanding. The vegetables were cooked just right and the tofu was fried to perfection. We are sad we won't have a chance to come back until we are in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Just walked in on a sunday afternon
Had the salad and a burger both were excellent. Service was very good. Recommended"}
{"text":"I visited here about two weeks ago with my son while attending the Canadian Formula 1 Grand Prix.  We had no problem walking in and getting a table.  The decor is pleasant, and the service was excellent.  The food however was nothing to write home about.  Maybe because my 30 year-old son has been a vegetarian since birth, and I've been one for over 40 years, but I must say we found the food we ordered to be somewhat so-so.  We shared an appetizer of artichokes that were somehow battered and fried.  I thought they were pretty good, but my son (who loves artichokes) passed.  My entree was decent, but again not very memorable.  The hot pot was good at first, but as the heat continued to boil away the stock, the dish became a bit bitter.  I would have put out the flame, but there was no way to do so.   We passed on desserts.  All in all, for the amount of money we spent, I would have expected a bit more creativity."}
{"text":"Finding a vegan bistro as creative as Invitation V is hard. A lot of the vegan restos in MTL become repetitive and fast. 

Invitation V switches it up a little bit; from the recipes to the presentation it is all unique. 

I ordered the hot pot which was a miso soup with veggies and tofu. I'm talking about NICE & BIG pieces of tofu. No small square cubes here. It was served with a creamy coconut Tamale topped with exotic peanut sauce wrapped in a banana leaf. The waitress suggested I put some of the Tamale in my soup to give it a sweet taste. I did just that and it was delicious! The presentation of my dish was impressive too. My soup came in a big bowl with a little heater under it to keep the soup warm. A smaller bowl was presented to me on my tray as well. I transferred the soup from bowl to bowl. It was fun! I'll post a picture so you could get a better visual idea. 

For dessert I ordered the tiramisu. MY GOD was it ever amazing! It tasted better than the real thing...and to think it's vegan and 100% guilt free. The caramel pecan sauce that they put on it was rich and creamy and a absolute delight. If I would be in the area I'd go in just for this dessert. I have an insane sweet tooth and this tiramisu left me happy and satisfied. 

The decor was nice too, quite modern. The seating was super comfortable."}
{"text":"Their brunch comes highly recommended! Very lovely, comfy restaurant with consistently wonderful service. The dinners are less impressive and lack creativity - I mean where can't I go and get curry as a vegetarian? The presentation is appreciated and so is the fact they are trying (perhaps stumbling?) to push vegan food forward."}
{"text":"Etant végétarienne, je ne refuse pas l'occasion de tester une nouvelle place dédiée au végétalisme !
A deux, nous nous sommes partagé 3 assiettes (2 petits tapas et 1 pizza) :
\"artichaut d'or légèrement frit servi sur un lit de verdure\" c'était très bon et fin, un goût de trop peu !
\"savoureux satays maison et sa sauce exotique aux arachides\" : un peu prétentieux comme description !? je me suis laissée tenter mais ce n'était pas du tout savoureux à mon goût, je n'ai pas aimé la texture qui me rappelaient comme du foie, mais la sauce était très bonne.
\"légumes biologiques servis sur notre pâte à pizza maison\" + supplément de fromage vegan : c'est là que cela s'est gâté, il y avait un goût très étrange, comme si il y avait du parfum sur la pizza, nous avons pensé que c'était ce fameux fromage vegan que nous goutions pour la première fois... sinon, rien à redire sur la pâte et les légumes.

Heureusement, le dessert a su ravir mes papilles sucrées !! J'ai pris le \"gâteau au kale et chocolat en fusion\", c'était plutôt compact mais gouteux, cela m'a rappelé le goût du matcha, et d'ailleurs le gâteau était vert à l'intérieur !

Je ne ressens pas l'envie d'y retourner, même si le service était très agréable, l'ambiance et la décoration assez classe..."}
{"text":"This is the best vegan food I have ever had. 
I am a sworn carnivore! Although I have been with a vegetarian partner for the better part of a decade, and tried numerous vegetarian dishes, I still can't believe how good the brunch at Invitation V is! When my girlfriend and our two vegetarian friends suggested this place, I looked at the menu and didn't really see anything I wanted to have. I decided to go with the flow, since they usually have a lot less options than I do when we go out to eat, and I thought they deserved to have their day in the sun... So we went and as I was seating there, nothing on the menu looked very enticing. The really nice and friendly waiter answered my questions patiently, and I ended up picking a breakfast tempeh sandwich with fries. The sandwich came in a burger bun and was one fresh and yumi sandwich!  Yet the best part was the fries - these are the best I have had anywhere - and I have really high standards for my fries! Our friends were quite happy with their meals, and the only one who didn't enjoy her's was my girlfriend who ordered the parfait with fruit and chia.  Now, I don't care for chia - it gives the dish a funky texture, but in spite of half the dish left uneaten, when the rest of us tried it, it slowly started to disappear until it was finished, although the consensus around the table was that it was the least successful dish on the table.  The coffee was excellent as well. I honestly don't know why we haven't been back there for another brunch - we really should."}
{"text":"Invitation V is probably the best place to have a laid back yet elegant vegan dinner in Montreal. The service is always fabulous and the fusion of flavours and cuisine is fantastic. My favourite dish which I've had many times is the \"crab\" cakes. Read more about them on my blog: http://mtlveg.com/2014/03/12/invitation-v-vegan-montreal/

Haven't tried their brunch yet but I really want to!"}
{"text":"Just tried this new vegan restaurant in Montreal near Mile End. Unlike other vegan or vegetarian restaurants that i have tried where the food might be a little bland, the dishes in this restaurant all look appealing to the eyes and tasty for the palate and taste buds. I started my meal with a healthy juice. For appetizer I had the butternut squash & roasted red pepper soup which is light and delicious. For starter I ordered the organic greens served on a yummy phyllo pastry with homemade satay. The special peanut tahini sauce was just tasty. For main courses, we had a vegetable pizza ( crunchy and flavorful), a 'creamy' mushroom barley risotto with sautéed kale and zucchini (my favorite dish!!), and the signature hot pot tray with tofu and organic vegetables. Remind me of the japanese sukiyaki. The hot pot dish also comes with a creamy coconut Tamale ( sticky rice) which is another must try. For dessert we had the tahini black pearl pudding and the kale and chocolate cake. Overall the service is great and the staff are quick, polite, and friendly. Great ambience and a welcoming environment. Will definitely come here again to try out the chef's new dishes."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service! I came with my family and I am there weekly. I spend a lot of money at invitation v and now I am very upset. I came with my family and my 8 month old. And I asked for a high chair and they gave me a broken high chair. And then tells me there is nothing they can do!!! Not happy about that! Maybe they should remove the self belts in their cars as well. I believe this violates some code of child safely. I am not happy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Déception totale!

Cuisine qui vous laisse sous une non satisfaction dû à sa combinaison flate des saveurs. Aucune explosion multidimensionnelle dans la bouche. C'est la cuisine végé d'il y a 20 ans...la cuisine qui fait que ls non-végé trouvent ça plate ou au goût de carton.

leurs frites sont géniales cependant!

Superbe décor  et belles présentations cependant.

Dommage!"}
{"text":"Un nouveau bistro végétalien à Montréal! C'est beau et chic, et on y présente de la nourriture délicate et savoureuse. J'ai eu la chance de prendre part au souper de pré-ouverture, en y trainant une amie presque de force. Pas de viande? Pas de beurre, ni de vrai fromage? Comme plusieurs personnes, elle était très craintive face à la nourriture végétalienne.. mais ce soir là elle a changé d'avis ! On nous accueille avec une fabuleuse baguette de Chez Guillaume, puis vient l'entrée. Le satay sauce arachide était à couper le souffle et la fleur de printemps était rafraichissante et débordait de saveurs. Comme plat principal, j'ai choisi le veggie burger avec frites de patates douces, et mon amie a pris la pizza. Le burger était assez ordinaire (le chef est venu nous jaser après le souper et m'a dit qu'il était entrain d'améliorer sa recette), mais les frites, OH LES FRITES. Je pense que je peux dire que des frites de patates douces j'en ai mangé des tonnes dans ma vie, et celles là les surpassaient toutes. Délicieusement assaisonnées de muscade, cannelle, un peu de 5 épices et de sel, l'équilibre était parfait. Un 2$ d'extra extrêmement bien investi. La pizza de mon amie était divine elle aussi, rien à redire.

Le seul point faible de la soirée, c'est qu'il ne restait plus de dessert ! On nous a offert du thé ou un smoothie en compensation; c'était encore une fois délicieux. Une belle sélection de vins abordables, très beau décor relax, personnel charmant; j'ai hâte d'y retourner pour finalement gouter au dessert! Et dire que mon amie avait peur de s'ennuyer de sa viande..."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty and was glad to find a vegan spot near the palais de congrès! Chickpea burger was alright but nothing special. Service was good. They had difficulty with their credit card machine when I was there though."}
{"text":"Great menu choices! I am not a vegetarian, but I like to eat healthy and fresh with more plant options. I Yelp searched for vegetarian restaurants and InvitationV never came up, even though I was only a block away. Luckily I stuck my head in while on my way to another place. The other place was closed, so I came back to InvitationV and glad I did! I thought at first it was more of a cafe but the menu is more vegan gourmand. Incredible concoctions and pairings! Interesting wine choices instead of the same old commercial choices. Service was polite, efficient, and amazingly fast. I had been sick so desperately needed healthy food. Instead just a soup, like I hoped to find, there were so many interesting menu choices, both small plates and mains, that I had a hard time deciding. I went with the taro root roll and it was insane for how it was conceived and prepared. Greatly enjoyed the thought and care that went into the dish. It was quite filling but I couldn't deny myself the almond paste cheesecake and neither should you. It did not taste exactly like cheesecake- not as sweet/tangy but good enough to stand on its own. 
So glad I found this place (no thanks to Yelp). I leave tomorrow but might return just to try something else healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"Technically 4.5 stars. 
My vegan friend and to visit so we decided to come here. I had the mushroom burger (without pesto, because I don't like pesto) and it was AMAZINGGGGG. It was really hearty but also refreshing. The salad had the most evenly spread dressing I've ever experienced. The fries were also fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only complaint is that the fries were too salty. I also had a bite of my friend's mushroom sausage and butter chicken tofu and those were both excellent. 

The decor in this restaurant is beautiful too! I came at around 5PM and we were seated immediately. Service was good as well. 

Overall a really great place and I will definitely definitely definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"From the fantastic service to drink to food this restaurant does not miss a beat. 100% legit. Best service, best food, best drink I've ever had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here tonight! I was so happy to find a delicious, good-looking but casual vegan restaurant in Old Montreal! The service was great, I really appreciated our server's frankness about dishes he loved, and because of his advice I switched up my order and was so happy with what I ate! And so was my date! The vegan sausage was nutty and rich with awesome gravy and roast veg and lovely crispy chickpeas. It was a balanced meal with tons of protein, perfect meal size, super savoury and delicious. 

I found dinner reasonably priced for the area, really dug the look and vibe, will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary service and food! Our server was amazing and we were pleased with her overall friendliness. The menu is not conventional vegan fare which was reassuring. We were surprised when we received free spring rolls for making reservations. At the conclusion of our meal, we met the owner and thanked him for such a lovely experience. We attended six vegan restaurants in Montreal and this was by far the most chic with the best wine list."}
{"text":"Went to Invitation V last night and it did not disappoint. Best vegan restaurant I've ever been to! The drink on special I think it was called a bengal tiger was similar to a mimosa, loved it. The mushroom burger was rich in flavor. The french fries were over salted. The mushroom casserole with butternut squash was also delicious, but lacked a strong flavor. The waffles on the side seemed a bit strange, but add to the overall flavor nicely. I had a great experience and will come back next time I'm in Montréal!"}
{"text":"Other than one mediocre tempeh satay appetizer, everything we ordered was excellent. The chickpea soup was bursting with flavour. I'm not usually a fan of imitation meat, but the fish filet dish was delicious. High points for presentation too."}
{"text":"The best vegan  dessert of my life! The service was a bit rushed and the food is slightly overpriced. BUT the food tastes good and the dessert is out of this world. I've gone back (even if to just get a taste of their fruit fish again)"}
{"text":"Is there anything to say about Invitation V other than you have to go right now and taste their delicious, imaginative, exploding with flavor vegan food?
No. Just go. Right now."}
{"text":"Perfect food. We have tried burgers and it was perfect. Good to hangout with friends.
The waiters were very friendly. In a perfect location. 
I will definitely recommend this place.
Prices are a bit high but it worth.
One of the best vegan restaurant s that I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Je n'ai que du positif à dire sur Invitation V. Comme je l'ai écrit récemment dans ma review pour LOV (un restaurant quasiment 100% vegan qui vient d'ouvrir dans le Vieux-Montréal), l'offre d'établissements végétaliens un peu plus \"fancy\" est encore assez limitée à Montréal. Comme LOV, Invitation V vient combler ce vide! Les plats proposés sont créatifs et le personnel porte une attention particulière la présentation des plats. Les prix, même s'ils sont légèrement plus élevés que les Aux Vivres et Crudessence de ce monde, sont amplement justifiés: les quantités servies sont satisfaisantes et, surtout, la qualité des ingrédients fait une grande différence. À noter que plus de 80% de la nourriture du restaurant est certifiée organique. Le menu n'est pas gigantesque mais contient assez d'options (burger, risotto, filet végétalien, etc.) qui devraient convenir à tous les goûts. En plus du menu disponible sur le site web, des spéciaux de la semaine/du jour sont également proposés au gré des produits disponibles pendant les saisons. Une grande sélection de bières est également proposée: on retrouve même de la bière biologique au quinoa! Les desserts, tous vegan également, sont à tomber par terre (surtout la tarte à l'amande avec \"fromage\" de noix de cajou)! J'ai aussi beaucoup apprécié la sympathie du personnel et la qualité du service. Petites parenthèses: il y a aussi un vestiaire pour laisser votre manteau, votre écharpe, etc. Pensez à le demande à votre serveur. Bref, avec La Lumière du Mile-End qui se situe à seulement quelques pas, le quartier Mile-End peut être fier d'avoir 2 restaurants d'aussi bonne qualité aussi proches l'un que l'autre! Je recommande fortement Invitation V, autant pour des végétariens/végétaliens que pour un omnivore à la recherche de nouveaux horizons créatifs et définitivement santé."}
{"text":"J'ai pas tellement tripé. Pour de la bouffe végétalienne, j'ai vu mieux. Il me semble que l'ambiance était pas super décontracte et on était allés entre amis. Malgré qu'on ait fait une réservation, il y avait deux ou trois plats qu'on ne pouvait plus commander à notre heure d'arrivée.  Cela dit, le design intérieur et la présentation sont plutôt réussis.

Comme expérience, ça a été plutôt moyen. La bouffe était bonne cela dit, mais quand même un peu chère pour ce qu'on reçoit.

C'est pas mal, mais pas tout à fait un coup de cur."}
{"text":"The breakfast was worth coming back for. During dinner time Ask for the \"turkey meal\". Good stuff"}
{"text":"A new vegan spot to love in Montreal!

The focus is on being creative, so no faux chicken & waffles here, certainly a breath of fresh air. I'm not knocking the places that do vegan comfort food, but they seem to be the rule rather than the exception these days and sometimes a vegan wants something a bit more delicate, something to tantalize the taste buds, leaving one pleasantly satisfied, rather than in a food coma.

The restaurant is open and airy, tons of natural light coming in from the large windows (people watching!), and an approachable yet elegant decor. It's very comfortable, with exposed beams, brick and natural wood. I cherished the vibe and feel it could be a great date spot as well!

Our server was extremely pleasant and knowledgable about the menu. He was opinionated in a non pushy way and helped steer us in the right direction of the restaurant's best offerings. I stared with a creamy potage de champignons, simply delectable. Perfection in a soup! Umami explosion! I could have ordered a second bowl. I followed that with the taro and yuba roll with celery root puree & maple roasted carrots. I'm a little obsessed with all things yuba and this was an interesting creation, thin sheets of tofu skin wrapped around considerable portions of smashed yuba. I think it needed a bit more spice/flavoring, perhaps more yuba and less taro, as the taro kind of overwhelmed everything. That said, it was certainly one of the more inspired vegan dishes that I've had in a long time and bravo to Invitation V for taking risks with food!

We were too full for dessert, but I expect to return soon and indulge. Love this place after one visit and I suspect that I'll love it forever."}
{"text":"One of the best fine dining restaurants I have ever been to. Food is absolutely amazing. Weekends can get busy so make reservations. You could also eat at the bar. Hands down the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been to their previous location once a few yrs back and loved it. Stopped by Montreal this time for 3 hrs on an extremely cold day, my friend and I decided to visit their new location in downtown Montreal. The new location is definitely bigger with warm decor and attentive servers. Ample space between tables. Innovative and delish menu items - wish I was here for dinner to try more of them!

They also have muffins, wraps and salads to go but we're too full"}
{"text":"4 etoiles pour la deco et le service , la bouffe bonne aussi mais les frites à 4$ salés et quantité reduite ... parcontre la vinagrette de la salade delicieuse donc je vous recommende de skiper les frites .."}
{"text":"Nous verrons après avoir mangé si le resto vaut 5 étoiles  mais à date c'est bien. Donnons une chance au coureur car ils viennent de déménager. Décor un peu froid à mon goût.   Beau menu très bons cocktails bon service souriant et courtois. Prix abordables environs 30$ par personne, beaux choix d'apéros. Musique pas trop forte c'est apprécié ! Beau menu même pour le brunch. Vin à 40$ la bouteille. Serviettes de table en tissu. Je reviendrai vois dire si c'était bon."}
