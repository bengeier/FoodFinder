{"text":"i love this place, i have never had anything that i wasnt totally loving. i hope this place never changes. food so good other italians will eat here. :) it has that past era feel."}
{"text":"$18.00 for a large one topping bland pizza. No flavor crust or dough. I will not try again. Way over priced, highly disappointed. Sauce is very plain, simple tomato sauce. BORING, pass if you aren't starving."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We had lunch here this past week. The wedding soup was the best I have ever tasted. I had an Italian hoagie and as I'm typing this I'm craving it so bad. It was made with Mancini twist bread so it was so yummy!! For dessert, I had the turtle cheesecake which was amazing!!! They had somebody bring that in but they made their own tiramisu which was also the best I've ever tasted. Very light. I'm home now and I'm so sad that I can't eat here now!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place and a hidden jewel in Westview. It may not seem like much on arrival but the food is dome of the best Italian to be found. They are consistent as well. After coming here countless times I have yet to experience a bad meal, or anything I would consider close to sub par.  The menu is priced fairly and the portions are on the larger side but not too much. The wait staff are always pleasant and the owner is usually walking around.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Before ordering I read a review comparing DiPietro's to the best pizza in NY or Chicago (and he's eaten his share). If Sabbaro's, Pizza Hut, & Domino's are your go to pizza places I might agree. In fairness, I will qualify this by noting we did not eat there but had it delivered. That said, we ordered wings & pizza & both were disappointing . The meat on the wings was tough, the breading mushy. The pizza was underdone period. The veggies were'nt cooked and the dough had no bite to it what so ever. To quote DJT (SAD!!)"}
{"text":"The reality is 5 service with 1 food ....sad really.  I still tipped the waitress as she did her job, that being said we paid $60 to leave with the question of why?     All done with local family restaurants."}
{"text":"DiPietro's is a favorite of my Aunt and Uncle so I've had the pleasure of many meals here over the past ten years or so.  Every time I've been the food, service and value is all great.  The stuffed shells are excellent with exceptionally flavorful cheese. The pizza is as good as any NY or Chicago pizza I've had (and I've had more than my share).  The veal parm is great and the zucchini appetizer is a \"specialty\" not to be missed. I'll be back in town this fall, and I'm already looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza! Been coming here for 40 years! Love it! Quiet place to eat or great for pick up! Dinners are really good too!"}
{"text":"Has always been a favorite for my entire family. Their pizza is the best in town.  We come here a decent amount for dinner as well and I've never really been disappointed. Pretty standard Italian fare, exceptional balsamic dressing for their salads, but I do feel it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"The plain cheese pie is the best traditional pie in this city, and it's very well priced.  I delivered products there for a few years, and would see them starting to cook their pizza sauce at 6am or so.  Very flavorful and fresh, definitely not from a can.    I've tried a few other things on the menu.  It's good food, but really too expensive and nothing compares to their plain old cheese pie."}
{"text":"Okay - I think I've found the achilles heel of DiPietro's - and that is the regular pasta in meat sauce. The linguine was coated in the red meat sauce, but it was not thick at all and hardly meaty. It's disappointing as dishes like their Chicken Marsala and the Chicken a la DiPietro are so very good."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  An old family style pizza shop with some added Italian menu options.   The pizza is good but not great.  We like the Sicilian style pizza but it isn't consistent - sometimes good, sometimes so-so."}
{"text":"One of our favorite mom and pop Italian restaurants. We especially love the carbonara and the Diavolo. Also, their wedding soup, house made Italian dressing, and fried cheese is excellent. Now I have to go there tomorrow just thinking about it :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of our local Friday after work pasta and wine chill spots. It's pretty reliable in terms of quality of service and food and we find ourselves there at least once a month.  We ended up there this past Friday and it was really crowded.  I guess a lot of folks were craving good pasta and pizza on a subzero February night.    We tend to stick to ordering the same things because we really like them but last night I tried something new. Personally, I love their pasta dish, Linguine Diavolo which has homemade sausage and peppers and onions tossed with marinara.  So darned good!  Their Shrimp Scampi over Linguine is pretty darned good too if I'm in the mood for a lot of butter.  But tonight, I wanted something lighter so I tried their Chicken Piccata.    The dish is served with your choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta or veggie.  I love their homemade Italian dressing so I always get their salad and sop up the remaining dressing on my plate with the fresh Mancini's Italian bread they serve.  I ordered the side of pasta and substituted angel hair for the penne.  The price is around $17 which is not bad when you get bread, soup/salad and a side of pasta or vegetable. I'm not sure what people expect when they say they think DiPietro's is expensive - maybe they mean their pizza which can be a little on the pricier side.    The Piccata is served with fresh thick cut mushrooms and thin pounded chicken breasts with a delicate lemon wine sauce.  It was really delicious and could easily be two meals.  Yeah, maybe next time I'll save half.  The angel hair with marinara was perfectly sauced and tender and I found myself finishing off the last sauce with that addictive Mancini's bread.  Isn't it terrible?  Dipping bread into Italian dressing and marinara for dessert?  Since we had a friend with us, we ordered up a full carafe of the Bellagio Chianti to share and I must say, that is a nice amount of wine for the price - $31.99.  It's a full litre of wine and we ended up taking some home for a nice night cap."}
{"text":"It makes me sad that I have to give DiPietro's only 3 stars, but I'll explain why.   I'm not from the area where this restaurant is located and when my boyfriend wanted to come here for his birthday a little over a year ago, I really enjoyed this place. Very classy with the white table cloths and Italian decor, also the classy music. I'm one of those people that will order the same entrée every time I go out. And nothing turns me on more than getting some homemade fettuccine Alfredo from an Italian restaurant. The first time I had Alfredo from DiPietro's, it was absolutely fantastic. So cheesy and definitely homemade.   Unfortunately, my boyfriend went on a date night last night here, and I, of course, ordered the Alfredo, and I was completely disappointed. I could 100% tell that the Alfredo sauce was a pre-made powder sauce. You know, those packets of powder you can buy at the store to make quick Alfredo? That is definitely what it was. I've had more Alfredo than the average person and I'm pretty much an expert when it comes to perfecting it, and it was just awful. Pasta was not home made, and this fake sauce was drenching the pasta. The ratio was way off. Didn't have a cheesy or garlic flavor too it like previous times. And it just looked artificial. No butter, and no fresh grated Parmesan like before.   I've eaten here probably 4 or 5 times in my life and I've never been dissatisfied with the Alfredo until last night. Next time I'll have to order something different to get a decent idea of how all their food tastes. My boyfriend always orders the pizza and loves it however. He loves those big Sicilian pizzas, extra cheese and jalapeños every time. Last night he got a calzone, which he liked but said it was a bit doughy in the center. The sauce he ordered with it however was very nice. That was homemade for sure, which gives me hopes about this place.   I love Italian cuisine and it breaks my heart to see this restaurant start to head down hill. I definitely see room for improvement. Our waitress was extremely nice but took forever to check on our tables for refills and to take away dirty plates. It was exceptionally stressing because we were the only ones dining in.   And this may be odd but with how beautiful the restaurant is styled it was strange to me to see red pepper flakes on each table in those little McCormick spice containers. Seems to throw off how classy the place is.   Overall I give this place a 3. I really hope they improve their food and staff to get this place on track again, sitting in an empty restaurant at 8 at night on a Sunday breaks my heart inside. I keep hearing rumors around town that this place might close sometime soon and I'd hate to see that happen."}
{"text":"Cute little Italian place in west view! Nice for a date night. From the outside I never expected it to be as nice as it was on the inside. We went on a Sunday evening and we were the only couple there. Service was great. We both got different seafood pastas. They were not bad but not amazing. I would say the food was average."}
{"text":"A great homemade Italian restaurant menu. Delicious food. Serves alcohol.  Bring your family or date.  Has takeout. Street parking. A staple of West View Pa ."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in North Hills for a pizza night.  Our pizza came in a timely manner and was tasty (I could have had it a little more well done, but that is my preference and it usually only happens when you ask).  We ordered ranch because for some reason their ranch drips from the heavens, according to my friend who is a regular.  But to our dismay, NO RANCH.  We were disappointed, but it happens.    10 minutes later.... Our delivery guy came back with our ranch.  Big moves.  Big moves."}
{"text":"I ordered a small (8 cut) pizza for delivery on Saturday night. The service was kind and prompt, the pizza arrived sufficiently hot, and the end product was pretty tasty. I like that their pizza is a little saucier than most places. My only complaint is that they went too heavy on the cheese, but that's my personal preference."}
{"text":"I know, it just looks like a pizza joint from the outside, and their pizzas and hoagies are first-rate. But the real treasure is the quaint little Italian restaurant in back. When I want a good, home-cooked Italian dinner, there is no where else to go. Their menu has a nice variety from the basic spaghetti and meatballs (the meatballs are wonderful) to my favorite, Veal Romano. Fork tender breaded veal medallions in their signature marinara sauce, covered with eggplant with just the right amount of parmigiana cheese. Throw in a house salad, a bowl of wedding soup and the always present Mancini's bread and butter and I'm in heaven! The stuffed banana peppers or provolone saltimboco are also delicious appetizers. You have got to try the Steak Diavolo or the Fettuccine Carbonara (fair warning, the order is enough for two meals!) Those of you who have lived in the North Hills for the last 30 years probably already know of this gem, but for those that don't, please give DiPietro's a try. The service is great, no rush. It's a great place to have a bottle of red wine, great food, and reeeeeelax."}
{"text":"Their Boston Scrod Italiano is one of my  all time favorites. It is not smothered in cheese as some Italian fish entres are. Just Marinara sauce and some fresh spinach cooked in the sauce. With their nice side salad, a side of linguine, Italian bread and sharing a half carafe of their house Chianti - it gets no better!"}
{"text":"I was surprised when reading the negative reviews on this site- although I don't think they're the best restaurant ever, I had a very good meal there on 1/4/15, and the service was excellent.  I had Chicken Marsala- not cheap, but it was perfectly cooked with light/flavorful sauce and plenty of mushrooms.  Portion was large and I took leftovers home.  Can't complain at all!!  The salad could have had more ingredients but was very fresh.  I think the servers are knowledgeable so would recommend asking their advice when ordering.  Hoping others have good experiences too!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Over priced.  Did not honor Enjoy coupon for lunch. Coupon stated up to $6 off except on daily special items.   My friend and I ordered a steak salad and a small pizza. We were told it could not be used towards pizza. I said the coupon did not say pizza was restricted.   Waitress said owner won't let them use coupon toward pizza  orders.  Even though the pizza we ordered was more expensive than the salad we ordered."}
{"text":"So I don't even want to write a review on this place because I want to keep it my little secret.  My husband and I went here one day on a whim and now it is one of our staples.  This might be my favorite restaurant in the North Hills.    It doesn't look like much on the outside and certainly doesn't offer fine dining inside.  The entrance is the take out order place and then you go into the cozy restaurant to be seated.  The waitresses offer friendly service.  Always ask for the bread and oil at the beginning of the meal.  They only bring it to regulars or those that ask.  We always order the Penne DiPietro which is a vodka sauce penne with sausage and chicken.  My mouth is watering as I sit and think about it.  We usually always get canolli's (spelling?) for desert which comes with 2 of them for sharing.  I will say that the service is impecable but the meals are usually long.  The waitresses are well trained not to bring all your food at once and don't rush you out of there.  They make it an eating event which we love.  I should also say that they take the entertainment and enjoy cards and never punch them.  They do this on purpose so you can use them over and over again.  This in itself causes me to purchase the entertainment card every year.  I totally reccomend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Many people complain about the food here, but I've had nothing but good experiences. Their pizza is okay: good sauce, but nothing special. However, their wedding soup is OUT OF THIS WORLD! It's simple, brothy, with perfect meatballs. Not too many restaurants seem to serve wedding soup, and if they do it's often over salted. Dipietros makes the best wedding soup I've ever had. I dream about it on cold rainy days in Boston. Additionally, their fried zucchini is pretty great. Add a little lemon juice to it, and you'll never regret ordering it. I will say, I've never ordered anything besides those three items. But when they are so perfect, why try anything else?"}
{"text":"We LOVE going to DiPietro's...we really love the meatball hoagie and Alaskan or Shrimp pizza (white sauce).  Fried zucchini has more flavor than any place around   If you're in the West View area, stop by.  Might be a bit pricey, but your beverage has never been refilled as often as they do here (great service)!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Di Pietro's and apparently this place has been serving the community for over 35 years.  I wasn't aware that you have the choice of ordering at the counter and sitting in a booth or opting to be waited on in the dining room.  They have a huge menu board to order from and it lists everything from appetizers, pasta dishes, sandwiches, pizza and much more.  I ordered the meatball hoagie and it was good tasting and had just the right amount of crunch to the bun. I am curious to try out the Provolone Saltimbocca or the Sausage Rolls which is fresh dough wrapped around their homemade hot sausage, green peppers, onions and cheese and baked.  Their prices are reasonable and the staff is cheerful and accommodating."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, best in West View! Great for take out. Just be clear with the staff when ordering, don't leave anything yup for interpretation. Calzones and hoagies are really good and recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a little girls night out with some former coworkers.  We were seated very quickly, and our drink orders taken promptly. Our waitress also brought us out a bunch of Italian bread & butter to start with.   I ordered the meatball casserole (served over a large portion of penne pasta), which comes with a side salad or soup.    I chose the salad with house dressing.  The salad was a simple salad mix with some black olives and a few red onions.  Many times the house dressing can be the best part of a restaurant, but this one was just not my taste. It was a sweet Italian dressing that lacked spices.  But it was okay enough to finish my salad after I had already dumped it on.    The 6 meatballs served in the casserole were very flavorful and about the size of a golf ball, the spaghetti sauce was good but could also use a little more flavor.  It was topped with a healthy amount of melted mozzarella cheese which was so good. The portion of the casserole was very large and I took about half of it home with me!  They also had a large selection of Italian desserts like cannoli, tiramisu, cheesecake, Spumoni ice cream, and some others, but I was too full to partake!   I would definitely come back to this restaurant for a casual, Italian meal with great customer service!"}
{"text":"I are here last night with a dining companion for dinner.  Our meal started out with what I think was some Mancini bread and salads.  The salads were decent with lettuce, a tomato, two olives and 2 pieces of onion on each and came with a small side of balsamic dressing.  For my entree I decided on having the Penne DiPietro which was sausage, chicken and Gorgonzola cheese in a tomato cream sauce while my dining companion had the Chicken Romano.  I was impressed with the sauce on mine, especially whenever it was infused with a bit of Gorgonzola, and the sausage was decent enough but the chicken had a very firm taste, almost like it was dry after had been left out for a very long time.  It was definitely not cooked freshly.  My dining companions chicken was moist and tasted much better with the cheese and eggplant that was on top of it tasting decent as well.  However she did not enjoy the pasta that came with it.  The bottom line for me is that I will not be coming back here anytime in the near future.  The food was decent at best and with the $45 with tip that it cost us to eat here, sans appetizer, dessert and a drink other than water, I can easily find numerous better restaurants in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"So, I'm not gonna hold the bad blind date that I was on against this place. BUT! The food left me with the same bad taste as the weirdo from my date.   I got the fettuccini carbonara, and there was waaaayy too much salt in the mix. The idea is there but there's just way too much salt to make it good. It came with a side salad and bread. Those were good.   The waitress couldn't really make any suggestions on dinner options. She said everyone's getting the lasagna, I guess. Ooohhhkayyy?   I heard pizza is good here, but I may not go back.   Back to the dating game.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 4 layer lasagne. totally dry, it was layer upon layer of noodle and ricotta, with no sauce in between! The meat sauce was minimally ladled over the top was amazing, but needed added to the construction of the lasagne. Save yourself the trouble and ignore the award notification, and order the stuffed shells or similar pasta stuffed with ricotta, to avoid the total dryness of the lasagne.(which was a huge disappointment after seeing friends reviews of this place, and the award winning lasagne). Sad to say, but stouffers lasagne its better(they understand to put sauce(which is way worse) between layers, but they know how to construct it! From what little sauce I received, it was excellent. But, overall, for the price, you can get a good steak at mortons!"}
{"text":"If you like original Italian, then you have to try this place. Their dishes are simple and packed with flavor.   You have to try the sausage rolls as an appetizer and the manicotti is always superb! The lamb meatball kicker with the manicotti is amazing."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my mom's cooking.  Until I had real chili, I thought my mom's was the best.  And then I had the real thing and I knew from then on she wasn't much of a cook.  Sorry mom.  And I guess its about the same with DiPietro's....if you've never had good Italian, you might think theirs is pretty good.  Nope.    Specifics.  I had chicken parm.  The chicken was dry and chewy.  The side salad was one of those glass plates with a few pieces of  iceberg, a leaf or two of spring greens - just enough to keep it from being ALL iceberg, the requisite cherry tomato, rings of red onion - does everyone just move those off to the side of the plate?  And the house Italian dressing?  I swear it was Good Seasons from the shaker bottle.  Housemade dressing doesn't have those tiny specks of red and black and God knows what else floating around in it.    The price for this 2 small pieces of nearly inedible chicken in a smear of sauce and a sprinkle of mozz, a wholly inadequate salad and a small pile of watery veggies?  $18.  Really.    If you want Italian, this isn't it.  You'd be better off with Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. It sounded like a place I would enjoy being older Italian restaurant that I figured had pretty good food based mainly on the area, how it looked and how I perceived it.   I was wrong. We had dinner last night at DiPietro's, a party of three. The restaurant is basically a pizza parlor up front and a sit down restaurant in back. We ordered a sausage roll and split it between three of us which was very good. I liked the dough, their sauce and the sausage roll itself.   I ordered the chicken parmesan which is a staple in Italian American restaurants. Usually, like pizza even when it's bad it's pretty good. Not in this case. The chicken was pounded so thin and was so over cooked and rubbery it was a shame. The breading was dark brown, bordering on burnt. Sauce was fine on it, but it could've used more. Pasta side dish was over cooked. Pretty bummed out about this.   The other orders at the table were Chicken Picatta and Manicotti. The server was asked if Chicken Piccata could be made as it was not on the menu, but they had Veal Picatta. They were able to accommodate the order. Again, two of the thinnest pieces of chicken I've ever seen and they appeared to be over cooked. The sauce broke very quickly as well. If the chicken wasn't pounded to 1/4\" in thickness, both it and the chicken parmesan would have been better. Stop trying to save money by pounding the chicken to death. You're ruining the product! You're charging $17.99 for chicken parmesan and it flat out isn't good!  As for the Manicotti I didn't have it but our guest did. To me it personally looked dry. I don't care for manicotti, but it didn't look great.   I probably wouldn't go back to DiPietro's.   DiPietro's reminds me of a place that was started by a family from the greatest generation and was fantastic for many years, but when the children took over it declined and everything became an after thought. While I know it's not that's the vibe I got from it."}
{"text":"The food is terribly overpriced for the quality. You can get similar food at a better quality and a fraction of the price at any other local Italian place. The owner is a very nice man who still visits the restaurant. The interior dining area is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Occasionally eat there for lunch but went in for dinner with the family a couple nights ago.  The pizza was very tasty but their prices are very high, particularly for what you get.  We ordered a large cheese pizza, two side salads, a soda, a water and two kids' lemonades.  With tip, we managed to get out of there for $33.    My biggest complaint is the side salads ($4.99 each).  They were served on a typical salad plate and consisted of a little bit of lettuce, two cherry tomatoes cut in half and two black olives.  For five bucks I expect a lot more than that!  The food is always very good when I go there for lunch, and the pizza was good, but the prices are just too much."}
{"text":"The deliver, they have the best pizza and veal I have had in a long time, and they NEVER screw up an order!!!  If you are looking for quality Italian food in West View, this is where to go!!!"}
{"text":"Went to DiPietro's with My boyfriend & his friend from out of town. Wonderful greeter, sat us at a booth right away, Fabulous waitress ! A must try appetizer is the  Provolone Saltimbocca , Yum !  The bread there is fabulous (mancini) ! Dinner we all agreed was delicious ! Definetly a pittsburgh hidden treasure :) A+++++"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to DiPietro's for his birthday yesterday. His favorite food is Italian, so we're always looking for the best homemade Italian food.  The entrance to DiPietro's is for ordering pizza and subs - the restaurant is in the rear and is cozy and quaint. We were promptly seated and our waitress was spot-on and quick.   My husband ordered the Chicken Parmesan - which he does at every Italian restaurant - and got 2 large pieces of chicken with a side of penne. I ordered the ricotta stuffed shells. The sauce is smooth with a hint of sweetness. It's not overly cooked, so you can still taste the freshness of the tomatoes and basil. The shells were stuffed with a combination of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses and the filling was slightly creamy and not too dry. It bugs me when cheese filling is dry and grainy.  The prices seemed a bit on the high end for pasta in a small neighborhood. The chicken parm was $18 and my stuffed shells were $16...although, soup or salad is included.   I'd say that DiPietro's is a place that we'd visit again."}
{"text":"Being from out of  town I wanted a taste of Pittsburgh Italy.  We heard good things about Di Pietro's and decided to eat there for lunch today.  The service was friendly and the food was good to great and the restaurant itself clean with many windows to let that Pittsburgh sunshine in.  I ordered the fried zucchini as a appetizer.  It was a tad over crunchy and the zucchini was on the thin side.  The marinara served with it was amazing.  If this same sauce is used with their pasta, it's already a winner!  I also ordered the half steak hoagie.  It comes with onion, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  I ordered it without the mayo and the waitress asked if I wanted ketchup (we are in Heinz country!) or Italian dressing.  It was nice to be presented with options. The hoagie was the best that I've had in awhile.  The bread was lightly toasted but fresh.  The steak was tender and had great flavor.  I will definitely visit Di Pietro's again on my next visit to Pittsburgh."}
