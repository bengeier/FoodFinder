{"text":"This restaurant changed administrations and downsized its space about six years ago.  With the original administration, it was a relatively busy restaurant and the food was decent but the customer service was terrible.  With the current administration, the food is worse and the service is worse (which I didn't know was possible).  This restaurant is supposed to be an Italian buffet style restaurant, but when I came to dine here a few days ago, it seemed more like a bad (and smaller) version of Fu Lam.  When I walked in, an employee acknowledged my presence by looking at me but then ignored me by continuing to play on his phone.  When he realized that I was still standing there, intending to dine there, he told me to follow one of the waitresses until she seated me.  A waitress seated me and I was surprised to find that the restaurant was relatively empty, except for myself, four other tables were being used for other customers (the restaurant probably holds more than 50 tables).  I didn't understand why the restaurant was so empty until I began to look and try their food.  It was after I began to eat where I understood why the restaurant was empty: the food is terrible!  The soups are runny, tasteless and full of leftover food.  The lasagna was probably bad in the first place, but because it had been out and over the steamer for so long, it was dry, the cheese was slightly tough, and the meat had lost its taste and texture.  They had little egg omelettes with zucchinis inside and I thought that these were hard to screw up but apparently I was wrong.  The omelettes were disgusting! They were completely dry, tasteless, and flaky and the only thing holding the omelettes together were the skins of the zucchini.  The chicken legs looked disgusting and burnt and attenpted to make it look appetizing by glazing too much burgundy sauce on them; apparently it looked so bad that no one had even been brave enough to try one!  The restaurant had a lot of Asian style noodles, which were so dry that someone could scratch their esophagus because of the noodle.  The restaurant even had sushi, which was a wonder because the restaurant is supposed to be promoted as an Italian restaurant, not an Asian one.  I thought the food couldn't get worse but apparently it could when I got to the dessert counter.  There were two trays that were filled almost to the top with cold water, one tray had a little bit of chopped cantaloupe, honeydew and apples, the other tray had litchi, slices of oranges and peaches (the ingredients from the latter tray were all retrieved from cans).  These two trays did not looked appetizing at all!  There were also little plastic cups floating in a tray of cold water to keep the contents cold.  Inside the cups was custard topped with some jam.  This cup of custard, if one could finish eating it, had so much sugar in it, it could burn your throat.  I thought that nothing could go wrong with the ice cream.  The ice creams themselves probably had nothing wrong with them when they were initially bought, but the problem was that the boxes of ice creams were probably there for so long that I could taste the bland and staleness of the old ice cream.  The chocolate ice cream, which had the least amount of ice cream because many people liked that flavour most, was so old that their was an extremely dark brown crust of chocolate ice cream that I couldn't penetrate the ice cream scoop with.  The service of the restaurant was not good either.  I was confused to as to who my server was because their were two employees serving me at the same time.  When it came time to pay, I stood up with my jacket and purse on and stood near the cash register but no one came.  I almost felt like dining and dashing, because the entire experience was terrible.  I don't know how this restaurant has stayed open for six years with the new administration with this type of ambience.  I would highly suggest not to enter this restaurant, it is a waste of your time, money and  taste buds."}

{"text":"This place's cleanliness is not very good, the food is fat, greassy and  barely eatable. We were VERY disappointed. Worst buffet in Montreal.  Do not go there."}
{"text":"I went there on the first of Sep. for a dinner with my sister. To be honest, the food was great. Hands down. Exactly as I expected if not better!  However, I didn't give it 5 stars due to the BAD SERVICE I've got! The moment I entered the buffet until I left,  no one came to ask what to drink or if we needed something!! So I had to call the waitress ( who was responsible for our section) to order drinks!! So she just brought them with no excuse! Our Glasses of water were almost empty and she didn't even care! Anyway she wasn't looking at my table at all... she was taking good care of other costumers she might known before.  Then suddenly she brought the check! ( we didn't ask for it yet!! ) . At that moment, we decided to add 1 cent as a tip, in order to let the staff to understand what kind of service we had!  Of course she thought that there was an error since there is no way that we ill leave only ONE CENT!! So when we told her it's the reflection of the level of the service e got....she said ok next time don't leave anything..!!! Can you believe how rude she is? she didn't say SORRY!!!"}
{"text":"C'est pas possible qu'on tolère cette endroit comme restaurant. Tout est bizzard... c'est pas propre, le personnel jase et rigole autour des plats, a l'ouverture des portes pour le souper du samedi soir et bien il y avait plusieurs plat même pas remplit, presque tout était sec. J'ai demandé au gérant ce qui c'est passé avec ce restaurant et suite a ma plainte il nous a tous offert 15% de réduction..... honnêtement je ne suis pas du genre geule fine mais là sa va bcp trop loin.   J'espère bien que vous irrez dans une autre endroit et que cette établissement fermera c'est porte sous peu.  Merci et choisissez bien !!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst buffet I've been too. The french fries were about the only decent thing about this place. 16-18 $ for crappy food, the meat had too much Grissel, the food wasn't hot. Don't even get me started on the dessert table! It was a mess. There were no signs telling what was what and there were just bowls of white creamy stuff that frankly did not look appetizing. The ice cream bowls had some sort of yellow stuff in it...and they were supposed to be CLEAN. The plates also had bits of food stuck to it. As we left we told the waitress it wasn't good and she said there were new owners and she wouldn't even eat there.  Overall  Crappy food Dirty place Not returning."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've ever had. The food was fat and not fresh, not to mention that the option was very limited. AVOID THIS PLACE FOR ANY COST."}
