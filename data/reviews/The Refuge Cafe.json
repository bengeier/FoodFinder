{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's a hit or miss. I love the feel of the place, very inviting. I ordered a banana/strawberry shake once but they told me they were out of bananas. Really? Lol there's a Fry's right up the street, but oh well I survived and ordered something else. I've ordered the bruschetta a and love those! Also the sandwiches are awesome. They have free wifi here and also live music in the evenings.  I'll still keep going here cause I like their lemonaid"}
{"text":"The Refuge is not just a great place for your Saturday breakfast; they are an AMAZING place for your office lunch or breakfast! I placed an order for 12 breakfast items plus coffees and needed it by 7:15, not only did the workers come in early to accommodate my order they got the order 100% right. The food was amazing, and my co-workers and I are officially their biggest fans and have been referring them to everyone. The staff is friendly the and the food is off the carts for the price. Please take the time to get to know this local gem."}
{"text":"Great whole foods. They make their own mayo, salsa, simple syrups, chocolate sauces, and more! Great staff and it all goes to charity!"}
{"text":"First visit there was a trip for breakfast and it was absolutely awesome. They impressed us enough to encourage us to come back for lunch. The pulled pork is now a family favorite.

Sometimes if they're short staffed during lunch, turn around is a little slow. Last experience with their tuna salad sandwich was dry, driest I've ever had and supposedly it had apples and sunflower seeds which were were exceedingly rare."}
{"text":"This place is great for coffee, great food, and friendly service. I have a hectic schedule and finding a nice spot to catch up with friends, work, school or just take a moment for myself. I wanted to keep it a secret, but this place deserves the kudos."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place while waiting in Central Phx. to go to the airport. The coffee was out of this world and the food was super delicious, everything from the tuna salad to the tapas to the bbq was top notch and fresh but the salsa hands down was the winner! A lot of variety on this menu. The drink choices looked amazing and they had plenty of options, I will so be indulging in the $5 Bloody Marys here soon. All that being said what really makes this place 5 stars is the vibe, it can't be beat. Very peaceful and comfortable and our server Kevin was outstanding. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, wonderful atmosphere and fresh local food.  My BFF and I love meeting here during the week, as the service is friendly and the quality of their coffee and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Friendly coffee shop. I guess they do some good charity work so that's nice. I enjoy their cold brew."}
{"text":"Had a great panini. Good bread and delicious ingredients. Service is on the lax side. Just because people step in the establishment to have a good cup of coffee and kick back doesn't mean the employees need to as well."}
{"text":"This is good as a coffee place but the breakfast sandwich was disappointing.  Plus there aren't many breakfast choices"}
{"text":"Great place with an inspiring mission. Had \"the jam\" frozen drink...Nutella, a banana, peanut butter and expresso all whipped up into one delicious creation. I also recommend the Albondiga soup. It's a meatball soup in a broth with veggies and fresh cilantro...delicious! Looking forward to trying their breakfast options on my next visit."}
{"text":"Always good food and awesome coffee. I wish their hours were more steady. Many times we have walked there to find they closed early because they are slow."}
{"text":"The az sunset is so good! Great place to hang out or study. Really good food and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Congratulations on one amazing year!  Delicious treats and smoothies!  Great concept!!  Such a relaxing and peaceful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Found myself sans kids and husband for a few days so instead of cooking, I ate a few meals at The Refuge.  Had the Foccacia with turkey and bacon, the Chicken Tortilla soup and the breakfast burrito with bacon- all were awesome.  No complaints.  I tend to drink vanilla lattes only and all of mine have been great.  Am glad this place is close to home."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The coffee is delicious and breakfast is amazing. I had the veggie burrito. The staff is also helpful and attentive. Danielle helped us at the counter and was very friendly. But everyone, including the cook checked on us! Great place for students with free wifi and a ten percent discount with a student id!"}
{"text":"First time here! So delicious and such a nice calm coffee shop. Definitely will be coming back more often for the Haboob expresso :) plus super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite coffee spot...the coffee was great (they have almond milk-yay!) and hubby loved his bfast burrito. Outdoor patio is a great spot to bring dogs; ours loved it.  Inside, they have local art and reasonably priced gifts, made by refugees who live in Phoenix... Staff was very friendly and pretty quick....great concept, great spot...will be back often!"}
{"text":"John and his staff is probably one of the best in town when it comes to food and beverage service. The customer service experience is extremely friendly and timely. I have frequently stop by on Tuesdays afternoon's over the past couple of years prior to my evening class. Jessica their barista/bartender and others  call people by name and remembers your order from your last visit which is just one example that you know they are focused on long term customer relationships. The food is \"fresh\" and made from scratch know matter what time of day you stop in and chefs even come out to greet you as well to make sure everything is ok.  Thank you Refuge for the great dining experience..."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I practically live here!
Jessica is the ONLY person that serves my drinks just how I like them. She's friendly and extremely helpful whenever I have questions about the menu options. Have food allergies? Let her know and she'll take care of you.
The staff is always welcoming--it's like Cheers, only with better hair. A true social venture and a gem to Melrose.
As for the food, depending on the night, Eric or Marisol will serve up magic with a fork and knife. The pork tacos are my go-to, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Again, if you have food allergies, or dietary restrictions, let Jessica know (or whoever is taking your order) and you'll be taken care of.
Again, I love this place!"}
{"text":"The coffee, burritos, and salsa are my favorite.  I'd eat them everyday if I could. The staff is always great too, friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff, great pastries made ON SITE - You can smell them actually baking, OPEN wi-fi that WORKS, not TOO loud so you can work, good lighting, they have a conference room in the back, proceeds support local charity in PHX - So ALL great things here. Add this to your co-working, meet friends, morning/pm coffee needs and sweet tooth. I didn't have the feta/goat cheese sandwich  - but my friend's looked and smelled divine! Love this place so far!!"}
{"text":"We had two breakfast burritos and two different kinds of coffee. EVerything was perfect  Salsa was nice. Atmosphere was good.  We could not ask for a better place to have lunch from out of state.  Recommend this place.  Besides having excellent food the prices for lunch were low."}
{"text":"Just moved to the Phoenix area and decided to check it out after incredible reviews from yelp. This place is probably my new favorite study spot. Its super cute! Be  sure to try the lavender white chocolate latte and the grilled cheese with a side salad. One of the ladies was friendly enough to recommend adding goat cheese, basil, and tomato. I added tuna for extra protein, but for real, I'm telling you, it's like the best \"grilled cheese\" I've ever eaten in my life. Go there. Now."}
{"text":"Perfect small road stop. Quiet, superb chill setting. They usually serve breakfast just til 11am but made an exception for us since they'd breakfast fixin's still. We had not even told her that is what we needed. The menu is modest and you purchase at the counter like a deli. The breakfast sandwich for $5. Served very fast and filled us right up including the protein I needed to get me from hangry to calm. A perfect small stop with some rather cool artwork for sale overly made by local refugees. All profits from this small cafe go to local plans run by Catholic charities."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, good coffee. Proceeds go to charity. And there is a beautiful mural on the wall outside of the front door.  The hummus plate is substantial and delicious.  The happy hour is great. Every night you can get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for lunch for the first time. It's a nice little restaurant that has a chill vibe. I ordered the house red and refuge focaccia which came with chips and salsa and a small salad. The sandwich was good but I didn't think the chips and salsa complimented the sandwich very well. The cafe has games and is a great place to grab a quick bite, read, study, or just hang out."}
{"text":"The food is good. We spent $42 on 4 meals with drinks. Reasonable. It's a quiet and nice small place to hang out. They have coffee, good food and wine. We loved it."}
{"text":"The Refuge is great. Cozy design, great service, diverse crowd. Great place for anything- breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, or just a coffee. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A very quaint and cool cafe to eat lunch at. My husband works in Glendale and I work in Phoenix, so we frequently meet here in the middle. The menu is light fare and the food portions are just right. My favorite is the grilled cheese with goat cheese and cheddar. My husband frequently orders the tuna sandwich with a small side of soup. They are a part of the Catholic charities organization, so food profits go towards helping their cause - you can feel good about supporting this local business. Wi-fi available!"}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed a wonderful afternoon here! Their coffee is absolutely delicious, and they had a good selection of drinks and food to choose from. The atmosphere was great and comfortable, they also had some board games to play. It's a great place to hang out for a little while.  Not to mention, all their proceeds go to Catholic Charities.  Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"This is such an amazing coffee shop! The staff is lovely and engaging and they have wide selection of delicious coffees (the syrups are made in house) and super yummy breakfast items! The atmosphere is very cozy and they play super relaxing 50s and 60s music! I had a breakfast burrito and the lavender coffee! Both were extremely yummy and filling!"}
{"text":"A few remarks: 
1.  This cafe is run by a charity; their mission is to help alleviate homelessness & generally be good humans.  Amazing.

2. The pulled pork sandwich is completely amazing. Period. It has this soft, yummy bun with a bean spread, pickled onions & avocado.  Super yummy & filling.

3.  Where in the Valley can you get a side salad (creamy balsamic vinaigrette, spring mix, croutons) with candied walnuts at zero extra charge?

4.  My order was under $35 before tip
* Two beers (one bottled, one draft) 
* Cucumber/jalapeno/onion appetizer
* Sandwich with side
* Cookie

Refuge is my new favorite neighborhood place!  Kudos to the GM and Chef; it's a joy to find a new place with a fresh approach to being a local business."}
{"text":"Great place, good brews and food at decent prices.
Atmosphere is modern/artsy.
Great place for a date or afternoon snack.
And it's non-profit!!!"}
{"text":"The Refuge Cafe is my go to Zen place before class. Depending on how my day went or which evening class I have I'll choose between an Arizona Sunset ice coffee with a tasty pastry or a cocktail with the turkey panini. Atmosphere is friendly & relaxed. I love sitting in one of the comfy arm chairs to sip my drink & finish up my class reading assignments"}
{"text":"After patiently waiting online the cashier without any qualms, concerns or apology decided to take the order of the gentleman behind me. She even called him by his first name \"Tom\" as if by calling him by his first name made it ok to skip me. I just left the building after that."}
{"text":"The Refuge is my favorite neighborhood coffee stop. Very spacious with a completely relaxing atmosphere and friendly, laid back staff. You instantly feel like part of a family in this place. Great collection of local art, moody lighting, relaxing furniture, and chill beats makes it hard to want to ever leave The Refuge. Oh, and the coffee is great too, with several interesting combos. Try the Haboob!

I've had breakfast and lunch here and each time is was delicious. The pulled pork tacos are the best pork tacos I have had.

I also like that the beer and wine bar element is geared to a classy crowd without the classy prices. This makes for my top choice spot to take clients on business meetings. It's not formal or stuffy or fake like some Starbucks tend to come off as. You must visit The Refuge, especially since they have happy hour every day!"}
{"text":"OMG this is great! I love this little place... I got the Refugee Focaccia with the salad and the raspberry iced teas delicious. Service was awesome they were super friendly. Food was made from scratch and fresh... delish!

On top of good food and good service-proceeds go to non profit services!

Awesome! Must come here!"}
{"text":"I have breakfast here almost every tuesday. The oatmeal is to die for. Literally it would be on my \"last meal\" breakfast food list. Coffee is good and the service is great...even at 7am. 

They have a cool little conference room that is free for the first 2 hours and very useful for a board meeting or other gathering.

It's not as hip as say Lux but it's not nearly as crowded and you can hear yourself think. Plus the profits support charity! All in all its the best place west of central to grab coffee, a bite to eat or a beer!"}
{"text":"Love this spot!! I get the veggie burrito w egg whites and feta...it's the same crouse and everyone is super friendly. You might even see Pat, he's an older gentleman that gives out scratcher tickets!"}
{"text":"Best airport coffee shop this airline pilot jas ever found.  Absolutely the friendliest employees on the planet!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito and lavender iced coffee. Both were super delicious. This was my first time here and I'll definitely come back and recommend it to anyone. Very relaxing atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I been scouting for a good pumpkin spice latte for at least a month now.  Here I have tried the most delicious pumpkin spice latte in town so far.  Not too sweet, not too bitter. You can taste the pumpkin and the spices. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff with a great drink selection!

I am definitely a fan of this location. The staff members and atmosphere of this place are great. Everyone I have meet on staff has been really kind and knowledgeable of the products they brew and whatever is on tap. I love being able to talk beer and coffee with these guys. The business also has lots of great and unique items on sale around the shop. The Refuge owes its name this artwork and crafts on sale. They are products made from local refuges that are looking to showcase their skills and culture with the Phoenix community in hopes of making a little extra cash for themselves. Depending on what they have to showcase you can find some really great items for sale.

The Refuge is a great place to go for a coffee or a drink to get some work done. They have a large meeting room in the back that you can book with the guys up front that is perfect for accommodating a meeting of +10. They also have lots of fun board games available to sit and play with your pals.

A great location to go for work or to kill a few hours of time."}
{"text":"It's pretty yum here. The people are nice and there are games. Kinda awesome for a first date!"}
{"text":"Refuge just makes me happy. Refuge is an unassuming little coffee shop in central Phoenix. It's affiliated with Catholic charities, and so it has lots of artwork and crafts from around the world on display. The people who work here are so friendly. The coffee is good and reasonably priced. I personally like to go for the bagel/cream cheese and coffee special (it's super inexpensive- like $3.00ish) AND you get a free refill on your coffee. I've never gone for drinks and lunch, but they do have a full bar. 

Great little place to go do work!"}
{"text":"This place is aptly named!  I've been wanting to try it for a while so decided to meet a colleague there for a strategy meeting.  We went in around Noon, grabbed a really yummy tea and a snack, and got to work.  There is great art for sale and some really cool crafts in display cases.  The place is  laid out nicely, with great lighting and nice, comfy furniture.  There was little noise and an overwhelmingly calming vibe.  The best part?  This place is owned by a charitable organization which is local and works to 'help folks get a new start in life.  I like all of these attributes and would support them just because they AREN'T Starbucks!  The fact that they are superb is just icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"So happy I finally stopped here. First impressions are a tell all for food/beverage service joints, and The Refuge now has a new fan. All I ask is to be immediately acknowledged, receive friendly service, pay reasonable prices and enjoy it all in a clean environment; and this coffee shop/wine bar/ tasty delights hang out nailed it! 

You'll be happy you checked it out. I'll be there tomorrow, no doubt about it!"}
{"text":"I figured it was worth a shot, I've been passing it for awhile, looks like a nice place that has wine etc...

Well I was disappointed, not only was it practically empty the service was incredibly slow. I was walking out when the girl behind the counter finally came back to take my order after she slowly prepared a few drinks for the other customer. So I ordered some bruschetta (which was good, but over priced) and a bottle of wine yet my opinion still didn't chance.

Food was good, other than that I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Sunday morning.Nice quiet atmosphere. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Very friendly young lady server.Tried American breakfast sandwich and egg, veggie, potato and cheese burrito. Both were freshly made and came out hot. They don't have pancakes and waffles or French toast. 
Overall we enjoyed the quaint atmosphere and the food."}
{"text":"This place has excellent potential--I hope it succeeds in the competitive market of Central Phoenix coffee shops! Great selection of wine and beer, and I love all the gorgeous art and handicrafts for sale. It's good to know a portion of the money I spend there goes right back into my community. Could use some help with regards to business processes (taking and fulfilling orders, keeping dining area tidy), but hopefully the staff will get a hang of this soon. Looks like this might be my new favorite coffee shop--much less pretentious than Lux and more welcoming than Copper Star!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. I hold monthly meetings here, and the staff always goes above and beyond to give us great service and make sure we're well taken care of. The manager, John, and the supervisor, Jessica, have built a personal connection with me, and it really goes a long way when we keep coming back. 

The food is great - tasty, fresh, well made. I've never had a poor meal there. (Get the lox & goat cheese bruschetta and the breakfast burrito - you'll thank me later) The beverages are made to order and it seems they will do anything in their power to make you happy. 

On top of that, your dollars spent support a very worthy non-profit. If I lived closer, I'd probably be there all the time."}
{"text":"I found this place while my sister and I were out running some errands in the morning. I had my 9-month-old with me so I wanted a cozy cafe with couches so I could enjoy a coffee and be comfy with my little guy. The Refuge was just the place for this. The woman at the counter was so helpful and very patient in waiting for my sister and I to make up our mind on what we wanted to order. I ordered the American Breakfast Sandwich ( it was only $5!) and a 16 oz. Eye Opener Coffee. Both were absolutely dee-lish! The sandwich came with a side of tasty salsa and our order was hand delivered by an older man who I am assuming was one of the owners. He was so sweet towards my little guy and chatted with me about his own family. Both the restaurant and staff were warm and inviting. I will definitely be giving them my business again."}
{"text":"Just love this place for good robust hot coffee and the breakfast sandwich (egg, crispy bacon & cheese on buttery toasted bread). A great place for meet up, good food and meet-ups!"}
{"text":"You need to trust me here.  Try the pulled pork sandwich.  One of the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"Outstanding wines, unique appetizers, great place to take a date when you really care!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept am coffee and pm drinks. Local beer wine and vodka. Menu has crepes salads sandwiches and tapas. Live entertainment this am with guitar. Staff super friendly and helpful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I could not thing of a better way to start.  The food is excellent and they have several vegitarin options on the menu. The customer service is top notch, a small local business that places the customer as a priority.    The have an excellent selection of drinks as well,  I suggest the Irish Coffee."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and am stuffed! I had the pulled pork sandwich and a blueberry Italian cream soda - to die for! This place is a social charity and well worth a try! Their profits go toward refugees and the food is spectacular! They are a coffee and wine bar so go nuts! The ambiance is like a coffee lounge and bistro. I will be back!!!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little hidden gem off of seventh Avenue they make incredible coffee. And they have a simple menu with all good selections on Saturday mornings they also have crapes which is probably their best. The chef Jacob it's an artist for this food."}
{"text":"For now they are only getting a star,  went there this AM had lox and bagels, the bagels wasn't toasted guess you gotta ask for it. As I was waiting for my drinks and food to come seemed like 10 mins. My food came but not the drinks. Finally my husband went it to get his drink in by the time they got it to us it was cold hot chocolate, another 5 mins I had to go in for my drink. If you have table numbers they should be used. I summed up that the 3 people I saw working wasn't enough help.  

I still giving them hope, I want to go back in try their tapas and wine...."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot and it's quiet. Perfect for a delightful breakfast and coffee. If you sit outside the puppies are welcome and they will even bring a bowl of water out for you. The service one thing I don't like is that they don't have a kids menu or an a l cart menu. This makes it a little expensive when you have kids"}
{"text":"I am always looking for a home-grown business to support. When I found this place I found love. Great atmosphere good looking staff and a worthy cause. Thank you refuge."}
{"text":"Im sitting here, listening to some excellent alt rock i dont know, across a table from my girlfriend, enjoying a coffee and an excellent breakfast burrito, and i cant help but think there are very few places i would rather be on this saturday morning. Its my first visit and i'm hooked. Try this place if you want a genuinely amazing multipurpose cafe experience."}
{"text":"The homemade lavender syrup for one of the coffee drinks is unbelievable !!!  And I got the chicken ceasar salad on special yesterday with a citrus type dressing and was absolutely fantastic.  I plan to stop here on my drive home from work more often !!!"}
{"text":"I waited over an hour for an order that was mediocre at best. I would have appreciated a warning that they were way behind before I ordered. Not a great first impression but the staff was friendly. I would not recommend this place on a weekend as they tend to be understaffed."}
{"text":"Bartenders were friendly. Great drink menu for Craft beer or specialty coffee drinks. 

Wish it was open later."}
{"text":"The refuge is awesome! I come here every week and the vibe and coffee are always on point. Jessica is personable and so sweet! Love it here"}
{"text":"This is a really cool spot!
It is advertised as a coffee shop, but that is not the entire story.

The Refuge Cafe spends 100% of their profits on charity to give back to the community. What an awesome service!

New Happy Hour Menu coming out soon (See my picture).

Interesting menu of different types of coffees and espresso drinks.

Full Bar:
House made Bloody Mary mix - 5$ on weekends
Jalapeño infused vodka - enough said

Non-tap beer - good happy hour deals for watching the game.

Food:
Breakfast, Lunch, and early Dinner.
Great selection of food.
Everything seems to be made from scratch.
I only ate one thing here for breakfast so far and it tasted really fresh.

Atmosphere:
I feel really comfortable in this place. I would describe the atmosphere as \"super calm\" or \"friendly.\"

Service:
Excellent, friendly

Wild Cards:
Fresh squeezed lemonade
Smoothies
Mexican coke in a bottle
Etc.

Will I be back? Absolutely"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm definitely a regular here. I love that it's a quite little spot to catch up with a friend or do some work. Some coffee houses are loud and distracting. I can easily get lost in my work at the Refuge. 
The staff is extremely friendly and nice. Great people and good service. Their menu offers various great options for food and drinks. 
I can highly recommend the oatmeal made with half n half and milk. It's by far my favorite on the menu. Their breakfast burritos are pretty good as well. The French toast is a great option and the pulled pork sandwich is a very generous portion (but FYI not sweet BBQ tasting). 
My favorite coffee drink has got to be the Cayenne  mocha!! It has a perfect combination of bitter chocolate (not overly sweet) and a spice of cayenne!! Their smoothies are delicious as well, made with real fruits and veggies they have frozen.  
Again...you can tell I'm a regular! And I'm telling you this is the perfect everyday spot to come check out!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the lavender coffee & the fact my coffee addiction can support a good cause ; )"}
{"text":"The Chai latte was amazing in flavor and the grilled cheese was excellent! The environment is chill and friendly. A perfect place to study or just hang out with friends! They also have a nice patio you can sit on and enjoy the nice Arizona weather! Keep up the great job guys and everyone should come here and bring your friends!"}
{"text":"I found The Refuge Cafe just south of the light rail on 7th Ave. At the entrance, there's a sign that has thier faith based mission statement. I walked into a great bistro. To my surprise, my lox on a whole wheat bagel, was served open face. Both sides had heaping mounds of salmon, plenty of capers and the best part...the sweet red onion slices that were pickled.  They were sweet, crisp and tangy because of the vinegar. The best lox I've had including Katz's deli in NYC."}
{"text":"We stopped in last Saturday night to grab a drink and were pleasantly surprised that a nice jazz group was playing.  It was the perfect end to a day...a nice drink, great music and the best company ever."}
{"text":"How cool is this!? Proceeds from here help local charities through the Catholic Dioceses of Phoenix. So not only are you getting very tasty food,  great coffee and espresso drinks, beer and wine, you can feel your soul smile knowing the profit from your purchase will go to something good right here in your neighborhood.  The world needs more places like this! Try \"The Jam\" frapp, made with banana, peanut butter and Nutella. The bacon wrapped dates were especially delectable too, great atmosphere as well. My go to when in the Melrose Neighborhood!"}
{"text":"First time here and my experience was great!
The people who worked there were friendly and helpful.
Iced coffee is the best I've had in the area and the smoothies are great!"}
{"text":"I will be nice and give you 5 Stars for the Iced Toddy and House Made Biscotti, but please please fix your WIFI. Understand that the expectation of a quality coffee house also having reliable wifi."}
{"text":"I love the Refuge!  I first came here after my roommate's mom suggested it (she works for Catholic Charities).  I was impressed by the kindness and patience of the staff.  I was so enthralled with the menu that it took me FOREVER to pick out what I wanted!  The staff was very helpful in choosing a great drink for me.  My coffee-snob boyfriend REALLY likes it too!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place! I had the lavender latte & while it wasn't the best I'd had, I really enjoyed my visit here as did the rest of my party. It's such a nice place to relax! They have a really nice menu & I'm planning on coming back to try some of their food."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Art gives the space a ton of character. Great place to get work done was here for 3 hours."}
{"text":"Stumble upon this spot one morning. The food is delicious and the coffee is always hot. Would recommend it for sure."}
{"text":"Just wonderful...best ever custom grilled cheese (white cheddar with gouda, tomato, basil) and yummy vegan vegetable soup..."}
{"text":"Love the place, the food and especially the mission.   Please support it!
It has been a great addition to the neighborhood and to the community."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! The people friendly and the food is good. They are welcoming to my young adult group that meets there a couple times a month.

Get the breakfast burrito for lunch and the veggie wrap for dinner. They have one free refill on the iced tea. I don't actually drink coffee, so I can't comment on it."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious with huge portion sizes, I got a delicious tapa plate and had enough to take home for less than 10 dollars with grilled veggies meats and pesto. The chai was delicious and the staff was very attentive and nice. In addition they showcase local refugee artwork and many local nonprofit causes- want to enjoy your lunch and give back doing it? Come here! Also great study spot with lots of tables and outlet space by the bar"}
{"text":"I had previously put a 1 star review on the Refuge Cafe because of concerns I had over social stances of their owners. I have removed that review as I realized I was judging them with the same kind of judgment I was accusing them of. 

So....I want to place a new review of the Refuge Cafe. It's more than a coffeehouse, as the name states, it's a cafe but with a coffeehouse vibe. I had black tea and 2 of the tapas, the olives and the grilled veggies. Everything was very tasty. I would like to go back in the evening and try some tapas with a beer or glass of wine.

It is an extremely comfy spot, lots of regular tables, hightop tables, bar stools around the bar area, and several big comfy stuffed chairs. Everything here looks VERY high quality. No ratty furniture here that's for sure. It was extremely clean. And all the art on the walls is worth a visit in itself.

I urge you to try the Refuge Cafe. It's a wonderful addition to the central Phoenix scene and a place I will be hanging out on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Decent coffee; excellent breakfast!! Service is polite but can be slow. On the plus side, there's always parking and a quiet table available. Can't access their wifi unless you give them your email and approve junk solicitations."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim and was not disappointed. I was drawn in by the philosophy and mission of the cafe, but stayed for the atmosphere and food. It was great for a light Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"My best friend and I were looking to kill sometime and decided to pop in. We loved their grilled cheese and lemonade. We loved this place so much we made it our place to meet. It's great food, good quality, nice place, and they have a great staff."}
{"text":"We got there early morning 
Nothing much and crazy you can say about this place . 
I think the team is super nice working very fast . They are not to pushy and try to sell 
I think they need a little update for the design . For my Opinion the place is too dark.
We order coffee and a muffin and a muffin was fresh coffee was a little bit burn 
 the overall this place is pretty nice"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful staff. Unlike Starbucks. Have tried latte, iced latte and just a plain old drip coffee. All spot on. Plus, profits going to charity. This is definitely my \"go to\" place. 
Went back for French toast Friday. Prices is right $5.50. The presentation is beautiful. Two slices of French toast dusted with powdered sugar. Three strawberries, half nectarine and two slices of bacon. What a deal. I felt like it was taking forever for my order to come. Unfortunately the toast was ice cold. Bummer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered the Refuge Cafe a couple months ago and fell in love. It's quaint,  comfy, and delicious. The staff are all super friendly and will go out of their way to accommodate anything you ask for. We've been there for breakfast and it's our favorite place to sit and have a cup of coffee. Not to mention they have the best oatmeal I have ever had in my life. We've also been there for their happy hour. They have some great beers on tap and a bunch of board games if you're into that. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the least week so that says something.  Right?  1st time we  had the French toast and the breakfast sandwich,  both delicious.  We ordered the French press but were later told ask the French presses had accidentally been broken the day before,  so we were given oyt choice of large coffees. I had the lavender which is amazing! Great service from the staff that day.  The second day my friends and i went for coffee and it was freezing and dark inside. ..little depressing so we took our frozen bodies to the cute little patio.  We both ordered the cayenne coffee, spicey and chocolaty delicious.  The 3rd time, today, went there for breakfast, had the az sunset, which was good but not as good as my previous choices.  Wealso gad the breakfast burrito,  which was good but its contents  were wierdly distributed... more egg on one side,  more baboon in the other, enough to notice.  They also had different staff today, not as friendly,  thus the minus 1 star. I've bought 6 coffees at this point and when asked if they had loyalty cards, she rudly responded, we are out and walked away.  I already knew they were out,  but i wanted to know when they would be delivered and I'd i could get credit for my coffee purchases. ..apparently i doesn't deserve a thorough answer.  She was more concerned with keeping up the conversation with her gal friend than to do what she's there to do,  provide customer service."}
{"text":"My first time here - the staff is friendly and fast. I had the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito - they kindly put the potatoes on the side for me :)

I have to say this is one of the better breakfast burritos I've had and very reasonable cost. They use REAL eggs from a shell - cracked fresh for each order. 

Love the atmosphere - great place to hang out. Cocktails if you want them. Board games are a bonus! They also have a conference room available for meetings."}
{"text":"Stopped in the day after Thanksgiving to kill some time. We ordered an Eye Opener, a Chai Latte and the hummus plate. Dad added his own cream to the Eye Opener, and my Chai was piping hot, spicy and sweet. Hummus plate was gobbled down within minutes--- fresh, cold veggies (red peppers, cukes and carrots), nice pile of assorted olives and crumbled feta, several triangles of warm, soft pita- all with a generous crock of smooth, classic hummus- tahini flavor coming through without too much garlic. 
Dad complained his \"large\" beverage seemed smaller than he expected, but that was the only complaint.
Bathrooms were shiny-clean. Comfy seating throughout dining area with music playing at the perfect volume. 
Art for sale on the walls and in a display case, apparently all by refugee artists living in the Phoenix area. 

Parking is limited, which is typical for this part of town.

LOVE!"}
{"text":"This might just have to replace lux as my study spot given how much quieter it is ! 

Free wifi - win ! 
Good coffee - win ! 
Great food with vegetarian options - WIN ! 
Service - could get better but mostly a win ! 

The only thing with the service was that they messed up my order forgetting one item but it wasn't a big deal, not big enough to drop a star or anything ...

Their coffee is good but lux kinda still beats em hands down on that matter but that's just personal preference at this point .. It is by no means bad just that it can get better. 

I really like this place and hope to go back sooner than later :)"}
{"text":"I live nearby and can walk to this cafe.  I always order their delicious burritos and they're always AWESOME.  The burritos are seemingly prepared and wrapped with great care, and so I recommend them to anyone.  Also had a iced mocha which together made for a great Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"It seems that most of the positive reviews are about the coffee, which I didn't try so I will not make any assumptions. The food on the other hand was absolutely awful. My girlfriend and I can be picky, but none of our requests should have compromised the quality of the food. I ordered the tuna sandwich, which was supposed to have jalapeños, apples, and sunflower seeds in it (SOUNDS AMAZING). Apparently nothing else comes on the sandwich aside from the giant bun, which was actually the best tasting component of my entire meal (pretty sure it was bought...). I counted one sunflower seed in the entire tuna mix, and 0 jalapeños (extremely disappointed). I got the vegetarian chili soup on the side, which must have been at least 4 days old and came out lukewarm... 
Well, at least they have Cholula."}
{"text":"Well, I been to only a few cafes here and I got to say that this is absolutely my second favorite cafe. The location is far from where I reside but definitely worth going to for wifi or some hot chocolate. The atmosphere is great. It's quite the cafe to be at just with friends/family to meet up and talk about each other's day."}
{"text":"A great local coffee, beer and wine cafe that is owned by Catholic Charities, so patronizing this establishment supports local refugee programs. Local art, jewelry and crafts done by refugees are also featured and available to purchase. 

The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. The coffee and teas are outstanding and are roasted/made right here in Phoenix. The food is sourced with local ingredients and made fresh. I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich and the the tuna sandwich. The fresh salsa and chips and salad are both tasty side options. Actually, everything I have eaten here has been good! 

They have a nice private meeting room in back and right now they have a local \"Promote Your Talent Showcase\" the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month featuring various local musicians and vocalists in an intimate setting. 

I suggest that you stop by and try out this great new establishment that is focused on supporting local community."}
{"text":"Cayenne soy mocha- delish!

All the food was great, had pulled pork sandwich & global grilled cheese (cheddar + goat cheeses)

Spacious, clean, great atmosphere. 

Definitely recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review, especially to a new coffee shop just around the corner from me... but my experience the other morning warrants it.

Decided to break away from Starbucks super efficient morning coffee run to try this place. There were about four people in front of me in line when I showed up. There was only one guy working as cashier and barista, so he had to go back and forth between the two. Took over 15 minutes for me to even get to the front of the line. I had been planning on ordering food with my coffee but I could tell that was going to take too long so I just got an iced coffee and went without breakfast. While I was in line, a lady came in who had apparently called in an order. The order was ready for her, but she still had to wait in line (behind me) to pay for it. She ended up walking out-- leaving the food behind-- because of the ridiculous wait. This is morning rush, they really need to be more prepared then that for the service given. Maybe someone called in sick that day or something? I don't care to make that a repeat experience, I need to get my coffee/food and get on my way to work. Maybe go in the morning if you don't have anywhere to be for a while. Not to mention the iced coffee was not good (if I'm comparing to ANY of the other cold brewed coffee I've had at other local coffee shops)."}
{"text":"For people who need to work or study, this place is actually an okay place to go to. Free wifi & you'll very likely find a seat open for you to pop open your laptop. Can't comment on the food because I didn't have any, but it gets busy here during lunch so it seems like it's worth the trip to many. It actually gets a bit loud during lunch, but the rush dies quick.

They have a seating/dining area but, also a bar upon entrance where you order food & drinks. This isn't just a coffee joint/cafe. I guess what sets them apart is that they also serve alcoholic beverages, so that's a plus.

The service was good. They were all welcoming & friendly.

Their iced soy chai latte was yummy, but there's not much about this place that impresses me. It's just okay.

FINAL THOUGHTS: it's cool....... BUT with the other options the city offers, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. 3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Stopped in before shopping and had great coffee and a yummy bagel and cream cheese. Very friendly staff, comfy seating  and was surprised at he extensive menu and full bar. Will be back for a meal soon!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to have a nice quiet breakfast. The staff is super nice and their bagel and lox combo is very tasty."}
{"text":"Great place! 

I love the tea- try the vanilla black and buy a tin to take home. 

I can often find great handicrafts here too made by refugee. 

Great menu, great quiet spot to work, wine AND coffee!!"}
{"text":"I don't go here as often as I could (already had an attachment to another nearby coffee shop before The Refuge Cafe opened) but TRC is a 5 star all the way. It's clean, spacious, and comfortable (with televisions, tables, and chair seating). They serve beer and wine (not sure about mixed drinks) in addition to their coffee and food menu. It's a great place to, at the very least, try."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are awesome! And the coffee is the best one. I even buy it for home. I wish this place had longer hours"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place for lunch with my coworkers and I was so impressed with the food I couldn't believe. Amazing quality healthy food. Me and my coworker enjoyed it so much and kept commenting as we ate it. People should definitely try this place. And they give you great portions as well."}
{"text":"I stop st the PHX airport location (terminal 4, near gate A14) every time I have a flight out of this concourse. The staff is consistently friendly and personable. It can't just be a random thing. I have to believe it goes deeper and is a result of management. Guessing the training and hiring practices, combined with leading by example, is why the staff here always seem like they enjoy their jobs. And the interactions certainly put a smile on my face. Can't recommend enough - stop by the next time you're flying out of Concourse A, gates 1-14."}
{"text":"This is an incredible Cafe. The
 Food as well as the servers and the information presented by the servers are outstanding! In addition, where can you find a cafe that also contributes in their money to good causes that benefit Society.  We love this place, the people, the food, the contribution to society. Come to this Cafe!! Support the Cause!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back to try something else!  We tried the veggie and the Refuge sandwiches and they were great.  Also the chips and the homemade salsa were a treat!  It definitely didn't disappoint and I love that it is all for a good cause!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe with superb excellent service. The food was also good, I had a turkey, bacon sandwich that was tasty."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here wish I could come here everyday! Danielle is a wonderful barista the whole staff is so nice and knowledgeable! 

They are so passionate about the quality that goes into everything here. The drinks,food and atmosphere is much better than Lux or Copper Star Coffee. Free WiFi by the way! They have live entertainment by local artists on occasion and art classes. I love supporting local places..Starbucks who? 

I love everything about The Refuge I'm glad it's a part of my community - it's my sanctuary away from home and work. Keep up the great job guys!!"}
{"text":"What a great place!! Pulled pork delicious and green chili veggie soup was awesome. 

Great find for us that are on the paleo diet.."}
{"text":"Delish!  Roasted beet salad with sunflower seeds,  feta cheese and citrus viniagarette!  Thank you John and Chris for your excellent (as always! ) service and warmth!"}
{"text":"They raved about the tomato basil soup - it was OK - a bit thinish.  The pulled pork and the roasted vegetables more than made up for the soup!  Really good and I loved the tapas-sized portions.  Would definitely go back next time i\"m in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Always great place for meeting...great food and service for value.. has a nice conference room sized meeting room with all your a/v and e-communications needed."}
{"text":"So delicious, I just wish they were open longer on Sundays because what's when I get most of my work done and I need a great coffee shop."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do. But this operation further entrenches my belief that most coffee shops are a long ways from competing with Starbucks. Service is always painfully slow. They've made way too large of an attempt at getting fancy with their signature drinks. Their food is mediocre at best and it takes twice as long to get as it should.  Maybe if the refuge lost some of the pretense and sped up their service things would be better. It is indeed spacious. Has great art. Good music. And has a great rotation of draft beer. However, they're trying to be a competitor to Lux and they're a million miles away from being in the same league. Stick with Starbucks or Lux until this new business figures things out."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place. The ambiance is casual and fun.  The green chili pork taco plate is the best in the entire valley.  They also have some very unique and delicious cocktails.  A hidden gem."}
{"text":"So my bf and I are in deep search of the best tasting, most comfy, most friendliest, most productive coffee joint in town and so we strolled on over to check this place out.

On our way here, we kind of missed the turn where you park - hint: you park where the big \"Catholic Charities\" building is.  When you walk in, the cafe is a good size, but on a Sunday morning, it was kind of packed with people.  We decided to prop ourselves at the front of the cashier, where the couches were.  The music was my kind of music, the coffee was good, but I just couldn't get 100% comfortable.  I am not sure if it was the noise or the amount of people that turned me off, but I just wasn't comfortable.

I did manage to work for an hour and a half so that was good.  The baristas were ok - I read on reviews they have the all kinds of different varieties of specialty coffee, but when I looked at the menu, it looked like any other place. The barista didn't ask us if we have been before and didn't get an introduction on what they offer so I settled for the almond milk chai tea and it was yummy.   

Not sure if we found \"the coffee  joint\" we so desperately are searching for so our search continues."}
{"text":"For my first time there it was pleasant I loved the display of the crafts that the refugee women have made it was lovely! As for the food, I had the French toast which weren't anything special. My friend had the bagel and wasn't happy with it either. The service was really great and friendly though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Nice vibe and super friendly staff. I got an Americano and it was much better than Starbucks! The blueberry scone was so good, not too sweet. Just right! Can't wait to go back and try their food."}
{"text":"Good food, nice people. A little slow getting the food but it was really good once we got it. Give it a try you won't be sorry. Tomato basil soup was very tasty and the turkey panini was also delicious."}
{"text":"Cute place. Awesome coffee and tea drinks - made by a true barista guy but I can't remember his name, and a decent menu all day. In addition, they have a small but thoughtful beer and wine list. 
Good location on 7th ave. 
triple bonus points because all profits go to supporting catholic charities."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place with their choices of food alternatives to sandwiches - like the hummus platter - and some unique drinks - Love the lavender flavored latte! Very peaceful the couple of times we were there, and the wifi seemed to work well.
My only downside is I wish they could be open a little later. We came in with a group of friends to have a meeting and discuss our festival we're putting together, but the waiter came up and said \"um we're closed now\" not long after we sat down. In their defense, I do know it's a coffee shop and most people don't go for late coffee, I am just wishing they could afford later hours, especially since they have a whole meeting room in the back, and it would be so convenient if we could get people together when everyone has time to be off work.
Also glad to support a charity effort, though I'm not big on religiosity. They don't seem overtly Christian however, so I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I like this cafe because it is a Starbucks alternative, and the environment is cozy and nice for studying or meeting friends. There's patio seating and a couple of couches, the bar and small tables. 

I just wish they would put more thought into the veggie dishes besides salad and hummus. The veggie wrap seems to be whatever salad leftovers they have on hand, not very inspiring. I'd love it if vegetarian dishes were more than an afterthought, but something that chefs put their passionate dreams into!

I appreciate the unusual tea selections like lavender flavored tea, but I wish they'd offer the standards like chamomile and mint as well.

Supports Catholic Charities which aids refugee resettlement, and the walls feature changing displays of original art made by local refugees that the organization has helped.

In the end I go here because it's not Starbucks or Copper Star, and the food and drinks are decent, but I think this place has more potential!"}
{"text":"Hello new breaky joint. I just transitioned from night shift to morning. I've been looking for a place with good coffee AND good food. Well here it is. I find some coffee shops will have great coffee but meh food. The sandwiches that come frozen and you stick them in the toaster oven. Not this place. I wasn't expecting the breakfast burrito to be so good. The mocha I got was awesome too! New favorite and stoked I only live a couple miles from here"}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this spot, and I have a serious love and dependence on coffee. So naturally I tried it out. I got the blended dirty chai which was absolutely delicious! Next time I came I got a simple non-fat latte, also wonderful. The coffee is a fantastic blend and does not have the bitter taste that many coffee shops have. Places (cough starbucks cough) leave their espresso shots sitting out occasionally and this results in a bitter and old tasting latte. But it was not the case here, I could see the barista making my coffee fresh, and that is an important aspect that I look for. I wish I lived closer to the area because I would be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"Super cool cafe with good atmosphere for working or visiting.  Loved the tapas plate (the tuna was awesome!) Perfect spot to hang out and nosh while you catch up on email. #whistlewhileyouwork #yesphx #local"}
{"text":"Routinely come for breakfast (the burros) n they vary depending who the cook is that day from really good to mediocre. Haven't tried anythg else so I can only speak on burros; staff is always super friendly though."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Most of all delicious food! My daughter loved the waffle. And the burrito was awesome-panini style! The lavender coffee delicious and unique. Yum! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to express how much I love this place and how appreciative I am for their great customer service! I ordered through UberEATS the other day and had some picky requests (because being pregnant will make you picky). They called me before sending my food out to make sure they could accommodate my requests. Then the food arrived! I got the Turkey Focaccia sandwich with side salad and OH MY GOODNESS it was all so good! So I ordered it for a second day in a row and will probably continue to order it as often as I can! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Legit  lattes to my utter delight & I am a stickler in this regard. Great panini pressed breakfast sandwich which they serve w. Salsa. Salmon bruschetta highly recommended- very fresh w. Great goat cheese. Give this new place a try - good service and non-profit to boot for good cause! Going back!"}
{"text":"I've read positive reviews about this place yet I've never actually stopped by, sad really because I live walking distance. I finally decided to check it out and I will definitely be back to get a taste of the rest of the menu. I had the refuge mixed green salad and it was absolutely delicious. The salmon bruschetta was also delicious and that's involving the fact that I'm not all that crazy about salmon."}
{"text":"I want so much to like this place because of  their mission to help newly settled refugees; unfortunately, my third try at breakfast with not a lot of luck is brining me to write this review. I'll just stick to my most recent visit which was earlier this week.

I ordered the breakfast burrito and the potato were not thoroughly cooked; some were raw. I ordered a cookie wrapped in plastic and it was not fresh; I'm guessing it was several days old but not advertised that way.

I sat at the bar area to eat my breakfast. I did not order coffee but nobody asked if I wanted water. In fact, the waitress disappeared and there was no way to get anyone's attention. 

My suggestion is that the Refuge operate as any other restaurant or coffee shop. Customer service needs  to be improved. Why not check back on your customers and see if they need anything, similar to what you find in most other restaurants?

It's a popular place and others think the food is really good, so I could just be coming in on their off days.

I will try it next time for lunch and see what happens."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this cafe was amazing! The cashier was so nice and helpful when choosing what we wanted! I love what they support and will definitely come here again. Also, the lavender drink is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The Refuge is a great name for this wonderful place. Wonderful food, a nice atmosphere, great art on the walls, jazz & blues in the air... and COFFEE! Good coffee and espresso drinks. Plus it is a chance to help other people while you do what you like. They have a full selection of wine, beer and spirits... so my wife can hang out with me at a \"coffeehouse\" for a change since she wants a drink while I have lots of coffee. Good place. Nice people. A sanctuary in this crazy city... a Refuge!! Thank You!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, not too trendy or hipster but very relaxed. Mimosas were reasonably priced and the breakfast burrito was very tasty and a great deal at $5.50. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great cafe, modern, clean interior, plenty of parking. The Focaccia bread sandwiches run about $10 and you get a nice, large, freshly made sandwich with a large.delicious house salad with candied pecans, croutons and Feta cheese.
The salmon Bruschetta was amazing and the Proscuitto and Gruyere ones were great...and for $3 for two they were well worth it.
Also they are charity driven so its for a great cause.
The menu also shows some $5 breakfast choices so we'll definitely try it in the morning too. Coffee was smooth, full bodied and delicious. Free wifi.
The wine and beer menu looks thoughtfully chosen and reasonably priced.
They have just opened so time to show them some love people :)"}
{"text":"Not only are their smoothies delicious, but their food as well!! The hummus plate. The grilled cheese. The bruschetta. All amazing. And today they accidentally made my drink wrong, so Jacob came right up to the table, took it back and made me the correct drink and even up-sized it for me. Super sweet, and a relaxing place to chat with friends or study."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's great on a weekend morning when you want to sit and read with a latte. The breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwich are delicious. They also have the most friendly staff"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for the first time a couple weeks ago. The coffee is good, but where they really shine is the breakfast burrito!  It's full of fluffy eggs, bacon, potatoes, and melted cheese wrapped in a tortilla, and then put in the panini press. Bam! It's delicious! The salsa that's served with it is just okay, but the whole thing is awesome! Service is as to be expected, but I'll be coming back often for that addicting breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Club sandwich is da boom. Literally the best sandwich I've ever had. Awesome atmosphere and the owner couldn't be more friendly! They have booze, coffee, lots of great food options, you won't be disappointed! 

A+, 5 stars. Nice work and keep it up!"}
{"text":"The worst bagel Ive ever had. I opened the box and it already looked dry. The salmon looks like its been sitting out for weeks! Not to mention it gave me the meanest stomach ache. My dog wouldn't even eat it. Never again. Im only giving it two stars because the iced coffee was bearable."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and went to your Phoenix airport location this morning. I was looking for a coffee and when I stepped up to the counter was greeted by a great guy named Amel.  Super friendly, polite and hospitable. He took a genuine interest in where I was traveling and genuinely made my morning great!  This is not something you see often these days. I am from Dallas and when he asked where I was headed informed me he was a cowboys fan!  Though I am not A Cowboys fan I will in no way hold that against him or your shop and will return one day soon. 

You need more people like him. My only disappointment was that when I went to your website there was no link to contact your company and share this terrific morning experience. 

I failed to mention that the Carmel latte I ordered was far better than Starbucks. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've noticed this place for a while since it's across the street from my vet, but hadn't stopped until yesterday.   Nice decor inside, outside dining nice to see since it's getting cooler.  Had the breakfast special sweet crepes--delicious w/ Nutella and bananas and strawberries. Good selection of coffee choices."}
{"text":"After driving by hundreds of times I finally stopped in to the Refuge last week. I was looking for a place to work, enjoy a coffee and a snack so I gave it a shot! The parking was easy and plentiful which is often a challenge in this area and sometimes deters me from other spots. There is a nice outdoor patio with shade and the inside is clean, modern with plenty of tables and comfy chairs to sit and chat or work. The young lady at the register was very friendly. Lots of coffee and drink options and some really good food choices, too. I had a latte and a breakfast burrito, the burrito was really tasty and a big portion for the price. The latte left a bit to be desired but I would go back because it's local, the overall experience was great and it is a nice place to sit and work or meet up with a friend."}
{"text":"I really liked the breakfast sandwich and the salsa that came with it. My latte was good and everything was priced well. It wasn't that loud so I was able to get some work done as well."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. Just moved to the neighborhood and love to support local coffee shops even though I do find myself at Starbucks more than I like to admit. But I have been to refuge 4 times now and have had a great experience each time! And I even brought the world's toughest critic when it comes to coffee or lattes, my wife! She loved it! The home-made treats were delicious, too! I still need to order some food which sounds really good. Someone mentioned the grill cheese and had a photo. i want one! 
I do bring my laptop and do my work which is why I visit cafe's so often. Wifi has worked great every time. I like how quiet and relaxing refuge is with comfy chairs if I decide I want one, with a friendly staff. The art on the walls created by refugees is really nice to see.
I saw a Bloody Mary bar there one saturday and thought wow...next time I will come on a weekend and order one. I did just that a few weeks later, but...no Bloody Mary bar that day. I was disappointed. But not for long! I still ordered a Bloody Mary and it came with all the fixings on the side presented very nicely on classy plates! Stuffed olives, the wh... sauce, a dish of horseradish to make it as spicy as I wanted. A huge, fresh chunk of celery! Now that's a Bloody Mary! Oh I hate it in bars when there is no celery. Obviously refuge knows what they are doing. 
I'll be back many more times. I need to get over there and order some food tomorrow morning! I think there's a breakfast burrito with my name on it! And the white chocolate mocha! So gooooood!"}
{"text":"The Refuge takes its name seriously: it is the most soothing of the many coffeehouses in roughly this neighborhood. It features -- prominently -- staff who are not sullen hipsters, but who are sweet and charming and helpful. It also features bizarre and wonderful coffee drinks -- lavender and chili peppers figure in them, though not in the same drink -- and a wine/beer liquor license. The spirit is distinctly soothed.

Food quality varies widely enough to keep it at a 4-star rating. The breakfast burrito is so meh that when the counter clerk somehow misunderstood my vague babbling and ordered up a breakfast sandwich for me instead, I ended up grateful and delighted, as the breakfast sandwich turns out to be much better, with lots of butter and nice soft eggs. Henceforth, I am ordering the breakfast sandwich on purpose. Pastries similarly run from the meh to the sublime, but they're priced reasonably enough to not trigger severe buyer's remorse, and they seem to change fairly often, too.

The coffee is apparently brewed for use in the amazing coffee drinks, so when consumed straight, over ice, it will put hair on your chest and, should you have any minor ailments that are ameliorated by application of caffeine, you will experience a miracle cure. I have no problem with this (it took my headache right away), but you need to be in the right mood for coffee that slaps you in the face.

The setting is industrial-bungalow-chic, with local art, free wifi, and a nice patio. I believe this is run by Catholic Charities, which may explain the effort to create an aura of spiritual peace."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little spot to do some quality studying.  It's also nice to have breaks here with a warm lavender latte. And when you're hungry for something meaty, go for the pulled pork sandwich. It also comes with a side salad!"}
{"text":"So I frequent cafes/coffeehouse to mainly read and study so my reviews are based on keeping that in mind. Here are my top 10 reasons for coming here...

#1- It's a well lit, spacious place which has table/chairs for my serious studying but also couches/comfy chairs for the days I just want to relax and study. 

#2- Outlets and free-wifi for my gadgets which is crucial. 

#3- Play good music, not too loud or distracting but enough background noise so I can tune everybody out and focus on my work.

#4- Good drinks menu with plenty options for coffee, tea, smoothies, soda, etc. Maybe, they offer alcohol too but I am not too sure since I am not talented enough to study while consuming alcoholic beverages. 

#5- Awesome lunch and dinner menu for my stress eating. The grilled cheese here is one of a kind, you get to combine 2-3 different types of cheese so you can get pretty creative. The bruschetta is a MUST, my friend ended up ordering it twice in the same night because it was SO good! The hummus is also really good, the barista hooked us up with extra pita bread since we ran out which leads to my #6.

#6- Pleasant and friendly staff who don't rush you with your order and are very helpful in answering questions or if you need a little briefing on the menu.

#7- FREE one refill on iced tea which is what I usually get.

#8- The profits go towards charity which makes me want to support it that much more. 

#9- On the weekends, they sometimes have live music. (They also have plenty board games here so if you don't need to read/study, that's an option for entertainment). 

#10- Private parking lot, never had trouble finding parking or have anxiety about having to parallel park. 

Nothing is perfect, so the only drawback for me is their hours. They usually close at 7 during weekdays, I wish they were open for longer hours or maybe longer hours on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place after months and months of seeing shared Facebook posts promoting their food and drinks and I was not disappointed at all! I had their Lavender latte and it was so delicious. I've never had a coffee that tasted even kind of similar. Really refreshing, sweet but not too much. I had it iced and will definitely be back to try it hot. I also had a egg, cheese, and potato burrito and it was so good. The red salsa they give with the burritos is amazing. The people working were nice and cheery & the store itself is beautiful. I will definitely be back to try more of the goodies."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, food and coffee! Love their soups for lunch. The prices are great. I would for sure recommend this cute cafe. A must try!"}
{"text":"I am madly in love with the lavender white chocolate latte.  Its creamy and delish with the perfect amount of lavender where its not over powering and you can still taste the white chocolate.

I also highly recommend the breakfast burritos. The veggie Is my fave. Fluffy scrambled eggs laced with cheddar cheese and seasonal veggies.  The tortilla its self is something to talk about. Its fluffy and light almost like a pita in style. It really adds to make this burrito the stand out it is. Served with a side of salsa and big enough to share.

Not to mention this place is built on charity.  Part of the proceeds go to help refugees and all of the arts for sale inside are made by the refugees themselves.  This place is a definite on the list of places to go.!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, roasted by Cafe Esperanza and good beer on tap, including a dedicated \"Hop Head Tap\" for bitter beer lovers like myself. Happy hour from 3-6 puts their tasty draughts at $3. Wine, I believe, is also discounted. I haven't tried the food or pastries yet, but they look proper. Open wi-fi. Nice coffee house atmosphere with spacious and well lit indoor and outdoor seating. Live music on the weekends and even a conference room for meetings. They could probably do a bit more to block out the racket from 7th ave for the outdoor seating area, but the place has only been open for a few weeks. 

The cafe features arts and crafts made by refugees who were resettled in the Phoenix area. Proceeds from cafe go to funding Catholic Charities social equity programs. Despite the name, no actual refugees seem to work here and none of the menu items seem inspired by the diverse cuisine of the refugee communities. Would be nice to see some diversity behind the counter. 

My only other complaint is the endless Indie Pop playlist. While the volume and bpm are okay for working, it misses hip and lands somewhere between Tilly's and a Christian bookshop. 

A worthy endeavor and great place for coffee and lunch if you are feeling cramped at Copper Star. As of yet, it doesn't manage to pull off the dual cafe/bar vibe like Lux can, and thus is not really a place I would want to go for a drink unless it was a business-casual beer with coworkers."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy this great place. Great beer selection so it is a great happy hour or weekend spot. Great coffee so great morning on the go. Also have had some of their food and have enjoyed it. The staff are very friendly and the business model benefiting refugee services is awesome to support. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Since relocating to AZ, I've made it my mission to visit every cafe during the duration of my time here. I love the coffee culture here in Phoenix and The Refuge has been on my mind for a while now.

I'm a huge sucker for lavender flavored things and their \"The Lavender\" caught my eye, can we say it was lav(ender) at first sight?

Came in to do some studying and of course try their coffee. Got a medium, iced, Lavender which is just a latte with white chocolate Lavender simple syrup. (I know, how many times do I have to say Lavender in this review ... ) Typically priced drink and brought out to my table when it was ready. Good flavor, sweet but felt like it was lacking in the caffeine department. There's espresso in this right? Whatever, I'll take it.

Interesting atmosphere to study in, definitely not for me to say the least. The environment was loud with oldies music and overpowered by the smell of fried bacon odors wafting through the cafe. Now, now, I do love me some bacon ... but to have the entire cafe smell like a kitchen flat top stove the whole time is a bit much, too much. 

I would say this place would be great to grab a to-go drink if you're not looking to be powered up, for a bite to eat or to just read a book. Noticed a couple people on their phones during my time here, so study session environment? Not so much. My table was also super wobbly, but I just had to McGyver some post-it notes so my drink wouldn't topple over onto my laptop ... or the floor. Wi-Fi was decently fast and there are outlets located along the wall areas. Parking lot is conveniently located right next to the cafe, so you don't have to worry about that except for the lack of shaded spots."}
{"text":"Delectable eats and good service are a must to stay in business in central Phoenix these days, as they should be. But foodies will find few locales that serve the body and soul as does the Refuge. An operation is only as good as the people running it, and you wont find kinder staff or more savory storytellers than in this genuinely unique neighborhood nook. The history of the Refuge is as appetizing as the menu, which ranges from panini to tapas. Stimulants? Beer, wine, and beans. Beware, the Pope might be visiting. Ask Jess or Daniele, they'll tell you all about it."}
{"text":"The people and the food are great . Atmosphere is home-like , the people and servers are cheery , and make you feel welcomed. The menu is descriptive enough to know what in the drinks and food. I'd definitely would wanna visit here again to try the other items on the menu !"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic the service even better. The gentleman who rung us up was so knowledgable, remembered our names and my celiac-ness. They ran out of what we ordered and profusely apologized and offered us a solid alternative.

We ordered a salad and tacos (ended up getting the club sandwich due to tacos being sold out). Fresh great ingredients that I wouldn't make at home. 

The guy was a packer fan so I'm automatically biased but the whole experience was awesome."}
{"text":"Just another local bar that plays favorites to regulars as expected. Coffee and drinks are exceptional compared to food.  Bathroom is one of the cleanest I've seen. A nice homely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere, small selection of good quality food (we went for breakfast, egg sandwiches breakfast burritos oatmeal yogurt), excellent tea, nice art. Meeting room in back for groups. Friendly service. We'd go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great location for me! Nice, clean space. The drinks and food are really, REALLY good, the service is just kind of...cold?
Today I had a little apple tartlet with cheddar in the crust! Delicious! The cayenne mocha had just the right amount of spiciness to make it perfect. I forget the name of the other drink that I tried, it was a mocha made with dark chocolate and orange. Amazing.
The food is awesome, I've had the grilled cheese made with goat and cheddar cheeses (it's a must try combination) and the roasted beet salad, which is by far the best salad I've ever tried.
The prices are in-line with everywhere else, specialty drinks $4-5, the grilled cheese was $6 and the salad was $10.
The salad had the perfect beet to goat cheese ratio, but could have used quite a bit more lettuce. It was really an $8 salad. $2 more worth of lettuce next time please.
I would probably five this place a 5 star rating based on food and beverage alone, but only 3 stars (still A-OK) for service. While everyone is nice, no one is really friendly. I sat at the bar the first time and no one talked to me  and my attempts at small talk were awkwardly avoided. The Refuge Cafe has a lot of positive things its doing, why not talk about it to their customers?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very interesting latte choices I love. The cayenne lateral is great and I also love AZ sunset and the lavender isn't bad either.  They have almond milk too! And half your purchase goes to charity."}
{"text":"I ordered a yummy chorizo burrito with a lavender latte. It had a cozy environment and really nice staff. They raise their money for a great cause, and I definitely would return."}
{"text":"Love this place! The owner is super friendly and welcoming and makes awesome cappuccinos! The menu is very varied and offers everything from salads to burritos and sandwiches. There is also beer on tap and a great wine by the glass selection. I had the refuge foccacia panino and it was very fresh and tasty. I found the prices to be very reasonable. Overall a great place with a great vibe!"}
{"text":"Omggg. This is my favorite spot!!!!!! 2.3 seconds away from my house. :))) the people here is great, very friendly and energetic.

I always get the decafe chai latte :) yummmmmm
Sissy got the Nutella mocha. Ehhhh. She didn't like it so much  It was too bland. Not even sweet..

Deserts:: Baklava and the pumpkin cake is so delicious"}
{"text":"When your stuck some place over night... let's say an airport, let's say maybe one in Phoenix. You try and try to make it to the morning, without eating junk out of a vending machine with the hopes of finding a real meal in the A.M. hours. 
The Refuge Cafe, was my spot! All I needed to survived at this point was a great cup of coffee and the Refuge Cafe, nailed it! 
They had comfy chairs to sit in, a place to plug my phone and computer in, and that glorious cup of coffee, I had been dreaming about without actually falling asleep was finally in my hands.. Thanks Refuge Cafe.. You kept me alive another day!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place a few times when it was still a \"coming soon\"... and I'm glad I finally stopped in!  

Refuge's exposed brick walls and finished concrete floors provide a cool modern look in a chill, comfortable, and relaxing environment.

The barristas/staff all seem friendly and knowledgeable and it's actually a fairly bustling place for having been open a relatively short period of time.

For food, I have only tried the prosciutto bruschetta... and for $3 it was good, but small (two pieces), but it definitely hit the spot!

Cupcakes are the standard make-at-home size, but only $2.  I will be sure to try them.  Today's special cupcake was a gingerbread cupcake with crushed ginger and raisins... and it was a larger size, but still only $2!

Wifi + espresso + cheap eats = me coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"I went to the Refuge yesterday after yoga for breakfast and coffee (sorry for my gross self coming in, haha) as part of my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw!). The people working here were nice enough and the prices were pretty standard. I got a latte and a bacon/egg/cheese/potato breakfast burrito. The 4 star review is really for the latte alone, the latte was very good...the burrito, on the other hand, was not very good at all. It was very large, too big for just me. It had a lot of egg in it compared to other ingredients and didn't have much flavor (was supposed to be southwestern, not sure what made it southwestern at all). It was served with some terrible, flavorless salsa... just overall not impressive. I would come back for coffee, but not for food."}
{"text":"Had one of the best dirty chai lattes I have ever had. I'll be visiting more just for that! The ladies at the front were so sweet."}
{"text":"They've made a regular out of me after only two visits! This place has great coffee with house made syrups (today I had coffee cardamom). They serve beer and wine later on in the day. Their breakfast burritos are HUGE and delicious!! If you haven't hit up this melrose district coffee shop you definitely should!!"}
{"text":"Soooo impressed.  I have lived in this hood for 10 years, never stopped her.  First the food is like something you would get when you stop by your moms house for dinner. Second its with a purpose! All profits benefit local charities.  They provide employment to veterans, refugies and local kids.  Last Saturday crepes!!!! Givebit a try."}
{"text":"I had read about this place and wanted to check it out since it opened.  Since I needed to meet with a couple of people in the area, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity.  It is a great place to hold a casual meeting.  The atmosphere was inviting, and we all enjoyed our drinks (REAL apple juice...not the super-sweet garbage in a bottle that most places have...for me coffee for the other two people).  The paintings on the wall are interesting, and the artists receive 100% of the proceeds on the sales.  It is the ideal way to support a terrific cause for this non-profit as they help refugees."}
{"text":"Moved across the street a few months ago now and have stopped by at The Refuge a handful of times. 
Lox bagel hit the sweet spot on a heavy craving day. 
Absolutely enamored with the thick, natural serums they use of their Italian sodas - homemade in which I can taste the raspberry pieces as opposed to the standard sugary sweeteners. 
Staff is always friendly and engaging. In my college days, I spent the majority of my time in a similar cafe environment and seek it out whenever I relocate - happy to have found one so close by!!"}
{"text":"Great feel to this place it is unique.  Friendly helpful staff. Fresh crisp vegetables and the hummus is to die for. It was an experience.  Loved it. Price is worth it. Atmosphere was calm, soft music perfect setting to anjoy a good meal. Might be considered a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I had no clue that this place spends all its profits on charity when I first came here.  I assumed \"Refuge\" meant that it was a cool place to get away from the Phoenix heat (I moved here in summer).  I thought I had just found a nice, comfy place to chill, drink a good cup of joe, and relax with a textbook.  Refuge had 5/5 stars from me previously, but now that I know, it's earned the coveted 6th star.

If you're a mocha fan, get the Haboob.  Refuge also has some spicy coffee that my husband loves and an orange-flavored coffee that tastes incredible.  I haven't had any of the plain old black coffee yet since I've had so much fun experimenting with the other fancy options.  If you'd rather have a drink, though, they have reasonably-priced mixed drinks, beer and wine, and fun food platters (hummus!) for when you study up an appetite.

Go grab a drink at a coffee-shop/bar with a social mission!"}
{"text":"Perfect little road stop. Quiet, super chill atmosphere. They normally serve breakfast only til 11am but made an exception for us since they had breakfast fixin's still. We hadn't even told her that's what we wanted. The menu is small and you order at the counter like a deli. The breakfast sandwich for $5. Served very fast and filled us right up containing the protein I needed to get me from hangry to serene. A perfect little stop with some pretty cool art for sale too made by local refugees. All proceeds from this little cafe go to local programs run by Catholic charities."}
{"text":"So happy to find this place.  I have lived for years in Wellington New Zealand and miss the great cafe culture. This place brought it back. Very friendly and accommodating. I felt like  I could stay for hours."}
{"text":"The Veggie wrap was Delish. This is an awesome place. I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said except maybe I would like to curl up here for a few hours with a great book. If you have to eat good food and drink good coffee why not donate to charity at the same time? I love eating and shopping for a cause."}
