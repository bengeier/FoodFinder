{"text":"Closed. Closed? CLOSED?! Again? I agree Stephanie C., this place is cursed. It has to be because Vdara was amazing. so sad."}
{"text":"After finding out that our first choice was fully booked for dinner the other night we ended up at Vdara after my husband pronounced \"I've had a fancy burger there before.\" I didn't care where we went, I was starved.

Looking at the cheesy logo and the trying to be hip modern d√©cor I wasn't that enthused, but once I sat in the comfy chair I was quickly convinced. Our waiter was a sweetheart, asking the kitchen to cut us some bread when I mentioned that I could eat a horse. The bread was simple and delicious with oil, salt and pepper, but the best part about it was that it wasn't a trouble to get, and that he went out of his way.

I had the seared tilapia and he had the gnocchi with mushrooms. I say yuck to his, only because I hate mushrooms (devil spawn), but he loved it. And the tilapia was the best meal I'd had in a really, really long time. In fact I will go back JUST to eat it - though the waiter also suggested the chicken, stating it's his favorite. (I love when staff will actually seem interested in their place of work because you can learn so much about the food from them.)

In short, great service, delicious food, a little off-putting that it wasn't busy, but didn't matter because it was so great!

P.S. I wouldn't really ever eat a horse. I'm just not that adventurous and I fear the horse's family would attack me in \"The Ring\" style later in my life."}
{"text":"One thing I really like about Vdara is that I can go there after work without feeling out of place which I can't say about most of the bars in the area.

I really like the look of the place. It is a sort of modern and 'clean' look which I'm pretty in to. In addition, they hang paintings and photographs by local artists (which I believe are for sale as well) which they rotate fairly frequently. 

The two large street windows are completely open (they have those pull down garage type windows) which I feel gives the place a great atmosphere as you get a lot of ambience from the street - it's also fun to people watch the people waiting for the street car if the company is boring. They also have a very large patio, which is pretty nice as well.

I have found the staff to be extremely friendly and am usually welcomed by someone as I walk in the door, which I really like. The food here is also very great and very reasonably priced. On Tuesdays they have $4 selected bottles of beer and live music. I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Our friends thought Vdara was the coolest of some Queen West options we proposed. I made a reservation and they had our table ready. The bar area is the focus of this restaurant. A good place for drinks, maybe, after work. When we walked in from the cold, we actually barely noticed everyone was wearing coats inside, too.  And our friends, already seated told us the heater was broken.  We sit down and the server attentively comes over and asks if we have heard the problem for tonight. We say, Yes, the heater is out. He says, \"Oh yeah, that, but we can't do Debit or Credit, either. Our machines are broken.\"  
So, we get to sit in 5 degree weather, eat cold food and then have to pay cash? No thank you.  We didn't stay long enough to even taste the ice-cold water. 
They had my phone number- they should have called us and told us the reservation was going to have problems.  And, then they should have closed the restaurant for the night. It was a waste of time."}
{"text":"Vdara is closed?!*

This was a shocker to find this out when I walked passed it last night. 

A large \"For Lease\" sign rested on one of the tables by the window (EDIT: it's hanging from the window) and a letter taped to the window pane, detailing that the establishment was closed and the locks changed by the landlord. 

Is this place cursed? Before Vdara was Satori Supper Club which seemed a little too glitzy and pretentious for West Queen West. It closed down after a few months in the exact same fashion. Before that was Habitat but I don't recall how they closed and if it's all the same owners for all of the three establishments. Do they not pay rent? Who knows. 

I'm disappointed. I've passed by this place a hundred times and I never got to enjoy the establishment first hand. I'm disappointed that I won't get to eat their food as their menu items seemed absolutely delicious! Nor will I get to sit on their large patio for brunch, or dance to DJ Lazarus on Friday nights. 

Note to self: Never, never, ever let a business pass you by without trying it first. As a Yelper, I should know this, shouldn't I?

* A date on the posted foreclosure letter showed December 2. Now, apparently the resto was active on Twitter as of yesterday, which confuses me. Perhaps the resto will open again and perhaps I jumped the gun by announcing its closure. But there's nothing quite as obvious as the 'For Lease' sign in the storefront window. We'll see what happens next."}
{"text":"Neutrally elegant black & beige decor meets funky light fixtures and amazing local art for sale on the walls. Nice wine list serves an eclectic palette; even enjoyed a glass of Cava here, so summer sipping can't be beat on the patio. Nice brunch choice with lots of menu options."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night for a Song Writer's Circle (which they have every week). It was great fun-- of course, a major lack of crowd considering the night, but the talent was spectacular, and they have a deals on Mill St. beer every Tuesday, I believe it was $3.50 (plus tax) for one. I highly recommend the Organic Mill St. This stuff is like water, I drank three of them before realizing I was drunk. On a Tuesday. Fantastic!

Apart from that, the decor is really suave and mod, you feel like you've entered a first class bar. The servers were super friendly, too.  Not too mention their food menu looks DELISH!
It would be interesting to see what it's like here on a Friday, but if you have time to kill on a Tuesday, most definitely go check out the talent!!"}
{"text":"\"Who ordered bubble tea?!\" Mike S shrieked as our drink order made its way to the table. Um, that would be me, apparently, where bubble tea = yummy white wine sangria stuffed with blueberries and mint. It was overwhelmingly delicious. 

I can't comment on the food as I haven't had dinner here (yet) but for DJ nights and mixed drinks, Vdara is A-OK. I love Friday nights for DJ Lazarus' \"Music For The Masses\" 80s/90s throwback. You can request songs and - get this - he actually plays them! Also, unlike some DJs, Lazarus has a well stocked roster of songs from the era he's DJing and so you'll rarely hear the disappointing \"I don't have/know that song.\"

Waiter service is a bit spotty in the late hours of the night (just go up to the bar already!) and I can see slush becoming a problem in the winter as there is no foyer or coat check and the walk-ins directly from Queen Street can make a mess of the floor."}
