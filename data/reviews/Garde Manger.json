{"text":"Myself and a friend were visiting the area from The United States.  We have a friend in Montreal who was able to get us a reservation at this restaurant.  We were very excited to be able to eat here during our trip.  We had an 830 reservation and we walked from our hotel not that far away.  We arrived about 20 minutes early and we were told we could sit and have a drink at the bar.  When we approached the bar to sit the bartender asked if we had \"permission\" to sit at the bar, which i thought was kind of strange.  After informing him that we did have \"permission\", he asked us what we would like to drink.  Two of us ordered a Pinot Noir and one ordered a mixed drink.  We sat chatting until our table was ready.  The waitress was very nice but must have been very busy that evening because she was slow coming to the table.  We ordered another round of drinks.  When she came back she poured a different wine and we told her we had the Pinot Noir.  She came back to the table and told us that they didn't have any Pinot Noir that evening and wasn't sure which wine the bartender had given us. They finally figured it out and it wasn't what we had even asked for originally.  We decided to just have the original wine and let it slide being we were so excited to be there.  We ordered the Lobster Poutin to start and also placed our dinner orders.  We were served bread thankfully because it took forever to get the Poutin which the three of us ate in no time because the portion (and we ordered the meal size) was quite small.  We had to cut the lobster pieces on top so that the three of us would at least get some lobster.  We sat talking and waiting for dinner for a very long time.  Finally the food came out and we started to eat.  The waitress then came over and kept trying to clear dishes while we were eating.  We finished up dinner and were waiting for the waitress to come back to give us the desert menu but that didn't happen.  A male came over and put a small piece of cheesecake down and said this is on the house and could we please hurry because they needed our table!!! Are they kidding me.  It was not our fault that they took so long serving us dinner but now they didn't offer us a desert menu or coffee and they throw our one small desert for 3 people and ask us to hurry so they can have the table.  We paid the overpriced bill and left and got our coffee elsewhere.  Not happy was an understatement.  Overpriced, small portions, slow service (until they need your table), never offered a dessert and coffee menu.... We ate at much better restaurants during our week long trip..."}
{"text":"The food at this place was pretty good, but I'd like to tell you about a fellow patron who absolutely ruined the meal for us.

He was a boisterous man, he was an obnoxious man. He thought he was a man of class, but he was actually just an ass. The martini he ordered he deemed was too strong, the manager however thought the ugly man was wrong. They had a tiff over this cocktail, one that should have been ended quickly and without fail. But it didn't really. And the fellow patrons (like me) had to endure this insecure asshat's bluster. Shouldn't the manager have diffused the situation quickly for the sake of the rest of us?"}
{"text":"I would say this place is pretty overrated. Staff is fun and the place has a cool vibe. It's also very loud (or at least it was when I went). The food is good but definitely not amazing. My octopus appetizer was tough and not particularly tasty. The gnocchi with braised beef cheeks was pretty good with a nice reduction but nothing memorable about it otherwise. The bread was  uninspired and could be from anywhere. I would take a place like Bouillion Bilk over this any day."}
{"text":"Great spot ( we were treated by raging fire place), good food, nice wine list ( although no local Canadian options) and amazing service. Will return next time I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Wow what a great night! We have been there a couple of times and it is always great food, great ambiance and friendly service. Really one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Worth every penny. Be careful not to eat too much! Seafood is A+! Seriously good

Wow. Worth every penny; even sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"My wife is a big fan of Chuck Hughes so I surprised her for our anniversary dinner. Although Chuck wasn't in that night, we really enjoyed the food and ambiance. I'm a big fan of seafood, so I ordered a scallop entree, which turned out to be the best scallops  I've ever had. Even my wife who isn't a big fan of scallops loved my entree and said it was possibly one of the best things she's eaten. Awesome and professional service. Highly recommended! Will definitely come back and looking forward to trying Chuck's other restaurant, Le Bremner."}
{"text":"I don't think the right words exist for me to describe this place. If anything it was more of a feeling and an experience than just a dinner.

We walked in at 6:30 for a 7pm reservation and the very friendly host sat us down right away at a perfectly cozy booth.

The menu changes frequently so they don't actually hand out menus, instead they are written in both french and english on chalkboards around the restaurant. There is an option of about 7-8 appetizers and 7-8 mains, all of which are explained by the extremely friendly and pleasant wait staff. Everything on the menus looked appetizing so it was hard to choose but you really couldn't go wrong. Prices range from about $15 appetizers to $36 mains.

We ordered the traditional Lobster Poutine to start which was perfect and there was not even one bite left. My friend and I ordered the scallops and gnocchi as well as the stuffed quail with creamed kale to split. Again, there was nothing left on the plate and every bite was better than the last. For dessert we opted for the fried mars bar with ice cream on the side. It was interesting because its such a simple concept but it complemented the feel of the restaurant and comfort food of the menu. 

I believe we stayed for 2.5 hours. I don't think we really wanted to leave

On top of that, the night we were there Chuck Hughes himself happened to be filming a shucking oysters segment for his show so we were lucky enough to spend some time chatting with him and getting a photo op. He was beyond friendly and made our time there that much more enjoyable. I will definitely be making my way back there or to his other restaurant during my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Chuck's TV personality but didn't have too-high expectations about this place. And even still, it certainly did disappoint! (Then again, it could have just been a general letdown after the euphoria of eating at Au Pied Du Cochon the night before... but more on that in another review). Anyway, let's start with the atmosphere: we had the earliest reservation available (5:30pm; not by choice) and felt like we were intruding on a casual hangout. One of the servers was DJing via laptop behind the bar. I'm usually not this critical but come on, this is an \"exclusive\" restaurant, have a damn soundtrack or at least surf YouTube somewhere you can't be seen. The other thing  - the bartender told us the cocktail specials - one was something with a vodka base; behind her were varied top-shelf vodkas. We were sitting at the bar so we saw her make the actual cocktail, and it was made with Smirnoff. Not a classy move, guys. Hide that stuff if you're gonna do it.

Onto the food. It just wasn't very good. Tasted fresh enough, but not special or delicious by any means. The lobster poutine had like half a piece of lobster on it. We got the smaller portion and she said it wouldn't have big pieces, but it barely had ANY pieces. And the broth didn't taste very rich or lobstery either - it wasn't even salty enough. The mushroom tart we got tasted fresh but BLAND. Really bland. The bison tartare was quite good. That's all we had. The desserts didn't sound very appetizing.

What a disappointment -- not to mention that this place is located in the horse-smelling touristy \"old\" village. Avoid it."}
{"text":"I'm a Montrealer who's eaten at many of the city's top restaurants over the years. But for some reason, I never got to Garde Manger. I tried, on occasion to make a reservation online but it was always booked months in advance. I finally got a reservation for this past Friday. We arrived a bit early and we're seated in the back part of the restaurant right away. I was surprised to see such limited choice on the blackboard menu, which, by the way was practically impossible to read from where we were sitting. In either case, no single appetizer or entre jumped out at us. So we went with the chef's menu to get a taste of everything. This came with a variety shellfish including shrimps, lobster, oysters plus smoked arctic char and albacore tuna tartar. The char and tartar were excellent. The rest of the seafood platter was fine...how hard is it to screw up boiled shrimp and lobster? At $100 per person, I was expecting to be wow'd in the subsequent courses. I wasn't. Not saying it wasn't good but I expected more, especially given Garde Manger and chef Hughe's reputation. Second course included a birri tomato salad with focaccia cheese, a spicy zucchini salad with a deep fried zucchini with cheese and finally some beef carpaccio. It was good but didn't blow me away. The final course included scallops with pork belly and corn, pork tenderloin with jalape√±o grits and spaetzle with mushrooms and onions. The pork and scallops were very good and I didn't really care for the spaetzle.

Overall, I would say it was OK but nothing to rave about. Honestly, I don't understand the fuss over this place. This is comfort food. It's also a laid back place with patrons in t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops. I was expecting a more refined and sophisticated culinary experience. Frankly, I expect more for $350 (2 people including 2 cocktails and a glass of wine each). The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. Now that I've experienced Garde Manger, I won't be sorry if I don't go back for a while. I think there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal that can offer superior, more refined food for the same money."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant.We went to Garde Manger Friday night and had the best meal ever.The service was top notch and made our night even better (Erica our waitress Sam our bartender and Alexander overseeing everything).You will not be disappointed if you go to Garde Manger."}
{"text":"Biz trip to Montreal, Garde Manger was our client's #1 recco. Dropped in without a reservation (not recommended, I'm told) but they had a table for two. 

Great room. Completely unpretentious but great home-baked ambience.

Service from everyone was fast and friendly. Really friendly.

And then, what matters, good food. Can only attest for the scallops myself, but they were beautiful. Lobster salad in the hollowed potato was to die for. House Sangiovese hit the spot. Mmmmmm.

My colleague vouches for the Steak Tartare and Risotto."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, this place rocks. Beautiful interior, funky atmosphere and nom nom delicious food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Amazing vibe, decor, and music in Old Montreal. They have staple dishes, such as the giant Ceasar with a whole crab leg, a fried Mars bar for dessert, and the giant seafood platters. I`m actually not a big fan of seafood, so I get the beef short ribs marinated in Root Beer. Amazing. You need to reserve in advance even if it`s to sit at the bar - it`s not that big of a place -- but if you call a few days or even hours ahead you might get lucky. Last time we went, we paid $130 plus tax and tip for two full meals with appetizer and dessert plus four drinks plus coffee. The service was amazing too. Outstanding restaurant!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a delicious romaine salad and artic char. One of the better meals I've had in awhile and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"We went to Garde Manger at the recommendation of a friend who is also a \"foodie\" and were very blown away by the experience. We sat at the bar (in the new section in the back of the restaurant), which I prefer so that we can talk to the bartenders and folks around us. What better way to get recommendations than from those in the \"know?\" 

The menu was in French. My partner doesn't speak French, and as soon as the waiter heard me translating, he came over to explain it further. WOW. What customer service. 

I started with the steak and eggs with fois gras. It was beyond scrumptious. My partner had the salad which had fresh veggies and these little fried cheese bread \"croutons\" that were out of this world. Only issue, the portions were huge, and I was pretty full following the apps. For mains, my partner had the lobster risotto which there were no words for how fantastic it was. Huge chunks of lobster and not as much rice as you find in most risottos (which was fantastic to us). The flavors blended and just balanced perfectly. I had fish which was cooked perfectly! All in all, a fantastic dining experience.

But the best part was the interaction with the staff. Tim and (we think) Jason were awesome! They chatted with us all night like we've known each other a million years. They gave us recommendations of other restaurants in the city, even things to do. Seriously, felt like we met new friends. Tim told us about a new restaurant from the folks behind Garde (Le Bremner), and sure enough when we went on Monday - the whole crew was there. Perfection!

Bottom line: GO! The food is fantastic. The ambiance is awesome. And the staff, oh the staff - priceless!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn in deciding between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm going with three because I think the overall dining experience was far too rushed, especially for the price.  The service felt almost as quick as fast food and that is the opposite of what my wife and I expected (after hearing so many great things).

The food itself was very good.  I neither have great compliments nor complaints in that regard.  We enjoyed everything we ordered and the prices were not unreasonable.

Here's the negative...The pace of the meal was terrible.  Our lobster poutine seemed to arrive less than a minute after being ordered.  Our entrees arrived at just about the same rate.  The entire dining experience felt extremely rushed, as if the goal was to fed us, get the money and seat the next party of 2.  If not for the McDonald's pace, we would have been happy to linger, order more cocktails and enjoy the ambience.  Instead, we were out of the door not long after we entered.  For me, a veteran of the hospitality industry, it's hard to separate the food from the hospitality experience...and Garde Manger really struck out where it could have excelled."}
{"text":"All three courses were delicious and reasonably priced.  Both seafood and meat dishes were cooked perfectly.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"LOVED the food, LOVED the atmosphere. 
But our server was very rude. we sat in the back (tiny girl, dark brown long ponytail- didn't even catch her name) Poor service in general. Spilt glass of wine on my friend, and still charged her for it. Rarely checked up on us, claimed that if we didn't order an appetizer, we would have to wait a 'long time' for our mains. (not exactly how restaurants work, but okay.. ) and basically made us feel uncomfortable because we didn't order an app, and responding to everything we said with a little bit of attitude..but food ended up coming pretty quickly and we weren't disappointed. 
Awesome caesars. and a great view of the kitchen staff dancing around clearly loving their job. it was pretty entertaining."}
{"text":"Everything about this place has big $$$ attached to it. If you want a cheap dinner obviously avoid!! Me and the girlies were in Montreal this past Dec. and came to this place because of the reviews and its a Celeb Chef resto.
Wasn't too hard to get a reservation b/c we went on a Tuesday. We ordered and shared the lobster poutine as appetizer for $20 it was good and was generous with the lobster however the portion was rather tiny...I kept eyeing the couple next to us that had some kind of avacodo appetizer, it looked soooo tasty.

The waitress was nice and took the time to explain to us their ever changing menu. In the end I ordered the duck close to $40 which was good but towards the end i ate something that tasted really bitter...didnt know wtf it was (since the place was pitch black practically), perhaps the cheese but it sorta ruined it for me. We all ordered different plates so we can eat off eachother and their food was super tasty (pork belly, lobster risotto and chicken with mash)! Good music and interesting atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, fantantic service and AMAZING food. So glad I managed to get a reservatiom thru the DINR app. 

Had the ahi tuna, raw scallops, hanger steak with zuchinni salad, scallops and charred corn, and housemade peanut butter and chocolate hazelnut spread pastries. 

Good way to wrap up our Montreal stay. Worth every $$ spent."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian - so not sure how much my review counts. I knew I wasn't going to have the best meal of my life since it's a meat/seafood place. 

The atmosphere was absolutely awesome. I loved it. We sat at the bar, chatted with the people beside us, had some laughs, bopped to the music - 5 stars on atmosphere alone. I love great food without the snootiness of 'white table cloth' style restaurants.

My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal that included: a massive seafood platter to start, lobster risotto for a main and this dessert with peanut butter and jam. I don't think he said one word while eating - he liked it so much.

If I were rating just on my meal, probably give it 2-3 stars. My appetizer salad was HUGE - it could have been a meal on its own. I had the avocado/tomato salad. There were way too many onions in it for me - I would have loved to be able to taste the fresh heirloom tomatoes. The fried cheese was also cold and rock hard. I ate maybe half of this. My main was a vegetable risotto. The rice was still crunchy. While I was expecting 'al dente' - it actually had crunch. It also had a smoke flavour - which I didn't quite understand.  I don't think I ate more than half of this either. The dessert that we had was a peanut butter cookie type of thing with ice cream and jam. Meh. Not my thing. 

Overall, great atmosphere, probably great food for meat eaters (I'm guessing), poor choice for vegetarians. I didn't find it overly expensive - but it's definitely not cheap either. I still had a great time, but going back would be pretty pointless for me."}
{"text":"We were in town only for a few days and so we weren't able to get a reservation but I should have called to check!  In any case we were walking by after dinner and stopped there for drinks at the bar.  We were surprised to see the place pretty empty.  Oh well... The service was impeccable and the drink specials and selection heavenly!  Not a full bar I think but they had some real beauties (ie Japanese whisky and some other liquors that I rarely see but wish I had a higher alcohol tolerance to try them all).  The music selection was awesome as well (sounded like my playlist between a few late 80s songs with more recent ones) and set at the right volume so you can hum along but still hold a conversation.  We didn't eat but the food around us looked amazing and our drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"Somehow the Westin concierge got a 7:30p, Saturday reservation for four of us. We are visiting from Illinois and attending the Jazz Fest.
Foods and services were great, the best in the week in Montreal.  I recommend the short ribs and lobster salad."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this place I wanted to try it myself a little disappointed nothing to brag about every dish was over salted lobster poutine nothing special can be done at home and overpriced."}
{"text":"Brilliant.  An all around great dining expereince.

Lobster Poutine and Octopus with Chorizo were our apps. 

Mains were braised short ribs and lobster roll with match stick frites.

Mini ice cream sandwiches and s'mores cake was the perfect way to round out the meal"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow. The scallops and pork belly was out of this world amazing. The staff are so friendly, the food was so fresh and flavourful and the atmosphere is second to none. Don't hesitate to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Valentines Day Weekend 2015 - Went for the scallops to have our host inform us that they had run out of them amongst other dishes. Ordered the gnocchi beef cheek for app which was ok... then the cod and clams for my main. The whole time there was a very drunk guy at the bar walking around the restaurant doing shots with various people including the cooks.. who wants a noisy stranger passing shots across the grill while your food is being prepared?!? Not me. Finally when we got our main of Cod and Clams the cod was raw and cold in the centre.. I sent it back and received the very same dish back with the same issue as if the cooks did nothing at all. I just pushed it aside and told the host I did not want anything else. I went with high expectations to be terribly dissappointed. There was no executive chef in the kitchen which left us with a very mediocre soo chef at best. The only way I'd ever  visit there again is if  Chuck Huges sends us a personal invite.. like he ever reads his reviews anyhow. I felt very let down Chuck and you are one of my favorites.¬†We flew in from Newfoundland and frequently dine at fine restaurants. I guess our expectations were too high compared to other experiences such as Raymonds and Modavie etc..

{"text":"My better or best dinning experience in Montreal, Located in old city...  We sat at the bar for dinner which we booked 5 days in advance, cause the rest of the place had been booked for months as its so popular, which was a treat in its self as we got more attention. The room is small but full of hip beautiful energy... the service is top notch and the menu was even better, and of course had the lobster poutine which for the price is worth it..."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the bar in the back room last week and David was our server. He was most likely the best waiter we've ever had in any restaurant. He was incredibly attentive without being invasive, enthusiastic without being overbearing. He was perfectly knowledgable about each dish and helped us decide what to order. The best waiters have a way of doing things you wouldn't even consider to enhance the experience, and David did that on multiple occasions. We'll be back for the terrific food and hope to run into David again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Great decor, ambiance, the place lets clubbers come in after 10-11 and dance in the middle of the place, despite it being so small. But the music and the vibe are so good, you can't do anything else but crack a smile and order more drinks.
Now for the food, I had the lobster poutine...simply divine. My girlfriend and her friend both had the shrimp risotto and both complained it was too salty. The fried Mars chocolate bar is an absolute MUST in dessert."}
{"text":"Went on 6/18/12.  Started with the specialty cocktails and the lobster poutine and the avocado salad.  All very delicious!  I had the short ribs and my husband the steak!  Both really great portions and awesome flavors.

The dining atmosphere and location is great too!  Took a nice long walk afterwards because we we're so full :)"}
{"text":"Went here with three other people. Collectively, we kept ordering until we tried more than half of what was listed on the blackboard that day, including braised rabbit risotto, and cornish hens stuffed with foie gras, as well as a giant seafood platter that came served in a trough. My only complaint was that the rabbit we ordered was a little salty. Other than that, everything was amazing.

Note: We booked seats farrrr in advance and recommend you do the same!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at the Garde Manger. An avid Chuck Hughes fan and foodie, I was looking forward to this meal and was not disappointed in the least. We had the famous Lobster poutine, Braised short ribs and the tomato and fried cheddar salad. Fantastic!!!!!!  Unfortunately, we had no room for desert. The only downfall is that I didn't get to meet my culinary hero Chuck. Maybe next time, because there certainly will be a next time."}
{"text":"OMG the food is so good! It's very expensive though. Good portions. Great intimate ambiance. Very impressive date location."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service! We opted for the chef's tasting menu and recommend this if you want to try several menu items. For $60 pp we received a platter of 15 oysters and smoked salmon, 5 appetizers, and 4 entrees split amongst 5 people. Portion sizes were generous! We took leftovers home to enjoy the next day! Will definitely come back here the next time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"You will miss it if you are looking for it, it's on a side street without signs, look for the purple light, literally. The ambience is great very good lighting and great vibe. The food flavours are just amazing (maybe best I have ever had)!! The only disappointment was the Lobster Poutine nothing special, maybe the expectations were too high, and also the Risotto portion was not appropriate, left wanting more."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the bar on a weekday night at a 9:30 reservation. It was a wonderful night made special by Morgan who made our seafood plate. We had the Lobster Poutine, a salad and split the medium seafood plate. I definitely will return and ask for a seat at the bar again. The music set the atmosphere, the staff was super friendly; it felt like we were at a get together for a large extended family. Thanks to all of you especially Morgan for a great night and an outstanding meal."}
{"text":"it's been almost two months since i visited montreal and garde manger and i would totally go back if only to have dinner here again.  the service was friendly and patient. the chalkboard menu was a bit hard to read from our angle at the bar, but our waitress was kind enough to go through every item with their lengthy descriptions.  the bar tender threw in some extra oysters, which were shucked right in front of us. then the entre...i had the duck...oh the duck...so good...so tender.  others have praised the duck here and they were not exaggerating. best i've ever had.  there is really only one problem with this restaurant - being located 600 miles away from my front door."}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful dining experience! Well worth advanced reservations and savoring all courses! 

The inside is intimate, but rustic enough to be relaxing. Our waitress was very professional, helpful, and down-to-earth. She was very helpful and ran through all the menu offerings for the evening. 

To start, we drank their cocktail-of-the-day, something with muddled blueberries - it was delicious and very refreshing. The lobster poutine and fresh oysters were delightful. For a main course, I highly recommend the Braised Short Rib. It was heavenly - a generous (but every bit enjoyable) portion of meat cooked to perfection that could be cut with a fork. The lobster risotto and special gnocci dish were equally well-enjoyed. The waitress suggested perfect wine pairings for the meal too! 

The two desserts I tried were good - a warm strawberry crisp and molasses \"cookies\". They weren't as fabulous as our previous courses ... but still well-enjoyed by everyone. 

Apparently, Chuck works the counter when he's in town. The restaurant is extremely well-run when he's gone, and I will have to go back to Garde Manger in the future. I think the Braised Short-rib would be even more amazing in the winter! :)"}
{"text":"I love you, Chuck Hughes.

You know the way to my heart:  Lobster Poutine.

Garde Manger is absolutely my favourite restaurant in Montreal, and it is not just because I'm a bit of a celebrity chef groupie. The restaurant has a great  vibe - it feels warm and cozy, the perfect place to curl up for some comfort food, yet the eclectic music and vibrant clientele make you want to get up and party.

What can I say about the food? I've already mentioned my love for the lobster poutine. The scallops were meaty, flavourful and surprisingly filling. Though I was stuffed from all the food and wine, I couldn't resist the deep fried Mars bar with ice cream for dessert - yum.

My only complaint: it was really, truly, Chuck's day off."}
{"text":"We made last-minute reservations here after receiving a glowing recommendation from a local couple - all that was available was a late seating at the bar, but I'm very glad we took it! We did have to wait about 10-15 minutes past our reservation time to get seated, but the host did his best and there was a nice fire to keep us warm in the waiting area. 

Our seat ended up being at the oyster bar, which not everyone would enjoy, but we found it interesting. It was great to witness employees who actually seem to like their jobs and the food served!

We decided to have the $80 chef's choice tasting option, and although our total bill with drinks and gratuity ended up coming to about $300, I feel that it was a very good value for the amount, quality, and variety of food we were given. Dishes varied from a chilled seafood platter (my first time having freshly grated horseradish!) to endive salad to a sort of surf and turf main dish. Everything was fresh and tasty - the only thing that we felt could have been better was the pork belly dish. The wine recommendation was right on. Dessert included an apple crisp with brown butter ice cream and two very decadent chocolate peanut butter puffs."}
{"text":"have to say we were not looking at this spot to eat while on a short 4 day Montreal vacation. as it turned out it was a 3 minute walk from our condo. Walked in and had a reservation for the same night.
 Lets just say that we were dissapointed. Mostly with the service. I had oysters ( very good) cod fitters with creme freshe and cavier( so so) and the short ribs ( excellent) My partner had Steak frites. She ordered med rare and it came blue and was not a good cut at all. The reason for the 3 * is we felt that from the moment we sat down we were getting pushed out. Our waitress was like a waterbug. Never having time for any freindly chatter ( which we enjoy) There were plenty of servers so this shouldnt have been a problem. All in all not a \"fun\" or \"gastro\" experience."}
{"text":"Went here after a business trip to Montreal on a Friday around 6:30pm with no reservation (which clearly seems necessary if you aren't going solo. Got a seat at the bar next to the 3 rotating iPod DJ/ Oyster shucker. Stylish folk and not to crazy b/c it was still early. Service was great. The bartender was attentive and helpful.
Went with the tomato salad w/ avocado and those fluffy cheddar croutons which were phenomenal. Best and richest salad I can remember having. Then I went with the halibut which was quite tasty with the veal stock and sitting on a bed of pierogis.
 Only caveat is it's a wine place so beer selection was limited and lacking. Had a pilsner from Brewery Montreal that was just blah.
Overall Highly recommend! Go! Go now!"}
{"text":"We came here because of a friend's recommendation, not because we knew anything about the celebrity chef. Maybe it was that ignorance that prompted us to boldly call the restaurant at 8 on a Saturday night to see if they had space for 2 (they did!)

The restaurant is lovely, and the neighborhood is gorgeous. I agree that it's pretentious that they don't have a sign, but whatever, we found it. My partner got the foie gras and the lobster special and proclaimed it delicious; I had mixed greens and Steak Diane... the sauce was wonderful. We had great service at the bar, it was all very convivial and warm... a very nice experience."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I have ever been to in Montreal. Ive been twice in the last year both times were incredible not just the food but also the atmosphere and service is friendly. Prices are affordable."}

{"text":"Garde manger is a foodie dream for this girl! First visit, chuck was expediting and took a minute to chat and pose for a pic. Love him, he looks chubby on tv but in person he's skinny! Anyhoo, lets talk turkey. Well, oysters first. They have multiple varieties available, the servers know how each oyster is different than the other, and the condiments are top-notch: finely grated fresh horseradish, delicious mignonette and lovely lemon. Ok, chuck didn't make the lemons but the oyster platter was unbelievably good! If you like oysters in a just a little bit, you love these, and if you like oysters, you will be in oyster heaven. If you've never tried them before, order just one! Give it a try! 

The braised short ribs are delicious. Lobster poutine, meh. I love lobster, but I like it naked and cold not all saucy and hot. But if you like lobster, fries and cheese goodness, you will love this dish. Best fries ever, the curd cheese was perfect. 

What strikes me as profound, is that the side dishes at this restaurant are usually so well prepared and delicious, I tend to eat the veggies before getting to the meat! The best Swiss chard ever, the most delicious roasted cauliflower! 

If you love cocktails, you will love this place! Try their drink of the day, and/or have the special bloody Ceasar. I like spicy food, but find when you ask for no or less spice, it works better in this drink with a huge snowcrab claw as a stir stick! 

Love the food, love chuck. Pants are tight when you leave here, so plan to take a walk!"}
{"text":"I have never given such a bad review but was so disappointed in this restaurant that i felt it necessary to do so. Service was okay. I asked the server to recommend some dishes and he wouldn't. The food was not good,  and while I'm fine paying for an expensive meal that I enjoyed, at garde manger, we paid for an expensive meal that was less than ok. It was the worst short rib that I've ever eaten. Flavors didn't work and was nothing special. Spicy jerk crab legs were small and had little meat, esp for the price. I didn't care for lobster poutine. It was the one thing that my husband enjoyed. The only dish I enjoyed was the lentil and goat cheese bruschetta. We came to Montreal and wanted to try garde manger because of a recommendation and the great reviews. It really disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Really diverse menu of spicy sea food, comfort food, and some refined fine dining.

I had the beef short ribs over a bed of spaetzle, topped with a jalapeno popper. Everything was delicious, the beef was so tender that a sneeze could of pulled it apart (?). The jalapeno popper was amazing, just right amount of heat and crispiness. 

The staff are super knowledgeable and friendly.

They were filming for Chuck's Day Off while we were there, gathering shots of the activity of the restaurant.

Overall, it's great restaurant I would visit again and would recommend to people who don't mind a loud restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Garde Manger on the first evening in Montreal with my sis and one of her close friends. We were in town for NYE. My sister found GM and secured reservations, and I'm so glad she did! 

The reason for my five star review is because this spot hit all points of a great dining experience - awesome food, customer service, and atmosphere. 

Like I said, there were three of us having dinner and we opted for the dinner special that included four courses at at a flat rate of $80 per person. 

The first course started off with a cold seafood plate that included fresh raw oysters, smoked mussels, scallop, and salmon. A basket of fresh bread and butter flavored with spicy honey came to the table and was the perfect accompaniment to the fresh seafood. 

Second and third courses were three appetizers (small plates) and then three different dinner dishes. All were chef choice and they were awesome! My favorites included roasted beets over creamy ricotta, tuna tartar, and a creamy risotto topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. 

And final course was dessert which was a fresh, out of the oven berry crumble pie and caramel puff cookies. 

As I mentioned, as good as the food was, the experience was also about things that didn't go in my mouth. The service was immaculate and the feel of the space was really warm and inviting, especially crucial given that we arrived in the middle of a major cold spell (minus 15 degrees outside that night). The music playlist was great, and the night ended with a string of hip hop favorites that got us dancing in our seats. 

I am so glad we made it to Garde Manger! I can't say enough good things about this spot and encourage you to check out this quaint spot in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Hard to find in old Montreal, when you have all those old but charming buildings all looking the same, and no sign out in front to indicate you're at the right restaurant. You have to enter to be sure you're in the right place. Once you enter the restaurant you would no doubt know you're in the right place, this joint is booming and you'll find newspapers articles of the restaurant and the famous chef Chuck Hughes plastered on the wall out in the small foyer.

When it comes to food, this place rocks. The menu is written on a blackboard situated above the bar. Whatever we had I'm sure the menu has changed already. But just let me tell you, I had the best risotto here ever. My date ordered a risotto with rock shrimp cooked in a lobster broth. Deliciously good! 

Would come back here again if I'm ever in Montreal and would recommend anyone to try it out in a heartbeat. Be sure to make reservations, this joint is packed."}
{"text":"Hubby ordered the seared foie gras with duck confit sitting on a buckwheat waffle and was really happy with it. While seared foie gras and duck confit are French components, the maple gastrique and buckwheat waffle were a great way to inject a little Canadiana. I had a difficult time choosing my starter because I wanted to eat everything but in the end I ordered the octopus with fingerlings, cr√®me fra√Æche, chorizo, and butternut squash pur√©e and I didn't regret it for a second.

Hubby went with the short rib for his main. The meat, vacuum-packed and slow-cooked at a low temperature for 60 hours at 60 degrees, had great beefy flavour and a melt in your mouth texture. It was served upon a large pile of Gouda mashed potatoes and this made hubby a happy man. For some reason I was really feeling the seafood so I ordered the seared scallops with leek, romanesco, speck, and more butternut squash pur√©e. Everything was cooked, seasoned, and plated to perfection but I was left a little bit hungry. I had chosen two fairly light dishes on purpose so that I could end our dinner on a sweet note. While all the options sounded tempting, I was drawn to the s'mores dessert because it involved marshmallows and I am a sucker for marshmallows. The decadent chocolate brownie, topped with warm, gooey marshmallow and graham crumb and vanilla ice cream was the perfect ending.

We left Garde Manger well satisfied and ready to paint the town 'rouge'"}
{"text":"vibrant atmosphere, and excellent gnocchi- true comfort food. we had a great time :)"}
{"text":"There's a reason why Chuck rarely take's a day off.... The food is amazing and the creativity that goes into it comes across in a flavor sensation.

I had duck breast with chorizo sausage and foie gras. Delicious.

For dessert I attempted the peanut butter cookie, w/ peanut butter and raspberry jelly topped w/ ice cream caramel crumble. It's a perversion of the senses. Ask your server to bring 6 spoons just in case you need help finishing it.

I'm definitely look forward to going back."}
{"text":"After much excitement about being able to go to Montreal and dine at Garde-Manger, I've walked away fairly disappointed.  The place is obnoxiously loud and conversation is next to impossible.  You end up in a place where everyone screams.  It has a fair number of people who think nothing of screaming in your ear who are not in your party.  The food was only OK.  I ordered the lobster poutine which was a great idea, but mediocre execution.  The Bavette et Frites was very good.  My guest had the octopus to start which was not cleaned/prepared properly followed by a very tough duck dish.  We wanted to try a dessert, but 45 minutes after ordering it with no dessert delivered, we gave up and left.  Chuck was there but only for about 30 minutes after we showed up (9:30PM).  The show is much better than the reality of the restaurant...Believe me, I wanted to like this place, but it did not impress."}
{"text":"There is something absolutely magical about this place. The vibe is unreal, just cool, and loose and fun. Everyone has fun. Terrific wine list, and the servers know it very well. The food is super tasty too... cooked to perfection, imaginative, tasty, sexy. My date and I arrived for 9 reservation and left at 2 am w huge grins on our faces ....  doesn't that say it all !"}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that the unofficial dress code is Fred Perry. Once you get past the awkward stares and uncomfortable vibes from those with heavy wallets, you get some really good quality food and tasty drinks. We ordered 1 appetizer 1 entree 1 dessert and 2 rounds of drinks between 2 people and were treated like red headed step children. Once again if you are either rich or not easily offended you will have a delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Delicious place for food. Nice ambience. Book far in advance. Great service. Check out the cocktail - it comes with crab legs!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the world. I have been to 35+ countries and this place really takes the cake. I have been to Montreal 4 times and each time I have a memorable meal at this place. The pairings are delicious trouble - lobster poutine?! Yes. Deconstructed hot dog - pork belly, dill pickle, chicharron and mustard? Sure thing. Short Rib with polenta and herbs? Uh-huh. I can't stop raving about this place and I hope to never stop. If you're willing to be excited by food and flavors I highly recommend. Garde Manger is a treat."}
{"text":"We sat at the back bar which I'm glad we did. It's quieter and you have more room. I highly recommend going with the chefs tasting! You get to sample a lot of the menu and try food you normally wouldn't. You will definitely not leave hungry! All the food we had tasted great & service was even better. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Having been there twice before, and having loved the restaurant ambiance and food, my wife and I were really looking forward to going there for our anniversary.  We started off by trying to make a reservation, I first tried exactly one month in advance using the on-line line system through Open Table and it said that there were no reservations available even though the restaurant website says that reservations will not be taken more than one month in advance.  I tried calling with the same results, how is that possible ?  I wonder if the place wasn't full with \"friends\".  This seemed to be the case as a waitress was drinking wife with patrons at one of the tables.  Not very professional.  We were given a space at the bar and at the same time put on a wait-list for a table if there were to be a cancellation.  When we arrived on Saturday evening, there were plenty of unfilled tables and during the whole evening while we were there one of the tables was empty.  We inquired, we wanted to move, and were told by the rude employee at the front, that the patrons for that table had called that they would be late.  An hour later they never showed and we were stuck the whole evening at the uncomfortable bar.  After 15 minutes they should have seated us at that table.  Our server said that she would get the manager for us, but he/she never showed.  Where is Chuck?  As for the food, some was good and some wasn't so good.  My wife had as an appetizer the crab on toast, well there wasn't very much crab, in fact there was only two bites worth and the bread was hardly toasted.  Her lobster rizzoto had too much garlic.  My dishes were good but not excellent.  We spent over $200 and for that money we had expected better."}
{"text":"Came here cuz its popular and it's one of Chucks establishments.  Even though reviews were a bit mix but I'm that shallow that I need to try a Canadian celebrity chef place :)  we came here for appetizers only because we had reservations for another delicious place down the street. So we picked what we wanted the most at this place which was seafood platter and the octopus. 

I love lobster but just not a poutine fan, so didn't want to waste good lobster on a pile of fries and gravy. And glad we didn't get it. Lady sat next to our table ordered that as her main and was not impressed with it either.  I see it used to have 1/2 portion n full portion options on the board from other yelpers photos but when we went, there's only the $28. 

Seafood platter!  4 kinds of oysters which were all fresh and delicious. My fav is the fresh scallops on shell and that's what'd drawn me to this place. They didn't have snow crab that night unfortunately. We also had the smoked salmon on beets salad place. It's yummy but I think $10 for that tiny plate is a bit much. 

The grilled octopus with potatoes and chorizo cream was delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly, not rubbery. And potatoes and garnish were good. Although a tiny lack of seasoning. 

Those were the only things we had. Seafood platter and octopus. No drinks. And $82 later. Guess seafood platter is $$$$. Although good seafood and rare scallops on shell. Don't think it's worth the price on appetizers along.  Food is good and definitely on the pricey side. Wouldn't give 5 star rating because the value just isn't there. There are many much better restaurants in Montreal for way way better food and lesser price. But if you're just loaded with cash, I'm sure the food here will satisfy you regardless."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place. The service, atmosphere and food were all amazing. They were very accommodating with my food allergies (gluten and dairy), I had lots of options to pick from. I would highly recommend making this a stop on your list when you visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Make a reservation well in advance --like weeks; but come on time. It's a smalI place , very boutiqueee.

Excellent food. The jerk crab was one of the single best item that I liked. The pork chop was very good and the steak fillet, that my coworker had. Vodka martini--yum. The Foi Gras was absolutely excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time (and I live in San Francisco & New York which have amazing restaurants). The atmosphere is warm & cozy, and the service is impeccable. Everyone that works there have great personalities and it is evident that they all \"really\" like their job and not just after a tip. 

We had the seared duck & spicy lobster. The duck was HANDS DOWN the best I have ever tasted and the lobster was incredible with fresh herbs, smoked jalopenos, lemongrass & ginger. Both of the dishes will be remembered by my husband and I forever! It was truly amazing. 

For a cocktail = get the extra large \"Bloody Ceasar\" that has a crab leg in it!

This restaurant created an amazing night for us and will go down as one of our favorites of all time. I HIGHLY recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"This was our third trip to Garde Manger. Once again it was fantastic! We shared beautiful PEI oysters then cod fritters to start. We each ordered a seafood item from the menu. Mine was scallops in carrot butter which was smooth, silky and absolutely delicious. My partner's dish was the seafood feature dish and it was perfectly cooked and richly flavored. We enjoyed every bite. The desserts were amazing too! If you get the chance, make a plan to eat here. You won't be disappointed. 
Le Bremner, a second restaurant owned by Chuck Hughes, is just down Saint Paul Street Ouest near the Bonsecours Market and is also a super place to eat - best for seafood lovers as most of the menu is fish/seafood. Our next trip to Montreal will include a return trip to Le Bremner."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great. Really comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Great mix of music from new school to old school. Make a reservation early - like 30 days."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great service...the lobster ceviche and the short ribs were excellent.  The spicy jerk crab was really  disappointing."}
{"text":"delicious dishes, fresh ingredients, excellent service by joe at the bar. Great atmosphere!! even though we almost miss the place but we made it as #1 customer on that day. Been grateful to taste matane  shrimp and  jerky crab, stuffed trout with oysters, and finished with molasses cake."}
{"text":"If you wanna spend 100$ p.pers. to listen to loud qu√©taine music, get ignored by the staff and mingle with obnoxious douchbags then that's the place!  Made us wait 45 min. with reservation after completely ignoring us for 15 min at arrival.  Food is way overpriced.  Overcrowded.  Forget getting attention or even a smile from any of the staff there.  Although, the 2 cops that came in at one point got free drinks...  Terrible experience, really felt like the staff thought they were way too cool for us little clients."}
{"text":"Was there on a Friday night.
We got in without a reservation, which was good.
Food was great but the waitress was really pushing hard for us to get an appetizer, going as far as saying that the main would come quicker if we ordered something before (??). Didn't really understand the logic there, but was very annoyed at being bullied into ordering something I didn't want (we didn't get the appetizers in the end).
The music was a bit loud, but the place is nice.
Would I go back? Although the food was good the overall experience wasn't great, so NO, i won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Chuck Hughes for a while now and tried, very successfully, many of his recipes from the show.  So, when visiting Montreal last week, we had to attempt to get into Garde-Manger.  We tried to get a reservation, unsuccessfully, for over a month.  Nevertheless, we found the place (more fun since it does not have a sign).  Our plan was to come early - we did not expect to get a table during the prime hours but were prepared to eat as early as 5pm - if necessary.  The maitre d was very nice and suggested that he might be able to seat us around 8pm - which was definitely worth the wait.  And when we came back, the restaurant was full, but we were seated, as promised.  Unless you come with more than 2-3 people and must have a table, it is a big part of the experience to eat at the bar (in either of the rooms).  We got a chance to talk to people seated next to us - young chefs from Toronto, who come every few months to pick Chuck's brain, so to speak.  We also had a very entertaining conversation with the chef and the bartenders on the other side of the bar.  The music selection - which is awesome, everything from Rolling Stones to Gypsy Kings to REM - is a great conversation starter!  We also got interesting info on how it all started (the second restaurant  just opened and the new show is being taped).  And then we ate!  The food was as awesome as we hoped for!  From simple oysters (two scallops on a half shelf were added as a very pleasant surprise) to beautifully constructed smoked salmon and caviar appetizer to the masterpiece of short ribs - everything was pretty much highly perfected (to those who complain about salt - that is what seasoning is and it was exceptionally balanced).   Suggest to try a bloody mary which comes with a full crab leg!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! Had the lobster poutine which was unreal and then the streak diane add my main which was one of the best steaks I have ever had! The only downfall is the extremely loud music which prevents you from having a conversation and the loud chefs who are drinking on the job, having shots while preparing food.  The ambience was a little too dark for my liking but apart from that I would go back."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Garde Manger for so long! When i finally went it was a no brainer i had to try the lobster poutine and unfortunately i was disapointed it was good but not the best i ever had for my main course i had the cod fish with clams again good but not great. Maybe my expections were too high."}
{"text":"It was worth every last single penny I spent!!!

I know this is a tad dramatic, or maybe I had too many cocktails, but by the end of the night, I was singing and dancing in my seat because I was food drunk.  It was a religious experience. My group actually shut the restaurant down.  

The lobster poutine lives up to its reptutation.  The scallops with gnocchi almost made me cry.  I couldn't even completely get my bite of spare ribs past my lips before I threw the fork down in disbelief that anything could taste that good.  Don't even get me started on our seafood platter that we started with, complete with raw oysters, scallops, king crab and shrimp.  

I'm not ashamed to say that I went to sleep in a food drunken haze with delightful images of our lovely hostest Maud, the apple-cherry crumble, and the dimly-lit wooden ambience that hugged me up.

I salute you!"}
{"text":"I had intended to eat at Le Bremner but it was closed so I decided on Le Garde Manger. I was worried that there was too much hype and if wouldn't be worth it, but boy was I wrong. It was amazing from start fo finish. The service, the atmosphere, the food, the wine and just the overall experience make me want to go back. I had the pork belly to start and the seared scallops as entree and my only regret is I wasn't with my boyfriend so I could have him order the other entree i wanted to taste! I was in town for work so dined alone at the bar (also a great experience getting to watched tue seafood platters and drinks get made), but definitely recommend going as a couple so you can try more options!"}
{"text":"Well... I dunno where to start. Have you ever felt like you got screwed at a restaurant? Probably... Well we felt like we got screwed here. I read about the seafood platter and so I decided we'd just \"start with that\". Well that's pretty much where the good experience ended. The waitress - knowing full well we were tourists - didn't hesitate to omit everything unless we asked, she didn't say a word. Didn't tell us it was $70 for the \"small\". Which by the way should never be ordered by only two people....15 oysters, 8 scallops, 3 sets of crab legs or 4, 10-12 shrimp... Like this was a doozy and she laughed it off like we knew how much seafood we would be getting... How the fack would we?! This is for a group of at least 6 especially if you don't wanna suck down on \"in house shocked oysters and scallops\". Mmmmm raw fish.... We left there $100 poorer and disgusted by the amount of seafood we \"tried\" to consume. About 9 oysters were left. The Montrealers on our right saw what we had and seemingly cause they could speak french they were able to order the platter omitting the scallops and oysters for half the price... She tried rationalizing they're ability to do that with some blabbering that made no sense. Lesson learned... Don't ever order a seafood platter that's not on the menu and be skeptical of a waiter that only points to things instead of describing them. By the way this place will break the bank...the last reviewer is delirious..."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! We went on a double date and shared all of our plates as it was our first time going to Le Garde Manger. While the service and drinks were excellent, we did not expect our food to be a complete miss. We ordered the lobster poutine, salmon belly, hen, steak, cod & clams and scallops. Every dish was well presented but overly salty. To make matters worse, all 4 of us ended up with food poisoning immediately after dinner. When we called to complain the next day,  they accused us of making this story up since it was the first time in 9 years that they have received a complaint from people getting sick from their food. We did not expect to get that kind of response back from the manager.  An apology would have been much appreciated. Never again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my wife and I drove from New York City to eat at this restaurant, which certainly creates great expectations! My wife is a big fan of Chuck Hughes and his shows so she was hoping that he was in the kitchen, but he was not that night. We were seated immediately at the time of our reservation in a really quiet table in the back room. Our server was very friendly and a total pro, as were all of the staff that night. Every morsel of food we had that great night from the beef carpaccio to the scallops was totally amazing! All I can say is that it was well worth the trip- even from New York City!!!!! The only things that would have been the topper was if Chuck was there!!! Maybe next time!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to experience this restaurant . Reservations are hard to get and I was super excited when my date and I were accommodated last minute for the first seating. The staff is super nice and the decor is cozy and trendy. We were really disappointed with the meal. The foie gras appetizer with blueberries was delicious but the piece was very small and the brioche on which it was served was too large and hidden by salad so it felt like you were having brioche with a taste of the foie gras. My Stake Diane had delicious sauce with pickled celery but the meat quality was too hard and fibrous. Our other meal was Cod, very nicely presented, a nice portion of good fish however both meals were way too salty and left us quite disappointed . Once we left the restaurant we had to immediately search for sorbet to cleanse the palate.. It's a great place to have a drink and oysters for the ambiance and service,  perhaps not for foodies."}
{"text":"Any place that can stand on its own and not even bother with having a sign outside the door is either pretentious or great.

La Garde-Manger is simply put...GREAT.  Teeny tiny out of the way place with a handful of table and a go-go-go attitude and feel without being rushed. The place is can be very dark and almost a little too much so. The person I dined with wasn't able to read the wine menu from their seat due to low levels of light.  The place could spare a few extra luxes from the gigantic chandelier that dominates the ceiling.

A word about that wine list...it's good, it's long, it's varied. What it is not, is cheap.  Since I'm not in the restaurant business I will never fully understand why wine I can buy at the store triples or quadruples in price when I buy it at the table.  That being said you can still find something that is \"reasonable\" (ish) and will work well with whatever they have to offer that night. If you need help the staff is as knowledgeable about the wine list as they are about the menu.

The menu is ever evolving thing I won't go into the details as to what tried. Suffice it to say that what I ate was incredible well prepared, flavourful, perfect temperature, appropriately spiced and left a great mouth feel/texture. At La Garde-Manger the menu is on the wall (also something hard to read at times cause of the light and people's heads being in the way) and its shows what's fresh today.  A good mixed of sea food and other delectable choices there is something there for everyone.

A quick final word about the sound of the place.  From entry to exit we heard a upbeat mix of everything from Pink Floyd to Brittany Spears.  Fun!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic service. 

We were in town for two short nights and we're lucky enough to meet someone who pulled strings for us to snag a spot at the bar for a late-ish Sunday reservation. 

The space is dark and moody. Gorgeous. 

We were actually able to sit at a table in the back dining room. We shared some razor clams and Arctic char from the raw bar. We had an amazing curry spaghetti squash appetizer (easily the highlight of the night), a lamb shank and a delightful sponge cake dessert. 

The misses were the lamb shank, which was served at a room temperature and the fact that I felt there should have been bread or something to accompany many of the plates and sauces. 

With a bottle of wine, our meal came to $185 CAD. I would return."}
{"text":"Garde Manger is one of the Canadian Celebrity Chef's Chuck Hughes infamous restaurants in Montreal.  Garde Manger is a happening spot that requires a reservation; you must be patient with their reservation process - you call them with your information and they call you back a few days later.  Luckily, we were able to score a reservation for 2 on short notice this past long weekend (note: they are closed on Mondays).

We arrived a few minutes before our reservations and were seated in a quaint corner at the bar.  I loved the interaction we had with the bartenders and our waitress.  I would recommend getting a seat at the bar again for future visits.

Food

We opted for 4 course service, trying various seafood items on the menu.  The oysters were fresh and delicious, one of the highlights of our meal.  Next, Jerk Snow Crab was our 2 course, it was addictive yet spicy.  The heat would only be comforted by eating more crab.  Our third course was the infamous lobster poutine, absolutely divine; thin fries with cheese and chucks of lobster all covered in a wonderful seafood gravy.  My SO wiped the bottom of the dish with bread, no gravy was wasted!  Our last course was their seared scallops entree, it was yummy - the scallops were perfectly cooked.  I love the roasted carrots that accompanied the dish.  After the 4 courses, we were too stuffed to order dessert.  I have to come back and try their deep fried mars bar!

Drinks

You must try their infamous snow crab caesar - it was one of the best caesar I have had!  

Service

Out of this world service, our plates were cleared right away when we were done our meal.  Our waitress made sure our food was paced well between course.  Anything we asked for, we got.  They do have an attention to detail at Garde Manger.

Overall

Garde Manger was one of my best restaurant experiences I have had to date. Food and service were top-notch.  I love the laid back vibe at the restaurant.  I will definitely be back for a return visit whenever I am in Montreal next.  Make you check out Garder Manger whenever you are in the Montreal area!"}
{"text":"The bartender Sam was awesome, made great cocktails out off menu and great service.   But food wasn't so impressive. Smoky salmon tartar with black rice was way too salt, and the famous lobster poutin more like saut√©ed Lobster on bunch of over fried french fries.. not impressive at all."}
{"text":"In a word- perfect!  We went to Garde Manger last night which was our first in Montreal and we couldn't have had a better experience. Well, I guess if Chuck was there, it would have been better:)

We started with veal cheeks and salmon tartare. Both were amazing. The pieces of salmon were larger than in a typical tartare which made for a nice texture. Highly recommend both dishes. 

For the mains, I had the scallops with gnocchi and my husband had the pork chop. Again, both were delicious. The pork was so moist and flavorful. The scallops were perfectly prepared and the gnocchi was light and fluffy. 

Unfortunately we had to pass on dessert.  After a bottle of wine and all of this food, we were just too full. Tonight is Joe Beef and tomorrow is Au Pied De Cochon. I will post those reviews too."}
{"text":"I always thought Garde Manger was good but after our recent meal there it's not ascended into the ranks of the Montreal greats. Their seafood platter is among the best I've ever had, the lobster, razor clams and oysters are phenomenal (if standard), but it's the various smoked fishes and other tasty bits really bring it to the next level.  

Service is insanely good, informal and friendly but so very on the ball. We did the tasting menu with wine pairings and we never had an empty glass once, the food showed up at the same time for everyone, and despite the restaurant being packed our server never felt like he was rushing with us. 

Mains included an incredible pork shoulder on cheesy potatoes that sounds boring but made me make a sex face in front of my mother in law it was so good. Most of their food is like this - on paper nothing special but through ingredients and preparation elevated to superhuman levels. Not sure what's changed recently but it's a different restaurant than last time I was here a year ago. 

Only nitpick is that around 10 on the weekend the bar fills up with friends of the restaurant and things get pretty party. I'd be pissed if I spend $500 and had to deal with people doing shots, yelling at each other and standing around with their butts in my face (we were a table over from the action so had a buffer) - but that's part of the ambiance - they also play 80's hair metal and gangster rap, sometimes that's just the price you gotta pay..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and ambiance.  Was here for dinner two nights ago and had a great time.  We had the seafood platter (half lobster tail, oysters and razor clams), lobster poutine (their signature dish) and the scallop entree.  The apps were amazing - but scallop entree was just so so.  Wasnt a fan of the corn mix that came with it, and overall portion was small considering the price (36$!).  I would be quite disappointed if I came here hungry, but since I've been snacking throughout the day, I was quite full from what we ordered.  Overall a great, but expensive, dinner experience!"}
{"text":"Wonderful from beginning to end. We started with cocktails and lobster poutine. I ordered the duck and my partner ordered the pork. Both were absolutely wonderful. The meats were both moist and full of flavor. We ended our night with a blackberry and pistachio dessert that made me want to order four more."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to my visit to Garde Manger my whole trip in Montreal.  It did not disappoint!

I sat at the bar, which I'd highly recommend, as the service is superb!

The bartender presented me with the drink menu, however when I informed him of my preferences, he offered to make a drink for me.  I was happy to take this option, and the drink was fantastic.  I did this the remainder of the meal, and all four drinks I had were terrific, and just what I wanted!

I started my meal with the seafood platter.  I opted for oysters, lobster, and the smoked char.  It was all fresh, and divine.  And just enough for me.

Following the seafood, I decided to just have an appetizer.  I chose the pork belly.  I loved it!

Dessert I had a hard time deciding between the strawberry shortcake and coffee cake, but decided to go with the strawberries since they were in season.  Perfect finish to my meal.

The service and food here are fantastic.  It's a little loud, so if that bothers you, it might not be your place.  Personally, I enjoyed the energy.  I'm already panning my next trip."}
{"text":"Had a great experience, the background music and service was great. Had the Arctic Chard with egg plant was wonderful. Very enjoyable night out."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and great to see Chuck in the kitchen! Positive reviews were accurate. The food was really delicious, particularly the lobster Poutine (generous lobster portions), tomatoe halloumi salad and beef tartare. The food was well priced for this caliber of restaurant. Nice atmosphere, interesting and fun wine list. We will return."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best restaurant in Montreal. I've been four times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"It's trendy, loud, and even an excellent restaurant.  Be prepared to wait a bit for your table - whether you have a reservation or not - but ultimately it's worth the wait.  Cocktails were quite good and the wine list was very small print and hard to read in the dark dining area but had a few good selections.  Service was friendly but not very experienced, in general Montreal these days is a young, vibrant city but servers seem to often fall into the young and not all that experienced category.

Lobster poutine was good but for $18 I would expect additional lobster or something to better justify the price for poutine.  For the main course we went with two fish dishes and both were cooked perfectly and included accompanying Israeli Couscous and Spatzle along with vegetables and sauces that were excellent and didn't seem overly filling.  Because of this we opted for dessert which was unfortunately a mistake - the clafoutis was not great and the \"ice cream sandwich\" just didn't work well - all of the components were quite good on their own but when put together the thick, dense, chocolate on either side of the \"sandwich\" just overpowered everything and made us leave half the dish on the plate.

I would return, but be aware that Garde Manger is one of the more expensive restaurants you'll find in Montreal and while it's very good there is definitely room for improvement.  Maybe just don't order dessert as a start."}
{"text":"What a delicious experience! The veal tartar with foie mousse was my favorite. You can't go wrong with that. And they didn't. The kicker was the maple toast. The combination of tartar, foie mousse on the toast...delish. Effing delish. Well-flavored and a nice portion. 

The braised beef tortellini was done well but I wasn't a fan of the al dente pasta. But that's just preference. The spot prawns were great, no shell or head, and very soft. I was expecting a bit firmer but was pleasantly surprised. Wish they cut the baby fennel but still good. 

I had the striped bass, which was perfectly cooked. Moist and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The skin was a little salty but I thought it went well with the rest of the dish, which included spatzle, truffles and a lobster beurre blanc. Omg, so good. 

Dessert was a strawberry meringue. I'm sure it's called something else and I've butchered it but still delicious! The cake part seemed undercooked and am not sure if that's how it was supposed to be. But again, great flavors and very good portions. Great wine selections. A few more to add to my collection. I left satisfied. Not overly stuffed and hating myself. 

Great service, as well. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. The rest of the staff was also very attentive. We were fairly early so could be because there weren't a lot of customers as of yet. But great experience. I'd definitely go again. And to Chuck Hughes's other restaurant."}
{"text":"i was here last year. it was fanastic.

this year was a little bit of a disappointment. i finally got around to order the lobster poutine. that was such a let down. there was only specks of lobster (so small i couldn't even tell it was lobster). the gravy was a bit fishy and there was hardly and curds. what topped it all off was that the poutine portion was very very small. i don't mind small portions but i would of been nice if i got a chunk of lobster. it wasn't worth $17.

i got the braised short rib for my main. that was great.

dessert i got the banana concauction. delish!

i would give this place a 3 1/2 stars.

service is wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Just got back from a business trip and this place won my heart.  My co-workers and I enjoy good food and drinks, so we will always find anew places to go to on our travels... this place was SO good, we ate here two nights in a row!  We tried different entrees on each occasions and I can honestly say that every item we ate was equally as good!  BUT if I have to list out my favorites it would be:

* Lobster Poutine ( AMAZING!)
* ShortRib
* Skate wing Fish
* Cheesecake mousse with Dulce de Leche

We had the lovely waitress, Ada ( might be wrong spelling) both nights and she made our experience even better.  

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  I wish there was one in California so I could back again!"}

i don`t know how tony s. could complain about too much seafood. try going to the grocery store and getting that much fresh stuff for that price!  this time around i didn`t have a cold and the food tasted way better. i got the scallops and crab salad. the crab salad is served in a potato shell, but the amount of big pieces of crab meat was equivalent to 8 crab legs! out of control quantity AND quality of seafood. I still think this a reasonably priced food and fantastic quality. This time, the server was amazing. Always anticipating our every need... we were the first people in the restaurant, but it filled up completely!"}
{"text":"I had really high expectations going to Chuck Hughes' restaurant. 

It was one of the coolest experiences vibe-wise that I've experienced at a restaurant. The wine, company, and service was excellent. The reviews from diners in our party ranged were generally good. The oyster + scallops first course looked amazing, as well as the signature lobster poutine.

However, I would certainly not recommend Garde-Manger for vegetarians. The only veggie choice listed on the chalkboard was a beet and cabbage appetizer, and the waiter recommended the veggie risotto. Instead of a decadent and luscious risotto, I was presented with an overly salty risotto that was utterly forgettable. The lack of creativity here was disappointing.

Which is a shame. The wine, conversation, ambiance, and music were all excellent. But my meal was a disappointment and messing up on something so basic as seasoning is never a good thing."}
{"text":"Garde Manger is a classic Montreal restaurant in beautiful Old Montreal. I've always had a great time at Garde Manger. The atmosphere is energetic but not too loud. It's a fun place with amazing food. The service is attentive. Seafood platter is the best in the city. Can't wait to return. 
P.S. It's expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"After drooling over internet pictures of this place for years,  I finally had the chance to try Chuck Hughes restaurant.  We had reservations for a Thursday night, came in and were seated immediately.  

The service was top notch, our waitress knew everything on the menu...scratch that as there were no physical menus.  Just two black boards on the walls, one in English and the other in French.  Because the English board was further away, she just started translating the French one for us, describing in great detail the ingredients of all the dishes and how they were prepared all of the top of her head.  I was impressed by her knowledge and passion for the things she described.  Since we had a group of 6, she altered the menu so everyone would have a decent bite of every dish ordered.  

Lobster Poutine - great! good chunks of lobster, but quite pricey at $19 for regular size and $28 for a large.
Oysters - were fresh and tasty.  we had a mix of 6 different ones in season that I can't recall anymore.
Braised Short Rib - nothing memorable if that says anything about it
Seafood Risotto - very flavourable, but way too salty and I LOVE salty food.    
Scallops with bacon and black truffle - These were plumb and juicy"}
{"text":"I must say, the food was great.  I had the Lobster Poutine, the Flank steak and a Deep Fried Mars Bar.  The bartender, was nice, but not the best server.  She was not engaging, as a bartender should be.  Their was a lot of quiet socializing among her and a few of the staff, one of which was the partner to Chuck Hughes.  The partner, a local actor whom I forget his name, seemed very cold.  He was shucking oysters behind the bar, talking with the bartender.  He, especially, should have been engaging the customers.  He had an air of arrogance about him , like he was taking our money and laughing at us because we were paying over $20 for a poutine.  The bloody poutine was brilliant, so I still give four stars, but it could easily have been five, if the staff was more friendly.  Also, which does not change the ranking, Chuck must have been on his Day Off!"}
{"text":"You won't be sorry if you go with the chef's choice. The seafood platter is a sampling of all they have. Bring an appetite and be adventurous! We had an outstanding experience!"}
{"text":"We came here as a date night on a Saturday night for a 6 PM dinner.  I'd originally only been able to get a bar seat but when they called the day before they were able to accommodate for a regular table.  The restaurant was unassuming from the outside.  We were seated immediately and our server was prompt.  He was very good at explaining how the menu was and making recommendations.  I asked about their infamous lobster poutine and he told me how after 11 years it came off the menu.  We started with the zucchini salad.  Anytime there's zucchini flower on the menu I am drawn to it.  The flower was stuffed with ricotta and the zucchini salad was very light and refreshing.  Our next appetizer was the spicy jerk crab.  Our server warned us it's super spicy and it was but it was good!  Decent sized legs.  My mouth was on fire lol.  Thankfully they gave us time to get the spiciness out of our mouths.  Then we shared the scallops and pork belly.  This was delicious.  Scallops were very good sized and the charred corn beneath was nice.  Next was the pork tenderloin on cheese grits.  The grits weren't overly cheesy which was good.  The cabbage was very nice.  The overall flavours were great.  We were too stuffed for dessert.  Their bread looked good and the couple beside us was devouring it but we didn't have enough room to have bread to start lol.  Definitely a great dining experience and would definitely go back!  The vibe and food and service were all excellent.  I just wasn't able to pay with my Visa giftcard that I was given as a gift."}
{"text":"You could walk right by this little hole in the wall, but we didn't. Something said, stop, look again, go back for dinner. We did and we were not disappointed. This was years ago. My only regret - we should have ordered more food. With two people, sometimes you just don't get to taste enough. 

Fast forward to today and I see (adorable) chef on TV beating my fave Bobby Flay in a lobster-cetric Iron Chef. 5 dishes of lobster each - swoon.  Apparently Chef Hughes has his own show on Cooking Channel.   Hope I can get a res the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was one of our most exceptional meals in Montreal. 

We passed by on the first night and couldn't figure out what it was..bar, restaurant?  Thankfully I did a little sleuthing to figure out that the pink light up sign was the entrance to deliciousness. 

We had to eat LATE (I mean like 10:30pm) because we didn't plan ahead but it was well worth it. 

The atmosphere is dark and cozy and it was perfect for the cool weather outside. We were seated all the way at the back of the restaurant - which was great because we could check out what everyone was eating on the way. 

The menu isn't huge but it is well selected and with a variety of items for everyone. I had fish and I have to say that it was the most well prepared fish I have ever eaten. Fully cooked (as requested vs seared) and still so tender and not dry at all! 

The server was very friendly - and helpful since I had a lot of menu questions. 

Definitely worth a visit and even a 2 hour wait for dinner. I will plan ahead next time to eat earlier but will definitely return!"}

As an avid fan of Chuck Hughes cooking, I was hoping not to be disappointed but everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience were great.  Couple things I would be sure to try, Jerk Snow Crab legs, Braised Short Rib, Lobster Risotto, and Goat cheese with lentils. Next time I'm in Montreal Ill be sure to return."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Service was spot on and was pleased with the other patrons. By far the best meal I had in Montreal. The short ribs were out of this world. Wonderful sides to compliment.

We've been here twice - September 2016, October 2017. Ate at the bar both times, were looked after by Sam both times, had fabulous experiences both times. 

The food is beyond amazing. We never made it to the entrees on either occasion - the craft-your-own seafood platters are simply too good. Razor clams, mussels, turbot ceviche, smoked Arctic char, oysters, lobster, scallops - amazing, just amazing. And when you add perfectly charming service by Sam and his associates - I can't think of a more delightful way to spend an evening.

Great convos, music, recommendations and a few surprise bonuses were in store for us by these lovely ladies! And the gourmet creations, as always, were mouthwatering!

{"text":"When I watched episodes of \"Chuck's Day Off\", I always thought it would've so cool to eat at his restaurant.  When I realized I was coming to Montreal, I thought wouldn't it be cool to eat at that restaurant--but didn't remember the name or Chuck's last name.  Also, I thought--\"there's no way it's close to where we're staying...\"

Then we took a walking tour of the \"Tastes of Old Montreal\".  During the tour, our guide points out the completely unnoticeable Le Garde Manger, and says it is one of the best restaurants in the city, owned by Chef Chuck Hughes.  Yay!!!  We managed to get a reservation, and were rewarded with great ambiance, fun interaction with a cool, informed and engaging staff, and we got some really great food.  

Our meal started with a delightful goat cheese board paired with crisp, light flatbread.  Then I got the striped sea bass and my husband got the grilled scallops.  Both entrees were just as delicious as expected.  For dessert we shared the ice cream sandwiches with caramel dipping sauce, and I'm only a little embarrassed to say I cleaned our plate.

The meal was tasty, fun and memorable.  Perfect for a vacation visit!!"}
{"text":"This place is \"hot\".

Perhaps because of the music (it's killer, but really, really loud. Huh? I said it's LOUD). Or the venue (it's hidden and indiscriminate). Or the crowd (hip, trendy, and fun with a side of self-entitlement). Or the atmosphere (it's dark and sexy). Or the chef (Hello Chuck Hughes. That's right, chefs are the rockstars of my generation). But shouldn't it be about the food (here I go)?


 
Bread n' butter? 
Nope, Bread and delicious salmon spread 



You absolutely need to make a reservation. My sister and I got the 9:30 seating and thought it'd be great to start with a stiff drink. The daily cocktail was tequila, and although I swore off this ish after 'TequilaGate' Whistler 1998, I threw one back. C'est la vie. It was a fresh grapefruit and soda cocktail that packed a mean punch.


Of the three dishes we ordered, I must have picked two bad ones because my sister was here a few nights ago and she liked it. Don't worry Chef, it happens to many men, it is normal, and it's okay. Or is it me? After all, I ordered.

The beef tartar was good, but there was way too much. I wouldn't normally complain about quantity, but when the tartar is big chunks, after a while, even the biggest carnivore starts to feel cannibalistic. 
 
That's a lot of raw beef... 

My second choice was the wreckfish (since Hughes is known for his seafood). I didn't like it. It may be that I wasn't picking up what he was putting down?!? 

The dish is still pretty, init? 

The night's saving grace was the jerk crab. It was delicious and messy. Oooh, I want to do it again. So yes, I will go back but this time, I won't be ordering. Until then, don't worry Chuck Hughes, I still like youghes."}
{"text":"The Smarty Pants Canadian Cousin was ecstatic to get a reservation for Garde-Manger for my visit.  \"I had to stalk their website for a month to get this,\" she exclaimed.  Let's hope this Rude Vile American Cousin didn't embarrass the Smarty Pants Canadian Cousin too much.

-- BREAD - With housemade cream cheese spread.  So good that they should charge for it.  MUST GET (obviously).

-- OYSTERS - Village Bay ($2.5) , Wellfleet ($3.25), Standish ($3.75), Cape Spear ($2.75), Coleville Bay ($3.25) - Arranged specifically in increasing order of flavor/sweetness.  Personally, for the sheer presentation, get the impressive seafood platter instead.

-- $15 GIANT CAESAR - Get their signature drink simply for the WOW factor.  I'm not a huge Bloody Mary fan, but the spicy kick (pepper on the rim and horseradish on the jabbed spoon) and the dangling giant snow crab claw made this drink impressive.  MUST GET.

-- $19 POUTINE DE HOMARD - The famous lobster poutine with lobster gravy was what we came for, and although good, it wasn't as great as those at the cheaper hole-in-the-wall poutine places.

-- $13 COD ACRA - The cod fritters were amazingly delicious - light and fluffy.  MUST GET.

-- $15 SMOKED SALMON - Being just smoked salmon, this was the least favorite dish of the night - which says more about how amazing everything else was.

-- $24 WAFFLE FOIE GRAS - Strange yet delicious pairing - a generous helping of savory seared foie gras and braised short rib over a honey-sweetened waffle.  Yes, it was as amazing as it sounds - the best dish of the night.  MUST GET.

-- $35 PETONCLES - The scallops were gigantic - the size of hockey pucks, EH!  The perfectly cooked risotto was wonderful with the heirloom veggies.  The sauce was very good.  GET IT.

The attentive service was exquisite - the courses were paired off according to complementing tastes, and every plate was accompanied by a thorough introduction to the dish.  (Note: Menu on the chalkboard changes constantly.)  The ambiance is dark and intimate, rustic yet modern, just like the discrete storefront outside.

$225 including taxes (Above courses, three wines + Giant Caesar, dozen oysters, espresso).  To use the rude vile American saying, it was so totally HELLA worth it, dude."}

{"text":"What a disappointment!  I was looking forward to trying this restaurant, as Chef Hughes is so well reviewed.  The meal was an overwhelming disappointment.  The illegible hand-scribbled menu on Saturday night had nothing but seafood and fish, except for a hanger steak and pork chops.  So, we ordered the pork and the hanger steak.  They were both horrible.  The steak was very tough and the fibers in the meat were too strong and too \"chewy\".  The pork chop was even tougher and very undercooked.  The pork chop was just too big - this probably explains why it was so tough and so undercooked.
I will not go back."}
{"text":"This review is for the lobster poutine only.

Service and Ambiance:
   * We visited this place just for the poutine.  It was late, so I liked the dark, Seattle bar-like (or American), energetic feel of this place.  They were playing Bob Marley too, so I was nostalgic and feeling the love. 
   * They were busy and closing the kitchen. But they still agreed to make us their famous lobster poutine, which was awesome.

Poutine
   * When in Montreal, aside from the French cuisine, you have to go to Schwartz for smoked meat and of course, you gotta try the poutine.   It is a common Canadian dish, originating in Quebec in 1950's, made with french fries, topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce and cheese curds.  We had the lobster poutine and it was delicious (compared with others I tried in Montreal).  It had big pieces of lobster and a really flavorful gravy.  I wanted to try the foie gras poutine at Au Pied du Cuchon when I dined there next day, but too much of a good thing can be detrimental to ones health. My body may never forgive me for the abuse and there were other interesting and healthier dishes to sample. 

Summary:
Definitely worth a try, if you are in Old Montreal, if you like lobster, and if you are not too concern with getting fat from the delicious gravy and curds, along with the deep fried potatoes.  It's so good but so bad.  If you are in Seattle, my first and repeating poutine experience was at Smith.  Best spare rib poutine ever! yumm.

A clarification to my comments about poutines above. 
   * Personally, I feel potatoes get a bad rap. No potato in its natural state is bad for us, but rather we make it bad because of how we eat it (e.g., deep fry) or when we decide to eat it (e.g., late night). A potato is a starch and it is made up of simple carbohydrates. Starch has a place in our diet.  Like everything we consume, moderation is key.  

   * With respect to potatoes, when our body takes in these quickly-absorbing carbohydrates we are forced to use them as energy right away or store them in fat. Unless we are headed to the gym after we eat or consume them after exercise, we are more likely to gain weight from these kinds of potatoes.  When we continually consume quickly absorbing carbohydrates, the high conversion of sugar causes a surge in insulin production. When we continually spike our insulin, we develop a resistance to insulin that has been linked to a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease."}
{"text":"We had a really excellent experience at the bar.  I did not know anything about Chuck Hughes or the \"hype\" really, it was recommended by a friend who is a fan and whose taste I trust.  Then I read about the lobster poutine and decided I had to try it.  Well, apparently they took it off the menu at least a year ago LOL!  So while I was initially disappointed, in retrospect I'm so glad it was not on the menu because we tried some wonderful dishes.

We were late, missed the little side street and had to backtrack, (ugh I hate that!), but fortunately they did not give away our reservation.  Sam at the bar was super friendly and a perfect salesperson- and I mean that in a good way!  He was an excellent listener and guided us through the menu and what would make sense for us.  We had a seafood tray with razor clams (oh my I had never had these before - a revelation!), smoked mussels - utterly delicious, two oysters (for my husband, I had the mussels, crab that was delectable that we didn't have to work at - meat already picked, and arctic char- another dish I had not tried and now love!  This served with Chuck's own jalepeno hot sauce.  

Next we had brussel sprouts with house bacon, hazelnuts Chuck's \"bomba\" - spicy nuts and probably some other things.  For our entr√©e we shared the duck leg and duck croquettes.  Absolutely melt in your mouth delicious.  Never had duck in croquette form before and it totally worked.  Hubby was kind enough to give me his duck fat :).  Heaven.  

For dessert could not decide between lemon cake and chocolate peanut butter profiteroles, Sam made it easy by giving us the cake and just one profiterole.  Peanut buttery deliciousness, wish we had only gotten those, the lemon cake was good- but... peanut butter!  

We each had two cocktails- which were good but not exactly memorable, I can't remember what we got!  The food was definitely the star of the show.  Sam was ready to try to make me an iced tea even though they did not have it- I got another drink instead.   I feel like the meal was really a good value given the unique dishes, presentation and outstanding flavors combined with what I felt was a really good experience.  If you don't drink it will be an even better value :).  They acknowledged that we were celebrating our anniversary too. 

Would recommend and will definitely return when we go back to Montreal.  Especially since the menu is always changing.  Next time might try the chef's tasting menu.  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I loved the music (was singing along the whole time)! 

Although I'm not a big fan of seafood, I managed to find myself eating here!

The waitress was incredibly nice and answered all our questions and suggested great dishes. Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the menus written on a board and put up on the wall.. just because it felt awkward having to look over another table to try and read it! I'm pretty sure the people on the table didn't enjoy that either haha! But the waitress did take the time to go over the menu for us and she knew everything pretty much by heart -Thumbs up!

We ordered and shared the lobster poutine, as the waitress recommended, as our appetizer! By the time we finished it, we were already quite full! They also bring you some bread and cheese as soon as you sit down!

I ordered the steak which was cooked to medium-rare (and no you can't choose how well you want it cooked -didn't like that). It came with some salad on the side. Overall, wasn't that fulfilling, unfortunately. 

Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time if you want to find a place to sit. 
(Rumour alert) They apparently take their reservation seriously that they won't even cancel it or make room for a celebrity who doesn't have a reservation."}
{"text":"We've been to Garde-Manger twice now so I feel like I have a pretty good take on the place. The gist of our take: good food, but sorely overpriced and the music is always too loud, to the point where you can barely hear yourself think.

As a vegetarian, the options for me there are incredibly limited. It's either a risotto ($32 for it with no meat) or a $14 tomato/avocado salad with fried cheese (expensive but very good).

Going down the whole menu everything seems grossly overpriced.. the main one being the Lobster poutine ($20)... the portion is way too small for that kind of price.

Expect to pay $50/person for a 2 course meal, without drinks. 

The food is solid but I have a feeling Chuck's fame is adding too much perceived value to his restaurant, and for the price there are much better places to eat in Montreal, even in the Old Port area (DNA for example).

Worth trying once but after 2 times I don't think we'll go back for a long time.."}
{"text":"Although everything was satisfactory, we expected a lot more. Maybe it's been too hyped up. 
The 3 of us had

1. Pork belly
2. Duck
3. Braised short rib
4. Razor clams
5. Scallops
6. Tartar with Foie gras

Drinks: Ceasar and bourban

The food was good, but for the price we paid, we expected it to blow our minds. The ceasars were ok, and the bourban wasn't good.  

We also booked (online) a month in advance and the only reservations available were for 530pm and 930pm. But during our entire meal 530-730pm, there were only 2 other tables and the restaurant only started to pick up as we were leaving. It sure would've been nice if we had been able to reserve a bit later considering the restaurant was basically empty.

Like I said, everything was alright. and if it wasn't for the price, i might even come back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best restaurant I have ever been to. The atmosphere was amazing, the staff was fantastic (thanks for the free shots), and the food was to die for! I cannot recommend the sampler enough, it left me wanting more of everything that I had tried, but at the end of the night I still left full. The lobster poutine was good, just really not worth trying when there are so many other things on the menu. I would recommend the smoked salmon, ah√≠ tuna, the mussels, and of course the espresso shot."}
{"text":"One of the top Montr√©al cuisine! Cozy ambiance, good service and delicious food! Lots of choices of seafood! Menu change often so always a good surprise. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok - hands down the best old fashioned i've ever had. Fantastic service. Staff was so friendly. No pretenses. Just passionate about food. Sat at the bar. Had the scallops and char. Just wonderful. Had the poutine because it just seemed like we should. Wish we were here longer just to go back again!  Will be a must on any trip to Montreal. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"If you don't like French cuisine, don't bother traveling to Montreal :D...you might as well pack your own food from wherever you're traveling from. Fortunately for me, it's my favorite cuisine so Montreal is heaven, for me at least; 2nd to Paris of course. Restaurant G-M is a good spot and this is why:

Food:
+ Short Ribs. It was written on their blackboard and is one of their staple dishes. It was damn good...a bit salty for my liking but it was done as short ribs should be. Lonnggggggggggggggggggggg slowwwwwwwwwww and falling off the bone when your fork touches it.

Service:
+ It was good, friendly, attentive and \"just there.\"

Fermented Grape Juice:
+ It's a French restaurant and thus the wine list is mostly French wines. I love Bordeaux and thus for me, it was an easy pick :)

I will definitely go back especially because it is located very close to the Westin Montreal (within walking distance) 

THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"Loved the location! Incredible space.  I made reservations for 9/19 instead of 9/12.  The more than accommodating host, Patrick not only seated us immediately but in an excellent table in the back room.   Delightful food! I was disappointed to find that the summer menu did not include Foie Anything! Oh well, as Lobster was the featured ingredient du jour, I worked my way thru the pain.  As i proceeded to eat and eat!  Poutine de Homard was crispy and cheesy! The Spicy Clam Bloody Mary was exactly that!  I want to drink it at every brunch for the rest of my life.  Wonderful energy and everyone was there to have a great evening.  I wish I could afford to eat this way all the time."}
{"text":"I came in fully ready to be disappointed considering the level of hype involved, but I was glad to be proven wrong. Nice atmosphere, friendly and very knowledgeable staff, an interesting menu and overall great food (I had the jerk crab and ribs). I'd probably eat here again eventually if I didn't have to book a reservation a month in advance, but I can't really blame them for their popularity."}
{"text":"We were told this was a must when visiting, so decided to go on our last night in town. The location is hard to find, with no signage really on the outside. However, I think that's on purpose as the atmosphere is very unpretentious. You get the feeling its all about the food, though the setting is very charming with an old world feel. The food was amazing. The waitress did a great job suggesting a wine to pair with my meal, and everything was spot on."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go in Montreal if you want to try surprising and modern fish and seafood dishes.

The food is outstanding and as fresh as it gets although a wee bit salty for my taste. The service is very helpful and knowlegeable though a bit pushy at times. The ambiance is very vibrant to say the least, it can be a bit too noisy and dark though as the time goes by.

It is definitely a must go. Make sure you buy a bottle of their green hot pepper sauce on your way out, it's delicious on raw sea scallops."}
{"text":"I went there in March to see whats the hype is all about. Ambiance was great but food was ok and services were terrible.  Definitely not worth the price"}
{"text":"From the moment we were seated, our lovely waitress answered our questions and was more than happy to make recommendations when (as usual) I couldn't make up my mind over 2-3 options. Her recommendations were spot on, including the bottle of red wine that my friend and I ordered. Everything just seemed delicious and worth trying! However, life isn't always that fair, SO...

For the appetizers, we shared a small lobster poutine and lentil bruschetta. I would wholeheartedly suggest the bruschetta. It was fantastic and exploding with flavour! I could have never imagined it coming together as perfectly as it did. On the other hand, I had big expectations of the lobster poutine. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the spot, as I didn't find a single chunk of lobster in my dish... The fries tasted great, so did the lobster gravy, but I did want some lobster in my lobster-poutine. C'est tout.

For the mains, we ordered the walleye fish in bonito broth with speck and egg pasta, and the pork chops over eggplant and kale. While the walleye fish was good, it was a little on the salty side. However, my pork chops were mind blowing. I was skeptical, as I often find them to be overcooked and dry, but WOW... They were moist, tender, and flavorful, that's all I can begin to even say about them.

Honestly, I was surprised I could even get a reservation here just a day before, but it worked. Maybe because it was in the middle of the week at a late time, but no matter what, this place is constantly on the go and so bangin'. Check it out, no matter how long the wait may be!"}
{"text":"What a feast! We reserved a month ahead for a birthday celebration. The server suggested that we try the tasting menu in other to try the most popular dishes. It ended up to be a starter of fresh and delicious oysters, then four appetizers and four entrees of the kitchen's choosing. It wasn't a true tasting menu as it basically worked out as if we had ordered each dish individually. The lobster poutine was a standout, as was the ragu and veal/fois gras waffle. I loved the giant ceasar!"}
{"text":"Our best meal in Montreal - ever. Without question a must try when in Montreal and strong recommendation to make reservations well in advance of your visit. Use Bookenda to make your reservation or of course you could call them. 

Have the lobster poutine as a shared appetizer and save your main meal for one of the entrees they have on the board that night. The stuffed hen is big enough for two people and although I only had a small sample I will order for next time. I had the short rib and was blown away by how good it was. 

Leave some room for the ice cream sandwiches.....and also ask to have a picture taken with the kitchen staff. Well worth the money spent."}
{"text":"I am completely obsessed with Chuck Hughes. Whenever he's on tv, I watch him. I've got a Google alert set up to read anything anyone has ever written about him. I've watched every episode of Chuck's Day Off, Week Off, Eats The Streets--religiously, hoping for the day that I'd be able to visit Garde Manger and possibly taste the famed lobster poutine.

According to the internets, you have to have a reservation newly a month in advance. I was traveling in Montreal sooo, so I took a chance and arrived at the restaurant right before 5 p.m., hoping to snag a table just for myself. The restaurant has no signage or street number posted on the door. It's almost as if you have to \"be in the know\" to know exactly where it is. Due to construction on the street to prepare for the 375th anniversary of the city, it was even that much more difficult to navigate past open holes in the street and narrow passageways to get there. Lucky me: there was ONE seat at the bar (where I prefer to eat anyhow) and the bartender took good care of me. I went in for poutine and stayed for the lovely, bustling atmosphere. 

There is one menu but it's written in chalk on two boards, in French and in English. I read Yelp reviews that said to stay away from the poutine because it wasn't worth the hype, but I didn't listen and I'm glad I didn't. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had at a restaurant. Being a Southern lady, I am well-versed in the language of gravy and the gravy is what made the poutine spectacular. There was PLENTY of fat, succulent pieces of lobster and the curds were melted just slightly under and on top of the piping hot pommes frites. I had a glass of wine and happily wobbled my way back to my AirBnB.

For anyone contemplating going to Garde Manger, do make reservations and do get the poutine. It says market price on the menu and don't let that scare you away. It ended up being ~$15 CAD."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here but I wasn't as blown away as either my dining companions or other Yelpers. Loved the appetizers and desserts that we had but my entree (arctic char) was overcooked (dry as a bone!) and also really salty. I couldn't get the salty taste out of my mouth for the rest of the evening..."}
{"text":"This was recommended to us by hotel concierge and it didn't disappoint. We were struggling to decide what to eat and as we were sat at the bar the wonderful bar man (I think his name was Vito but it was a couple of weeks back and I'm not totally sure!) said he would order us a tasting menu. We left the choices up to him and it was probably the best meal I've had in years. Everything was delicious and I'd drive the 6 hours it took us to get to Montreal just to have dinner there!
The drinks were also fantastic, as was the ambience and music. 

This is not a kid friendly place but awesome for a dinner with friends or as a date night."}
{"text":"4.5*

We went to the restaurant with high hopes and we were not disappointed

The only reservations we got were at 6p even though i called a month prior to make res. 
The restaurant ambience is great; dark, rustic, exposed brick walls, low lighting in the middle of the charming Old Montreal

Service was a little odd. Our female server was very accommodating and friendly, translating everything to English from French. 
One male server was really quiet and surly. He didn't seem to like responding to \"Thank You\". ummm

Food:
I thought the prices were quite reasonable. 
Our bottle of prosecco was $55- average for restaurants

Lobster Poutine: I love Lobster and I Love Poutines but i did Not love this lobster poutine. Sad but true. The dish was teeny TINY. The fries were skinny and not super hot. The cheese was rubbery, cold and NOT melted through. The pieces of lobsters were tiny and i'm not sure i tasted any of it. And i'm not sure there was much gravy on the poutine (which explains the cold, rubbery pieces of cheese curds) 
For $17...a great concept but not well-executed. Disappointing

Seared Scallops with carrot butter and green beans. 
Amazing. 
The scallops were perfectly seared and tasty. Wonderful flavor and i would have grazed on them all nite long. 

I had a taste of my friend's risotto and it was divine as well. 

Dessert: Deep-fried mars bar with a scoop of ice cream. 
Oh my. that's all i can say. 

The restaurant got a little smoky towards the end of our visit...i guess the ventilation in the kitchen could have been better. 
But overall, a great experience

Highly recommend for anyone visiting Montreal"}
{"text":"Great food and strong drinks. Went for drinks and apps. The octopus was like nothing I've ever tried, amazing! The squash was also top notch. The drinks were definitely poured by hand which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"I was actually a bit disappointed going here. My friend is a huge fan and I've seen Chuck Hughes show so we made sure that this was one our stops in Montreal. After all the hype and everything that people have said, I had set my expectations too high. Some of the dishes were really good and others were too salty.

The place had a good vibe to it, very busy. We went here for a friend's birthday and ordered a bunch of things. We tried some oysters, which were fresh and yummy. My first time trying raw oysters and I really enjoyed it.

We had the fish cakes, which was great on first bite, until we hit the salt. That just ruined the whole dish. After all the rave reviews of the lobster poutine we had to try it. The poutine was ok the smallest and most expensive poutine I have ever tried. It had good lobster flavour, but it wasn't the best dish. The lobster risotto was good, the creamy, rich sauce is where the lobster flavour shined. The amount of lobster included in it was good; but it was a bit one the salty side too. 

My favourite dish of the night had to be the braised short-rib. It cooked perfectly until it was nice super soft, and the sauce on it was amazing. I recommend this dish to anyone who goes here."}
{"text":"Food here is good but overpriced for what it is. $35 for 3 scallops?? I really take issue with 1. The wine list-every bottle is greater than $50. Which I find obnoxious but would be fine with if it was decent. My $65 of Canadian Riesling tasted like it should have been $12. My second issue was with the extremely poor service. When spending $300 on a dinner for 2 I expect to not have to flag down my waitress on multiple occasions. We wound up skipping dessert because the service was just terrible and we couldn't wait anymore."}
{"text":"Great food, perfect atmosphere.  We went for dinner here on Saturday night.  Although the online booking site said there were no reservations, I called, left a voicemail and the hostess promptly called me back to offer counter seats. I am sooooo glad we took them. Sitting at the counter gave us the opportunity to meet David, the bartender, and to watch him make fabulous drinks all night.  He was chatty, but not at all intrusive and had great recommendations. He most certainly added to our experience
and makes an epic old fashioned cocktail. 

For starters, we had the lobster poutine and the endive salad. The poutine was everything we were dreaming of and more.  For main courses, we had the beef chuck and the duck breast. Both were outstanding. Perfectly portioned, culinary marvels. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse with grapefruit/passion fruit glaze.  Absolutely mouth-watering.  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Small venue, big flavor. Homie vibe as you walk in there is a nice sense of ole Montreal in the brick veneer. The staff was friendly and there was an eclectic collection of seafood based fusion plates to try. That night I disregarded the house recommendation for seafood and went with the pork tenderloin... and let me tell you, I regret nothing. It was the best pork tenderloin I ever tried. Ever. The wine selection was great, and the cozy ambiance was just what the doctor ordered for my party of 4. They take reservations, and I do recommend that you call in advance on the weekends. When we left the place was packed. Great experience, be prepared to spend s lil $$$, 5 stars."}
{"text":"This has been one of the best restaurant experiences I have had in a while! I guess celebrity Canadian chefs know what it takes to have a great restaurant.

The best way to describe Garde Manger is going to your most awesome friend's place and hanging out, having fun and eating great!

If I owned a restaurant I would make it exactly like this one.

To start off with, it is true, you do have to reserve early before your visit. I booked 3 weeks before for a late Sunday seating. I was pretty stressed out because my group of friends decided to add 2 people to make the reservation for a total of 6. From what I understood, 6 is the biggest group they accept and I figured it would have been a pain to change at the last minute and that we wouldn't get a seat or be really squished. I called ahead and left a message that I would be needed 2 extra people (after 6 no one picks up the phone so you have to call before). I was amazed that when we arrived, they have received my message but misunderstood and thought I was letting them know that there would be 2 less people. Immediately I thought this was going to be a disaster but they were so accommodating and it happened that a large group left and we were seated right away! No waiting! 

Our waitress was one of the most pretty ladies in Montreal. She was also so friendly and helpful. Couldn't of asked for a better server. I also seemed from around that all the servers and staff were picked as the best of the best in the city. Starting from the host to the guy that takes away the empty plates and wow, so much eye candy! (For those that like that sort of stuff ;))

Like mentioned in other reviews, this place is loud! Do not expect quiet classical. More like classic rock for the patrons of this place.

But I digress, all this writing and no mention of food or drink! Like already mention, this is mostly a seafood/meat place. I ordered a caesar with some crab legs (best caesar I have had). I also ordered some oysters (I suggest asking if they have certain things you like because they may not be specifically on the menu or mentioned by the waitress). I also ordered a flank steak with these amazing deep fried mashed potato balls. Delicious. Most of the people at my table ordered a scallop dish and it looked and tasted great. They had a big variety of delicious sounding food and I did have trouble picking just one thing. I guess I am going to have to keep going back. :)

We also ordered some desserts to finish with and they were all wonderful. The ginger molasses cookie was particularly liked by everyone.

Wine list was extensive and a good range of prices.

If you are visiting Montreal like me, or live there, you should definitely go and visit my new friends at Garde Manger. (or at least I think they are my friends)."}
{"text":"Pretentious.. the only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that the staff and service was great!! Food was OK, but WAY over priced... Oh and put a sign up.. this restaurant is not good enough to think that they don't need a sign.."}
{"text":"From the very first taste of the spices on the rim of the Caesar glass, I knew we were in for a treat!  We shared an upgraded version of the lobster poutine  - upgraded to 3/4 lb. of lobster - delectable!!  Michael had the short ribs, he raved, I snuck a bite and raved.  I had the scallops with gnocchi and carrot butter AND BACON!!!!  Soooo good!!  We listened as the server described the dessert offerings, but decided that espressos would be enough for us.
About those Caesars: what a treat to have the freshest, coldest crab leg garnish.  The  drinks were so large, they outlasted the meal!
Service was impeccable, the music fabulous.  If I had any criticism at all, it would be the poor lighting over the blackboard menus, but then if you went often enough, you'd know them by heart!!
Truly an unforgettable experience.  Never had any doubt, Chuck!!  Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a friend of a friend who travels extensively and is an avid foodie. My partner and I were in Montreal for a few days and decided to go out for a romantic dinner. We were super impressed. The server was amazing. Probably one of the best service experiences we have had in our life. Very accommodating. I commented on this to the server upon leaving.

The food was unbelievable. It's worth noting that there are maybe 5-6 options for both mains and appetizers. However, I think this works to their advantage. While they prepare only a few dishes, they are done exceedingly well. We ordered the fois gras as a appetizer and the Arctic Char and Scallop main dishes. Ingredients were markedly fresh - where did they get those capers? So good. Because I don't drink alcohol, they made me this special lemonade with a raspberry base. Their recommendation and it was wonderful. Atmosphere was classy while also comforting. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"When one moves to New York, one learns that the best establishments require no signage. It's a notion that's fueled countless \"speakeasies\" and secret restaurants like Chumley's, APT, Sushi Uo, Milk & Honey, the Backroom and PDT.

After a long weekend in Montreal, it seems the trend has spread.

In four days, I had more than a few excellent meals in Quebec's largest city, but the best by far was at a restaurant whose name, for its lack of  signage, we initially couldn't discern. It was only after peering into its window and engaging in haphazard conversation with an equally curious woman from Vermont that we learned the small, impossibly charming restaurant was called Garde Manger, run by Chuck Hughes, one of Montreal's best, and our new mission impossible -- the only available table was at 10:30.

Yes, 10:30. Or as non-New Yorkers call it \"Almost tomorrow.\" While that might be a deterrent to most, to us it meant \"This restaurant is awesome.\" So we went home, had a few drinks and came back. Starving.

The meal was more than worth the wait. My pork loin was divinity. The lobster risotto was the best I've ever had. The steak tar-tar, the daily fish, all of it, amazing. I wish I'd taken pictures.

Two days after the fact, I could sit here and wax nostalgic about the decor, the service, the quirky music or the martini that sent me over the edge. Instead, I think I'll stop wasting my time Yelping and start figuring out a way to go back and do it all again."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this restaurant!! My family and I were in town for a weekend and enjoyed our meal so much, we dined here twice!  The staff made us feel like family, so friendly and obviously big fans of the food themselves.  The homemade focaccia with caramelized onion butter served nightly was phenomenal.  We all agreed we could eat the whole loaf.  We enjoyed arctic char cooked to perfection, delicious hanger steak, lobster poutine to die for, lamb, spicy jerk crab and more.  Desserts were the icing on the cake - PB&J profiteroles, a custard cake and a spiced warm cake served with homemade ice cream - fabulous!!  We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and never been disappointed. The d√©cor is great and the waitresses are all gorgeous lovely ladies that seem genuinely nice. I don't mind it, but the place could get loud later on in the night. Now on to the food review. For my last visit, I had the salad of tomatoes, avocado and deep fried cheese croutons as a starter. What can I say except what a way to start off the meal! To follow, the short rib. It definitely did not disappoint this carnivore. I was pretty much done after that. No room for dessert. Maybe next time... 

I saw Chuck Hughes (the head chef and owner of Garde Manger) walking the streets of Old Montreal one day. Needless to say it was the highlight of the day. I am a fan of his work!"}
{"text":"Came here on a business dinner. It did not disappoint. The food was fantastic, and the waiter was very friendly and knowledgable.  Rather than individual dinners for each person, he instead arranged for us to have various dishes brought out so we could all enjoy them family style. In this way we were able to try a wide selection of dishes. They were all amazing.

In the summer I'm planning a personal trip to Montreal, and this will be one of my stops again."}
{"text":"Just a note about the reservation issue I had, opentable is garbage when it comes to this restaurant.  Its a 30 day lead time to make the reservation.  I checked open table 8am Eastern exactly 30 days before my intended reservation and they said no tables available.  I even tried this at 12:01am and got the same result.  To get a table, call.  Pay the international toll from the US to Canada and call.  I even left a message around 1:45pm 30 days before my reservation date and they called back around 2:30pm.   

I will follow up at the end of July when we actually visit.  

(FYI, I usually love opentable, I've collected my share of $25 checks from them with all the reservations I made on the site.  But for Garde Manger...not so much)"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Garde-Manger to celebrate my mom's birthday while we were visiting Montreal. The ambiance is cozy and rustic with beautiful wood and stained glass details, and lanterns hanging from the ceiling. They play an awesome playlist of music that ranges from oldies to hip hop that progressively gets louder as the night gets later.

The service at Garde-Manger was phenomenal. Our waitress was so friendly and knowledgeable- she gave wonderful descriptions of the dishes and recommended and let us taste different wines to go with each course.  

For dinner, we shared the octopus appetizer to start and the walleye and seaweed speckle entree. We finished the meal with a cherry tart with coconut ice cream- delicious! We stayed after the meal and enjoyed one of the cocktail specials- a basil and mint margarita that was out of this world.

I highly recommend dining at Garde-Manger if you are in Montreal. It is a fabulous dining experience that is worth the price- I will definitely be back next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! First timers and we were not disappointed! Staff very friendly and professional, food and presentation was incredible. We will come visit on or next trip again as a must do! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food. One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"In celebration of chef Chuck Hughes win over Bobby Flay on Iron Chef - I decided to see for myself what makes him worthy of the title Iron Chef.

We braved it with no reservations on a Friday night. We arrived around 6pm and initially were greeted with a nodding head which signaled that without a reservation it wasn't possible to get a table.  But after having lingered a few more moments with the dim hopes of snagging a table, we were told we could be accommodated provided we would leave prior to the arrival of an 8pm reservation.  We were more than happy to oblige... Alas our cab ride was not in vain!

I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a Salade Tomate and the much-talked about beef short ribs to share.  

With the minimal description of the Salade Tomate, one would expect a very unassuming salad.  However - I was blown away!  I can confidently say that this is THE best salad I've ever had in my entire life. Any anti-vegetable rebel would get weak in the knees in the face of this tasty tasty salad!  I am still in awe as to how such simple ingredients as: cucumber, avocado, plum tomato, and arugula could yield such a tasty tasty surprise! Of course it was topped with croutons and a fried sharp American cheddar to make it not-so-ordinary!  The white balsamic and olive oil vinaigrette was simple yet amazing!  And the star ingredient which really made this salad was none other than the ever so fragrant - DILL!  Chef Hughes is definitely not intimidated by textures as the crunchiness of the cucumber, creaminess of the avocado, and sweetness of the plum tomatoes tickled my tastebuds.  Then  the subtle tartness of the white balsamic and olive oil vinaigrette and amazing fried cheddar joined the party in this ever-so-impressive cast of ingredients!  The cheddar retained its firmness despite having gone through the frying process and the avocado was creamy without being mushy!  I had found a piece of heaven.

With such an amazing pre-entree tongue teaser, the \"short\" ribs had a lot to \"measure up\" to.  

While it was no doubt the most tender of short ribs I have ever experienced, it was a little too sweet for my liking.  It was served atop a bed of sp√§tzle and topped with a jalape√±o popper.  I would highly recommend having one of each 3 component in every bite so that the saltiness of the sp√§tzle balances out the sweetness of the ribs, and the fritter teases your tastebuds with that added kick of heat! 

Kudos to Canada's second Iron Chef - Chuck Hughes."}
{"text":"I have been to Garde Manger several times and it does not disappoint. It is located in Old Montreal. The restaurant does not have a sign so you will need to know where you are going. 
The restaurant is dimly lit and intimate. The exposed brick walls adds character to the place - gives the restaurant a trendy vibe.   

The food is delicious and is worthy of the hype. There are a few standouts. I would recommend starting a caesar (which comes with) and some oysters.  The oysters were expertly shucked, meaty and fresh.

For the mains, we enjoyed the signature lobster poutine, the pasta and duck. The lobster poutine consists of french fries, lobster meat, cheese curds, and lobster bisque reduced until it takes on a gravy-like consistency. The lobster poutine is a must. There is a reason why it is a signature dish. I would recommend getting a the small size as it is really filling. The pasta with rabbit meat was delicious. The duck was flavourful and cooked medium rare. 

Garde Manger and Chef Chuck Hughes are Montreal institutions. I highly recommend Garde Manger."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the sales practices left a bad taste.

I expected a big bill.  Appetizers are between $15 and $20 and entrees around $40.  We also had cocktails and wine.

Our very charming, but very fast-talking, server at the bar talked up the seafood platter.  He encouraged us to allow him to put together a platter for us which, together with two appetizers and one entree, would be roughly the same amount as two appetizers and two entrees.

When I got the bill, it was higher than even I was expecting.  But one doesn't like to make a fuss, and one has had a cocktail and some wine, so one pays the bill gracefully.

When I reviewed it later, however, that seafood platter totalled $68!  Almost double the cost of an entree.

As I said, the food was excellent, although the entrees are on the small side, but I would have preferred more honesty in the selection process.  The take-away is to tell your server how much you'd like to spend on the seafood platter before you receive it."}
{"text":"Uninspired food, cold inattentive service. I will not come back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. This was a first stop of a 5 night trip.
I eat out a lot. 
This place has it all.

Great service 
The food was fabulous.. Everything 

First time here 

\"I'm hungry how about you just surprise me with whatever you think is good\"


First was a platter of fresh seafood AMAZINGLY
Then a few other plates 


The flavored and the freshness 

WOW

Hey this place just hit everything just right"}
{"text":"Good BUT ... good is abundant in Montreal. Garde-Manger is not consistently among top recommendations in Montreal but it makes the list often enough to form some expectations. My expectations exceeded Garde-Manger's delivery in terms of both food and overall experience. 

This is another of what I call the \"Chalkboard Bistros\", fine dining establishments that provide the menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I don't like this practice but it's popular (for now anyway). I found the menu, limited and lacking distinction / personality, with the same style of offerings that are standards around Montreal. That being said, the food was good, it just didn't deliver on the level that I would have expected given the buzz about the place. 

TIP; request the front bar if bar is given as an option. The back bar can become almost another kitchen-like operation preparing oysters and volume drinks. Back bar can also be pretty tight. 
TIP: avoid being seated during one of the eating sessions times 6:30 / 9:00pm, the wait-staff can get slammed during these seating sessions and your service delayed and/or intermittent."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was on a girls trip and wanted to enjoy a nice dinner on our last night. I shared the arctic char, scallops, octopus and lobster poutine with my girlfriends and we could not stop raving about every single one of the dishes. So much flavor in each, it was great! The ambiance was very friendly and trendy. We had great, attentive service as well! I will be recommending this hot spot to any of my friends visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Garde Manger on accident, having lost faith in finding a decent place to get drunk in Vieux Montreal. There was no sign, but the place was booming on Tuesday night.  A guy named Kyle was switching between his duties of mixing music from 3 iPods, preparing oysters and scallops and finding time to chat with every person sitting at the bar.  The magic hung in the air.  The place has quite an amazing ambiance in itself, but with the fantastic service, it was irresistible. 

I've already had dinner but figured I'll try the oysters.  Kyle called them 'my babies' and prepared them while adding some fresh horseradish into the condiments mix as well.  He also gave me a couple scallops on top to give them a try. I must say they've probably been the best fresh oysters I've ever had - incredibly smooth with a delicate texture and nothing else.  The scallops were quite good, as well.  I ordered Grey Goose on the rocks and went to town.

This is a perfect kind of place where you feel like home, even if it's your first time.  It's an absolute must for anyone looking for a place to chase the touristy blues away in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"The Wikipedia entry for \"overrated\" should feature a photo of this place.  The stench of arrogance coming from the staff could maybe be tolerated if the food were better than the average old port tourist trap.  This place no longer really sees the light of day on any credible top lists in Montreal, and there's a reason why.  I can't endorse this restaurant for anything other than a cozy interior, which is why I give it a second star."}
{"text":"Most underwhelming dining experience I have ever had. Lobster Poutine is the best dish? There was barely any lobster and you can eat poutine at any other bar in Montreal.  I have had better poutine at bars. The crab dish came from the miscues off Red lobster's reject menu, and the oysters were good, but isn't that credit to the fish monger? 

The whole chicken was mediocre, shrimp risotto was a recipe from Paula Dean, and the short rib tasted like a rubber tire. The deserts were not bad. Prince point is outrageous, for a Joe Beef knock off. Go to Petit Bourgundy for the real thing and don't waste your time here.

The servers were on point, and it's shame that they work there."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks and incredible food, a must try! We ate at the bar and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I had made a reservation on the DINR app and the reservation said 5:30-9:30, which I thought meant you can go anytime in between those times. When I had arrived at the restaurant at 7pm they proceed
to tell me that my reservation was at 5:30 and I had missed it. They said there was a glitch on the DINR app, so the time was wrong. They told me that they tried to call me, but the thing is I'm visiting from New York so I don't have any cell phone service. I can only use Internet while connected to wifi, or text. They did not attempt to text me or email me, they should know that there are many travelers from outside the country that may not be reached through calling! Nobody even apologized to me. This completely ruined my last night in Montreal. It was 7pm and I had already taken a cab to the area and I was left with no reservations. And if anybody knows me I plan everything ahead of time so I hate when my plans get ruined like this. And it is hard to get a table at some of the high rated restaurants in the city. Thanks a lot for ruining my last meal in Montreal. I am beyond angry about this! They didn't even try to resolve the situation in any way. OH and to top it off they emailed me saying my credit card would be charged. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"I would like to just leave a Wow here. Easily slides in to my top 3 best meals ever.
Takes a bit to find (look for the pink light), but once you're there it's like a party in your buddy's cabin where everyone is just drinkin, munchin and having a good time. The atmosphere is loud, so if you're looking for a quiet romantic spot, Montreal has plenty that suit that purpose, not this one.
Chalkboard menu, top is apps, bottom is mains. Server will happily take a picture on your phone for you so you can easily consult it.
Started with Rabbit Agnolotti in a dijon cream sauce. I'm a bit of a cuteitarian, so while morally opposed to this dish, thumper was delish.
Hubs had the salt cod risotto with lemon and fried capers. I've since decided I've never had a risotto made right before (including my own) and will need to figure out how they got a risotto to be light and not have carb-remorse is a wonder.
I had Sturgeon, Pork Belly, Japanese Mushrooms, Egg and Potato Dumplings in a pork broth. I avoid pork like the plague, but I just had to. It didn't look like much food but once you dig in the richness of it all, so ridiculously decadent I had to restrain myself from licking the bowl. Every component sung on its own merit but was a beautiful choir with the rest. The simple addition of a couple of hot pepper rings on the sturgeon cut through the richness and provided another layer of flavor.
To finish up, we had the PB & J Profiteroles. The puffs themselves were not the best I had ever had but when you top anything witha rich and creamy ice-cream-like PB mousse and a delicious strawberry sauce...who cares?!?
Hit the pocketbook a little hard, but this is a must visit for any self-proclaimed foodie."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The menu is always changing to go with what is in season and have great sea food dishes. 
The last time I went I started with the foie gras and braised veal cheeks on a waffle and it was topped with a little syrup. Melt in your mouth!!
Then I had the scallops with carrots and there was a few gnocchi too. The scallops were so sweet and plump. Another delight!! 
At this point we had no more place for dessert. But the last I was here I took the deep fried mars bar YUMM
The service is always amazing here, the staff know the dishes really well and have a great way describing it and how it would taste. 
It's a little on the pricy side but a definite guilty pleasure that needs to be indulge."}
{"text":"Dropped in after noticing how close we were from our hotel and I have watched Chuck Hughes on his cooking shows for years.  We did not have a reservation and we purposely allowed our 15yr old to eat out in advance and then hang out on the wifi in our room since according to the online reservation site- no one under 18yr is allowed in...? The hostess gave us an early table with the understanding that the table was already reserved in 2hrs so we would need to be through by then which was totally fine.
    The 3 of us split the lobster poutine appetizer- plenty of food and wonderful and rich.  I had the cod filet and it had a delicious golden crust and was seasoned really well- salty but I really enjoyed it. My husband tried the pork cheeks which he also enjoyed.  Our 18yr old daughter had the steak and really enjoyed it but recommended eating it with greens if you start with a poutine appetizer instead of ordering the side of fries.
     The vibe of the restaurant was very cool blending Old Montreal and its character with the modern open kitchen and chic style.  Love the lighting! My husband walked right by the front door. You have to be paying attention- it is a small front with no specific labeled sign: just a white neon panel that lights up red when they are open.  The front door opens to a small foyer and you must push and walk through the heavy black curtain to find the check in table. 
   Worth trying out- a little pricey and you must work around their limited hours- but definitely a good stop in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 rounded up because I loved their tunes.

The experience at Garde Manger was close to perfect, and as many previous reviewers have noted, the setting is wonderful. Our waitress was more than attentive, as were the busboys and even bartender. 

Our party of 4 shared 3 appetizers; oysters, octopus with fingerling potatoes and chorizo, and lobster poutine. The 3 varieties of oysters were all delicious, the octopus a little too seared for my liking, but the poutine is something that grows on you I find. The first bite might be a little confusing to the palate but I was going back for more. 

For mains we had; short-ribs with Stilton cheese, 2 had the rock shrimp risotto, and I had the seared scallops with potato and brussel sprouts. I tried the risotto, which was a little too al dente for me but delicious, and the scallops were so fresh and the whole dish was perfection.

We didn't really have room for dessert, and two people had some of their special drinks (home-made Five Alive with gin, and a virgin classic Bloody Cesar). Next time I think we might try all apps so that we can try even more."}
{"text":"Ambience, service and food was top Knotch! 

Duck was amazing, as was the lobster poutine and wine selection!

Thanks for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on our last night in Montreal.  The food was amazing especially the oysters and the crab.

The staff friendly and attractive too."}
{"text":"Simply put the best dining experience I've ever had. Also, Alexander the waiter was amazing."}
{"text":"What is wrong with this place. I keep trying to make a reservation. It has been over 5 times. They never call back. They rarely answer the phone. Sure the food is supposed to be great. But who knows. Obviously the place doesn't have to beg for customers since it is well known. But some basic customer service wouldn't hurt.

I did manage to speak to someone on the phone here once and they said that for a weekend (prime social real estate, obviously), you have to make a reservation 1 month in advance at least. What a bunch of 'tards."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks, because the line at Santos across the street was huge! It was a lot of fun the crowd was young, and DJ was playing some old school Hip Hop, songs most people know but you never hear! Drinks were good had 20 year old Porto at 25$ a glass, not something you find everywhere. I'll def go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Poutine and lobster were a match made in Heaven, and the angel in charge of solemnizing the match was named Chuck Hughes. 

Now, these are facts that the clergy and the texts will not tell you, so you just need to eat the lobster poutine at Garde Manger to be blessed with such divine revelation. I showed up without a reservation at 7:30 PM on a Friday night (what was I thinking?), and was told that it would be 10 PM before I could get seated (at the bar!). I actually ended up getting seated 10 minutes before 10 PM (score!). No, I did not wait around at the restaurant for upwards of two hours; I just provided my name and phone number, and went out for a walk around the lovely city of Montreal on the beautiful summer evening. 

The daily menu is scribed onto a couple of chalk boards (one in French and the other in English), and the only two items that are constant are the lobster poutine and the jerk spiced crab. Everything else changes regularly. Some nights, they have more exciting items, such as Cornish hen stuffed with foie gras, or a foie gras and short rib waffle; other nights, it's more familiar items, such as Arctic char and walleye. 

The lobster poutine, in my view, lives up to the hype. The mildly fishy succulence of the lobster claw meat pairs very nicely with the cheese curds, fries and gravy. I noticed that one of the reviewers here thought there was barely any lobster in the poutine. I have to suspect that his dining companion must have stolen all of the lobster when he was not looking, because there really is a very generous amount of lobster on every serving of the poutine that I have seen here. 

The desserts also change regularly, and my favorite is the peanut butter and nutella profiterole, which is a rich confluence of sweet and salty flavors and smooth and crunchy textures. 

Service is absolutely outstanding. Everybody is extremely friendly. My server, Awesome Alexander, recognized me from a prior visit to the restaurant (I can't imagine how, given the sheer multitude of people dining here every night), and brought me a sweet gift of complimentary dessert (or, to continue with the theme of divinity, heavenly manna)!"}
{"text":"I have been hoping to try Chuck's place for years and finally did this trip. It was great, really it was.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  The food was very good, the service even better.  We had the 6:30 seating which was nice because I understand it gets a bit loud for the 10 seating. We found the music great and although getting louder as time went on it was excellent. Was Chuck there;sadly not but the waitress was a wealth of information. 

Food:  Lobster poutine my friend had, she said was good but not great.  I had the best ever Caesar which turned out to be an appetizer in itself with crab (and it was fresh) and horseradish. My husband had beef ragout and he loved it.  Overall very good near excellent. I wonder if the hype doesn't pull it down somewhat.  

Loved finally getting there and having the experience."}
{"text":"Party of 2, Wednesday night, 930pm. 
Very very pricey. Luckily the food is pretty good, so that helps you get over it pretty quickly.

Very dark and loud space.  We sat at the back bar and that was with a reservation.  

WARNING: they are quick to sell you on a seafood platter, but much slower to tell you the cost of that platter - they charge you for EACH item they serve you, so it gets expensive very quickly.  Make sure you ask how much it's going to cost you.  

Otherwise, our seafood platter was delicious - oysters, lobster, ceviche, sturgeon, shrimp, mussels.  Very fresh and came with a ton of condiments.  

Beef carpaccio had waaaaayy too much olive oil on it.  Soaking wet.  But the beef was fresh and tasty. 

The homemade pasta was amazing. Melt in your mouth I would order two the next time I went back kind of amazing.

Our last dish was a fish dish that was very blas√©.  Lots of ingredients piled on top and made the overall taste mediocre.  

Service was fantastic though, they are good sales people."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for a while, so I am somewhat disappointed that it didn't exceed my expectations. We started with the lobster poutine. It was good except for the bits of lobster shell in it.  We also ordered the lobster risotto which was good but nothing special. Again this had bits of lobster shell.  The sous vide short ribs were good but then again not blown away. This had a small bit of bone attached to one of the ribs. Unpleasant surprise while chewing but considering the other 2 courses had unpleasant bits in them as well it shouldn't have come as a surprise.  
Overall I wouldn't recommend it as there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal that Id rather try than come back here again."}
{"text":"So delicious the first night, we went back the next night! The razor clams and Atlantic char are outstanding! The service impeccably friendly and efficient. Next time I'm in Montreal, I will return."}
{"text":"I come to Montreal at least 3 times a year, and every time I go I stop in to Garde Manger.

Food is always top notch and delicious. 

I will say I did visit on March 16 and the waitress we had was not the best (although the food was amazing). My whole party knew what we wanted to order, however she insisted we just start with a drink order- fine.

I wanted the steak, however I dislike mushrooms so asked if I could have it with out mushrooms and substitute it for fries. She said she'd ask the chef, she eventually returned and said it was fine, however neglected to inform me she would be charging me for them. I don't see why she would have to check with the chef if she intended to charge me. 

Also, about 20 minutes into waiting for our food (she did tell us it would be 40 minutes which was fine) we had to request the bread and butter. Normally every other time I have been here (has to be at least 6 times) the waiter always brings it out.

Regardless of the poorer service then normal, the food was outstanding and I will continue to come back. My bill after tip was around $100.00 just for me."}
{"text":"This place actually holds up to its incredible reviews. The food was fantastic. The wait staff was even better. We got there early to sit at the bar and had the best time. If you can sit at the bar, the staff will keep you enjoying every second of your evening."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to Garde Manger. Only this time it was extra special. Not only was Mr. Hughes present, but he was gracious enough to help me propose to my girlfriend. I sincerely thank the staff and Chuck for this momentous event. Truly a highlight in our lives and we will forever remember the occasion. Aside from the proposal, the food and service was just as perfect! The only place in Montreal to get the best Oysters.Thank you Chuck!!!"}
{"text":"Lobster poutine was ok. My wife and I finally got a reservation after trying for months. Atmosphere is very cool and inviting. Food was good, I thought I was going to be blown away with flavor but it was still solid. Our server was the best server we have had in Montreal. We will try the other Chuck Hughes restaurants and see if they compare."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant in a very charming part of Montreal. The seafood was super fresh and the presentation was on point. Staff were very friendly. Great desserts too so make sure you save room for those!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a cold winter night by myself.  Thankful I was by myself because I would have found it hard to carry a conversation with the music that loud.  However, that being said, enjoyed the music.  Had the beet salad and oxtail ragout for dinner.  Both dishes were very well done.  Perhaps it was just me or the night but it felt like each dish was missing that element that would have taken it to excellent.  What was it I wanted in the beet salad - another flavor dimension perhaps?  The oxtail was good but feel like I was missing some top note that would have taken it further.  Okay som I'm splitting hairs here.  It was a really good meal and I was fully satisfied.  but perhaps not the most unforgettable meal of the past year."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here for our 2 year anniversary. We had called about a month in advance to reserve, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to make one easily (although we did go on a Tuesday which probably helped). The location, ambiance, lighting and decor of the place was just so charming! We tried the avocado, tomato and fried cheddar salad and the lobster poutine to start. LOVED the salad, very rich. The poutine was great too but quite expensive ($21). I ordered the black truffle and goat cheese risotto which was bursting with flavour, although was a little too al dente for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs which he raved about! It is an expensive restaurant, but you are definitely paying for the quality (and the portions are generous). We finished off with a deep fried Mars bar served with vanilla ice cream which was so simple but delicious. We tried it because we had heard so many great reviews about it, but otherwise, there aren't any fancy/ amazing desserts. Very simple items, such as a cookie or a crumble. The dessert menu probably the only thing they could improve on (hey Chuck, I'm a pastry arts student... ;) ). Overall, a great restaurant and we would go back if we weren't poor students!"}
{"text":"Loved Garde Manger! I wanted something French-inspired while in Montreal, but desperately wanted to avoid stuffy, white table cloth French restaurants common to many American cities. Garde Manger felt younger but timeless, and I really appreciated the general vibe, probably helped by a great bar and cool chalk-board menu. Fries are a must-order! Overall, easy and good quality food."}
{"text":"David the trifecta who looks like David Beckham,Tom Cruise and Bradley Cooper gave me the best service I have ever experienced. Definitely ask to sit at his back bar. Make sure to ask for the secret one scallop dish! Lovely ambience and great people!!!"}
{"text":"Okay so I had the pleasure of tasting Chuck's fare at a wine event last year and was floored.  Add to this all the hype that  GM has been getting from Iron Chef and The Food Network and I knew I absolutely HAD to go.
As you've probably read on here before getting a reservation tends to be tricky.  I tried calling a month ahead and like everyone else I failed to get a call back - BUT in GM's defense if you actually listen to the outgoing message they do say they ONLY call back if there is availability and so I had to go to plan B. Plan B aka Plan \"Show No Mercy\".  And so I put on my Saturday's best, ditched my friends for two hours to go \"shopping\" and dropped by the restaurant with a pathetic look on my face.  Yes, I am sorry to say if you are serious about getting in here you're going to have to cut the dead weight (aka your friends). Getting a seat at the bar is far easier for a group on one than it is for two or three.  
Well my plan worked, the lovely gentleman at the front and I were able to come to an understanding which had me seated at the bar in 15 minutes and out the door in two hours (which was two times longer than I needed).   

The decor of the place is nice in a dark, shabby-chic kind of way, which compliments it's location in Old Montreal.  The noise level was average, not too loud, not too soft and the music was a mish mash of 1980's classics, which was a nice departure from the constant dance party my ears are often assaulted with in Montreal.  Of course there is no signage outside, but if you know how to read numbers and a map it shouldn't be a problem finding the place. 
And the food?  OM NOM NOM!  Given that I was leading a secret double life and actually had dinner plans I opted to only try one item - the Cheddar Tomato salad, and it was like a Beautiful Spring day erupting in my mouth.  Fried cheddar, moist avocado, cucumber, red onion and juicy tomatoes on a bed of mixed greens dusted in herbs and ever so delicately dressed in a flavorful vinagrette, it had me saying \"Caprese what?\"  I also made friends with another wise solo diner (see who needs old friends anyway), who basically inhaled his Lobster Poutine and then proceeded to drool all over his dinner plate, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say it was pretty remarkable as well. 

So in a nutshell, if you are completely anal and value your friendships get someone who speaks Quebecois French to call two months ahead every day until they take your reservation OR ditch the friends, wear something fashionable and flirt with the guy at the front door.  In my opinion the bar seats are best anyway because you can see right into the kitchen and the female bartender is not only easy on the eyes but super friendly and informative as well."}
{"text":"Great food and the servers really try to make up for the slow kitchen. I was there on a Tuesday night and the place was busy but not full. Sat at the bar near the kitchen so I could see the action. The kitchen is just too small for the size of the restaurant and so things take a bit longer than they should. Excellent food though so if you have a good dining partner (or don't mind drinking) the wait won't seem that long."}
{"text":"first things first: make a reservation! I read reviews and made a reservation in advance and it really helped. It is a smaller restaurant but everyone diner is well taken care of so they have to restrict the number of customers.
I have been watching Chuck Hughes on tv for years and love his shows and recipes so when I was visiting Montreal, naturally I had to eat at one of his restaurants. 
The food was beyond what I had imagined! I got the braised rib and it was the best braised rib I have ever had in my life! My boyfriend had a yummy crusty fish on top of crispy pasta. For dessert, I had the ice cream sandwich with caramel sauce and my boyfriend got the boozy affogato. Both incredible! 
We had such a lovely waiter who was really knowledgeable and personable. Excellent service. He even gave us a cute little garde manger souvenir post card."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. They took their signature item, lobster poutine off the menu. A restaurant has a right to change its menu however when you remove a dish that is world famous and a destination dish and you do not have a current menu posted online, you can expect customers to be disappointed. Wound up having a pretty good but extremely overpriced for portion size scallops dish. I live in NY and can get great scallops dishes in 15 restaurants. Having your mouth set for a famous, award winning dish to find it had been removed soured me on the whole experience. And again, based on price, portion size, and overall quality, I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have agonized so much about writing this review. It was such an incredible culinary experience. Two months past, and I am still trying to put it in words. 
However, I have come to the conclusion that I can't really explain it well enough to do Garde-Manger justice.

It was truly As Good as it Gets in Montreal. 

I like many others wished for a little more light, and the special cocktail was pretty weak for $12 (a shot of Zubrowka and pear pulp). But, Metallica et al. provided an interesting background for the night. 
Yay heavy metal and kick-ass food.

Je reviendrai."}
{"text":"Fantastique! What a place! What ambiance! What food! So glad we went here for dinner. Stunning. Stellar. Great service, tremendous food. Nothing great come cheap. Worth every nickel. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"At this restaurant, I had hands down one of the best meals and restaurant experiences ever. I came with a friend while we were visiting Montreal. We were seated at the bar and had exceptional service. We never felt like we were waiting for the next course or like we were rushed.. timing was just so perfect. We tried quite a few menu items and each and every one was delicious. We chatted with Tim, who was manning the music that night, and he suggested that we can stop by Le Bremner if we wanted to see Chuck. Great overall experience. Would come again."}
{"text":"Over....rated.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great, the menu is written up on the chalkboard, and our meal started off fantastically with our appetizer.  Unfortunately the Lobster Poutine is totally over hyped.  First and foremost, the amount of lobster on the poutine was pretty pathetic consisting only of two large pieces of claw.  The flavor of the gravy was bland as could be.  Since it seems every restaurant has their version of poutine, I would have expected this famous chef to kick it up a notch in terms of creativity.  Simply throwing lobster on a dish to make it \"elegant\" or command the ridiculous price for this dish is simply laziness.  To be honest during the entire trip, the best poutine I had was at Le Roy Jucep and it would put Garde Manger's version to shame."}
{"text":"This is the quintessential Montreal dinner spot - cozy, delicious food and so welcoming on a cold winter's eve. Having an every-changing chalkboard-only menu is a bold move, but it is very clear that Chuck Hughes knows what's up.

We had the spaghetti squash with buffalo mozzarella, sultanas and pistachios, along with the lamb meatballs to start. This combo easy takes the cake compared to any version of its more traditional counterpart, good ol' spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti squash was cooked perfectly (no broken or soggy strands here), and when the melted mozzarella oozed into it, it was pure butter. The lamb meatballs were deliciously savory, and were cut with a bit of sharp feta, also fantastic.

For our main, we shared the duck with beets and butternut squash. The duck was succulent and juicy and the beets and squash were roasted perfectly, with a bit of crisp on the outside, but melt in your mouth mash on the inside. Again, amazing.

Dessert didn't disappoint - salted caramel profiteroles. Despite having no chocolate (my usual and often only dessert selection), these little treasures were very worth it. Good americano to wash it down, too.

Service was warm and informative."}
{"text":"Famous for the lobster poutine that beat Iron Chef Bobby Flay, the other menu items here are just as good and mostly as opulent. The poutine can be a meal of its own due to the size and heaviness of it. Lobster and poutine were meant to go together and it's amazing that no one else has thought of it. The gravy and curd go well with the succulent meat. The guinea hen, a meal meant for two, could also fill a family with the decadent truffle and foie gras stuffed inside. It's classic French technique with modern Quebecois ingredients through and through. The meat on the bird was deliciously moist and tender, imbuing flavor from the truffle and foie gras into the meat and skin. The root veggies it came with were a little bland, likely because they imparted most of their flavor into the hen. The bread served was also memorably tasty. There wasn't much of a beer menu, but the wine list was top notch with a good selection on both the bottle and glass lists. 

Service was very friendly, especially at the bar where it felt very personable. The ambiance is a bit hunting lodge like with wood features and mounted animals. Make a reservation if possible as very few tables are left for walk ins and it is constantly busy."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Alexandro was a fun and informative server. Seafood tower was great. Lobster poutine was delish. Jerk crab was expensive but good. Worth visiting. It's loud but the music is great."}
{"text":"Merveilleux!

{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service!  Small restaurant with a cozy feel and friendly service. We had a great experience and would recommend Garde Manger to anyone visiting Old Montreal."}
{"text":"In a city filled with world class hospitality and authentically good people, it's a shame to come across a restaurant host compelled to take out his apparent frustration in arriving at his station in life -- as the window dressing -- on innocent customers trying to have an honest meal.  We were summarily denied the table we reserved because our original reservation was for three people and we showed up with two people.  The host was rude, dismissive, and clearly unhappy to welcome brown customers into the establishment.  We left, quickly, knowing that we likely weren't missing much after seeing the disheveled and uneven presentation of food posted by fellow Yelpers.  Most troubling, of course, was the fact that many tables were empty, and there was no reason for the check-in boy to treat us like second-class citizens.  Chuck:  if you're paying attention, you need to drop the pretension and the front-of-the-house-d-bag.  If not, you'll be shuttered before you know it.  Intolerance isn't tolerated in 2017."}
{"text":"Apps were great, I could say that the lobster poutine was really great. The tomato salad was exceptional as well, with its fresh ricotta cheese and bright vinaigrette. The mains weren't anything to go out of your way for. We both had fish, the artic char I had was approximately 6 ounces which was fine but the dish was 36 dollars and there was one piece on top of the other making the bottom piece of fish soggy, why bother crisping the skin. The other fish we got was the stripped bass which was very fishy. 

The Bloody Mary was really tasty, nice and spicy. The dessert, peach cobbler, was boring and flat. I wouldn't go back but it's worth checking out. It seemed like a tourist trap for people looking for a celebrity chef experience, myself included. I could imagine that most of the individuals who went we like myself, from out of town."}
{"text":"I would give it a ZERO if Yelp let me.

That's right. A zero. This was one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. And I've had some bad ones. 

When you walk in the door you are ignored for 10-15 minutes as waitresses & employees scurry about. Then you are asked to wait some more as your table isn't ready. They decided to give us a free drink (one positive thing). We waited 45 minutes to sit. Yes.... 45. 

We are finally seated, great! We order our food and it arrives in a normal time. One problem, this food isn't anything special, in fact... it's disappointing. Ok, next course. The duck was as tough and bland as an old mans foot. My friend had the short rib. It was better, but nothing special. The best thing I ate was a deep fried Mars bar, made by Mars, not Garde Mange, and even that was overcooked. 

Our good friend Chuck wasn't there, and is apparently rarely there and it shows. 

They have music played by a character in a funny green hat. Unfortunately the man with the green hat plays the music VERY loud. He likes Purple Rain by Prince, Living on a prayer by Bon Jovi, and Private Dancer by Tina Turner. Odd. 

I will finish with the DOUCHE BAGS. They were sitting at the bar. Yelling, screaming, hugging, taking shots, and were quite friendly with the man in the green hat. It was an Ed hardy festival complete with barb wire tattoos. Turns out there were clusters of these people all over the restaurant. 

Conclusion... 3 people, 3 free drinks, lousy music, average food, douche bags as far as the eye can see. 300$ Yes... 300$. One bottle of wine! I will never go back. This is NOT the best restaurant in town. 

I've lost respect for Bobby Flay."}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured on a food network show, and my family took note since we were going to Montreal. It was a disappointment. First off, the spicy strawberry ginger lemonade that was recommended to us by our server was so watered down it was simply a $5 glass of water. The appetizer we chose was pasta based; the pasta was mushy on the outside, hard on the inside, but the sauce was very good. The entrees were decent, but my mother-in-law's dish was not hot, it was actually quite cool. The side dish of vegetables we ordered was not the best; in fact, all four of us felt it upset our stomaches. The one thing we all enjoyed unequivocally was dessert; our server recommended the coffee cake and it was divine. 

All in all, while the service was great, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Not going to be long winded but here goes. Drive 6 hours to get here. Our server Chelsea was fantastic. Atmosphere was good. Lobster poutine.....barely any lobster or gravy or cheese and had to pull 2 lobster shells out oft mouth. Pretty much a bowl of fries. Seafood risotto......started off great until chewing on unshelled shrimp. Not at all appetizing since bill for table of 4 was over 300.00 . Will not be back"}
{"text":"I want to preface this review with the following 
-I researched this place hard core before committing and found that everyone said the same thing. Staff rude,wayyyyyyyy overpriced,dark and they make you wait forever for your table. 
The only one i found to be true was the food is VERY overpriced hence the 3 star review.

We actually arrived a little late for our 9:15 reservation this past friday night but were seated right away.

Food
The meal started off on the right foot with a glass of sav blanc for me and a red wine for my dining companion. The cream cheese with herbs and shallots with house made bread is unbelievably good. We of course ordered the lobster poutine and it was as good as everyone says it is. The gravy was solid, the fries crispy and the cheese curds had just the right amount of salt. The lobster was a little less that visible but the flavor was there and i wasn't expecting it to be overflowing with lobster anyway.
For entrees i did the scallops with gnocchi and KP asked for the short ribs with spezztle. 
The scallops were cooked PERFECT but there were only 3. The asparagus and carrots were also a great addition to the plate but the portion was very small and the gnocchi's actually weren't gnocchi's they just happened to be made with potatoes; but were dense , dry and not very good. To me gnocchi's are pillows of perfection these were rotten rocks. The fried mars bar was exactly what you would expect a fried mars bar aka extra fat. I wrapped up my meal with a double espresso.

Service
The overall dining experience was slow but i like slow. At no point did i feel rushed but we had to request things like water, and more vin. When you are paying the astronomical prices like the ones at Garde-Manger the service should be FLAWLESS  i.e. I should need/want for nothing EVER. One negative for me was the constant up selling, the additional poutine, the seafood platter I mean i get it you want the check to be higher so you will have more of a tip but at some point just chillax with the sales pitch.

Atmosphere- Loved the darkness , Loved the candles and LOVED the music selection. 

I think this place is probably overhyped but i also think the food is pretty solid. I wouldn't suggest  to come back here but if i was in the area and wanted poutine and a nice glass of wine i would head here.

Price -$$$$ my half of the check was slightly over 100.00 including tax and tip and only had 2 glasses of wine. Basically come here and be prepared to spend a lot of money."}
{"text":"I'm assuming we visited on an \"off-night\". It pains me to write this because I was extremely excited to dine at Garde Manger and because I'm a fan of l'√©mission \"Chuck's Day Off.\"

We were a party of 2 and had reservations at the bar - which was fine with us.

We ordered the lobster poutine and tomato/avocado salad for appetizers. The salad was good - had fried mozzarella - good stuff. Selon nous autres vous pouvez trouver une meilleur poutine ailleurs pour moiti√© le prix... Ughhhh. Again - painful to write.

For main courses, we had the shrimp risotto and Duck breast with foie gras/chorizo. I had the risotto. Mon chum a eu l'autre. His was great - loved it actually. My first risotto was 80% peas, 20% rice - literally. We had to send it back. (I will add a photo of it to prove I'm not trolling here). My second risotto arrived, and had a great rice quantity but .... sandy/gritty spinach.

Our female server at Garde Manger was great. She was attentive and gracious and made us some great gin n tonics, which were unfortunately, for me, the highlight of the night.

Here's hoping it was an \"off-night.\""}
{"text":"Probably the best meal of my life. Obviously the raw bar is a must but the entree was definitely the highlight. Roasted quail w/ foie gras, fiddle heads, morels, caramelized leeks & jus. Incredibly rich but not excessively so. Coffee cake w/ salted caramel brittle and malt ice cream, which of course tasted like frozen Ovaltine, absolutely brilliant. I do want to say that Chuck Hughes is probably the least pretentious celebrity chef on the planet. He was there when we arrived and spent the whole time washing dishes. Probably thought that was the best way he could help and he knew his team had the food handled.

Bravo"}
{"text":"ohh this was such a polarizing experience... here we go...

we sat at the bar which I always like bc you get to see the bartenders in action. The bartender was very helpful with telling us about the menu. You dont get paper menus here just have to look at the wall and pick what you like.

I started off with an old fashioned which was solid. The wine was also good. No complaints here.

We ordered a few appetizers as well. We had some of the sturgeon tartare and some other raw preparation that the bartender suggested. Both delicious. 

We shared the pork as an entree. It was tender but a tad salty for my taste. The jalapeno grits were a good compliment and overall it was a balanced dish.

For dessert we had this little donut type things with peanut butter/chocolate. I forget the name but they only had 2 options so we gave it a go. Wasnt the best dessert I have had but pretty good.

This is where the review gets tricky. We had great service for about half the meal but all of a sudden the bartender did a 180. He literally went missing and then dropped the check before we were done eating. The bartenders mood changed for no reason... We werent milking our drinks or anything but it felt like we were being forced out. Very weird. It put a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience. 

Food was great albeit a little salty. Dont force people out who have come a long way to visit and this place will be fine. Until then it is a 3 star place."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. She was incredibly knowledgable about food and menu and ingredients. Our server was ultimately ... Well incredibly professional.  We enjoyed the food, the foie gras... Well it's Montreal... It's great! No. It's fabulous."}
{"text":"We came here for the poutine, which I'd seen on the Today Show. It's got lobster chunks in it, so I had to try it. Eh. It was okay. The poutine here was by far the tiniest poutine in Montreal and it cost $19. Other poutines we had were twice as big and half the price. Unless you're like me and have to try it for yourself, skip the poutine.

We also had the jerk crab as an appetizer. THIS was something to freak out about. The jerk seasoning was amazing; spicy and flavorful. I just can't explain it. It was so good.

For entrees, I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop. I don't like pork, so won't speak for that dish (he said it was good), but the scallops were freaking amazing. They were perfectly seared and crispy on the outside, but soft and tender inside. The gnocchi that came with it was homemade and perfectly cooked and the carrot butter really tied everything together well. YUM YUM YUM.

The decor is rustic-modern, if that makes any sense.  It's a small, casual, dark, trendy kind of place.  Our waitress was very friendly and was able to explain all the dishes in great detail.

It is pretty pricey here, though. There were 3 of us total; 2 appetizers and 3 entrees. No drinks or anything. Bill came to $207, and we weren't really that full after. Honestly, this restaurant has very good quality food, but for the price, I'd rather go eat at Quattro again. At Quattro, we got 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 glasses of wine for the same price and their food was amazing."}
{"text":"Walked by last night after a really busy & tiring day.  Drawn in by the vibe, we were not planning on falling in love.  But, from the moment we walked in it was exceptional.  Grilled octopus & potato starter was perfect.  BIson tartare was unique & flavorful.  The Arctic Char with toasted Israeli couscous was so fresh & perfectly balanced.  And, exceptional wine list."}
{"text":"I was vacationing in Montreal last summer and knew I wanted to check out Garde Manger. I was able to get a reservation for the Saturday night we were in town at 8:30. 

We arrived and were promptly seated in a huge corner booth. Since I was with my brother and his friend we decided to try a lot of different dishes. My review is a bit overdue, so I don't remember entirely what we ordered but I do remember the lobster poutine and oysters. Both were really good!

I would recommend Garde Manger. The service was great and the restaurant has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Waited so long to try this restaurant, it's really hard to get a reservation. We went there because we watch Chuck's day off and we heard so much about his poutine that won Iron chef that we had to tick it off our food bucket list. First, we waited 45 mins before they take our orders. Waitress apologized and said \"Sorry it's friday night so we're reaaaally busy.\" OK? Did this place just open a week ago or what?? Its a freaking restaurant of course its busy on Fridays

Lobsters are not in season and we were informed by the waitress that the price would be 36$ Since we really wanted to try it we went for it...when the poutine came, our jaws just dropped. I mean- Why would you charge much higher than the regular price and bring just a normal poutine with literally 6 pieces of curd cheese and tiny bit of lobster on top...just why...and seriously there was maybe just 2 tablespoon of gravy poured on it. Its okay to charge 36$ for a lobster that is not in season but to charge and bring no lobster is a f* joke. Anyway, for what I tasted, it was still pretty good, because any normal poutine you eat is good.
....still can't get over the fact I paid 36$ for fries lol 

The mushroom risotto was delicious but the squash spaghetti with a piece of mozzarella on top was awful. 

I will give this place another chance because I really want to try their real lobster poutine, so i'll definitely come back in the summer. But for the rest, there are sooo many better options in Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Best and most beautiful service I have ever had in a restaurant. Perfect vibe to the place. Great food that felt like modern French. Wonderful part of town."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and had a mixed experience. 
Atmosphere and service is good. 
Dishes are hit and miss:

Seafood platter of oysters & cold smoked salmon: great
Beet salad w/ apple, dill and buttermilk dressing: very nice
Lobster poutine: very salty and not much lobster (19$)
Beef cheek gnocchi: too salty, greasy and some odd Asian flavors mixed in  (the biggest looser of the night.) 
Venison served rare: delicious."}
{"text":"After watching Mr. Hughes cook on his day off many times, I decided Garde Manger was a place I'd definitely have to hit up when I was in Montr√©al. It did not disappoint! Got an excellent short rib, chili crab, and a smore's ice cream dessert that was heavenly.

Staff were awesome - great food and really fun.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, and yum. We started with the Salad with peaches and blue cheese, and spent the night begging the waiter to list its full list of ingredients. 

My boyfriend had the steak frites which he found delicious. I had the Risottto with shrimp and mushroom, which was also... Delicious. The place is pricey, so come prepared to spend but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE!  We havent been there in about a 1.5 and decided since we used to go there frequenty- we would go back w/ my Dad in town.  Walked in, the decor and the ambiance went from what used to be cool, chic, edgy- to lame calm restaurant.  The waiter had no personality- I asked him \"Is the place still as good as it used to be?\" his resonse -walked away. OK.

Now onto the food...Ordered oysters and another appetizer (lobster poutine which was DELISH) and 2 main dishes.  They served us everything together! REALLY?! What happened to apps come first then dinner? 

Best part was we had a variety of oysters- the ones from BC ended up being super fishy. The waiter replied \" Oh yes i HATE those too\".  So why not tell us that before we ordered them?! Thanks a lot for nothing! 

The gnocchi in a meat sauce was absolutly disgusting- it was like chineese beef dish sauce and a few random tiny gnocci floating around.  

Sad to say if your a real foodie like we are- who go out multiple times a week..avoid this place.
Came home and ordered a pizza!  Sorry Chuck- shame."}
{"text":"Chuck's team has nicely represented Garde-Manger on the gastropub scene with it's purple light shining on old Montreal.

Menu is nicely elevated with a few seasonal dish that may come and go, revolving around steady classics and all executed with a twist. The short ribs, making the podium hands down for the meat team sharing a close spot with the shelfish \"box\" on the food-appeal photo finish. Any appetizers with foie gras is a must indulge almost to a point where you want to skip dessert and grab some more! Too bad some of us are blessed with shelfish allergies... The lobster poutine looks addictive!

Wine list is elaborated, steap in price but will complement any orders.

Staff is knowledgeable, very attentive and making the dinning experience enjoyeable. No need to mention service is near spotless.

Good for business type dinners, not so good for a cheap date. Decor and music brings a pefect ambiance to this out of the box experience.

Online reservation days in advance is a must as walk-in patrons may get welcome another evening. Expect to spend 2h indulging."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The Spice jerk crab was one of the single best items I've had in my lifetime. And I don't even like crab. The pork chop was very good and the steak fillet, which my friend had was very good as well. The bloody merry we had also had an interesting look although I didn't taste. The Foi Gras was absolutely excellent. The Putin was fairly good, although it was the first time I've had putin so I don't have anything to compaire.

Be ready to make a reservation well in advance (I think up to a month advance is allowed) and come on time. The restaurant is not that large but I didn't feel crushed by too many people like many of these boutique restaurants."}
{"text":"My parents were coming to town and my dad has long been a fan of Chuck's Day Off, so this was the perfect opportunity to score a reservation (and score some impress-my-dad points).  

It's not a spot I would ordinarily seek out (I'm more of a diner/dive person than the fine dining type), but I couldn't help but be impressed by the impeccable service (water glasses were never empty, wine recommendations were bang on, and our server took the time to check in on us often).

Appetizers were tasty  - a simple cherry tomato salad with fried cheese croutons, and a boston lettuce salad with fried sardines and green goddess dressing were a fantastic start to the evening. 

Main courses were short ribs with spaetzle and a scallop dish. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. 

For dessert we ordered the \"famous\" deep fried mars bar, and while it was ok, it was nothing to write home about. We shared it between three of us, and couldn't manage more than a few bites each. Major sweetness, though paired with cold vanilla ice cream to offset the liquid sugar factor we made it work. 

Overall a fantastic meal. I'd go back again for a splurge - but it's not an everyday dining spot."}
{"text":"My colleague and I went here during a business trip to Montreal last week.  Since we arrived late (9:30pm) we had no trouble getting a spot but in the end we decided to get a seat at the bar and eat there.

We had the best bartender/waiter serve us...His name is Sam and I got the best service I have ever had in a restaurant from us.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and we took him up on a lot of his advice for us on the food and the wine.

We had the seafood platter, the tuna tartare and a pan fried arctic char and all three dishes were unbelievably delicious and fresh.  

Sam also introduced us to a wicked shot (\"hot shot\") which was layered maple whiskey with hot espresso on top.  

I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Sometimes the hype around a restaurant kills the actual experience of being there.  This is probably true of Garde Manger.  Food was fine but the experience did not meet the raving reviews that I had heard.

We made a reservation in advance but ended up in a corner booth which was not comfortable.  The idea of not having a menu bothered some of the folks in the group but I was cool with the idea of reading off the black board.

Service : Our waitress was phenomenal!  She was efficient, funny and kept the conversation going as we placed our orders.  Definitely a highlight!

Food : We tried a lot of appetizers - portions were small which led us to order more.  For an entree, I tried the pork tenderloin with jalapeno grits which was the only dish i really liked.  The rest of our group tried their different offerings - seafood, steak.  Food tasted good but the overall experience did not live up to the expectations.

Ambience : For a fine dining restaurant, our table for 5 was too cramped and we did not enjoy it.  The restaurant is highly sought after and is crowded at all times.  Its not easy to find the restaurant since they do not have a sign upfront.  Its an unassuming door and just follow your GPS.

Pricing : Expensive.  Don't mind paying the price as long as there is value in the experience.

Will I return? : Maybe, to entertain."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!

The ambiance of Garde-Manger is fantastic.  Warm and cozy, and all of the guests are excited to be dining in noteworthy establishment.  The waitstaff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly.

For appetizers, we shared the mid-sized lobster poutine and it was amazing!!!  Everything about it was perfect.  The lobster was incredibly fresh, the gravy was hearty and the fries were not to soggy or too cripsy.

For main course, I split the scallops with potato gnocci and the stuffed cornish hen with my friend.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, and tender and flavourful.  The cornish hen was also amazing (it was super juicy).

For dessert we shared the fried Mars bar.  Which was completely gluttonous, but the perfect sweet way to top off an otherwise savory meal.

I would definitely highly recommend Garde-Manger and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Packed and tiny restaurant in Old Montreal.  The staff is super busy but our server was great.  She helped us through some great suggestions - I was so torn to order the famous poutin, but she swayed us to another better option that wasn't so heavy straight off the bat.  We tried their massive famous Caesars which was fun - strange for dinner - usually associate bloody Mary's for brunch/breakfast but as an appetizer for dinner it was fun!  We just really enjoyed this place as our first stop in Montreal and it certainly was lively and popular!  You will have a good time!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and we loved it, however this experience was completely different. We had a reservation for 8:45, and when we showed up at 8:47 were told that our table had been given up to another group because we were late and they hadn't been able to reach us. We honestly thought she was joking because it seemed so ridiculous. Apparently we had one digit  wrong in our phone number and because we didn't call to say we'd be late, and \"15 groups hadn't shown up all night\" they decided to give our table away. The hostess was dismissive and unapologetic and blamed us for being late. We are really easy going and reasonable people but it was so frustrating and upsetting to be treated so poorly. We know the food is good from previous experience  but the service was really really disappointing."}
{"text":"Has a lot of promise, but unfortunately is riding a wave of hype. Food was relatively creative, but mostly out of balance. Had the cocktails of the day (bloody Caesar with crab claw and something resembling an aperol spritz), lobster poutine, tomato salad, short ribs with spaetzle, and scallops with gnocchi in carrot sauce. I'm a bit disappointed to be saying this but only the simplest dish, tomato salad, really worked well. Next the scallop dish was well composed, but the poutine gravy and the spaetzle overpowered the dishes they were intended to complement. Don't get me wrong, the restaurant has a lot to offer beyond food, but in a province of amazingly executed food, Chuck Hughes didn't bring it..."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner at GM was woth the trip to Montreal. Chuck Hughes second resturant is awsome.  They menu has a big sea food presences. If your thinking of going make a reservation well in advance."}
{"text":"Simply put, this was an exquisite meal. The Ginto-Nique was one of the best variations on the cocktail I've ever had. We split the orechiette as a starter and it was rich and indulgent. One of us had the pork tenderloin with cheddar and jalape√±o grits and declared it one of the best pork dishes she'd ever had. A wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Garde-Manger and unfortunately it fell short of the previous two. The service was very attentive as usual, however the food was just mediocre. I guess since the menu changes daily perhaps you could call it an off-night, but unfortunately I was trying to show some friends how incredible Montreal food can be and Garde missed the mark. We started with some old favourites: their giant caesar (it came topped with two clams and was spicy and delicious), the lobster poutine, which is always solid. Then our entrees arrived. My fianc√©'s braised short rib was good but far from remarkable, our friends both had the scallop dish and, again, nothing unique or special about this dish. Then there was mine...It was not good.  A small overcooked piece of fish sitting in a pool of a simple stock with a sprinkling of wilted green (it appeared to be iceberg lettuce but since this would be such a bizarre combination I'm sure I must have been mistaken, either way it was unappetizing). The fish lacked flavour and the presentation was simply awful. In hindsight I probably should have mentioned my disappointment to our server but I was too focused on our dinner conversation to complain. Afterwards, hoping dessert could redeem the meal, we ordered the Baked Alaska variation to share.  Served flamb√©, it had a donut center, which was unfortunately a little on the dry side (possibly day old) and this made for another mediocre dish. 

I will give Garde another chance since I've had great experiences in the past, however I'm hoping they come up with some tastier more inventive dishes."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night for a few drinks with a friend after eating at another restaurant nearby. We were seated at the back bar as the place was obviously busy; all tables were full as was the bar in the front of the restaurant. 

I've eaten at this restaurant and can say that the dishes are great; the market fresh menu displayed on a chalkboard is simple, creative, and just plain tasty! 

Tonight though, we wanted cocktails and Garde Manger delivered! The service was friendly, the ambiance was buzzing, and the space itself is cozy and relaxed for a fine dining restaurant. The cocktail mixes were good and one as interesting as the next; I could have easily kept going but stopped at two 

I would definitely return for the food again, especially their seafood plates as the menu is ever changing; our bar mates servings sitting next to us definitely opened my appetite!"}
{"text":"Oh this place blew me away. It is very hard to get a reservation here so my boyfriend and I decided to go at 9 pm on a Tuesday night and managed to get a spot at the back bar. We had a blast.

The atmosphere can not be beat. Dark and cool. Now for the food. I had oysters from Nova Scotia that were crisp and so beyond fresh. I decided to treat myself to a raw scallop that was still on the shell. You can't get that anywhere! So impressive. 

Then the main event. The LOBSTER POUTINE. okay if you are going to get poutine, go hard and get lobster poutine. It's as good as it sounds. Huge portion with large chunks of lobstah with a buttery gravy sauce with melted cheese curds over fries. Need I say aything else?

The service is 10/10. Everyone is very nice and are open to making suggestions. Loved the vibe and I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the seafood platter, lobster poutine & jerk crabs (so spicy that I cried lol) perfectly pear with a pilsner!"}
{"text":"My wife and I traveled to Montreal for 2 days on a business trip, I was able to get a reservation 30 days in advanced. We started with a Bloody Cesar (variation of the Bloody Mary, with clamato juice and various spices) we had the seafood platter with oysters, shrimp, scallops, and crab. We found the seafood very fresh and generously portioned. We shared a salad with fresh peaches, and finished with the famous Lobster Poutine. Everything was excellent, it was a bit spendy but for that special occasion it was worth it. I will definitely hit this spot again, on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Chucks day off. 


Sara: 3/5
Suk: 4/5

We felt lucky to get into Garde Manger when we called the Sunday morning to ask about reservations that evening and were told, yes, please come at 7:15pm.  

We felt less lucky when we showed up at 7:15pm and were told by the hostess, we will be with you in a minute.  

That minute morphed into 30 minutes, with nowhere to sit, no offer of water or a beverage, no preview of the menu and no acknowledgement of our presence beyond the first, \"hello, do you have a reservation, we will be with you in a minute\".   

I am an impatient person and the only reason we stuck around that long is because Montreal had an amazing video series of it's history projected against different buildings around old Montreal which we viewed to kill the time.  That, and Suk really wanted to eat here. I personally would have been ready to leave 15 minutes in.  

We were eventually ushered in and seated at the back bar.  Once we were there, we ordered oysters, jerk crab and the braised short ribs.  

If you have read any of my previous reviews you know I do not review oysters unless they are off - oysters are oysters and these oysters were great.  Thank you ocean and thank you fishermen.    No need to thank a particular restaurant for serving the fruits of other people's labour.  

The jerk crab was amazeballs.   Yum yum yum!  What's that? This isn't your own homemade marinade? Maybe Graces? As in available at most grocery stores across the country?  

So now, one dish which is actually from CH, short ribs!   Tough yet fatty and little seasoning. We left half of it because it was mostly fat.   

Fantastic service"}
{"text":"I had the scalp plate it was great... my wife had the sturgeon and did not like it . She thinks it was over done. The wine was ok .. but my martini was good."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good experience!
I wanted to try this restaurant for so long and tonight we finally went there. We were sitting at the bar which was pretty tight but that's ok. 
The lobster poutine was divine. Absolutely the best poutine in the world. 
The seafood platter was awesome too, paired with their special sauce, I just want more and more!
We got the tilefish as main dish. Awesome balance of flavour with carrot, gravy-like sauce and some crunch stuff. 
In conclusion, expensive but tasty!"}
{"text":"The last stop on my Food Day in Montreal was Garde Manger and I definitely made the right choice. I was dining alone so I sat at the bar where the absolutely adorable bartender offered to make me an Old Fashioned instead of the Basil Hayden's, neat that I had ordered. It was perfect! I ordered the lobster poutine which came out fairly quickly. The huge chunks of lobster claw were sweet, the cheese curds were gooey and the gravy was savory. The fries were fresh and seasoned perfectly. Garde Manger was the highlight of my trip...I walked past it twice because it's not clearly marked. Make sure you're watching out for it!"}

Nous sommes arriv√©s un peu avant notre heure de r√©servation, ils √©taient toujours en pr√©paration et nous ne pouvions pas nous installer pour d√©guster un ap√©ro, nous devions attendre √† l'ext√©rieur. Nous avons finalement √©t√© assis au bar. M√™me si nous √©tions assis au bar sur des tabouret, nous √©tions tout de m√™me √† l'aise. Des baguettes de pain nous ont √©t√© servies avec une tartinade au paprika tr√®s d√©licieuse. On ne peut venir au Garde Manger sans essayer la poutine au homard. Nous en avons donc partag√© une. D√©licieuse et tr√®s go√ªteuse. Malgr√© que mon mari soit intol√©rant au crustac√©, il n'a pu s'en emp√™cher. Comme plat principal, j'ai command√© le confit de canard et mon conjoint les ribs, les deux plats √©taient EXCELLENTS. Comme dessert nous avons essay√© la barre Mars frite, dont on a tant entendu parler. Un mot: collant. Elle donnait une sensation de tire extr√™mement collante. Mauvais. Je ne la recommande pas du tout et j'ai envi√© mes voisins de bar, qui eux, ont command√© le brownie au chocolat. Hmmmm j'y pense encore. 

Deuxi√®me tentative d'essai du Garde Manger avec des invit√©s am√©ricains en ao√ªt 2012. Nos touristes am√©ricains tentent de New York de faire une r√©servation, mais en vain, aucune r√©ponse et le restaurant n'a m√™me pas daign√© retourner les appels. J'ai donc pris en charge de faire la r√©servation. Ils pr√©cisent sur leur bo√Æte vocale qu'ils retournent seulement les appels des r√©servations confirm√©es. Quel service √† la client√®le!!! J'ai tout de m√™me eu la chance d'avoir un retour d'appel pour me dire qu'il n'y avait plus de disponibilit√© pour la date choisie. 

Je donnerais bien 5 √©toiles, si cel√† n'avait pas √©t√© du service √† la client√®le lors de la r√©servation et le service un peu pr√©tencieux."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Me and my date came here on a weekend trip to Montreal. Knowing this place was probably booked solid, I got the DINR app and sure enough spotted a reservation for two.

Our waiter was hilarious and made the whole meal so enjoyable. They also start you off with some bread and onion butter that was delicious! 

The waiter boasted the olde fashioned which my date got and thoroughly enjoyed. My Sauvignon blanc was great with my meal. 

We stared off with the jerk crab which we were told is the only dish that has stayed on the menu throughout the entire 11 years the restaurant has been open! It was delicious but my date who wasn't used to peeling and eating crab found it messy and hard to eat. However, I loved it! 

For mains, I had the scallop and pork belly in BBQ sauce. Presentation was on point. This was the most delicious thing ever, the scallops were cooked perfectly and paired so well with the pork belly and the corn it was on. Portion was small which is my only negative point, I just wished there was more for how much it cost. 

We ended off the meal with the peanut butter and chocolate sauce puff pastry, this was okay but my date loved it! 

What a great evening, would 100% return on my next Montreal visit!"}
{"text":"The service and the food was great. The waitress really helped explain the menu.
Their speciality is sea food, so try ordering at-least one dish. I had the big eye tuna appetizer and it was delicious with the right seasoning.
The portions doesn't do much justice for the price, but delicious none the less.

My only issue was with the lobster poutine. I am no poutine expert but I felt the fries were  quite burned and was a little sparse on the gravy.

Ambience:5/5 
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"Restaurant fantastique dans le Vieux-Port de Montr√©al BIEN BIEN cacher! Essayez pas de le trouver sans adresse, vous n'y arriverez pas! Mon copain m'a amen√©e l√†-bas pour une occasion sp√©ciale et nous avons tout aim√© du restaurant! Toutefois, pr√©voyez-vous un bon budget, parce que on paie pour la qualit√© des aliments et du service! 

Je vous conseille d'√©couter les serveurs! Ils pourront vous guider parmi les choix et vous offrir un service personnalis√©! Je vous sugg√®re aussi de vous asseoir au bar, le barman est tout simplement g√©nial et pourra vous donner des boissons qui s'agencent avec vos plats en tout temps! 

Nous avons rarement aussi bien manger; le plat de fruit de mer est vraiment un must!"}
{"text":"First time at Garde Manger last night. Sat at the Oyster bar and had a great time. Caesars with crab legs are not only visually appealing but made properly. The Poutine de Homard was delicious, though pricey. The Cote de Porc with a duck egg was amazing, the sauce which coated the plate was perfect. We also had the scallops with carrots which were seasoned and seared to perfection.They came with gnocchi which was yummy but a little tough, either to much flour or overworked. To finish the marshmallow coated brownie, brownie was rich and delicious, the marshmallow tasted great though had a little to much gelatine and set to firmly for my liking. Also had 1/2 dozen Village Bay oysters with mignonette and what I believe was a homemade chilli paste, they were fresh and all you could want from an oyster, at a good price also. 6 for $15. All in all a great meal with rich heavily seasoned food and I will most definitely go back anytime I am in Montreal (If I can get a reservation!).  2 of us shared the poutine and then the 2 main courses plus brownie dessert shared, 2 crazy Caesars and another well drink each came to $185 before tip. Pricey for homey food, but it is done very well with an informed and attentive staff, WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"I knew that the next time I came to Montreal I was going to pop my Garde Manger cherry.

My first time was everything I had hoped for, and more!

We made a reservation (smart idea), and were seated right away at the bar. Perfect place to sit for a small group of 2 or 3! 

Must have - Lobster Poutine. One might think this is probably Chuck Hughes' most overrated dish...but trust me, it was well due the accolades! Absolutely delicious. Poutine with just the right amount of \"fishiness\" added to the gravy, curds, and frites. We also had the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork (equally amazing) and the Pierogies & Pork Belly (yum). 

Service was great. Ambience was perfect. 

It's a great feeling when a restaurant can live up to high expectations! I can't wait to come back again and try other items!

C'est tres tres bonne!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  We had one of the best meals we have ever had here. The waiter was wonderful, the music was great and the wine recommendation was perfect!  Wish we lived closer so we could go back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in Montreal !!    After trying other #1 spots that were disappointing, Garde Manger served an amazing meal with equally excellent service.  Top it off with one of the very few that serve top shelf alcohol.  Not that pricey and well worth every penny !"}
{"text":"We had a astonishing evening as soon as connections who wanted to experience the delights. Beautiful food and excellent attentive encourage."}
{"text":"memroable experience here - definitely worth the trip and having the power out - yes its old montreal - and it was summer - made it special. we tried calling to get reservations but it seems like you have to get them at the right time - we got them through the conceirge at the hotel we were staying for the week - for the next day at the bar - it seems it was just luck but we got in - so i'm guessing maybe calling a little bit before they open around 6-6:30 is the best option.

the tomato salad. i can't say how the other reviewers were spot on.. fresh ingridents and the dill, fried cheddar, armenian cucumbers, and heriloom tomatoes - and believe it or not the dressing is white baslamic vinegar - just says allot about how important it is to eat fresh, seasonal, and simple.

i had the duck breast with truffled peaches and foie gras - the spanish chorizo gave it an added and appreciated complexity.

do try the bloody ceasar with the crab claw - the sweetest crab i had in ages ... a great appertif to start the evening.

the staff is great here - they are busy but they were able to make this a very memorable dinner. of course its about the food - so kudos to the kitchen staff for producing these dishes to perfection.

being a popular desitnation in Vieux Montreal - there's good company with the other diners here especially at the bar.

keep the address handy and if you have GPS - you'll be able to spot this place as its very non descript."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood! Follow the road all the way down to the glowing pink sign. It's almost as if they don't want to be noticed ... oh but they are! Just to make a reservation, you have to call their number, leave a message, and their message tells you they will call you back only if they find room for you. Don't show up unannounced or you won't get a table! I was lucky to get a call-back on a Wednesday night for a reservation at 9pm at the bar! After all that, it was a great experience. We ordered the lobster poutine, and it was really good. Some Yelpers have claimed inconsistency on this dish but luckily for us this time, it was very well made. Next we ordered a medium seafood platter which you can see in one of my pictures, it was also incredible. Unfortunately we ate too much to try the dessert but will be returning. The staff was very friendly and always attentive to our needs. The ambiance was happy and lively, and the music was not as loud as some have commented, we had no problem hearing each other. Will definitely be back, provided I get a call-back again!!"}
{"text":"Alexandro was an excellent server. Lobster poutine, seafood platter & arctic char was perfect. It is a noisier atmosphere so it was a lot of fun. Make sure to make reservations. Least favourite was sparerib dish; it was too dry."}
{"text":"Before dining at Garde Manger, I thought I would just encounter terrines and foie gras in Montreals' restaurant scene.  I was proven wrong. We managed to get reservations in this very popular, highly acclaimed restaurant on a cold and rainy day in May.     The highlight of my meal was the fruits de mer, which had  the freshest lobster, crab, oysters, and shrimp I've ever tasted. Prices are affordable, vibe is low key but stylish, and service was friendly.  

I will definitely be dining back here when I return to Montreal.  My only worry is that it will be so popular that it will even be harder to get reservations."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have watched Chuck Hughes and wanted to try one of his restaurants. I take celebrity chef restaurants with a grain of salt and I go in with low expectations. 

Before I went I checked online if any reservations were available. No reservations were available so I took a risk and headed down.  To make sure I would have a chance to get in, I went right when they opened at 5:30. Much to my surprise, during the approximately two hours I was there, the restaurant wasn't full. What is up with there being no reservations available?  

When I eat at \"fine\" dining establishments I like to order a little at a time. I don't have my entire meal planned out as I don't know how filling each course will be. Maybe after the first course I'll find the food isn't good and I will want to leave.  I started doing that and the person who served me said, \"You will get better service if you order all of your food at once.\"  

What?

I've never heard that in my life. It smacked of get 'em in and get 'em out. I left after the first course. 

I did, however, try the house-made smoked salmon. That was delicious."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on our first night in Montreal. It took us a while to find this restaurant because they pretentiously didn't have the name of their restaurant visible.

I ordered the drink of the day and my boyfriend had a beer. The drink of the day was delicious and I was happy that they weren't stingy with the alcohol.

We ordered three appetizers to share: the famous lobster poutine ($19), grilled octopus ($19) and fried cod and clam ($16). My boyfriend complained that there were very little lobster in the lobster poutine and I couldn't agree more. I think I took the only piece of lobster and he was left with the bits and pieces. The fries were decent but I think I like Deville Dinerbar's fries more (especially for that price point). The grilled octopus was also done well and wasn't tough at all. However, it was nothing special to my palette. The fried cod and clams was the the worst dish because all I tasted was batter.

The downfall of the night was when the host rudely confronted us because of a reservation confusion. We called earlier in the night to inform them that we would like our reservation pushed back and they nicely did it for us. Unfortunately, the person taking our call made two reservations under our name. That's why the host confronted us about the second reservation. I didn't see why he had to be so rude toward us when it wasn't our fault and the restaurant wasn't even busy (it was 6pm).

Overall, we had a mediocre experience and I expected more from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Our server was great and walked us through the menu and various alternatives. Food was great we had the jerk crab, halibut and the artic char and the cinnamon cake. Was hoping to see chuck, but didn't see him!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!  

I came here this past weekend with my boyfriend for my birthday weekend getaway.  I made a reservation for a Sunday night at 7pm about a month ago.  The place was busy when we got there but got steadily more busy as the night progressed.  

We ordered the smallest cold seafood platter as an appetizer (6 oysters, 6 jumbo shrimp & 6 king crab legs).  It was very good, though I wasn't thrilled with the cocktail sauce they served and would have liked more horseradish.  The seafood was fresh and very tasty!

We drank dirty martini's with our app.  These could have been dirtier - very stingy on the olive juice but i guess I like my dirty's on the filthier side and I should have mentioned it when i ordered.

For main course we shared two appetizers and I am glad we did because they were very large.  We had the lobster poutine which was AMAZING with huge chunks of lobster meat.  This did NOT taste like lobster from the can (as per previous reviewer).  It was fresh and juicy and the chunks were huge!  lots more lobster in here than fries!  We also had the tomato salad app with fried chedder cheese squares & avocado!  WOw great compliment to the poutine.  So fresh and delicious!  We each drank sauvignon blanc with the meal which was a nice complement.  

Our server was very good although I think she was a bit disappointed that we did not order full main courses on top of the raw apps and appetizer portion main courses.  Honestly we were so stuffed we didn't even finish it & the total still topped out at almost $200 so hopefully that shrug and upturn of the nose I noticed after I acknowledged her \"is that all?\" with a nod was just my imagination.  

It doesn't matter, the food was worth it and if I ever find myself in Montreal again I will beeline it to this spot.  Best meal in town!"}
{"text":"While on a business trip, this was the one restaurant I was told to go to and splurge on.  Make sure to make a reservation, as it's popular but small.

The atmosphere is small with dim lighting, with the menus written on blackboards on the wall above the bar.  We started with a great bottle of wine and Lobster Poutine.  It arrived to our table piping hot served in a skillet - delicious.  The serving size was a bit small, but who really needs to eat THAT MANY fries covered in lobster and gravy?  It worked great as an app for 3 of us, and left us all fulfilled.  My main dish, risotto to die for.  And to finish - deep fried snickers with ice cream.  

Dinner that night was extraordinary long, but I enjoyed every minute."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for this place, especially having finally watched the episode where chef Chuck Hughes defeated Bobby Flay on Iron Chef and having gone to the Bremmer were we had an amazing dining experience.
We shared 5 appetizers, the clams, the bison tartar, the octopus, the lobster rolls and the lobster poutine.
Everything was good but nothing was spectacular or made we want to continue ordering. 
The lobster poutine was original and they were definitely generous on the lobster serving but it wasn't the best poutine I've ever had.
The octopus was somewhat dry, the lobster roll lacked seasoning and overall that wow factor you would expect at a place like this just wasn't there.
Especially when considering the price, it just wasn't worth it.
Probably won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I had been curious to visit Garde Manger for a while because of the Chuck Hughes connection, and my wife and I used to watch a lot of Food Network. But we live in Toronto, so when we were in Montreal recently I made it a priority to make it here and book a reservation way in advance. If you want a two person table this is definitely needed as they only have a few two person tables. If you don't land one of those then you'll find yourself at the bar which is I'm sure fine. Food is food. Drinks are drinks.

The chalkboard menu is ever changing and makes you know you are only eating seasonal stuff. We ordered a couple apps. My wife had the asparagus which was in season and quite delicious. I had the shrimp salad which was good, as it had good flavour, but maybe not as interesting as some other things and I regretted my choice. My main was the artic char and chorizo which I thought was a slam dunk flavour wise, though a bit tiny for a main. Though very pretty. My wife had the spaetzle which she enjoyed. Who doesn't love spaetzle?

We had sponge cake with ice cream for dessert that looks and sounds simple but it was out of this world. Maybe my favourite part of the dinner. Simple things done exceptionally well always rule supreme. It was a delicous dinner but I feel like there is better value out there."}
{"text":"Unpleasant and very expensive. Same experience as other reviewers, hard upsell for wine ($80 bottle of $25 wine) tasting menu. My husband and I meeting an old friend and his wife for dinner--something special as we hadn't seen them in years. Dinner for four, bill of $750.... and here is what we got: entrees and appetizers plunked in the table, that we had to portion. Every time a plate came, the server loudly interrupted us. The room was filled with bachelorette parties and tables of drunk men. A tasting menu, in my experience, is a progression of small plates that the chef has thought through to show off the restaurants menu. Not here. Three regular sized entrees, plunked down, two sides. All at once--and unpleasant together (this sauce? That entree? Or that one? Bleu cheese overpowered, and no idea which dish it came on). Three desserts came--a slice of chocolate cake, a rhubarb tart and a pistachio semifreddo--on a plank. No knife (my husband got up and went to find one) again with the portioning and a mish mash on the plate. The minute dessert was cleared a new guy, large and silent, came with the bill and ran our cards. First attentive service of the night. And then...still amazed...he asked us to leave soon, as the next party had arrived early for our table. All stunned at the comment. Nine of the four of us will ever return, and encourage anyone to avoid the experience."}
{"text":"We went to Garde Manger for double birthday celebration and all the seven of us were quite happy with the experience. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and welcoming. The service was good and our needs were attended timely. We sat in the inner hall at a cosy big table under the menu. The same menu is written on the black board and it has only the appetizers and main courses, drinks and desserts are announced by your host and I really prefer to read the ingredients of what I'm consuming.

The lobster poutine is amazing and believe me there is enough lobster in it. I had tomato salad for appetizer, which was not less amazing as the tomatoes were sweet like they have grown under the southern sun or may be the chef had some secret seasoning for them. My main course was the most expensive dish in the house, lobster risotto, but wow, it was freakin good. As my friend wisely explained, when you pay for risotto you don't pay for ingredients, but for work and experience. I managed to dig in the duck with  mousse of foie gras dish and it was pretty good too. The sweet potato creme br√ªl√©e was interesting dessert to share, but next time we would rather try something else. 

All drinks we had were solid. The girls fell in love with the Bloody Caesars, they still talk about them more then a month later. I was a little bit disappointed as the Caesars didn't come with the famous snow crab leg in them, just a massive fresh celery and some beef jerky instead. Now I need to come back for more Bloody drinks with the famous legs, this time I really would like to sit at the raw bar and try some fresh seafood. Conclusion this is one more place rated solid five stars on my personal scale of six. I find it overall expensive, but absolutely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Certainly one of the hardest places I've ever tried to find (or get a reservation for), Le Garde Manger is high on my top Favorite restaurants EVER!

Chuck Hughes' (of Chuck's Day Off) restaurant hits on every gastronomic cylinder.  I have been twice and shared almost every dish we ordered, and I still haven't had something I didn't love.  

The prices are a bit high (I would be there every single day if they were $10-15 cheaper), but that just makes it more special when you can manage to go.  Getting a reservation can be tough, from the fact that the place is tiny, to their erratic phone answering.  

The food and atmosphere always lend themselves to a great night out, filled with conversation and laughter, which is what food should ALWAYS do."}
{"text":"We have rarely been so disappointed by a highly rated restaurant that had all the elements for success--warm ambience, local and interesting delights and not too noisy. As this was our 'special occasion' night out in our week in Montreal, we started out the evening with our 'go to' celebratory cocktail -- the Kir Royale to which our waiter replied, 'Would you like Prosecco or Champagne?' Our reply was simple, 'Champagne, please' as a Kir Royale, by definition, is made with Champagne and Creme de Cassis. We received our drinks and noted that the color was a bit pale but they tasted lovely. Upon further inquiry we learned that they don't stock Creme de Cassis; rather, they use a combination of Porto, Raspberry liqueur, and Pomegranate juice. We were rather put off that this combo was not disclosed (what if we had been allergic to one of those unexpected ingredients?) but we enjoyed the drinks and, in fact, ordered two more. In the end, we were quite shocked to see that four Kir Royales had cost $100!!! We've had these drinks all over the world, including Michelin-starred restaurants, and, frankly, we thought this charge was obscene. We politely mentioned this to the waiter and his response was, 'I offered you a choice between Prosecco and Champagne'; I guess we were meant to know that that was code for 'If you choose Champagne, it's really expensive.' Receiving such a reply prompted us to express our discontent to the manager who basically reiterated the same line. Good customer service requires acknowledging the feelings of the customers! To say we felt mislead and mistreated is an understatement; this encounter cast a shadow on the entire experience and exemplified how indirect communication doesn't serve anyone well. We should have been advised that the drinks were $25 each and then we could've made an informed choice. Additionally, the other food was either slightly above or slightly below average. We will never return to Garde Manger, nor will we recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"This place is quite popular. The only reservation time available was for 9:30pm. We came in an hour early to try our luck. No luck. I wasn't that crazy about the hostess lady. Being the first person you greet, she wasn't very friendly. On the other hand our waitress was super nice and very friendly. 
The food. We had an octopus dish. Superb! Best octopus I've had so far. On the other hand we tried the lobster poutine. Total fail. Small portion of lobster and the fries reminded me of McDonalds. So I found that dish to be a waste of calories and money. We also ordered the scallop dish. I liked it. Great fresh taste. I"}
{"text":"ambiance was excellent, except though I made a reservation a month ago, we were placed in a tucked away corner right under the a/c. after freezing a few minutes and playing musical chairs, we asked our friendly, but harried, pushy and many times absent waitress if it could be turned up. she never returned with that answer, and later stated \"well all the rest of us are hot.\" we arrived early for reservations, but were pretty much ignored until our reservation time. took 30 minutes to get wine, another 20 to get oysters. then our apps and mains came licketly split. they really wanted to turn our table way before our alloted time, despite the looong stretches of no service through out the meal. salmon pierogies were quite good, as was peach and speck salad. oysters were fine. scallops were excellent, hanger steak was great. wine selection by glass was okay but overpriced. the lobster poutine everyone raves about? we don't get it. we had poutine several times during our trip, but with this, the fries were overcooked and burned, the supposed \"lobster bisque gravy\" tasted no different that brown gravy and it had been sitting so long in the kitchen that the fries were a complete sog. As for cheese curds, I think we counted two. 

$250 dinner for 3 people. Can't recommend."}
{"text":"This venue can be summed up in one word: Pretentious!
Some of us who have been around for a while have seen this all before. A restaurant Chef rises to fame based on great food and a couple of TV stints. What follows is a restaurant that does not even bother to return calls for reservations, serves mediocre food and treats customers worse than at La Belle Province hot dog and poutine stand. Bottom line is that Chuck has sold out! \"The face of Hellman's Mayonnaise\" puhleeese...really Chuck?!

I went to the restaurant on three occasions, with and without reservations. Other than the DJ, the staff seem to think that it is a great privilege to be given the opportunity to dine at their establishment. I won't even get in to the food which was good but overpriced. The service and attitude just turned me off, with no desire to ever come back. 

Good luck Chuck, one day you will be waiting by the phone for customers to call. enjoy the ride while it lasts!

There are plenty of other deserving restaurants in Old Montreal, vote with your feet and wallets!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I come here, I honestly have to say that my experience got better the second time around! Service is exceptional! I came here with my love and we love our oysters. We got a dozen oysters. They easily slide out of the shell and directly in my mouth. Yummmm yummm just remembering it gives me the goosebumps .. I wished I had some right now!! Lol. I had a beautiful meal last time except for the octopus .. I have to say it was not their best meal! The cook was overcooked and it turned out super chewy. 
It was even very cold. Kind of surprised that it was overcooked at a top executive restaurant owned by the famous Chuck Hughes!! Hmmm bummer. Ok on the pro side Their Mushroom risotto was succulent warm and freshly prepared. I had to order a second order of that amazing risotto! 

Another thing I don't like is how their menu is written on their board. It's so small I can barely see what they have and theres absolutely no bright lights in the resto. It's kindove a drag having to figure out what the hell is on their menu. I admit its hard to get a hard copy of their menu because they change it daily but maybe they should change their board to a light board with markers instead of the dreadful chalk board. 

Service was splendid! We always get amazing service over here. I think the manager knows us very well and he always makes sure to get us the best available table and makes sure to get us the drinks we ask for. 

Overall, it's a very fancy gem in montreal and these minor d√©tails could be totally corrected if they pay attention to these comments hopefully! :p
I do recommend this place for their amazing service."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago visiting a supplier. No BS hands down the best restaurant I've ever visited. If you want authentic, passionate food, different tastes holy shit this is the place!"}
{"text":"Wow...Chuck knows his seafood!  It's not a cheap meal for sure ...but you get what you pay for.  This was very memorable...started with ahi tuna with fennel and tomatoes and had scallops with lentils, radicchio and crispy sweet potatoes for a main.  Both amazing and unlike most high end places...the flavours comes without high doses of oil and salt.  Definitely healthier than most restaurants you'll eat at.  Great service and great atmosphere!  The only reason I would say 4.5 stars is price...but again, it's worth it to spend to money for special occasions.  Chuck Hughes' rep is well earned!"}
{"text":"Having been a Chuck Hughes fan ever since his first season on The Food Network, I had the biggest expectations going in. Truthfully, those expectations were far surpassed. 
I got the chicken dish of the night and it was just pure heavenly bliss on a platter. 
The inside is very hip and fun. The real bonus of the night, was the super attractive staff......
For desert we had to get the deep fried mars bar, and I don't know the last time I had ever experienced such a perfect taste. A super simple concept, but oh my dear dear lord was it wonderful.
I just can't wait to go back...!"}
{"text":"What a place. The service is amazing. Food is the best. A must stop in Montreal. The food was the best I had in Montreal. The atmosphere is amazing"}
{"text":"You've heard the rumors, and they're all true.  It's near impossible to get a reservation here, and you have to be fairly violent to snag any of the first-come-first-served tables right when they open.  Your best bet is to abandon your family and come here alone to get one of the few spots at the bar.  Tell your family you're not feeling well, and that you're going to just get room service, and politely suggest they take their time eating at...wherever they're going to eat...and then sneak out and enjoy an experience you can never tell them about.

It was easier for me because I was traveling solo for work, which is another convenient way to get a spot.  The host was very nice, and the bartender was super friendly, not only providing fantastic service, but also adding the right amount of interaction without being too distant nor chatty.  He also provided some great wine recommendations and got all of us solo bar patrons to chat with one another.

I know what you're thinking.  Shut up, Mike, I'm hungry and all of this reading is costing me on the expensive Canadian data plan that I purchased at the airport.  Fine.

I had a pretty incredible plate of beef short ribs that were perfectly marinated and fall-off-the-bone tender.  But anything you get here will be prettttttty great.

Don't plan to go out after eating here.  Embrace the wonderful, wonderful food coma.

{"text":"Went with my boyfriend on his first trip to Montreal. Had the tasting menu, the chef selects dishes from the daily board and sends them out, along with their signature seafood platter. Was a really amazing and interesting way to experience the food. The portions were almost full size for each course, so we were stuffed silly by the end of the meal. Excellent experience and service."}
{"text":"A definite must for those in the area.  The service was good, drinks better, food incredible.
Had the 2 special cocktails for the night.  There was a sweet and refreshing pear and maple syrup cocktail w/ vodka as the base.  The other was basically a giant bloody mary garnished w/ beef jerky covered in horseradish sauce and pickles.  Not really a bloody mary fan, but the tomato juice wasn't overpowering and it wasn't too salty, so I didn't mind helping finish it off.  The beef jerky garnish didn't really do much for me, really salty, but I guess in a place like this, you can't just be serving up the standard bloody mary that the plebians drink.
Started off with the Octopus, fingerlings, creme fraiche and chorizo.  The octopus was prepared soft and tender, not the usually chewiness you associate with it.  The creme fraiche added the slightest hint of sweetness to the dish.  A few celery leaves balanced out the experience.
The main course was a seafood risotto and scallops w/ bacon, buttercup squash, and black truffle.
The shrimp was plump and tender, with the risotto being cooked al dente.  The fried calimari that topped it off was amazing.  So light and flavorful.
Scallops were cooked perfectly, which is a rarity.  You usually either get something that's cook too much or too little, which ends up being too chewy or raw and ruins the dish, but not here.
Capped off the night with a couple desserts, affogato w/ grand marnier and financier topped off w/ pistachio ice cream.  I'm not gonna even bother w/ a description, it was good.
Bottom line, you can't go wrong.  The food, drinks, service, ambiance, were al great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has no signage on the street. If you don't know where it is that's your problem. Forget about trying to get in if you don't have a reservation well in advance .... not even a single person to sit at the bar"}
{"text":"Heard amazing things about this place and it mostly lived up to the hype...
Atmosphere was rustic and romantic, a trend I see in many new NYC restaurants as well. Went with a group for a Bachelorette weekend and was able to secure a 930 reservation on a Saturday night, (apparently these are needed well in advance).

The menu changes daily and is located on two chalkboards throughout the restaurant (one in French/one in English), not the most convenient way to see the selection, especially depending where you are seated.

Everyone split the Lobster Poutine (which I am pretty sure is the one staple on the menu) but I wasn't too impressed, I just can't get into lobster with gravy though. I started with a tomato, cucumber and avocado puree salad topped with fried cheddar balls, which was an extremely odd pairing but sort of worked. The vinaigrette was good but too much dill was used as garnish or for flavor.
Entree was really really good, short ribs and green beans, mmmm. 

Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Three of us walked in without a reservation at 7:00 on a Friday night. They said we could have the best table in house if we had to returned by 9. Done. 

We sat right next to the open window on a beautiful night. It's a cozy spot -- full of Old Montreal character. Service was great. 

We had wine and long island iced teas. The seafood platter (yum), the lobster poutine (my compatriots loved, I thought was just okay) and the sardine salad (delicious). All in all a great night in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is quite good but this place is way too small. I've went there 5 times and always waited like at least 20 minutes at the door. Then you are stuck at your table barely able to move. Note that I am 6 feet 210lbs which is quite standard.

I'll always remember the barmaid forgetting to give me 10 bucks back on a 20 for a beer. Cheap trick to try to stole my money or an accident... I'll leaving the guess to you.

The chef is quite good and I can't complain about his work."}
{"text":"The Canadian Chardonnay was tasty and reasonably priced.  Our server took great care of us with a super friendly personality. 

Shared the raw beef appetizer special and the pan roasted salmon with roasted green beans. All tasted super!!!!!!

The restaurant is small with high energy and the noise level a bit high. 

The only glitch that evening was it appears the kitchen hood was not working properly so you left smelling a bit oily. 

I would return to Garde Manger again."}
{"text":"I used to love watching 'Chuck's Day Off' (I think that's what it was called) so when hotel concierge was able to get a last minute table on Saturday I jumped at the chance. 

Fun location in Old Montreal, nice size for an intimate, if somewhat loud, dinner. Service is very attentive and graceful - waiter knew all the dishes by memory, custom built a dish for a friend and took no notes for our order. Good wine selection but prices at the upper end $$$$ ( figure about $100/bottle)

Fish is the reason to go. Get the fish. Extensive 'raw' selection of oysters etc for apps. We all went with salads - beets, horseradish and ricotta for me. Very fresh, well seasoned and nicely pickled beets.

I had the scallops for dinner. Perfect hard sear on the scallops and perfectly done to 'medium rare'. Nicely accompanied with smoked tomato, lemon and a few other nice things.

Leave room for dessert - key lime pie in a jar is worth it as is the ice cream and profiteroles."}
{"text":"made a reservation 1 month in advance... i live in toronto and i know i was going to montreal so wanted to try it out. when we get there they tell us they can't accept minors (we had our baby daughter with us) because of their liquor license, but their other restaurant that also serves alcohol can likely take us. i dont know montreal law, i don't really care, but i think they should have it on their website so people r aware of this rule, so this pretty much killed the experience. The staff was nice but never gave a full explaination of this \"rule\"."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Garde Manger for dinner while we were visiting Montreal, and overall, we really enjoyed the food and service here.

We had heard about this restaurant through various food blogs, and understood that the chef is on TV. We were able to get a Saturday night reservation at the bar about five days beforehand. The restaurant itself is very small and you can see everyone from the bar. There was a very inviting and intimate feel to the place. 

The menu was very eclectic, with different spins on normal dishes. We opted for some Canadian oysters, which were delicious. However, one of them was just bad - happens to anyone and it's not a bad reflection on the kitchen - but then they brought us out more oysters and genuinely seemed to care whether our food was to our liking or not. I think that kind of attention to detail is what sets this restaurant apart from a lot of other ones.

We also opted for two appetizers, which were delicious, and for our entr√©e, we decided to split the most luxe option that they had - a Cornish hen stuffed with foie gras. It sounds decadent, and it was. There were lots of complex flavors with that dish, and I definitely liked the dish.

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal at Garde Manger. It was probably our favorite meal in Montreal, and that's saying something because there are a lot of great food options here."}
{"text":"Last year we went to Le Bremner, another Chuck Hughes restaurant in Montreal, and had a great experience. As a matter of fact I swore I saw Steven Spielberg there although my husband said I just needed my eyeglass prescription checked because there was no way he'd be eating dinner at like 6 PM wearing a pair of shorts. So needless to say I had high hopes for this place.

We were able to weasel a last minute early bird reservation at the bar. It was actually perfect, a spot in the back, quiet and intimate but seated at the bar you feel like you're in the middle of the action. They initially forgot to bring us bread, eventually I asked and boy am I glad I did. There were 3 different kinds of fresh bread that were each equally delicious and filling.

We fell prey to the tourist trap that is the lobster poutine. Sorry but honestly it's overrated. Fries lack another dimension of flavor, were soggy, the gravy watery and the lobster felt wasted on this dish. I'd skip it, they had many other delicious apps on the menu.

My main course was the red snapped served with green beans, mushrooms and lobster. I don't quite know how to describe it. It was crunchy, flavorful, light and delicious.

My husband got the short rib with aged cheddar grits and a parsley salad. The beef was heavenly, tender, and fell off the bone without a knife. The cheddar grits were the best I've ever had. His dish was the highlight of the meal.

Ambiance is trendy but not pretentious. Romantic and intimate. Waiters are friendly. Sure it's a little pricey but isn't that worth it if there's a small chance you might run into Steven Spielberg."}
{"text":"This place is all hype and no substance! The food plain sucks! I had the braised beef gnocchi, which was so potent and salty. We also shared the large lobster poutine (cause the small one comes with just a few chunks of lobster), so we decided to pay $29 for this appetizer. Basically soggy mcdonalds fries with salty lobster. Main dish was some kind of Veal special that was pushed so aggresively by the waitress that we just HAD to get it. It was 5 tiny thin slices of raw veal, with a fee stalks of greenery and some paste to hold it together. Whatever happened to COOKING the meat and serving a SIDE DISH! You know, potatoes?! Roasted vegetables?! Spinach?! Anyway, we are leaving hungry and pissed. Save your money and appetite and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This was easily one of the best meals I've had - the service was outstanding and the flavours and textures of everything were spot on. They were so accommodating of my need for gluten free. And I was certainly not limited on what I could eat. We sat at the bar and had reservations for 6:45. We arrived just before our reservation and were seated promptly. The service was excellent - food runners, bar tender, host. They have the restaurant run as an art. 

My husband and I shared 4 different dishes then ice cream for dessert. 

Endive salad with apples, pecans and blue cheese - light and tart. 
Smoked sturgeon cubes with creams fraise, chives  and caviar - wow wow wow. 

Salmon with Nordic shrimp, chorizo vinegrette and a cucumber, dill and red onion salad. The salmon was a pacific wild salmon, cooked perfectly. The heat of the chorizo complimented the tart acidity of the cucumber salad that complimented the richness of the salmon and shrimp. Taking a forkful of every element of the dish gave the perfectly balanced palate. 

Pork tenderloin with mushrooms, jus and a smoked cheese and jalape√±o grit. This dish was all rich but it worked. The smoky spicy flavour of the grits with the perfectly cooked pork had my husband declaring that this was his favourite meal and favourite restaurant. 

We finished it up with a scoop of the blueberry vanilla ice cream - made in house and an excellent palate cleanser and end to the dinner."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best dining experiences I ever had. What a fun, totally unpretentious place. The service was amazing, the food totally original and incredibly delicious... it was the kind of delicious that my wife and I took our first bite of our first dish at the same time and looked at each other wide eyed with disbelief and absolute pleasure. Without question, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. If you like fun and delicious things, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Ok yes expensive but work every penny. I haven't had a meal this good in a while. David out waiter was amazing, all his recommendations were excellent.  The bread is divine...like you want to eat it 24/7.  If you want to spent money and leave happy...make reservations. So worth it...the seafood...amazing"}
{"text":"A dining experience at its best.  Great decor, PLAYLIST OF MY LIFE and oh yeah, that food is pretty darn good too. ;)  Every app and entree was on the mark, and they were also serving up blueberry Long Island Iced Teas that night...magnifique!

I've read a few places that service is spotty--our waitress was amazing, and the bartender and DJ were very interactive and fun even when we were sitting at our table."}
{"text":"Razor Clams. So good. Cauliflower. Epic. We checked out 'beefier' places in Montreal but this absolutely stole the show during our food-and-drink-focused week in the city. The dishes were very flavorful but more importantly balanced and the wines had a good range of midst and pricey. The service was excellent and the service was genuine, the team was slick and a lot of fun. Ask the maitre'd for some \"Baby J's\" after dinner or maybe the upgraded, sophisticated version."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, drinks were great. Atmosphere was nice, and the bartender was a super."}
{"text":"Tried the scallops and the famous lobster poutine. The scallops was \"so so\" but my wife liked it. However I would definitely come back for the poutine. It's way better than any poutine at La Banquise. This guy takes poutine to another level!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Sat the back bar with Dave who was incredible. Food was out of this world. Oysters were over the top. Staff was so friendly and nice. Best restaurant in Montreal"}
{"text":"Went about two weeks ago with the boyfriend and everything was great!

For the appetizer I had the duck confit with foie gras served on a waffle with a sweet buttery sauce and it was absolutely delicious. The duck was crispy and the waffle was fluffy and the foie gras seared to perfection. As a main I got the short rib with gouda mashed potatoes and it was also delicious. The meat was very tender and you can tell it was cooked with love.
My boyfriend had the beef tartare, which was to die for and the flavors were perfect. A little spicy, creamy and served with toast and house marinated pickles. I couldnt help myself and stole a few bites. His main dish was the pork cheek with clams, also great. It was a little spicy for his taste but if you like it hot, its fine. 

All the dishes were well balanced and the flavors mixed together perfectly.

For desert I had the peanut butter cream puffs which were AMAZING. So soft and moist, they were the best cream puffs I ever had in my life.

Wine was great and they have a huge list, and our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. She answered easily to all our questions and offered a great service.

Only negative, we ate way too much!

Will definitely be going back soon, Chuck definitely lives up to his name!"}
{"text":"lobster poutine + foie gras (traditionally seared) + great ambiance = 4 stars.  Would most definitely return."}
{"text":"Some of the best oysters I've had in the East Coast. There's technically no \"menu\" here besides a board on the wall with their seasonal dishes written down but they are known for their build your own seafood platters - ask the servers for more info! Would highly recommend the build your own seafood platter"}
{"text":"We got lucky.... 
This was a last minutes trip but we were trying to book about 2 weeks ago.  They were fully book but we went to try again since plan changed. Lastly we got to a last minutes cancallation at the bar for just an hour.  We ordered some seafood (oysters, scallops and razor clams) and a mushroom toast as
 appetizer.   Season selection as great and the best it the freshly graded horseradish was amazing.  The 2 hot sauce that they paired was a hiden gem.  Specially the one called the holy hot sauce; it was chunk's own sauce.   It was well balance with jalapeno and the acidity.  I bought one home and my parent said it goes with meat better than seafood. We got 2 main course: pork loin with mushroom and salmon with squash.  
The loin is one of the best I have ever had.  Soft in the middle paired with buttery oyster mushroom.  The salmon is great but we find the it is a bit too sweet for us.  
An advice is to order a bit more than your regular order.  Their portion is a bit small."}
{"text":"I have saved my 700th review especially for Chuck. 

Last weekend in Montreal I had the pleasure of finally dining at Garde Manger. We had booked a 7pm reservation on Saturday night (booked 1 month in advance to the day, just to be sure)

I want to say everything about the evening was absolutely perfect. The restaurant is small, maybe 15-20 tables in total, with a small bar at the front and an open kitchen at the back. Exposed brick walls, dark interior, incredible large kitschy chandelier type light fixture above the bar. Music was just the kind you expect after watching an episode of Chuck's Day Off - we heard Sublime, Guns N Roses and even the Hockey Night in Canada theme song.

The waiter (gorgeous, of course) was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. 

The food was as amazing as expected. We had two appetizers - a peach salad of some kind with charcuterie, nuts and some type of gorgonzola, and a toast of some sort with chanterelles and cheese on top. Both were excellent.

The mains was where we went astray. We made the mistake of choosing 2 seafood dishes - a scallops dish and an octopus dish. Both were genuinely amazing, but the price point was absolutely ridiculous. Sorry Chuck. $37 for 3 scallops and $35 for about 100 gram piece of octopus, I was really just expecting more. Even the appetizers (priced at $12-$14) were larger portions. Folks sitting nearby did order the short ribs and the portion was much more reasonable all things considered. 

We shared a peach parfait to end the evening, which again was delicious.

The total bill came to $230 with tax and tip. That included the cheapest bottle of red they had ($45?), two mains, two appetizers and 1 dessert. 

Overall an incredible dining experience with perfect food, just marred slightly for me by the portion sizes of the spendy main dishes. 

I think Chuck owes me some more seafood, to be honest."}

{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I've had ever , service was excellent or better !!!  Atmosphere awesome food amazing on point we started with a seafood platter all awesome then we had had some apps.  Lobster poutine, ect all we're crazy good & we split up dinner so I never thought a pork chop could be that good but dam. It was.  Rossito was awesome sauce    & all our cocktails were great too.  So yeah if you go to Montreal yeah go here make a reservation & go !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here based on VERY STRONG recs and it did not disappoint! We didn't have reservations, but came right when they opened. Luckily, they let us have a table for 1.5 hrs since there was a reservation coming in then. 

We started with the lobster poutine - the sauce was delicious and there was SO MUCH lobster on that dish! More than I expected! We also had the braised short rib which was SO TENDER and FLAVORFUL! It was such a filling dish and the sides were also surprisingly tasty. 

Halfway thru our meal I saw another table order a seafood app and wanted some oysters. So, we ordered some of that too! The oysters were fresh and nicely shucked... delicious! 

I also saw someone order a bloody mary with the large crab leg. Looks interesting... but not something I'm into.

Since it's a pretty intimate place we started chatting with a couple from the table next to ours and found that they were from NY! It was a nice that we enjoyed our meal AND made new friends! It was a great experience and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hard to get reservation but worth it. A very nice pricy place. I ordered the veal cheek risotto dish and my brother ordered the monk fish a much to try very tasty meals."}
{"text":"My wife and I got lucky during a short visit and did snag two seats at the bar and it was wonderful.  Julie the bar tender was a great hostess/server, starting us off with her own creation, the honey lavender martini, AVIATOR.  Delicious...careful though, they'll sneak up on you.  The ambiance is just what we like; smallish , unique ... No corporate model here!  Great music keeping you company without requiring you yell to be heard, and last but not least, absolutely incredible food.  We shared the duck confit with foie gras on a buckwheat waffle as a starter, delicious.    I chose the risotto with veal cheeks, WOW!  Best risotto I've ever had.  My wife got the foie gras stuffed guinea hen and roasted vegetables, and it was moist and just as delicious.  A nice, moderately bottle of Cote de Rhone to help it along Perfect meal in a truly wonderful setting.  Warning: guinea hen is for TWO...pay attention when ordering.  Other than a desire for slightly lower prices, I don't have any negatives for this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"As we arrived the friendly hosted greeted and seated us at our table which was in a nice corner with bench type seating. The lighting was kind of dim which i liked and the stone walls gives it that good old montreal feel. We started out with 12 juicy oysters accompanied by lovely mignonette sauce. I love oysters! and for the main i had steak something, lol, i don't remember the name unfortunately but i posted a picture of it. When my steak first arrived i was very skeptical about because it was basically covered in celery and I'm not a huge fan of cooked celery. But whatever they did to that celery made it taste amazing. The whole dish down to the cauliflower was so tasty and flavourful. For desert i ate a caramel cheesecake. it was good, the caramel was a bit overpowering though because the layer was too thick and since it was a no bake cheesecake I'm guessing, it didn't have that classic cheesecake texture. 
Over all i really enjoyed this place, kind of reminded me of \"Joe Beef\" with the whole chalk board ordeal. I will definitely go again soon! See my pictures!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite restaurant during a recent visit to Montreal.  Yes, we had the lobster poutine, and it was wonderful.  The service was great and the restaurant had a fun, lively vibe. Reservations are essential, so the restaurant was packed, and it is expensive (hence the four, rather than five, stars).  I'd certainly make this a \"must\" for my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed ourselves mostly because we we pretty hammered when we showed up but also because we found seats at the back bar and they were playing Marvin Gaye loudly. Drank a big bottle of wine and had the Lobster Poutine appetizer. I had short ribs and my wife had lobster risotto. For dessert we shared the Bounty bar which included, among several other things, Bone Marrow Caramel. Let me say that again, Bone Marrow Caramel. For a man with the palette of your average sheltered 6 year old, this was quite a moment.  All in all, cool spot, pretty good food and pricey. Special occasion stuff imho."}
{"text":"After many, many hours spent watching \"Chuck's Day Off,\" my husband and I made the trip to Montreal to eat at Garde-Manger on our anniversary.  And the place is every bit as loveable as it is on TV.

It's not as loud as some other reviewers claim.  If you're looking for a quiet, white tablecloth atmosphere, this is not the place for you.  But if you want food worthy of that same environment but with much larger portions in a more comfortable, friendly, fun, young atmosphere, then call to make a reservation...like right now.  

The servers are super sweet and knowledgable.  The music is louder than your string quartet, but is refreshing amidst a plethora of fine dining establishments.  And the food is UNREAL.  Not surprisingly, bacon made an appearance in the complimentary bread laced with cheese.  But we had to save room for: the tomato salad with salty cheddar nuggets, spicy jerk crab leg appetizer, grouper with spanish rice and peel and eat shrimp (with onion ring garnish) and braised short ribs with goat cheese smashed potatoes.  We were ridiculously, uncomfortably full.  But we enthusiastically ate every morsel.  It was hearty.  It was amazing.  It lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant after hearing so many great things... And we loved it. Good quality food and great service.

We had a salad, jerk crab and veal cheek on waffle. All were outstanding, especially the veal!

Then we had their famous lobster poutine. It's good but nothing compared to the previous dishes. 

The desserts were not great. We had a maple dessert and one that consist of a chocolate bar. Both fell flat... Too dense, too sweet. Not something I would expect in a place like this. 

All in all, can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Took my parents and sisters here for dinner. We started with the jerk crab and octopus; had the pork chops, scallops, duck and bouillabaisse for our mains. Apple tart and peanut butter profiteroles for dessert. Service was excellent and food was good but not amazing. Found it to be a little overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy the food or the service.  We ordered the gnocchi appetizer which was so salty it was almost inedible. My main course was fish which was completely bland with no seasoning and served in a bowl of butter which made it soggy.  My boyfriend ordered steak which was served cold. The maple syrup dessert was overbearingly sweet.  The service was terrible.  Our waiter seldom came around. When we would try to call him over he instead just would look at us and stand around doing nothing. One star for the food and zero stars for the service. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in the World. My husband and I have dined at iconic and well known establishments around the world, and this is by far the best restaurant we've been to. We were there on Wednesday, March, 14th, and David took care of us. We had the chef's menu and we were surprised and delighted with every dish that came out. My husband doesn't like certain sea foods but that night he tried it and loved it-- This was all due to the freshness and preparation of the food. The oysters were sweet and delicate. There was not even a hint of any fishy-ness in any of the sea food and fish we had. We loved the variety in the seafood platter. Everything we had was absolutely delicious and layered with different flavours, and nice lingering tastes. The texture of the BC Tuna was so tender, it melted in your mouth. The beef carpaccio had different bursts of flavour and textures and mini potato chips on top which gave it a little salty crunch. We had the salad that had an amazing crispness and thickness; it was both satisfying and refreshing and somehow the Gorgonzola in it was buttery, and not at all overpowering. We also had the juicy pork shank, and even the carrots were nicely seasoned. Each component of each dish was flavourful. The staff was great. We liked the atmosphere; it was very cozy with the fireplaces and lighting.  It was a good loud, with people talking and laughing, which made it feel even cozier because everyone was enjoying drinking and eating so much, that they were oblivious to the fact that it was a cold and snowy work-night. David asked us if we're celebrating anything and we then came out with peanut butter profiteroles and the fireworks for my husband's birthday. Before we left someone came by and asked how everything was, and we held our full bellies and said \"Excellent\" and  \"Perfect\". We were also pleasantly surprised with the bill.  We thought the bill would be around $500, and it only turned out to be $230 for copious amounts of delectable food. We are planning a trip to Montreal this summer just to return to Garde Manger.  We've been telling our friends about it and we already have two other couples planning a trip to Montreal just to go to Garde Manger."}
{"text":"Small menu with a good variety.  Not too heavy and surprisingly delicate presentation.  We had the Octopus and Jerusalem artichoke appetizers, both went over very well.  Scallops and Shorts ribs as mains, again very popular.  The house smores had great flavour but the sticky factor of the marshmellows was off the charts and made the dessert very difficult to eat!"}
{"text":"First place I went to when visiting Montreal. Had a 9pm reservation and they accompanied us despite being 15 minutes late. Everything on the menu (which is on a chalkboard) looked great. Ordered scallops and was a bit disappointed as it came with only 3 measly pieces and a tiny slice of pork belly. I was expecting more for the price paid. My other friends ordered the pork tenderloin and the risotto and it looked very filling and appetizing. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"It seems like everyone that adores Garde-Manger is a tourist. We came here for dinner and even though we had a reservation, we were seated in the worst spot possible: in front of a huge pole so that the server could barely see us or our usually empty glasses. 

The lobster poutine had maybe 4 little pieces of lobster, pretty sure that it wasn't quite how Chuck made it on the Iron Chef ;) The seafood platter was nothing to write home about: the oysters were 'meh', the shrimp was equally 'meh' but the crab was pretty decent. Our main dishes were equally forgettable: my scallops tasted like half a salt shaker was emptied into the sauce. Also, because of said pole in front of us, the server miscalculated refilling my dates glass and spilled a fairly large amount of expensive red wine all over him; that was a nice touch (didn't even get a free dessert out of that catastrophe).

I do however quite like the atmosphere, the kick ass chandelier, stone walls, central location and the variety of music though, so see, it's not all negative."}
{"text":"My daughter absolutely loves Chucks place. She took me to a surprise dinner there. I am allergic to cheese so I ordered the flank steak and fries figuring it was the safest choice. Unfortunately my flank steak was tough and I could not cut it. The waitress suggested turning the steak which of course I had tried.  The top of the steak was charred while the bottom was barely colored. The fries were soggy lukewarm and really not what i expected. My daughter and her new boss were my table companions and I Imcertainly did not want to make a fuss. They had consumed their meal and I declined returning my steak for another as they were almost finished when the waitress noted my struggle. All in all a huge disappointment and embarrassment to my daughter.  I felt awful as she had stressed to her boss how fabulous the fare was. Sorry Chuck..... If flank steak is on the menu perhaps slicing it in the kitchen would help. I was terribly disappointed and embarrassed."}
{"text":"Probably should have ordered more seafood but we ended up with more of the other dishes.

The beef tartare and ricotta were my favorites that we had. Did not like the chestnut tortelloni and pork tenderloin. The scallops and the mushroom toast were just ok.

A cozy, dark restaurant with the menu on one chalkboard. Our server was very helpful and attentive."}
{"text":"searching for a decent place to have a late night feast on our first night in montreal, i was thrilled to be able to secure a reservation at garde manger. though the place is a bit of a scene (we sat next to zack braff, fo realz), it doesn't feel that much like a scene. everyone we met in the restaurant was excited to give a little bit of ordering advice, and generally seemed to enjoy themselves. a few singalongs to a cool soundtrack took place almost immediately on our arrival.
so, to order? get a bloody mary for christ sake. crab leg in a drink = order it. a nice bottle of wine, (by the way, we greatly appreciated that the wait staff did not up sell us as well expected), and a whole bunch of dishes will make for a memorable meal. we decided after seeing the small seafood platter, that we had to go for the large seafood platter. and it was large. arriving in an antique bird feeder, an array of wonderful scallops, village bay (new brunswick) oysters, king crab legs, and shrimp cocktail was consumed in minutes by our hungry 3-person party. the mignonette and cocktail sauce with grated horseradish was delicious, though these items were flavorful and fresh enough to eat without any adornments. just a great dish to share with three or more people.
greedy as we are, we also ordered the poutine homard (wonderful), the beef tartar (best tartar i've had in a long time), and the jerk crab (after having the king crab legs in the seafood platter, we had to go back for more, and it was totally worth it). i'm glad we went back to experience more, although i think that the wait staff felt we were overdoing it a bit. no apologies, guys. it was all delicious.
i'd go back to garde manger in a heartbeat. hearing that this place is featured on canadian food network, i hope that they do not fall by the sloppiness wayside. stick to your guns, order the seafood, guaranteed fresh, and enjoy a few drinks. this is a truly inviting, warm dining atmosphere where you will have a great night out. nice, bumping restaurant."}
{"text":"The Lobster Poutine was pretty good. The fries were very fresh and the gravy light tasting. Definitely worth the try. The Rock Shrimp Risotto was very tasty....finished with lemon zest. Enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The food was spot on. Had the seafood tower and me and my guest shared the lobster poutine and the steak.  The staff showed attention to detail and the food was great. A little but pricey but every know and then you have treat yourself."}
{"text":"Fantastic high quality dinner - was very excited about going here (after following Chuck Hughes on his TV shows and being a fan) and it did not disappoint!  Great atmosphere, fun staff that gave wonderful service - but most importantly the food was delicious, beautifully prepared & presented.  Best steak I've had in quite awhile - in a red wine sauce & perfectly cooked.  A restaurant not to miss if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars, I would. BEST RESTAURANT IN MONTREAL. And we have had some excellent food in this city. The food was beyond words exceptional quality and we had food restrictions they had to work around, too (husband is allergic to shellfish and I'm pregnant, so can't eat anything raw). We sat at the bar and had Sam as our bartender. We pretty much let him direct our choices, which was the best decision ever. The music was fantastic and everyone was incredibly friendly. The menu changes daily, based on what's fresh, and they have some choices not listed on the menu boards. We can't wait to come back to Montreal and come back here!"}

Nous sommes pass√© de surprise en surprise. Excellent !  Puisque le menu change en fonction des arrivages, vous en sortirez gagnant.

Les huitres fra√Æches (3 vari√©t√©s).  Super.

La joue de veau et le foie gras sur gauffre.  D√©finitivement un classique.

La poutine au homard.  Fallait l'essayer...

Le flanc de porc, la queue de boeuf, les desserts... Tout √©tait bon.

J'y retournerai.  Mais pas facile d'avoir une place."}
{"text":"Went there for a drink after a night out at a restaurant with a group of friends ...i loved the vibe that this place has..its a bit loud but totally understandable for a popular spot as this one
I liked the open kitchen and the friendly staff.!!
Am definitely going back for a meal and drinks .!!!"}
{"text":"Grand selection de vins ( √† partir de 50$-1900$!!!) choix de fruits de mer et de viandes bien accompagn√© mais le rapport qualit√©/prix ... n'est pas le point fort quand √† moi... la poutine homard .. ordinaire au prix de 36$.. la deco de caverne donne du cachet et le service est exellent."}
{"text":"Like most of my group, we went with high expectations based on the fact that is Chef Hughes restaurant and he's an Amazing Canadian talent!   This place is hidden away, no signs, so stay sharp and aware when finding it.  We made reservations as we know this place can get busy.  We were greeted promptly, seated and started our first round of drinks.  Our waiter in the beginning of the night was attentive (great wine recommendations) but unfortunately that service didn't continue.  We did the chefs tasting menu in order to try as many cool dishes as we could along with recommended wine pairing.  The waiter recommended a white with my appetizer that went so nicely.  We had a variety of raw fish such as scallops attached to the shell (pretty cool) oysters, and other varieties.  The BEST appetizer which alone would be a 5* was the beef carpaccio.  A MUST order item as so fresh and delicious!  The scallops were like butter, really enjoyed them!  We also were served a braised pork but unfortunately it was full of fat so only 2 people in our 4 person group could taste it.  During the course of dinner, our waiter was missing in action, serving tables around us and while we were attempting to get his attention we really didn't exist and it was surprising as it wasn't a crazy busy night.  I would have drank a lot more wine (only had 2 glasses) as no one was there to take our order.  The guys in our table had to order from the bar as we were very neglected.  All in all I'm happy we did it however was disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what it is. Short ribs were just ok, not tender enough.  I make much better ones a home. Scallops, not great. Not a fan of raw cauliflower. Good service, good ambiance, too bad the food is not outstanding. We will come back for the poutine only."}
{"text":"First, we love Chuck Hughes. We really wanted to love Garde Manger & did...to a certain extent. You do have to book your reservations 30 days ahead of time.  I left a lengthy email explaining that I was four months pregnant & this would be our last vacation for awhile. The Reservationist, was very helpful & got us a rez. As you read on, keep in mind that I am preggo, in our early 40s. I can not drink & my husband is nice enough to give up his wine. 

When we arrived there were several people smoking it up outside. I am an ex-smoker and I am the a-hole ex-smoker because I quit with such conviction that I do not crave a cigarette ever thereby I LOATHE the smell of it. But since this is \"Canadia\" I moved past that. When we walked inside, there was no hostess. We waited a few minutes until a really nice waiter came by and checked out our rezzz. He stated it would be 15 minutes which was fine since we were 10 minutes early. HOWEVER, two minutes, if that, after we arrived, another couple showed up, and got seated right away in the back section, behind the kitchen?!! As the night progressed we came to the conclusion that the \"back section\" is for friends/family/big spenders and it was rather disheartening. It became apparent there was a class divide. While we were waiting to be seated, the smokers from outside the restaurant began to trickle back in & they were pushy and shoved me and my husband out of the way as they made their way to the \"back\" section. If you get special privileges/seating/whatever I do not care, I was that age once BUT do not shove people around like jerks. I live in New York City being shoved and bumped is part of the reality so when I say we got shoved and pushed I mean it was excessive. The saving graces were: 
A.) The Bartender: I asked for no alcoholic drinks and she said they have the Virgin Caesar (type of Bloody Mary). I was not sure what that was since the music was a little loud and I could not hear her description so I asked for water. She actually came around brought us glasses and a water pitcher and put it by us. She went out of her way to get to us. 
B.) Our Waitress: I only kept the CC receipt and it does not have her name. She was working on 9/8 in the front dining room. I really wish I remembered her name. She is/was a GREAT waitress. She spoke English very well, she knew the menu extensively and answered all of our questions with patience and great detail.  
C.) The decor is awesome with this beautiful, gigantic chandelier in the middle of the dining room. It was like a chic winter sporting lodge. The music, a bit loud, was very good and I loved every song they played. It  was all over the board from classic rock to alternative and a little 80s and Bon Jovi in there. 

After we ordered, there were some back-and-forth patrons that were seated behind us. They had their drinks, would go outside and have their smoke and come back in. Unfortunately, there were two guys that decided to stand right behind me, were yacking it up like high school girlfriends & elbowed me so hard in the back of the head there was a bump the next day. He slurrly apologized...whatever accidents happen and it's date night with my hubby. 

We ordered a few staples that were recommend on Yelp such as the Lobster Poutine, Jerk Crab Legs (both apps) and the Short Ribs (entree) and we asked our waitress for a suggestion for the second entree which she recommended the Scallops. We ordered the Clam Caesar; I got the Virgin and my husband got the normal one. I highly recommend this drink. It was really good and not salty; a perfectly balanced drink (virgin or diesel). While we waited they brought us a bread basket with cheddar butter...OMG it was sooooo good. My husband is not a big cheese fan but he loved it (there were a few pockets of salt). So far so good, our drinks were good, bread basket was good and we thought we were in for a good meal and good night. 

On to the apps: the \"Lobster\" Poutine......a.) where was the lobster? b.) first time trying Poutine, and thought we would \"do it right\" and we were totally disappointed. The fries were soggy, the gravy was...well it had not flavor, and there were only two little pieces of lobster in a very small bowl of soggy fries, bland gravy, tiny cheese curds and even tinier lobster pieces. 

Jerk Crab Legs, they were a lot of work BUT worth it. The Jerk Sauce seasoning was amazing; spicy and warm. Great to dip bread in. The short ribs, were cooked perfectly but ruined them by drowning in sauce. The Scallops were perfect BUT we got about 1/4 cup of the pureed potatoes and three scallops for $37!!! WTF?! Saving Grace....the Black Forest Cake...yummy. 

I see the draw to this place. It's trendy and chic and for a certain clientele. If this was a year ago, we still smoked,  & had a few bottles of wine in us, the food and other things would have been perfect. But if you are not drinking & not into the scene this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Garde Manger is one of the most talked about restaurants in Montreal, and with lots of hype comes high expectations. Service and atmosphere were very good. The restaurant is very cozy, tucked away just off St Paul. 

I split the famous lobster poutine with my friend as an appetizer and had the beef short rib for my main, as recommended by a friend. The food was very good but it was not out of this world considering all the hype. I would definitely return to this fun venue in future."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening...from the food...to the ambience...to the service it hit everything we could have wanted. Our waiter made wonderful suggestions throughout our meal...drinks...cocktails....food.courses...we love Montreal and we are big fans of Mr. Chuck Hughes. This was as good if not better than Le Bremner....it is not inexpensive but worth every penny. 

Side bar: The famous lobster poutine has been discontinued."}
