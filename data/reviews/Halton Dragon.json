{"text":"We got digestive issues from eating here. They have a sign on the cash register NO REFUNDS, obviously people have told them their food sucks."}
{"text":"Best delivery/takeout chinese food I've had in Oakville.  Normally I find chinese food to be a little heavy and oily but Halton Dragon tastes light and fresh.  Even on a busy New Year's Eve they were prompt and the food was fresh and hot.  Really like their sweet and sour chicken.  Like chicken balls without the oily mass of dough.  Will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"Got take-out from here last night. The food tastes similar to other places. I didn't enjoy the food because it was too oily and didn't have much flavour. Had the sweet and sour shrimp (dry and deep fried), beef and mushroom and a rice/noodle pair.  Total came to $45. The food is filling, but left me bloated and sick. Had leftovers despite having four eat."}
{"text":"It's passable Chinese food... not authentic though. We enjoy the chicken balls, the chicken low mein, and usually one other dish with meat and rice."}
{"text":"Your food normally is great except tonight, there was a STAPLE in our chicken fried rice!!!! And stomach was upset after the Shanghai noodles. Very unsatisfied with the amount of money I spent to feel Ill and find an unwanted staple in my food. I hope someone get back to me about this issue."}
{"text":"This place is alright if you want Canadian Chinese food. Quick take out food and cheap lunches are hard to beat in Oakville. If you're looking to dine in, the place is small and seats up to 12 people so you'll need to go during non lunch hours. Overall, not a bad place to eat lunch but definitely not my first choice."}
