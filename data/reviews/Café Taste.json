{"text":"I've been back here more times than I can count lately (my inability to add might have something to do with the wine) and I don't know why I didn't give it five stars before.

Just go. That's all the review you need read really. If you like wine you will love this place. The food is excellent and I have never had poor service in the eleventy-four times I've been. In fact this evening turned into a private tasting because I would rather take the owners recommendations than randomly try new things here and hope they match up. Jeremy was super attentive and did a great job of making me feel welcome.

Go now."}
{"text":"i think the cafe puts the emphasis on the wrong things. the decor is cozy and the food was not bad, but the wait staff were forgetful (my toast arrived after i had finished my brunch), neglectful (he took my knife, said he'd bring another, then didn't), and careless (we had to ask for napkins, as did the table next to us).

this, coming from a place that touts their fine wine and local cheeses, grates freshly ground rock salt at the table, and seems to cook from very fresh ingredients.

not worth it, imo."}
{"text":"This had really great possibilities, but it wasn't as awesome as it could have been. It was good, for sure, but lacked a certain awesomeness. 

Called on Monday to make reservations for Tuesday. They never called me back. I called again on Tuesday and made the reservation, but when we arrived on Tuesday I was told that they only prepare food based on reservations, and since I had only booked that day there was very little food. I found that unimpressive since I had in fact tried to make a reservation in advance. When I explained this, I was told that since they are closing shortly they have stopped being good about checking their messages. Poor showing.

On the plus side, I had a fantastic French malbec. Really nice. We ordered a large charcuterie platter, an olive and bread platter, a large AND small cheese platter (I don't let being lactose intolerant stop me from having my cheese!), a baked Brie and the stuffed mushrooms. The quality of f the food was really high, but the portions were pretty small. Delicious though. A little disappointed that our charcuterie platter had two  prosciutto on it. I LOVE prosciutto, but I expect a little more variety in a plate.

The desserts were ok. Not spectacular. Cheese and wine is clearly the star here, which is fine as it is a wine and cheese bar!

Our server clearly knew his stuff, and he gave us delicious eats. I guess it's just bad luck going a week before they close down, when things were starting to run out."}
{"text":"If owner Jeremy Day likes you, you might enjoy Cafe Taste. If he doesn't, you are in for disappointment -- despite tasty wine and cheese. In hindsight it was a mistake to show up knowing which bottle of wine I wanted to order (the Rosehall Run Pinot Noir 2008, which was very nice) for a birthday dinner with family. You should probably ingratiate yourself by seeking Jeremy's counsel before ordering anything in his establishment. When I presented him with a TeamBuy voucher for a deluxe cheese plate (a $40 item on the menu supposedly serving 4-6 people), a plate comprising a few small portions of cheese was quickly plunked down before my party of five. He forgot to bring a knife, there were no plates or utensils on the table, and he didn't ask us if we wanted to order any bread, which didn't come with the cheese. There were only two other people in the restaurant so the sloppy service was baffling. When we asked him to tell us about the cheeses, he reeled off a few names then disappeared into the kitchen. By the time he brought out the bread, we were nearly finished the cheese. Sure these were nice, artisinal cheeses but it was hardly a $40 value. The TeamBuy voucher also included two 2oz tasting glasses of wine, which were plunked down before me without explanation -- I had to again wave him over to ask what types of wine these were. (One glass was pinot noir -- because it's not like I was already drinking a whole bottle of pinot noir... oh wait... -- and one was baco noir. He offered no information beyond this.) In addition to the $55 bottle of wine, we also ordered a cheese fondue for five people (the fondue pot was maybe 1/4 full and bread was scarce, providing at best a snack, not a meal as the price would suggest), two duck confits, and coffees, so it's not like we cheaped out on dinner. And we were polite diners. Nevertheless Jeremy's attitude was strange and off-putting, his service was careless, and frankly his entire demeanor smacked of contempt. His food is overpriced because portions are so small. Sorry folks... I wanted to love Cafe Taste but this was hardly the unpretentious, educational experience he advertises."}
{"text":"This small little place in Parkdale is perfect for an after dinner nibble and dessert or drinks but not so much for a dinner. 

We came here tonight as most others today, with a Teambuy that was about to expire. 

The place is small. They had put all of us in the romantic cozy covered patio I'm the back. A very nice atmosphere. 

Our server switched between a guy who showed off his knife bottle opening skills to other party, and a girl who walked cheerfully with a hop and a skip everywhere. 

It had stated that we were entitled to a Deluxe Cheese platter ($40 on the menu) and two 2oz wines ($10). On the phone they said that this would be a lot o cheese and to bring more people to the party. However, as Giselle D had warned me, their experience warranted a much smaller portion for 4 people. So it was just the two of us. 

He said the same thing when we were seated and I had asked him if we can combo some charcuterie with the cheese portions instead. He said we had $40 to play with for food and walked away. 

So here we are trying to pick our meal. Nothing on the menu seemed substantial enough to warrant a meal. Salad, two trout cakes, grilled cheese sandwich. So when we came up with our combo and told him, he said \"our chef is swamped with everyone and their teambuys, you can order this but you'll have to wait 45 mins\"

I appreciated him letting me know but also curious how busy could come be with all the cheese plates (and us being one of the last). 

Our food did come in a large portion and extra bread and accoutrements were $1 extra. For us we paid $5 for extra bread. See photo. And we were stuffed. But this not very healthy, oh well. The bison was tasty. 

Our bill came to $65 with extra bread and $10 wine. It's quite steep but say for 4 ppl, quit affordable. 

The difference between here and say, Caren's is that, they also have items on their menu that would be considered \"meal\" or heavier appetisers. I think this is what's missing here.   

I also wondered why they put everyone at the back leaving the front empty completely. Walking from the outside I wouldn't want to step in here but the patio was full! Maybe they had so Manu reservations tonight they didn't want any more. 

Free park for one hour or after 6 on Gwynne south of queen."}
{"text":"Cafe Taste is closing on Oct. 15. The closing party on Oct 14-15 should be epic."}
{"text":"Jeremy has fantastic taste in wines. You can order anything off the menu and be impressed. The selection of VQA is impressive and unique. The service is excellent and informed - he really knows his stuff and is great at recommendations, just tell him what you like.

The taste in music, however, is what loses a star. Very awkward, confusing choices. It really affects the vibe."}
{"text":"Great place to relax, indulge yourself with wines, beers,  and cheese.  The owner puts together really interesting taste combinations that awaken your palate.  I love their deluxe cheese tray.  The cafe offers local foods and has a strong environmental mandate which meshes well with my beliefs.  Service was wonderful as well.  I felt well taken care of :)

I highly recommend this place to any lover of cheese, wine, or beer."}
{"text":"I don't know why I'm the only one rating this place five stars! This place is not only adorable and delicious, but offers an experience that you'd be hard to come across for such a reasonable price in Toronto. 

To be clear, this is a WINE and CHEESE bar. Meaning that the majority (or all) of its menu is based around the different types of cheese mixed with the different sensations of various wines. DO NOT come here expecting a diverse menu of vegetables or meats, Cafe Taste is a restaurant that focuses on cheese and wine. 

Having said that, everything that we ordered was divine. The owner was our server for the evening, and he proved not only to be very informative about Canadian wines and cheeses, but he was also more than happy to comply to my mothers detailed requests for the recipes to certain dishes and the whereabouts of other local restaurants that serve Canadian lobster.

If you do go, I recommend that you try the 'wine flight' either red or white. The server will bring you three different kinds of Canadian wine without telling you what is what, and it is for your own experiential pleasure that you (and your partner) get to taste each wine with each mouthful and observe the difference in sensations you have. 

Being a novelty seeker myself, I absolutely adored the adventurous nature of this restaurant and would've been swept off my feet had a first or second date brought me here. It's a whole different way to eating that is highly prevalent in Europe. Focusing on the flavors and textures of foods rather than the food just being labeled 'nourishment' or giving you something to put in your mouth instead of talking. 

Everything was homegrown in Canada, so all you organic-lovers, you should most definitely check this place out. 

The decor was wonderful, very dim (romantic) with crickety wooden floors and mismatched tables and seating. They also have couches for the couples that plan on having more than one bottle of wine and extra dessert, wink wink, nudge nudge. 

Highly recommend for a taste bud explosion and an exciting, different night out!"}
