{"text":"Live jazz, great atmosphere and decor, servers and staff were cheery, fast service, and most importantly: delicious food!  We started off with the shrimp ceviche and avocado appetizer, and everything tasted supremely fresh (served chopped together in two avocado halves). The classic chicken and waffle dinner was divine: the chicken was juicy, the waffle fluffy, the gravy rich, and the jalapeño flavors in the coleslaw and cornbread had a great kick to them. We also tried the taco trio, which was very flavorful with catfish fried just-right and their robustly spicy sweet salsa (but the portions were maybe on the small side for the price, while you get quite a lot of food with the chicken and waffles).   A bonus: Our server was quite careful about allergies. A member of our party has a serious nut allergy, and one type of waffle on their menu contains almonds, so they made his waffle on a separate griddle to prevent cross-contamination.   Really hoping to see this place take off! They're also open super late on weekends (3 am!)"}
{"text":"I really hope this place can turn it around but as of now everything about the restaurant is very poor. From the service, to the atmosphere, to the food it was all really bad. I love supporting local restaurants but this one needs an intervention asap!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. Food was cold, and no taste. Servers had no clue what they were doing. Sitting around on phones while I need a drink refill. I won't come back and I defiantly won't let my friends and family waste their money here. Atmosphere seems like they could make this place something but they don't even play jazz music. Strange."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad, even if Lolo's didn't exist. Since Lolo's does exist, there's not much point in coming here.  The waffles are Belgian style, and generic and flavorless. If you've been to Lolo's, you know the incredible flavor, the subtle spices that go into their waffles. Jorge's taste like standard waffle mix.  Since they're Belgian style, they get cold quickly. Belgians do this because they have so little mass and so much surface area. You've probably noticed that when you try to spread butter on a Belgian waffle, it often won't melt. That's because they cool down so quickly. If you don't eat them immediately, they'll be cold when you do. Another reason to prefer Lolo's - theirs are nice and dense, flatter waffles, which stay hot longer, not to mention their incredible flavor.  The chicken was not normal fried chicken. It was some kind of boneless thing with a hot sauce mixed into the batter. It tasted terrible. It really was just unappetizing. I didn't eat even a third of the chicken. It's crazy to make fried chicken and decide for the customer how much hot sauce will be in the chicken -- if people like hot sauce on their chicken, and that's a big if, they probably prefer to be in control of how much.  Chicken and waffle places tend to be obsessive about their chicken and their waffles. It's usually a situation where someone has spent years perfecting their waffles, finding the right spices, timing and heat. And the same thing with the fried chicken. These sorts of places, like Lolo's or Roscoe's in LA, are the culmination of serious skills. Jorge's feels like someone just wanted to open a chicken and waffle place, and where no real effort went into either of the dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and decor. I had some life changing chicken and waffles at a restaurant called the Burgundian in Seattle, and I would say these stack up well. The chicken was also much better than Lo-Lo's, and the sides are more unique, such as the cilantro in the coleslaw and the jalapeño in the corn bread. Some of the dishes are on the pricy side for what you get, but the chicken and waffles is like two meals for me at least, and you're paying for more than just KFC on top of bisquick waffles. The chicken is seriously good, a bit of spice but incredibly moist. We got our food fast and all the staff were very nice."}
{"text":"Slow delivery, that also never arrived. Not only did I not get a confirmation of delivery until an hour after I ordered. They then called ad asked if I lived somewhere I didn't (even though they have the address). After waiting so long and no hope for delivery, I just went out and got food.    I gave them two stars because grubhub was also a part of this stupidity."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars however......... Staff was very friendly and personable (hence the 1 star). Our food took a bit over 20 minutes just to come out cold. Seriously the butter never melted on the waffle - never. The gravy was cold- not hot, not cool but cold! The cornbread was dry and I'm sure cardboard would have been more tasty. The chicken breast was moist although the batter came off as soon as you cut into it so I basically ate naked fried chicken. Asked for the manager but instead the owner came out. We explained very politely how terrible everything was. He offered to bring something else out and we opted for fresh waffles. I will admit when fresh and hot they are really good. Get the bill and for 2 cold chicken and waffle dinners with 2 soda waters and 1 ginger beer our total was $45..... Hmm the owner did hand us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"I stopped in to check this place out of curiosity and damn I'm glad I did! They did a great job making this place look modern yet relaxed at the same time! I had a veggie breakfast burrito and French fries instead of ranch, Delish! U never know what to trust with veggie dishes, sometimes u end up with hardly anything filling but this place did great! Plus the blonde bartender had quite the bod and some cheesy jokes  adorable. I will absolutely be coming back, worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles. Chicken...AND waffles? It sounded strange at first, really it did. We gave them a call for a delivery and a very quick 25 minutes later I opened the door to a wonderful aroma. The fried chicken was AMAZING, the skin came right off and the seasoning was just right. The eggs were cooked to order perfectly, over-medium. It came with a side of gravy that I ended up just eating by itself, it was delicious and I don't even like gravy. Once that was done, I had two warm, fluffy Belgian waffles covered in butter with a side of warm syrup and it was in that moment that I understood. Chicken and waffles makes all the sense in the world. Whether you love it already or you are curious to find out, I highly recommend Jorge's Chicken and Waffles!"}
{"text":"Awesome food !!! Get the chicken and waffles!! Come here it's great food!! Chicken and waffles chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"Blah... That is the first word that came to mind when I sat down at this place.  The record covers for the menu is completely lame and I don't quite understand the concept of letting customers write on the chairs. This is a poor, broke man's disneyland version of a touristy New Orleans wanna be juke joint.    And the food! How dare they not have bone-in chicken breast and decent hot sauce.  It should be against the law to serve fried chicken and not have crystal hot sauce!!   The service was absolutely terrible, took over 10 minutes just to get drinks.  The mimosa was just a fancy glass of orange juice.  The food took another 25 minutes, and some how managed to come out cold.  The only thing I liked about this place was the small portions.  You definitely will not over eat... Unless you order two entrees.  All of the food tasted pretty average, the chorizo and salsa appeared to be store bought.  The chicken was not very meaty and over fried.   So again ... Blah"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for chicken n waffles!  Their seasoning in the breading is absolutely mouth watering and my chicken is always fresh and juicy.   Gabriel is a fantastic server who knows his breakfast crowd!  Never had to ask once for more iced tea, he kept my glass fresh and full at all times.  My husband and I love it here!"}
{"text":"I lived in the neighborhood across the street and always wanted to try Jorge's cause I'm a fan of chicken and waffles. I thought they had been open for a few weeks but our waitress Bri had told us they were open since January. I walked in and was shocked by how nice it looked inside, all the tables and booths were well built and the decor made me feel like I was in New Orleans for brunch. Feeling like being in the south, I ordered a hurricane to drink. Bri didn't know what it was so I explained it to her and her and the bartender looked a great recipe for me. It tasted great and the bartender even came over to the table personally to tell me it was the first one he's ever made and wanted to make sure it was good. I ordered the classic chicken and waffles for lunch and absolutely loved it. The chicken was well seasoned and the waffle was yummy. The serving size was perfect and I left feeling full and happy. Bri had asked me if it compared to other chicken and waffle restaurants I've been too and I told her it was better than all of them. I would recommend going in for brunch any weekend!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I'm a server. I am very understanding and don't ask for much and I tend to tip much more than necessary. I had been looking forward to trying this place ever since it opened down the street from me, only to be infuriated; the funny thing is is that we left before we even got a drink order.  When my boyfriend and I arrived the place was empty (there was only one party there, and they were checking out). There were two servers there. They saw us and didn't greet us until ten minutes after we had been standing there. One of them was literally doing nothing and was too lazy to walk from the bar to us. The other was serving her table like we weren't there. Once the party leaves, one of the servers FINALLY came over to say hi, she just said \"Oh yeah just sit anywhere.\". Not only that, but she watched me as I gathered the menus right in front of her. I had to gather my own menus? Really? I was extremely upset by the time we sat down, but I was really excited to try out Jorge's so I decided to try and stick it out and give the server a chance to redeem herself. Once we sat down we waited. And waited. And waited. We were the ONLY party there in the restaurant after the other party had left. The server had gone and disappeared! We had sat there for a good 5 minutes until I finally said \"Screw it. I'm pissed off and I'm not going to enjoy this whatsoever.\". And so we left. Without a server even coming to our table or saying good bye. Nothing.  Whoever worked Tuesday (4/21/15) at around noon really screwed up. I don't think I can even return because now it will just piss me off remembering that incident."}
{"text":"Not too bad. The wait is kind of long, but the quality is okay. They should clean the grill more often but the food wasn't terrible or cold. It was decent. The customer service was great though."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was super slow.  Our meal came out in bits and pieces. We had 4 people with us. One half of us received our order first, then the other half received part of their order 20 minutes later. Another part of the order came shortly after that. Weird."}
{"text":"Wow! We were introduced to Jorges the first morning we arrived in Tempe by a friend who lived there. It was so awesome that we came in a second time the next morning! I had the Spanish Fly scramble the first time and then jumped into a chorizo and egg with a waffle the second time. My buddy slammed down the chicken with egg the first time and devoured a waffle and egg breakfast the second time. Each time we were greeted by Dave, the owner, and I always enjoy good service and hospitable servers, but it adds that extra bit of special when the owner greets you personally! The scenery of the restaurant looks inviting, with the future music scene adding to the excitement! The main focus of my reviews is how the service is delivered and when the restaurant has service that is beyond the beyond, you're bound to find a restaurant that you'll become a local at. Jorges would be my local spot if I was a resident in Tempe, but since my residence is 800 miles, I can only hope to get a taste of awesomeness every once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"First time visiting today with my family ! This place offers an awesome relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"Good food and the servers are very nice! Chicken and waffles are very tasty and the burritos are great as well! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once but the food is yummy and the price range is perfect for college students. The service wasnt bad either, I usually dont go out for breakfast in Tempe but this place was great!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up near my apt and sent out a $10 gift card to people in close proximity. Oddly enough I had been having such a craving for chicken and waffles lately, it seemed like fate.  First off, Fate I would like you to know that you're a jerk.  My wife (who is a vegetarian) and I decided to try this place out even after reading the previous Yelp! reviews.   I thought the record sleeves for menu covers was a cool idea, and it seems that they have added a better beer selection since one reviewer had posted his distaste of limited beer options.   At first, the service was prompt. Our server took our drink order and brought the beer and waters quickly. She was not very knowledgeable when it came time for ordering our entrees, my wife wanted to make sure there was no egg in the veggie tacos, she did not know but she did go to the kitchen to check for us, and was very polite.   We ordered:  Veggie Tacos Side of sweet potato fries Chicken and waffles that came with gravy  After waiting nearly 20-25 minutes for our food, it finally arrived.   The fries - barely lukewarm. When she brought the rest of our food out I explained to her that our fries were cold, she took them back and said she'd be back. A couple of minutes later she returned with what was obviously the same fries that were just redropped into the fryer to heat up (and soak up a ton more oil) they were awful.  The rest of our food was also barely warm. The butter didn't even melt on the waffle.   The manager came over and asked how everything was and I told him \"all of this food is barely warm\"  \"I'll go reheat all of it for you\"  He did. He obviously dropped the chicken back in the dryer (now frying the meat as I had cut off a few bites) and brought it back.   The whole meal was awful.   I felt like the food was probably ready at a decent time, but was not delivered to us promptly and sat under a heat lamp for 10+ minutes.  I will never go here again. People tell me I need to try Lolo's. I guess I will next time I have the craving.  If I could have left 0 stars, I would have."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken. Moist and flavorful. Waffles were soft but wish they'd have added some cinnamon or something to make then taste more special."}
{"text":"Best ceviche in Tempe!!!!!!! It's an appetizer but so worth it! I don't get the comment with the greasy food comment but it's not at all! I love the workers there so nice! And they serve food until 3am!!! I love it! I literally walk there after having a hangover for the ceviche"}
{"text":"Perfect waffle. The chicken was under seasoned,  nothing a little hot sauce can't cure. Got the breakfast chicken and waffles.  Was a huge portion.  Everything was fresh and hot. Gravy was thick and awesome. Nothing out does this waffle tho.  Wow. It was super dead when I came service was quick, and the food came fast as well."}
{"text":"Awesome vibe out at the patio bar, we felt like we were at the beach! The manager and owner are very friendly and excited to be apart of this area and hope that their new restaurant gains popularity. The concept for this restaurant came from the same guy that owns all of the US Egg locations around town. I've never been there so I cannot relate any similarities or differences, but this place has a pretty cool thing going. The location is pretty close to ASU, right on the light rail path, and has some awesome interior decoration/design. Jazz music is their jam. I like that. They also happen to have one of the best sign spinners that I've ever seen. Anyway on to the good stuff:  We ordered Chicken & Waffles with a side of Jalapeno Mac n' Cheese. I'd say it was pretty good, but not on the same caliber as something like Rosco's. Perhaps it was because I got the breast (I normally prefer dark meat). Anyway, the chicken was flavorful and cooked perfectly, but there was still something awry. The waffles were golden and crispy, also cooked to perfection. Perhaps I prefer a thinner waffle? I cannot quite put my finger on what was wrong. The hot sauce choices could be a little better. I opted for Cholula vs. Tabasco, but I feel like they need some Louisiana hot sauce or some Franks. Maybe I want crispier skin on my chicken. I still do not know what was missing. Anyway, it was not bad, but it was not quite like the chicken and waffles that I have come to love.   The manager recommended the mac n cheese, but my friend and I were not fans. It lacked flavor. It was bland and needed more of a cheesy taste. Perhaps some ham or bacon, or a sharper cheese. Hell even a little salt and pepper might work. I ended up putting hot sauce on it and that helped a little but not a lot.   I am interested to see how this restaurant does in the near future and look forward to checking it out again. This place has some serious potential to be a fun little spot.  Go see for yourself!!"}
{"text":"They have an awesome happy hour menu! Cheap drinks served by a super friendly bartender, who made sure our glasses were always full. The food was good and not too pricey. Definitely going back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome food-hands down best guacamole I've ever tasted-excellent shrimp and fried chicken tacos and great fried chicken and waffles (and my husband is definitely an expert!!). The service was also fast and courteous,all while putting up with our 2 years old daughter!!! I would definitely recommend this restaurant and we will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money. Not only is the food cold and greasy, but also disgusting.   Who 'fixes' cold food by throwing it in the deep fryer for a second time? Cook up a new plate instead."}
{"text":"Come get your breakfast. Visited twice this week in the AM.  Greeted when I entered,  had my order in minutes.  Fresh, hot and worth the price."}
{"text":"Went here for a group lunch with my coworkers.  I got the grits and the catfish tacos.  My coworkers got the taco trio, the mac and cheese, chicken wings and the chicken in a cone appetizer.  We had hoped the chicken in a \"waffle cone\" would actually be a folded waffle but it was a waffle cone made for ice cream.  The tacos were awesome we all agreed.  As other yelpers have mentioned, a greater variety of hot sauce would have been nice.  The chicken IN the waffle cone was perfectly cooked.  The catfish was perfectly cooked and so tasty.  We are all so sick of all fish being tilapia lately.  The mac and cheese, also as other yelpers have said, lacked flavor and we all had a taste but most of it was left. The macaroni was also overcooked. The manager came and asked how we liked everything and was very receptive to hearing the problems with the mac and cheese.  He said he could see that the noodles were mushy and would work to make sure that gets corrected. He was also receptive to the idea that the cheese needed a little more umph.  Like use sharp cheddar or something with more bite to match up with the jalapenos.  Our service was excellent and my male coworker loved all the TVs with the college hoops games going.  I will definitely go back and I think this place just needs to work out a few kinks."}
{"text":"Great food and a good selection of brews.  The highlight was the customer service. Allison was awesome, thanks Allison for the great service!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chicken restaurant that manages to cook their main item completely wrong; you've found the place. My boyfriend and I came into Jorge's with high hopes only to be let down the moment I took a sip of my watered down cherry koolaid. The service at the bar, or might I say, lack of service, kept us waiting for about 15 minutes before even ordering our take out. While waiting at the bar, however we did realize that the happy hour specifically on Devils Ale was a steal, which would be my boyfriends only reason for ever going back to Jorge's. After eating our sandwhich we impressed, but then immediately disappointed when we cut our chicken open to find RAW PINK CHICKEN. HOW DOES A PLACE THAT OFFERS CHICKEN NOT COOK A CHICKEN BREAST COMPLETELY? It was unbearable and not appetizing. However the waffle was fluffy and tasted good. Honestly, even after my 10 dollar gift card, I feel like I was charged way over what I was given. I'd rather spend the money at a chick Fil A."}
{"text":"Just so-so service  They forgot to toast the English muffin  The food is just okay  Solid three stars"}
{"text":"This place was always empty when we went. As of a few weeks ago, it is closed \"for remodeling\". There is a distinct lack of remodeling activity going on. I think everyone knows what that means."}
{"text":"It was good not great. Service was excellent and probably worth an extra star but the chicken was slightly underdone and the breading was very generic - not a ton of flavor.  Awesome atmosphere. Love the jazz music playing while I sat on the deck.  Overall worth a look. I will try something besides the chicken and waffles next time."}
{"text":"Came here at 2am and for $13 I got a fried chicken breast with gravy, jalepeño coleslaw,  a brick sized piece of jalepeño cornbread, and a sweet potato waffle. The portion was huge and everything was delicious, I felt the coleslaw could have used more dressing. The manager, Josue, was polite, and very friendly. They have a full bar, which I have nothing to say about since it was after 2am. Working in bars, this will definitely be my post 2am go to spot. The food, both in portion and quality, is worth way more than $13. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"It was pretty empty when I went in today, around 2 pm, but seems like a nice place - decor is sort of southern jazz music and food is a mix of chicken and waffle centric food and mexican food. I had the chicken and waffle dinner with the fried chicken breast (boneless, but it was not dry at all). It was about $11 and also came with a waffle and some coleslaw (you can get coleslaw or mashed potatoes), and some peppery cream gravy that was quite good - when I go back I'm going to replace the waffle in the chicken dinner with the mashed potatoes and I would go ahead and ask for extra cream gravy, right from the start.   The restaurant was empty when I was there (I was the only patron about 2 pm on a Sunday) - so I hope that is not indicative of the usual crowd level. While the food is good a crossover of a southern focused chicken and waffles and Mexican food feels like an odd cultural mishmash, just due to the decor - and they need to turn down the fans a bit as it was a bit windy at the table due to the high speed of the fans.  I don't know the sales of this place but I would encourage a bit of a menu make over - put a chicken fried steak on the menu (the place already has the cream gravy and the flowering and wash for the chicken), I would also emphasize the cocktails (they have a full bar) and promote some vintage ones - and add some more Southern themed items - fried green tomatoes, cornbread, hush puppies, maybe even some catfish - an all you can eat Friday catfish might not be a bad idea. I would encourage management/ownership to look at the menu of Southern Rail and I would also look to Mrs. White's golden rule cafe. There are plenty of places for good Mexican food in Tempe but you have to travel a bit, from my experience, to get good Southern food.   Here's my question for the owners - who is your target audience? Based on the menu, I'm not quite sure they have that answer down."}
{"text":"I had Lolo's, Louisiana fried chicken and so far this is the best chicken and waffles I had. I usually don't like chicken breast but it was made perfectly, not dry at all. Had jalapeno cole slaw,will most likely not order that again. But will eat here again."}
{"text":"Was out with my boyfriend and he suggested Chicken and Waffles. I've never had it and Jorge's was right around the corner. My goddess, it was delicious! The waffle was crispy (this is the way a waffle should be), the chicken was tender, boneless and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Boyfriend got the dinner version of the chicken and waffle with added jalapeno coleslaw. Plus with $2 Flat Tire how can you pass it up?! We sat at the bar and we got chatting with the bartender. The place is amazing, the food is delicious, the workers are awesome. I highly recommend. I have been to places before where you have to clarify your waffle as crispy, or you have to try to get  one of the worker's attention. This was not the case. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First Caveat, this review was written the second day the place was open so I am hopeful it will improve.  The place is big and airy with a nice bar and patio. Be warned-the beer selection is pretty pathetic and would be better if they added some locally made craft beers instead of crap like Blue Moon and Dos Equis.  That said the service was horrible.  The waitress was completely out of her element.  We waited for about 5 minutes or so before we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. Over 10 minutes went by before our coffee and water showed up (Water spots on the glassware). Then we had to ask for menus.  Finally our order was taken.  The food came out in a semi reasonable time but the waffle was cold and the $2.99 side of jalapeno coleslaw was incredibly small for the price. We actually should have received two waffles because the waffle that came was with the meal and I had ordered the coffee and waffle special as well. There was a second waitress who seemed to have her act together, in fact another table next to us that came in 15-20 minutes after us got served by her and had their food before we did and paid before we did. Oh and that waitress took the time to refill my coffee, something our waitress didnt do once. Oh-the bill was messed up also and they had problems with their credit card machine being out of paper.  The bathroom was also dirty and wasn't cleaned from the night before as we were there right when the place opened. We were there just over an hour which is twice as long as it should have taken.  Was a calamity of errors but errors that proper training of the staff or a good restaurant manager could fix."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan of the chickenwaffle cone! :)    For one, There's no Jorge. This Self proclaimed Mexican Restaurant has no Jorge there! I was really feeling some type of way about this. I really thought I was going to support (under the impression by the name Jorge) that it would be ran by an actual Spanish or Hispanic since it had a Spanish Name, served Mexican specialties like Ceviche. I thought a \"Mexican Soul Food Jazz Joint\"?! OKKKK :)  But come to my surprise this Mexican Chicken and Waffle Place is owned by the same owners of the US Egg! I was ready to leave for being mislead. Really, this is like mockery because they also have  semi Soul Food like Jalapeno Mac & Cheese, Shrimp & Grits and the obvious Chicken & Waffles. When I found out that the owners weren't Mexican or SOUL, SMH, BUT, None the less, I was there, been wanted to try it despite the SIKE but, still thought why not?!  Although, surprisingly, I didn't hear or definitely didn't feel the VIBE of a real inspired Jazz Joint, which the menus there also come inside Album Covers from different artist from Black Jazz Artist (DUH!) to White 50's Jive (?) groups. That lost me too, this place is weird. The name you think sends one message: Mexican Soul Food but when inside the place it feels like any other old downtown Scottsdale bar catering to the rock crowd.    Anywaysss, I went in and like everyone else said on their reviews, although it wasn't busy (about 5 employees, 3 customers) there wasn't an instant acknowledge to greet us. We were New Customers who had never visit this establishment before but was eager to try the Mexican Chicken Waffle Combination!  The employees were just chillen, over the counter laid back, the bartenders were a rocker type white boy and a non-social (maybe new?) long hair, skinny female. The bartender guy told me the happy hour specialty drinks were his own recipes. So, we tried the El Diablo & The Moscow Mule. Both taste like too much syrup, kind of strong with weak liquor but, like he said, \"Drink it or wear it\"(? - I don't know).  We ordered some apps; The Chicken Waffle Cone, The wings and I wanted to try the shrimp & grits but was advised \"don't do that\" may not like it (sad I was craving some damn shrimp & grits too)  but instead I took the warning and ordered the Jalapeno Mac & Cheese. Why?!  The Chicken Waffle Cone was soooo good. Hard to eat how its served but it was seasoned  just about right. A pinch more of seasoning wouldn't hurt & maybe a little longer browning would of made this chicken waffle cone IT. But one down side to this, that I recommend adjusting is, that if this is a Waffle Cone, you expect some syrup with it, no? Add some syrup on the side along this app, waffles and syrup go hand in hand. The coleslaw bed was good too.  The wings tasted like any other bar food. Kindda disappointing too cos you would think they would be fried wings, no? (I don't know maybe based on expectation from their competition) but man, the mac & cheese?! Why, didn't I stick to my first choice? The Jalepenos Mac & Cheese taste like out the box macaroni with a non brand cheese melted on top, cooked to good temp tho, but it was so bland and taste-less, like no salt or pepper, the very least.  My guest I took with me was really to leave as soon as we got a feel of the atmosphere there but hey, I tried it, I guess."}
{"text":"Worst chicken and waffles. Chicken was like a big chicken strip that was way too crunchy and felt like it came out of the freezer. The strawberry waffle did not have fresh strawberries which was surprising for the price. Do not waste your money it is mediocre and over priced. Drive to Scottsdale and get Lo Lo's."}
{"text":"Like I said, when I want something, I know what I want!! Good all the way around... Nice crisp with my chicken and moist, waffle was hot with a bit of a crunch on the edge... And the cold coke in the mason jar hit the spot... Looking forward to coming back with live jazz on the menu in the evenings...  Came back in less than 24hrs with my family & the same thing applies that I said yesterday. The tacos were added and my son enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try this place because it's currently closed for refurbishments. The owner should reflect this on Yelp. Pretty much went out of my way to check this place out."}
{"text":"They're not claiming to be a 5-star restaurant, this is straight up bar food.  You want $3 beer and $3 apps go here, QUIT HAYTIN'"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim, as we live in the neighborhood, and left beyond delighted with the experience. Even so close to closing, we were met with genuine friendliness from the bartender and who we belive to be the owner. They spoke with us like we were friends and treated us like guests in their own homes.  The food was, without exaggeration, divine. The chicken was juicy and obviously cooked fresh, not from frozen. The diversity within the menu makes it so everyone will find something they like, and, to top it off, BREAKFAST IS SERVED ALL DAY. We will be making this a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"Chicken & Waffles are amazing as well as the street tacos. Great location .... good vibe!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place with two friends of mine for lunch and it was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. I wish I would have taken a pic but before I knew it, it was gone.  One friend ordered Carne asada fries and they were good as well. I'll be back for sure and I'm sure my friends will as well."}
{"text":"This place is definitely just starting out. You can tell they're still working out some of the kinks, including menus (they don't have a drink menu which made it like difficult to order drinks) and service (the waiter seemed new and not super familiar with the menu items), but the food is delicious. We got guacamole and the classic chicken and waffles. The guacamole was very good, but the chips just seemed to be cheap tortilla chips from the grocery store. However, the chicken and waffles were a delicious Belgian waffle and crispy fried chicken which had a bit of a spice. The combo of sweet and spicy was great.   On Friday night they had a guy playing live reggae music which was a little too loud and obnoxious. Not sure what demographic there trying to reach since the decor is jazz albums and the food is a mix of Southern and Mexican. If you can get over the restaurant's growing stage, it's worth it for the food. I  hope they get things together and don't go out of business because I'd like to continue going here."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of about 6 ladies for breakfast on Sat. morning. We were all excited to try it. When I walked in at about 930 it was almost completely empty, It was not because it was early because at around 11 when we left it was still just as empty!  Anyway, the service was kind of weird from the start. The waitress was attentive but also the bartender. Then there were 2 other waitresses that were kind of drifting around . Unfortunately, for all those servers and lack of guests the service was not attentive at all. At one point I had to get up and go to the bar to ask our waitress for a side of toast. You would think for a group of 6 they would check up a little more.   I got the classic chicken and waffle. I liked it a lot. For me, the food was the best part of the experience (besides the company). The other ladies with me were not so impressed. My one friend got the protein waffle and that looked good..  Overall, this place is going for too many identities. Brunch? Chicken and waffles? day bar with a cool patio? Nighttime scene?   I might go back because I liked the fried chicken but we shall see."}
{"text":"The happy hour at this place is awesome and having a reverse happy hour menu is always a bonus! The fact that they're open after 3am is a major plus because there are very few places open that late that isn't Filibertos. The service is always fast and courteous, & the food is consistently pleasant at a great price. I've come here multiple times and have brought friends who have had nothing but good things to say! I will definitely be frequenting this place more often."}
