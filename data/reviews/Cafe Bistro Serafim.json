{"text":"The food was forgettable. The service, especially, needs a LOT of work. The wait staff were perfectly pleasant, but totally disorganized. There wasn't a manager around to really lead the team, so it felt a lot like a headless chicken. Our drink orders weren't taken until 40 minutes in, and then we learned that the bartender wasn't even in that day. Given the location, a restaurant like this has a lot of potential. Switch up management and then we'll talk."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here three times during our week stay in Montreal. Each time it was nearly empty with no more than three tables. Perfect for our honeymoon! Were a little apprehensive with the lack of people but decided to look past it as we were visiting in off-peak hours.   Our first visit we had two iced coffees and lemon cheesecake. Now this was not your standard iced coffee. It is a thick creamy coffee concoction,ice. It hit the spot better than a standard iced coffee could have on a hot afternoon.   Just about anything you try will be delicious for the area! We would stop by again if we are ever in the area."}
{"text":"It was quiet and empty but we had to wait a long time before being served. I appreciate the owner who stepped in and served us  There were flies on the food. The dishes were OK, good quality but nothing memorable.  Its certainly overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Voilà un lieu où se mélangent autant de bonne bouffe que de cultures! Le Café Bistro Serafim est une sorte d'auberge espagnole culinaire... D'ailleurs, ça transparaît assez au travers des rythmes musicaux qui défilent. Effectivement, le personnel multiethnique apporte une grande richesse gustative aux plats proposés. Vous aurez le droit  à des sucreries et recettes provenant d'un peu partout : Corée, Iran, Allemagne, Grèce, France... De surcroît, l'on y trouve une inépuisable sélection de repas faits maison, à base d'ingrédients naturels et biologiques. Le pain au Kamut est fait à la main, et si vous n'avez jamais goûté à cette céréale, sachez qu'en plus d'être meilleure (au goût et pour le corps) que le blé, elle est idéale pour ceux qui ne tolèrent pas le gluten...  Mais qu'est-ce qu'on y mange? Pas mal de tout; le menu est fait pour satisfaire carnivores et végétariens. Allant de la salade d'haricots jusqu'aux viandes délicieusement apprêtées, vous aurez de quoi vous en mettre plein la panse, sans vous sentir coupable.... Et les desserts sont plus tentants les uns que les autres. Essayez le kourabie, c'est une   petite pâtisserie grecque, reconnue comme étant la meilleure amie du café... Ou encore le ghotab, gâterie iranien au yogourt, aux amandes et à la cardamome.  Mais je vous avertis, ça coûte un peu plus cher qu'à la normale...rappelez-vous cependant que la nourriture est de qualité supérieure.  Il faut mentionner qu'on y trouve quelques excellentes bières importée: Duvel, Birra Moretti...  Mon allongé était goûteux et gentiment accompagné d'un petit biscuit au beurre...  Rareté : Vous pouvez vous commander une verre de chlorophylle à la menthe. Très rafraîchissant..."}
{"text":"The Cafe Bistro Serafim was a great find in Old Montreal. They serve wonderfully prepared food, most of it organic.  You can't miss with the any of the breakfast omelets or crepes."}
{"text":"Is there a \"no star\" option? This place is a ridiculous joke. Dirty tables, dirty floors, rude service, and a $5 charge to use the bathroom for non clients? haha what? We wanted a quick cold drink and did not want a menu but it was forced upon us. There was nothing that appealed to me so I had some apple juice which cost $6 (it was a tiny dirty glass by the way) and my partner had iced coffee (which was crushed ice and ground beans poured into a small glass). It cost $14 for one glass of apple juice and an iced coffee. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TOURIST TRAP!"}
{"text":"TOURIST TRAP! Slow and poor service, and iced coffee that was disgusting and an iced tea from a bottle (mango flavoured?! Which isn't what I ordered.  Over priced."}
{"text":"I am a native Montrealer spending some time back home, so I have been in lots of cafés, and this is definitely NOT one that I would recommend.  I have to say that the two waitresses were very nice, but that's the only good point about this place.  My husband and I went there around 2:30pm (so it was pretty quiet), and we waited at least 30 minutes before my husband got his panini, and I was told that there was an error with my order (a crêpe), which would take five minutes to fix. About 25 minutes later, they finally get my crêpe to me. The food in general was OK, but I was disappointed with the crêpe which was burnt at the bottom. For a panini (without any kind of side), a small crêpe, a coffee, a fruit salad, and a juice, they charged us over $40 CAN (i.e. $37 US). They did NOT offer us any discount for the extended delay to get the food. And finally, when I asked them to add 15% for tips to my debit transaction, they counted it OVER the total including taxes (and in Quebec, tips should normally be added to the total BEFORE taxes). Perhaps we were just not lucky, but I would never go back there, and I believe this place is still in business just because they serve mostly tourists who don't hear from other people about their poor experience there."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant in Montreal! You are better off spending your money elsewhere.   After walking around Old Montreal on a Saturday night we stumbled upon this corner restaurant. It didn't seem that busy as the other restaurants, so we decided to give it a try. It didn't take long for us to get seated inside the restaurant, about 10 minutes. The decors looked a bit indecisive and they couldn't decide between a seafood shack or a rustic library with bookshelves which separated the kitchen from the dining tables. Also there was a random fish tank full of lobsters, but yet they never came out to grab em for cooking.... Odd much? Guess they are keeping them as pets.    So it took us, a party of 7 about 15 minutes to look over the menu and order our food. Our waiter was very nice and patient with us explained what's what, they even had a $39 prefixed 4 course dinner but the regular dishes seemed tastier. After placing our order, that's when everything started to go downhill. Water was served promptly, but apparently we had to wait 40 mins just for bread... seriously?   Even better the appetizers followed 30 minutes later.  We've ordered a Crevettes, Pétoncles, Pieuvre grillée $24 (Grilled Shrimps, Scallops and Octopus), Pikilia $36 (Combination of Appetizers) and a Pizza Cinq Fromages $12 (Pizza Five Cheeses). While waiting for our appetizers to come out, we've noticed that once in a while the lights would sort of dim and flicker then return to normal. Turns out this would happen because they were using a freaked microwave to nuke our food instead of cooking it!  After over an hour and a half, our meals finally came out but everything seems to have a curry theme to it. When we complained the chef decided to come out and that's when all hell broke loose! He accused us of starting trouble and being Americans. He even called my friend psychotic and that's when we all got up and left! Funny thing is we weren't the only table that left, as three other patrons followed our footstep. I guess they were American too!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. This place went from comical to scary in the 40 minutes it took for my \"sandwich\" to even start being prepared. The idea is fine - organic, local fresh foods in a bistro-like environment. The execution is a travesty - a micromanaging, out-of-control chef and no less than 5 people on the waitstaff wandering aimlessly as the chef takes one hour PER DISH to assemble. The prices were outrageous; the disgusting sandwich I received consisted of rotten-looking slices of lamb salami on stale bread with slimy peppers. Total price: $16. The cheese pizza we ordered tasted equivalent to a Totino's frozen pizza. Since I had an hour to wait before receiving the 5\" pizza and crapwich, I had plenty of time to watch the chef assemble the other dishes. There were several trays with the basic components of the menu sitting in a refrigerator unit. He would essentially scoop a few spoonfuls out of a few of these containers, throw it in a non-stick skillet, and dump it on a plate. $20+ for reheated food where somehow the chef was the only person capable of cooking. Please, for the sake of humanity, never visit this place."}
{"text":"Fun little organic greek place in touristy old Montreal, we sat on the patio and were fairly undisturbed in moderately cold weather. Fun people watching(I saw a drive-by photoshoot that had me laughing for the rest of the day) and a great bistro atmosphere for drinks. I wasn't inside much but the bathroom was nice, and I don't see a problem in the $5 charge of the restroom -- It's a nice way of saying that the restroom is for customers only. The food was decent greek fare. The grilled cheese was nothing special but the veggie burger with tzatziki was good, if not a little expensive for having no sides."}
{"text":"Good people, great food. Best sandwich I've ever had. Order smoked turkey."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking around Old Montreal and fell in love.  Sat outside and the ambiance was perfect.  Ordered a white sangria, and it was the best one I've ever had, with fresh blueberries!  Staff was attentive and felt very local. Absolute must!"}
{"text":"It's a very simple, casual bistro in Old Montreal, with great food and service above average (for Montreal standards). It's true they charge 5 CAD for non customers to use the restrooms, but the place is very clean.   The main dishes are, actually, a 3-course meal consisting on soup, greek salad, and what you asked with a side order of vegetables. Serves two normal or one hungry person. I asked the shrimps, and they were JUMBO shrimps, lots of shrimps.   Waitress was very friendly, even with my crappy French.   They have an outdoor patio, but it's impossible to seat there, it's full of bees. They probably cover the tables with honey. They would benefit of AC inside."}
{"text":"We walked in when the chef was having dinner with his family.  His son cooks with his dad and his wife works the front of the house.  The menu is heavily influenced with Greek dishes, which is representative of the chef's native Crete.  The lamb shank was melting off the bone and had an incredible flavor. The grilled vegetables were fantastic, and the entrees were served with a complimentary salad and roasted red pepper soup.   They went out of their way to make sure we were happy and enjoyed our time there.  It felt as of we were having dinner with old friends.  The experience was so enjoyable, I know I will return again and again."}
{"text":"This has to be the hidden gem of all gems in Montreal! Don't be thrown off by the sometimes intense host, this is a family owned, authentic greek place so the people working are very passionate about the food. Overall, they serve up amazingly fresh, authentic, and organic greek food for an amazing price! As if this weren't good enough, they also have an amazing selection of ready-to-go foods and desserts and a little mini specialty market in the corner of the cafe! Also have great outdoor seating.   LOCATION/NEIGHBORHOOD: Located in the heart of Old Montreal, on a picturesque, cobblestone street the location is prime. It is not on the main, super-touristy square, but it is still on one of the fun streets in old montreal. It is a great neighborhood to go for a walk in before or after your meal (or both).  AMBIANCE/DECOR: So this may not be the most modern, or chic of places, but the decor and ambiance are authentic and welcoming. It has a comfortable, homey feeling, and is cute in a casual and comforting way. The decor is very much that of an authentic greek/Mediterranean cottage or restaurant. The ambiance ranges from buzzing and full of life (during peak hours) to quiet and almost romantic during the later hours of the night, or off hours during the afternoon. They have adorable outdoor seating, which I encourage you to take advantage of; the outdoor seating is like sidewalk cafe dining in europe, and is very enjoyable if the weather is being cooperative.   SERVICE: The service is usually prompt and attentive. Both times I have eaten here the server has been very knowledgeable and passionate about their food and about making sure that we are enjoying what we are eating. The first time I ate here I believe we were being served by the owner (he works here all day, every day) and he made us personalized salads that weren't even on the menu according to our tastes (at no extra charge). Both times I ate here they were very accommodating and understanding with my picky eater/vegan requests and made sure that we were having a good experience.   FOOD: Alas, the things that makes Serafim the true gem that it is......the food! Almost everything on the menu is organic and seasonal, but that is just the beginning. The menu is extensive, but you can't go wrong with anything! The options range from such creative mediterranean fair as savory zucchini tarts and bison with wild mushrooms, to traditional kebab plates moussaka, and vegetable tagines. They also have excellent salads and fresh seafood. I am vegan and am obsessed with their vegetable tagine; my mom (who is in no way, shape, or form vegan) tried it the first time I got it and was obsessed. The flavors were so perfectly balance, and the mixture of vegetables, sauce, and chickpeas with rice was perfect; I am salivating just thinking about it! My mom got the vegetarian moussaka and fell in love, she couldn't stop raving about it. We both loved the salads we got as well. The next time I went I got the chickpea salad to go from the deli case and it was delicious! Also go some greek coffee and another order of the vegetable tagine........it is to die for! Honestly though, you can't go wrong with anything you order. The food is authentic, made fresh, and made with love in every bite....sounds cheesy but it's the truth.   Special notes: On sundays they have an AMAZING buffet that goes until 8 pm.....if you can make it to this, you will be the happiest person on the planet!"}
{"text":"Visited for the second time for breakfast, it was still just as good as the first. I loved the raw feel that was reminiscent of bistros I visited in Europe. Yes, the service is slow...but well worth the wait if you enjoy a well orchestrated breakfast."}
{"text":"Les prix uffff mais bon on est au vieux Montreal ... petite terrasse pour se reposer , à l'interieur musique francaise, jolie deco."}
