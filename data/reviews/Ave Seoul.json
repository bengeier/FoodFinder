Whenever I move to a new city, I need to find a few things. My go-to spots actually, including a sushi joint, bubble tea, favourite drugstore, and a place to get my authentic Korean food. Although I've been to a many Korean restaurants here in Montreal, I was hesitant to say that they were my go-to place because none of them fully hit the spot for me. Something was missing, whether it was the expensive prices, not so clean interiors, or just plainly not authentic. I think I can finally say that I've found my go to place for Korean food in Montreal; it's located a little far out from downtown Montreal and its name is Ave Seoul!

I discovered Ave Seoul accidentally; it wasn't on any of my foodie bucket lists nor was it recommended to me by anyone. Hubby and I just happened to be near the area one evening and so we decided to try the Korean restaurant out as it had great reviews on Yelp. When we arrived, there weren't many customers (it was an early Tuesday evening after all) but by the time we left, the kitchen was very busy getting customers' orders ready!

The restaurant's menu was extensive: they had great lunch combos which I wanted to come back for, and they had everything from Korea's classic bibimbap to casual snacks, stews, chef's specials and much more. Hubby and I both had some difficulty picking what to eat because we really liked everything on the menu! The evening we visited on was rather chilly so we both went for something hot to keep ourselves warm: Ttukbaegi Bulgogi (bulgogi noodle soup) for me and gam-ja-tang (pork bone stew) for hubby.

Not long after we ordered, our dishes arrived. Hubby and I were both very pleasantly surprised with the presentations of our dishes; the side dishes were served on a clean dish, there were utensil holders, our dishes it self were very visually appealing!

This was legit, and the most legit one we've found in our city so far! The pork meat was soft and easy to take off the bones while the broth was just spicy enough to give it a kick. It wasn't difficult for hubby to finish his bowl of rice because it was so good. The stew itself was served in a rather large hot stone bowl, bigger than your regular bibimbap bowls. Gam-ja-tang is traditionally cooked with potatoes (gam-ja is potato in Korean) and we were disappointed to find the potatoes in this dish slightly undercooked. Other than that, the flavours of the stew itself were great and it didn't seem like any MSG was added to our stew.

I ordered this because I was craving bulgogi but I wanted soup at the same time. It's essentially your well known bulgogi but with broth and glass noodles inside. It really is perfect for a cold day. Whenever I had ordered this dish previously at other Korean restaurants (outside of Montreal), I always found that it wasn't done very well. It was mainly too greasy and they had used fattier meats over leaner pieces. Here at Ave Seoul, I was surprised that it was done really well without any extra fat or greasiness. This restaurant was the least place I had expected this from so I really enjoyed my dinner at Ave Seoul. The amount of bulgogi and glass noodles in my soup was basically overflowing because I had to give about half of it to my husband.

We would definitely go back to Ave Seoul whenever we're craving for Korean food in Montreal. Sure we cook it all the time at home but we still like to eat Korean out once in a while. With affordable prices, I'm surprised that Ave Seoul isn't as well known in Montreal. It's definitely a bit of a drive from downtown Montreal, but I don't mind; I rather travel a little more for authentic Korean than waste more money on not so authentic stuff."}
{"text":"Une of The best Korean in Montreal!! Their hot stones are awesome !!! Their food is always fresh , delicious !!! Their staffs always friendly... I recommend to every one who want having a good Korean meal !!!"}
{"text":"If wanting to eat Korean food an you are not willing to go to downtown area? You should consider coming here! The decor is appealing, and has a bit of a chic vibe to them ( they went with the all white theme) 

I orders bimbimbap which was a monstrous portion and came with sides dish ( potato, Asian strong beans and vegetable ) and with miso soup! All for 11.35$ this place also had BBQ which really convenient considering there also a college near by."}
{"text":"Place is really cozy. It feels like your home. 
Food is great. I love their bibimbap also they have kids menu which is I like. My daughter took some bbq with french fries and a salade with it.
But my only problem is the service, very slow... it took them 30 mins to give our order.
My advice to never go here without eating a little bit in advance. Thumbs up with the food tho."}
{"text":"This is still our goto Korean.

The quirky decor (fun) belies an attention to detail that is seldom matched.

The veggies are always super fresh, and perfectly sliced and prepared. Good sized portions and fair prices.

Check it out."}
{"text":"New Korean BBQ restaurant in Saint-Laurent on Décarie close to Côte-Vertu metro. 
Walked in about a month ago to check it out and liked it so much I've been back 3 times since.
Nice decor, amazing and friendly service (in English only though) and very good food. 
Everything I and my dining partners have tried there ranged from very good to excellent.
They have a soup, with soft tofu, that is amazing and so tasty. The tofu tastes and feels like bone marrow. Their homemade kimchi is excellent.
They have tables with hotplates incorporated in them for the BBQs. The meat is fresh and perfectly seasoned.
If you're into Korean BBQs this is definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"The food is good but they did the unthinkable! Ordered rice and pork, didnt finish it so asked for take out, the man took in to the back and I saw him transfer the food into the takeout box with his bare hands!! No bueno!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite korean resto. Bibimbap and the pancake are so good. Much much better than Chez Bong which I find over rated.Pancake was crispy on the  outside and chewy on the inside. Perfectly cooked. Very tasty. My daughter ordered Kimchi soup which was equally delicious. Price is reasonable.   Friendly servers,  water always refilled promptly. I would definitely come back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went with a group of eight coworkers for lunch and we had a great experience.
The menu is longer than most restaurants but you won't regret it the second you taste one of their dishes. So much variety!
I ordered a BBQ pork dish served in a hot stone bowl, delicious!
Parking is a problem in the area only around lunch since you need a permit 
Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go there. 
The food is always good and the dishes are always well display.
The service is a little slow but the staff are so friendly.

I definitely return again!"}
{"text":"The best place in Montreal for Korean food! The service is a little slow but the staff are very friendly. If you have the time to enjoy a nice meal, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Un bon restaurant coréen.  Respect des saveurs traditionnelles et surtout des plaques électriques pour le bbq. Abordable et délicieux. Très heureux de ne pas voir des plats américanisés.  Stationnement sans trop de tracas.  On y retourne."}
{"text":"Charming new korean resto near Cote-Vertu metro. Food taste amazing and friendly service."}
{"text":"The kalbi was hard to chew and there werent enough rice that came with it. Service was okay we had to always ask for the water while waiter was sitting down doing nothing or on her phone. My friend took bulgogi poutine and it was basically fries with little sauce that couldnt be tasted because of its small quantity also you cant call poutine without cheese.. The soup that came with my meal was very little... I expected a bit too much for the price they had"}
{"text":"If only we can give this place more stars. Amazing food, amazing service, a hidden gem in montreal. Clean, Mom and Pop vibe.

Food is simply amazing, a must try!!"}
{"text":"I ordered squid on rice (a bap dish). The squid tasted moldy, not fresh. The various vegetable accompaniments, including kim-chi, were very good. The sauce and rice were very good. They told me they use frozen squid and that it's new every day, but I couldn't eat it with the moldy taste. Anyway they didn't make me pay and I left and went elsewhere.

The three stars are because the service was good, the environment nice and that they didn't try to charge for a dish that I wouldn't eat.  I suspect they're just fine for beef bulgogi. If the squid had been good they'd have gotten 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"It was nice to find a Korean restaurant closer to Laval instead of driving further south Montreal! Managed to find free parking in the residential area. 
As we got into the restaurant, we requested a high chair for my child. Unfortunately, we got there after a family and they already took the only ONE highchair available.. we were disappointed but still decided to stay as baby was getting fussy (supper time). We had to improvise a chair with our stroller so we can eat freely..
Food was ok, seemed like a family own restaurant. I ordered the udon soup (broth super tasty), the seafood crepe (good), the general Tao (was a bit dry) and my husband got the Korean rib plate (was ok, came with small amount of ribs and some fries).
They were quite busy for a Friday evening. Lots of people coming in/out and some had to wait before being seated. 
Overall ok service and experience, but they should make it more baby friendly."}
{"text":"Extremely good korean. The pancake is delicious buy really big. Only buy if you are more than 2 sharing. Staff is friendly and their cocktail with soju beer and sprite is extremely smooth. Be warned that the soups are really hit. Even boiling"}
{"text":"Tried a number of dishes but the whole experience was kind of disappointing. We did take out so this not a reflection of their service staff.
The first issue to pop up was that after ordering we got a call back that they didn't have the ingredients to make the kimbap. I'm not sure how that really happens on a Saturday at 6:30 pm, but it did. Moving along, we picked up the food and when we got it home we noticed that a \"small\" soup was one of those small styrofoam containers most restaurants use for sauces. Not a big deal, just odd. 
Now cracking onto the food, my seafood Soondubu was ok...which was disappointing because one of my friends had said this was her favorite version of the soft tofu stew. I felt there was too much red pepper flakes which overwhelmed everything else (and is a weird texture to me), as well as the seafood being a bit rubbery. 
The seafood pajeon was good, although my sister found it lackluster. I thought it was pretty standard, it was helped by a little extra soy sauce.
The banchan included some good kimchi, sesame broccoli, and soy-sauce simmered potatoes."}
{"text":"The food was okay.
We had the seafood rice cakes, a beef/cheese dolsot Bibimbap and a seafood Bibimbap.
The beef/cheese Bibimbap was good, but the seafood used in our appetizer and Bibimbap didn't taste fresh (and was very chewy)."}
{"text":"D'abord, le service nous charme par son peu de prouesse à pousser une mise en scène stéréotypée. Toutefois, le décor est malhabile par son jeu de meuble générique. Une volonté d'être au courant et branchée mais sans la fougue. 
Le resto s'est muni de tables avec grille à BBQ. Nous nous sommes résolus aux plats préparés. Le Soon Dou Bou (un mijoté de tofu) est épicé mais sans trop de malice. Un peu décu que mon oeuf ne soit pas suffissament cru. Le plat  s'accompagne de riz et d'une variété de légumes au même thème, soit marinés. Bien satisfaits de notre première visite!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on a saturday night. 

- the food is good with generous portions. We got the bibimpbap, the tofu soup and the jap chae.

I find what was lacking was definitely the ambiance. There was no music whatsoever, which made the place feel cold. We could hear everybody's conversation which made my boyfriend and i instantaneously want to whisper - for a date night, it kind of sucks. 

Also i find the service was lacking, our waitress didn't greet us or thank/ say goodbye once we paid and left, and she never once come to see us to see if everything was okay. We had to ask for some refill on water..I would understand if she was busy, but several times she was just standing there scrolling her cell phone. 

I think if they just adjust the two above mentionned points, this place can really be a hit! Its cute and you can tell its a family business, which i always strive to support!"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food and atmosphere with K-Pop playing in the background. Lunch is especially great as the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My party and I got food poisoning after eating there, the chicken balls were dry and clearly tasted like they weren't fried on the spot. They had a plastic texture and the sauce isn't qualified as a Korean recipe, it tasted like old general Tao; absolutely gross. Like frozen chicken that got reheated added with a sauce + peanuts on top. The rice that came with the stew was extremely hard to chew and their kimchi stew is sweeter than others, and didn't add a lot of ingredients either. The appetizers/small dish they give us at the beginning were tiny portions, we were 3 and they only gave us 2 pieces of marinated potato. 

Overall I don't understand why this place had good reviews the food is average at best although the service was okay and they had nice decorations."}
{"text":"Finally there's a Korean restaurant in Ville St-Laurent!  Been waiting for that to happen for a while.  I didn't even know about it until I came across a Yelp review one day.  Kudos to Yelpers who took the time to write reviews.  Writing a meaningful review is not easy.  Anyway, I decided to go try the new restaurant in town tonight.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and modern. Seating is roomy and comfortable.  Not your typical Korean family restaurant.  Almost reminded me of a Korean cafe instead.  I think it's a nice place to hang out with friends.  I ordered Jap Chae and Soon Doo Bu.  The food is quite good.  One of the best Jap Chae dishes I've eaten.  Their sides dishes, especially the kimchi and the cucumbers were spicy and delicious.   Their rice was perfectly cooked to the way I like it - soft and chewy.  The texture was just right, not mushy like most.  The waitress was very nice and friendly.  She gave us extra side dishes when she saw we finished the plate.  I don't know what more can I say but I really enjoyed the dinner.  Will definitely come back again and maybe try the BBQ next time.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've tried those \"All you can eat\" Korean BBQ restaurants.. They can be fun but I would classify Ave Seoul within a superior category.

Their dishes taste freshness and their meals feel like home cooking. I never ordered a mealthat came out too oily or overcooked. I've had their bulgogi bibimbap (served in a hot stone) and let me tell ya.. It is on point son! It does remind me of my trip when I visited Korea.

Located near in between Station Côte-Vertu and Du Collège, if you're using public transportation, you'll have no issues getting there. By car, finding a parking spots could be tricky on Decarie, anyhow.. I'm sure you'll find your way :)

Definitely recommended! Delicious Korean comfort food :)"}
{"text":"A friend and I shared 2 dishes that were indicated they could be shared for 2. 

The first one was a roasted pork dish you can put into a lettuce leaf with all the complimentary side sauces and kim-shi ingredients to make yourself a tasty sandwich. I really enjoyed the the taste but I'll be honest... this plate is REALLY not meant to be shared for two! We received about a dozen small pork pieces and 5 lettuce leaves (yo, that's not an even number!!!). The lettuce leaves that were originally provided were tiny and the extra ones we asked were far bigger. I wished I had those instead as it would have made eating the meal far less messier! This plate more gastronomic than it needed to be and I felt it had low value for the price that was asked. (2/5)

The second shared plate with a huge beef and mushroom soup in a hot bowl. This soup was so delicious! With the small bowl that was provided, I got 4 servings of that decadent soup. I would definitely have this again! (5/5)

Service left to be desired. Describing the menu items to us was a chore that we just left it be. The follow-up was difficult and as per my friend, it seemed like our hostess was far more interested being on the phone than providing service to her patrons. The tea when asked came in a cup but we needed to ask specifically for more tea when it ran out. This was a first for me after many Asian themed dining experiences. Same issue sprung up with asking for more lettuce as it took way too long to be served (hint, if it takes you 15+ minutes to cut some lettuce leaves.... there's a problem!).

In conclusion, value left to be desired. I paid $30 for 2 shared plates + tip. When hitting this price-range you fall in another tier of expectations from me. All in all, Ave Seoul was kind of a mixed bag for me and I'm unsure I'd be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place!
They opened last year and we've been going there regularly for lunch ever since. 
The owner's Korean and it is definitely authentic Korean food. 
Everything on the regular menu is just super yummy but beware, the lunch \"box\" is not at all authentic Korean and it's actually pretty bad compared to the rest of the amazing menu but I guess it works for some people as most of my colleages get it when we go there.
Service is great but it can be a bit slow.
Decor is nice and the whole place is completely renovated."}
{"text":"It was OK. I'm rating it so I can remember I've tried this place. Just too lazy to write more..."}
{"text":"The food is actually good, but service is very slow. We waited for more than 20minutes to get our food."}
{"text":"Food is very good quality for price. The only problem is the staff barely understands english or french. The best thing to do is eat at the restaurant and point at the menu to indicate your order. DO NOT call in for any reason they cannot understand you. I've been there quite often and there's always a language barrier. However, the food and environment makes up for the lack of understanding. The food will win you over regardless of how annoying it may be to order or even make reservations."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant last night for a night out with my Hubby !
Was looking for a family restaurant where you can really feel a Korean atmosphere and we found it ! I tried the Bulgogi Dot Sol Bimbimbap and wow the rice was krispy and the vegetable were fresh ! Plus they even put the tv a little louder so I could listen to Kpop while eating ! I'm huge kdrama & kpop fan and I had a really great time and will go again for sure !"}
{"text":"The taste of the meals we ordered we very similar, they all had this sesame flavour. Though the beef and the topokki were amazing!"}
{"text":"Quick service. Average price and portion size. Very tasty food. Nice restaurant ambiance. My go-to Korean place in Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"Seafood pancake not crispy and seems reheated. Bibimbap bulgogi is delicious, get it with the egg! Pork katsu is tasty but super greasy. Glass noodles with veggies is decent. Service is.... Sssllllooooow. Water and juice came after the waiter finished cleaning all the empty tables.... All in all, a bit disappointed when comparing to shabushabu but I'd come back for bibimbap if I wanted to stick to vsl."}
{"text":"What does the interior look like? Imagine a restaurant setup inside a K-pop music video. It's young and modern. In fact, you can witness that essence displayed on the TV screen. 

Onto the food, the soup broth of this place is amazing! One of the big dissapointment in the culinary world is a bland broth but Ave. Seoul won't let you down on that. My gam ja tang (pork bone soup) was packed with rich flavors and the broth was milky looking. I'm drooling right now. 

On the other side, I wasn't a huge fan of their bibimbap. I found the dish to be lacking complexity. But the problem is that I've actually never enjoyed bibimbap in general. Either it's just me or that I don't like the dish. 

But overall, Ave. Seoul has good food and I'm really glad that a Korean restaurant opened in the Saint-Laurent area because it's one of the things that was missing."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try. We both had soups and they arrived boiling hot! I found mine a bit salty, but the taste was good! The only thing I would say isn't so great,  is their service. It's a bit too slow and the food took about 30 minutes to arrive to our table. The staff is friendly though! Would recommend.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!!! Looks like nothing from the outside, but there is a hard working Korean family preparing extremely yummy dishes in there! Very authentic tasting! There is the option of korean BBQ with a grill directly on the table or à la carte menu.  Do try their spicy tofu soup, the tofu is so smooth and silky, it just glides on your tongue.  Their combo of hot stone bowl is also an awesome deal.  For less than 30$, you get to choose your hot stone rice along with a soup noodles and a salad.  And do remember to leave the bottom of the hot stone rice until the end of the meal without touching it.  You will be gladly rewarded with a crunch crust of caramelized rice. Yummmmmm! What are you waiting for? Go try it out!"}
