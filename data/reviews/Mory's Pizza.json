{"text":"Best Pizza in Verdun!! Get the sesame seed crust...
I wouldn't go there to eat a few slices though.. we went once and it was not fresh."}
{"text":"LOVE the sesame seeds crust, just the right texture and crispyness, though I suspect its made with shortening. The sauce is good, avery honest marinara and the price is quite all right. My only hick-up would be the quality of the cheese. There is a weird, sort of non-dairy after-taste to it (you'll see what I mean if you order the regular, just cheese and sauce version)

 other than that, seriously, in Verdun its pretty much the best."}
{"text":"Great pizza with real ingredients, not soggy at all and fantastic prices! Two for one pizzas and drinks, its fantastic. Delivery is fast and the staff is extremely friendly. 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken wings for pickup. The price was $4 more than the price on their menu. They refused to honor the menu price even though I had just gotten it the day before in my mailbox. The woman behind the counter was really rude and irate about it too like I had done something wrong. She obviously didn't want to be there. Not going back. If I want abuse like that I can get it from my wife."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not gonna go overboard and say that it is some of the best pizza I have ever had...C'mon I live in Montreal. But, that being said, it is some tasty pizza. They are well priced and the pizza is far from being bad; In fact, ask for sesame seeds on the crust and you will be pleasantly surprised. Definitely, a fair pizza for a fair price!"}
{"text":"Pizza- it's good but not amazing, the seeds on the crust is what makes it better then other 2 for 1 places you don't have to have sesame seeds but it is a lot better.

I haven't explored the menu to much over here.

I ordered a fries with sauce and they put it on top of it which is stupid I would of ordered a poutine if I wanted fries with sauce."}
{"text":"This place was great until that ignorant French bitch hung up on my face 


New flash ...they are garbage"}
{"text":"J'adore cette pizzeria pour ses prix et leur pizza. Par contre, plus le temps passe, plus c'est dispendieux et que les portions diminues. Pour le genre de place, je ne comprends pas étant donné qu'il y a quand même une grande clientèle. Mais bon.. Y'a juste côté salubrité qui me dérange un peu. Les toilettes, les livreurs dans les cuisines sans filets et la fille du service qui a chaud et qui va chercher la pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and excellent service - can't complain. It is what it is, a fast food joint. It's not the best pizza in the world, but it's a good value and definitely the best option in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever eaten, in Verdun no less! The poppyseed crust is totally inspired. I highly recommend Mory's special - loaded with all sorts of great meats and veggies. Pretty reasonably priced (by Montréal standards, anyway) and the pizzas are cooked to order very quickly."}
