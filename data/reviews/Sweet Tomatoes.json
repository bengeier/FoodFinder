{"text":"A great place to take your family for a healthier meal.  Lots of fresh salads, soups, breads, and muffins.   Something for everybody.   Our finicky kids really enjoyed this restaurant and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant with such KIND people! The woman stocking the salad bar was so friendly when we walked in, the woman at the register helped talk us through everything with a smile, and the guy walking around giving out cookies is making sure everyone is happy. Wow!"}
{"text":"An update as I have visited Sweet Tomatoes quite often in the last couple of months.  It's mostly some little gripes that I have and I need to vent. Sweet Tomatoes seems to have an obsession with Asiago cheese. They have 3 types of focaccia  bread, all of them with Asiago Their 2 main salads have Asiago cheese.  Seriously?   I personally don't like Asiago and would like to see some more variety or at least use a more universally accepted cheese (mozzarella would be nice). Or at least don't mix it everywhere!  Then another staple salad they have, Won Ton Chicken barely has any chicken! Why not call it Won Ton salad?  And what about the desserts? The warm apple cobbler tastes like a homemade one, with large chunks of fresh apple and pleasantly sweet, but not overly so, syrup.   Sweet potatoes with maple butter are amazing, definitely try these.  The brownie muffins and fudge brownie are not always sweet (sometimes they're just right, others time they have a dark chocolate taste but the fudge brownie really lacks the \"fudge\", it tastes \"watered down\" somehow).  Banana bread muffins are nice and soft with a pleasant taste of banana (no banana chunks) as are the apple cinnamon muffins.  The sugar free chocolate mousse is amazing as always, light and fluffy.   The soft serve ice cream is actually yogurt and you can't really tell the difference. There's a choice of toppings like chocolate and caramel syrup, chocolate sprinkles, nuts and cookie crumbles. The cookie crumbles are relatively dry and hard, they're not \"cookie dough\" chunks you're used to seeing in ice cream.  Overall good for a salad buffet with healthy dessert alternatives.  Keep in mind that Sweet Tomatoes (slighly) change their menu every 2 weeks(ish) so some items may be missing while others are always there."}
{"text":"Who can beat healthy? Full salad bar , baked potatoes, four or five choices of soups, pastas, corn bread, muffins and all that.....Its a place to go when you are hungry but cant afford to overload on fat calories. Just go easy on the dressing ...& the pastas... & the bread & the potatoes & the soups & ... looks like the entire selection. Oh what the heck, just go enjoy a nice Salad Bar at least you'll be fibre-up. Two thumbs up on this one!"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes! I can pig out on lots of good stuff here, and with the ClubVeg coupons its very affordable."}
{"text":"I come here very often, and I always leaved pleased. I enjoy their selection of soups and salads, and they have had great customer service on every occasion I can remember. The workers usually seem friendly and are very helpful.   The only downfall is that sometimes young children in the restaurant are loud. I just try to pick a table away from kids and that usually seems to help the noise level."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch once or twice a week, and the experience is consistently satisfactory.  All you can eat salad, soup and desserts for a little under ten bucks, seems fair to me. The soups and desserts are forgettable, but the salad ingredients are always fresh (and that's the main reason I go in the first place).  The place is seat-yourself... most of the time. Sometimes they get lunch rush'd, but they do the best job they can in these situations to get everyone into seats as quickly as possible --even at its busiest, I've rarely waited longer than a few seconds for them to find me a seat."}
{"text":"Delicious strawberry lemonade, it bursts with flavor without overpowering sweetness. The Arnold Palmer is really refreshing, I enjoy the subtly of the tea. Lastly, the berry drink is the only one that is unsweetened but it's real fresh."}
{"text":"Best Sweet Tomato I've ever been to!  I love the lay-out of the place; very different from the other ones I've been to.  Very clean as well.  The people who work there were all very nice and helpful.  The specials of the month were fantastic, as usual.  The tomato soup was out-standing and I had multiple bowls of that.  I highly recommend this place as it has something for everybody, so everybody in your family will be happy!"}
{"text":"We come here once in awhile and are not disappointed. The food is fresh and the folks seem to be around for a long time so it might be an ok place to work.  Love mushroom Monday."}
{"text":"Went Here just the other night and haven't been here in awhile . Came only an hour before close and the food was still fresh and amazing . Til the time they open til the last hour of close their food continues to be fresh and amazing . Great salad bar, very clean, very nice and welcoming service . Had a great dinner and really enjoy going here. Be back soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is not bad, for my first time I enjoyed it. It is basically a good place for lunch probably wouldn't recommend dinner. The salads are good and the rest of the food is good too. Also, if you're not a big eater then it would be a great place for you, majority of it is small portion. Overall, not a bad place I liked it."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Friendly staff. The only complaint i have is they had Mac n cheese for one of thier 8 soups that they promote. Mac n cheese is not a soup.  The other soups were mostly broth so sn additional soup would have been nice."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner. Lots of salad choices and soups. Everything fresh and delicious. Good customer service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"CLOSED for good.  Lost their lease, building to be torn down. Closed, closed, Closed, closed, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes, clothes.!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating, if you sign up to their coupons, you save alot!! Clean environment,  Pleasant staff, sometimes it does  get packed but never too crazy..food is great too!"}
{"text":"Probably go to this location, or the one at Arrowhead, once a month.  Very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit.  They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Sweet Tomatoes and I am now officially a fan! The food was good, the service was friendly and quick, and it was a very clean environment. I tried the Caesar salad, the orzo salad, some of the pastas and the chili. Oh and some bread too! Everything was tasty and my lemonade was excellent! I'll definitely be returning with my family!"}
{"text":"Best. Mushroom soup. Ever.  They serve this the first week of the month.  We go for the cream of mushroom soup and also enjoy the salad bar. Delicious ranch dressing as well. I miss the days when fresh chocolate chip cookies were brought around the dining area though :("}
{"text":"We dropped by for dinner around 5 pm and were very disappointed in this buffet. Our first impression as we walked in the front door was a display of soggy dressed salads, some of which were half empty. There seemed to be quite a few ingredients to put together your own salad along the line so we did this.  There was only one cashier for two lines of traffic so a little congestion there.  After we put together our salads we were eager to see what else was offered. There were several soups, however we had to try 3 to find one that was just okay. The tomato based soups were too acidic for our liking and the chicken soup was overpowered with thyme. We did like the pea soup , which was one of the few items in the buffet that had any noticeable meat in it.  The rest of the buffet were a bunch of carbs....muffins, corn bread, pizza with a tiny bit of cheese on top, macaroni and cheese, pasta with acidic tomato sauce........Just what i consider cheap fillers with no real nutritional value.  Soft ice cream was the basic desert...no fresh fruit offered except whole apples and a few unappetizing things such as jello.  I would really not recommend this buffet to anyone other than vegetarians."}
{"text":"If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in the past you already know what to expect because every city has a place like it.  Grab a tray, grab a plate, walk down a line just like the one they had at my elementary school and load up with lettuce, spinach, cold pastas, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc.  Have a seat and congratulate yourself for eating healthy (ignore the 3 cups of Thousand Island dressing you also got).  Then, I guess as a reward for healthy eating, you grab a bowl of soup to up your sodium intake for the day. Then you grab a few slices (more like 3x2\" pieces) of pizza, some muffins and devour your second course.  Still feeling good about your healthy eating choices you grab a bowl, put a brownie on the bottom and cover it with ice cream, add some sprinkles and you're golden!  Don't get me wrong. I'm OK with all of the above. My kids love this place and, since they both have hollow legs, it's an economical choice and it must be healthier than McDonalds."}
{"text":"I dont understand all the positive reviews for this place. first of all it's overpriced $10 to get in $2 a piece for drinks. And then you have to pay extra to get meat on your salad dont understand that at all. The food is okay nothing special. But makes no sense to go here when there's better salad bars in the area like Jason's Deli and the Sunset Station buffet."}
{"text":"I use to work at Sweet Tomatoes , and Let me tell you guys something , we wash our spinach , lettuce etc and we are very clean with our foods ,everything is freshly baked . Very healthy as well . I love sweet tomatoes I don't work there anymore but the workers are amazing and the food is delightful"}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes is a great place to go for a salad buffet with a large selection of salads, fixings, hot and cold items, and desserts.  The selection, quality, and freshness of the food was very good, especially for the price.  While it is somewhat similar to Souper Salad nearby, it has a much broader selection and seems to have slightly fresher ingredients.  Sweet Tomatoes also costs a little more that Souper Salad, but it's worth the extra couple of dollars."}
{"text":"Great salad buffet! The blueberry muffins are always good and hot! Too expensive for just salad though. Awesome service! Warm cookies are a nice touch."}
{"text":"This location has very nice staff! They did get rid of some ingredients since the last time that I was in but the food was great. Many places have terrible restrooms but they're bathroom is very clean and kept up."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday dinner. The salad bar was fully stocked and fresh, there wasn't much of a line, so we were able to quickly get our food. The soup was alright - we learned to get just a small amount for a taste test first, as a few of the soups were quite salty or the flavor was off, but most of the soup options were fine. The staff was helpful, and restrooms were clean. Overall an alright place to go for healthy options."}
{"text":"food is still good, but the set up is ridiculous, yeah put the soda and ice cream right next to where the soups and pasta are to cause a huge log jam of people. Also had a hair in my salad, not cool."}
{"text":"Ten 10 Stars!!! LOVE IT! How Much I Miss It!:(  If Your In the Tempe Area You Must Go!!! Great Delicious & Healthy Food!;)  Can Wait To Go Back!..."}
{"text":"This place is always busy and they still have awesome service and endless food plus one of only few places that had caffeine free diet coke on tap! !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, good food that can accommodate many different dietary needs.  Good place for small children as there are a lot of finger foods (beans, peas, corn, noodles, etc.). The salad bar area is pretty clean.  They have a harder time keeping up with the bathrooms on weekends because they are packed.  Tables are cleaned fairly quickly to keep people moving through.  We are regulars and like almost everything we try there."}
{"text":"Not a lot to choose from but many toppings for your salad. The pizza wasn't that good and they didn't have my favorite soup (broccoli cheddar) but it's all you can eat so I can't complain too much I guess."}
{"text":"I love their salads, especially the wonton asian salad. The bar holds a lot of items and you can make practically any salad you want with it.   Their turkey chili soup was the best one I sampled while I was there. The potato creamy soup did not have enough flavor, did not have a chance to try the cauliflower and cheese.   Their ice cream is surprisingly thick. Usually, soft serve machines produce watered down ice creams that melt within seconds. Not here. The lemon lava cake is delicious. I was a bit disappointed by the blueberry muffins, maybe it was because the one I got was a bit on the burnt side and was not moist enough.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite family place to go out to dinner! The people are so kind, even making my son a special \"face\" dessert! Feel good about eating out!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to one of these since I lived in Tucson over a decade ago. I loved it then, I love it now. The salad bar is always well stocked, they offer a rotating menu of ethnic salads and sides, best of all there's more than just salad!  They lure you in with the salad and then get you with the soup, bread, pasta, cookies...OMG the AYCE healthy salad now turns into my need to fill up on all the carbs I was trying to avoid by coming here in the first place!   I don't regularly patron buffet restaurants, but when I do I go to Sweet Tomatoes! Come hungry my friends!"}
{"text":"Seriously, who does not like Sweet Tomatoes! This one is a bit smaller compared to the other ones that I have been to, but the food is all the same! I love the soup but the vegetable soup seemed a little watery today. Maybe it was just my unforgiving attitude! I love Sweet Tomatoes, my family loves Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"This is the only  ST I've ever been to that had Jasmine Rice available for your buffet consumption!  White Rice? OMFGWTFBBQ ORGASM!  Other than that, it's a ST; Typical over-priced salad bar bullshit."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I'm much of a healthy eater but coming here makes me want to change my mind. I love the staff here they're always friendly and the food is great for the price. See you next time!"}
{"text":"Print out he the coupons they send via email or else this place is not worth it. Salads, blueberry muffin and ice cream are standouts. Pizza, cornbread, brownies and pastas are just okay.   And mom's please don't let your kids run around like it's a McDonald's play pen."}
{"text":"I think the whole idea of this place is to serve fresh salad an soups which is not bad. If you are going here don't expect to have anything else. But I have been there twice in last month for fresh and light food and both of a the times I didn't feel the freshness of there food. Lettuce wasnt really fresh soups were not fresh as well. Don't think will be back for more."}
{"text":"I have been to better Sweet Tomatoes. The service was in a bad mood and the food seemed as if it was sitting all day.   Not going to this one again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Lettuce had some ice in it.  Nobody spoke to us except to collect money. Very clean place. Enjoyed the chili and potatoes."}
{"text":"It makes me happy when I eat here. They have the best tasting soup in a buffet. I love their muffins and cookies. They have much better quality than other Souper Salad."}
{"text":"They just switched to ceramic plates/soup bowls and glass beverage containers. These improvement definitely merits a 5 star rating, as the freshness of the ingredients comes through better than ever.. Consistently fresh Coca Cola as well"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. Everything was messy and unclean, there was very little options for pasta. Service was poor to moderate with the employees seemingly more interested in their conversations with each other than waiting on anyone."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a three and not a two is because no matter who you bring to this place (Veg-head, Health-nut, or even fast foodies, etc.), they will be satisfied by the selection.  But it never fails that there about a billion kids there and it's such a cafeteria setting that it makes me feel like I'm eating at a hospital.  The last time I went there was an evil little kid sitting behind me in the next booth that would not quit kicking me.  Word to the wise...DO NOT SEAT PEOPLE WITHOUT KIDS NEXT TO KIDS!!!!!  SERIOUSLY!  It ruins a dinning experience even if you are used to them (even if you have them!  If you left them at home there is probably a reason!).  This has always been my biggest pet peeve.  We finally got babies out of movie theaters now we need to work on family seating!  Not that it matters much in this place, because sound carries so well that it should be an auditorium, not a restaurant.  The food, I've never been able to complain about, though you may have to wait if it's a popular menu item, cooks can only go so fast and it's literally a free-for-all some days.  So, my vote is if you have a picky eater, go here, if you have a snobby eater, avoid!"}
{"text":"Did they have tomatoes? Yes. Were they sweet? Sure.   Variety has fallen in this location. They didn't have chicken for my salad which was disappointing. Other than that it was pretty tasty.   Tip: use their brownie muffins as ice cream toppings"}
{"text":"This is a healthy place to be ... Salad and pasta galore and many more! First time my parents introduced me to this place i just had to go there weekly ... call me a fatty but i would have two plates at a time ... I even go for seconds ... filling my plate up with potato salad caesar salad and another one but i forgot the name. Its like an asian style like salad with fried wonton and almond nuts i think.   Place wise is clean. The staff seems very welcoming. One thing I don't like is the water ... its like water from a faucet. Not that i've tasted. Just the way it looks. Other than that. Healthiest restaurants I'd rate numero uno!"}
{"text":"epic fail!!!! stay home and make tour own.....dead on the holiday.....filrhy......food cold & unstocked"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Noodle Soup and Asian Chicken Salad are my ultimate comfort food!   Have to say this location is one of the preferred ones now that Tempe location has changed into \"Field Kitchen.\"   They pay close attention to their soup quality, and salad was great!  Will return soon!!"}
{"text":"The food and service is horrible. To start none of it tasted fresh. The lettuce on almost all of the salads was totally not fresh, some even withered or whatever it's called.  Compared to the sweet tomatoes that used to be on Camelback this one had tasteless, stale food.    Now on to the worst part..it was nasty. Food on floors, they hadn't wiped counters down, and slow to remove our used trays. It was just a bad experience. We will not be coming back. Whoever was managing the one on Camelback, I don't know why you closed but please help. All these other sweet tomatoes suck!!"}
{"text":"This is great place to have a healthy meal for a decent price. Salad fixins are all super fresh, and there are so many to choose from. The soups that I tried, the chicken noodle and creamy tomato, were as good as any homemade soup I've had. This really is more like 3.5 stars for me, but I give it the bump for the soft-serve ice cream machine -- not to mention the warm snicker-doodle cookies they brought to our table."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. There are a lot of toppings for your salad and you can build a pretty good salad. The premium toppings aren't really all that premium though and cost a decent amount more. There is a decent selection of soups, but they only usually have a few other hot items. The whole point is the salad though and it's really good."}
{"text":"This place has decent device. Very responsive customer service. Very good soup & food to support my vegan lifestyle.. Love love that they have a section for me to enjoy my dining on the balcony out in the open air away from the crowd :-)"}
{"text":"It happens everytime I'm away from home for a long time...lots of meat, not much veg.  So I went in search of a place I can OD on veg...enter Sweet Tomatoes.    I REALLY liked this place.  It reminded me of \"Lettuce Surprise You\", a salad buffet place I went to in Atlanta many years ago.    When the check-out lady found that this was my first time to eat there, she gave me a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free.  Now who wouldn't love such a place!  :-)    I only went for salad, soup, and ice cream and all was good.  This place is definitely one where you eat piles of green  which is essential after too much meat and heavy cream."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome salad bar, a great selection of soups, and lots of hot food choices. My favorites are the sweet potatoes and corn bread. The food here is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not my first choice of restaurants. If you're in the mood for buffet-style salad, vegetables, and soup then come here. But this is not a place you come to if you're wanting meat. FYI: Lunch buffet is about $7 without a drink."}
{"text":"I really like Sweet Tomatoes but today my sister and I stopped in for lunch. I don't know if they recently raised their prices but $12.00 seems a little excessive for lunch. Honestly, isn't  that what dinner used to cost here? Okay enough about the price.   The salad toppings were all delicious and after having a little soup we were all pumped to have the cranberry / apply crisp! Mmmm  We scoured the dessert bar only to find jello, pudding, cottage cheese and a broken ice cream machine. You know when you've built up the moment in your head of delicious crisp apples with tart cranberries covered in a warm oatmeal crisp and then suddenly the vision is blurry? My heart literally sank! No one ever wants to settle but today I settled...I settled for the chocolate pudding. :("}
{"text":"A good option if you're looking to go healthier than the usual mall food.  Basically, a super salad bar with a nice selection of soups.  My favorite is the chilli.  Stay away from the pasta bar though.  The mac & cheese wasn't as good as the stuff in the blue box."}
{"text":"We just left. I usually have great experiences eating at the location in Temecula, CA. This NV, rainbow location with 2 stars because we were never greated by manager or cashier as we paid with our prepaid vouchers. The cashier never gave us a receipt and noticed in the screen inputting 1 guest while we had 3 in our party. Is that the reason we never got our receipt because she may have kept the other two vouchers. While on vacation i chose to eat at this location because it was new. For some reason the food was not as tasty as usual ; (. On a thankful note, our tables were cleared of our dirty dishes."}
{"text":"Nice affordable place to eat.  Love salad and soup selection.  Wide variety of breads to compliment the soup and salad.  Narrow selection of desserts is just the perfect topper for the meal."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the cashier and waiters as tonight. The cashier made assumptions as to which coupon I wanted to use. I showed her the 2 for $19.99 and she took it upon herself to charge me an adult meal for my child and added a drink. I caught the meal but not the drink. I paid for a drink that I didn't want. Our waitress never even bothered saying hello she would just take the empty plates. My waitresses have always said hello and asked if we needed anything. Very disappointed that it was as though I wasn't even there."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed:  no more ham or chicken or parmesan on salad line, sour dough bread is not fresh baked but warmed up,  Golden Coral is a much better value."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is our favorite! This one is clean, the food is fresh and delicious! The made-from-scratch soups are wonderful. If you still have room after the well-stocked salad bar, add some breads or a baked sweet or regular potato. Be sure to save room for dessert! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Forced to go with co-workers for a celebratory lunch here last week.  NEVER AGAIN.    Salad bar was just OK - wilted lettuce but hey, its hot outside.  As usual, the only VEGAN food item was the vegetable soup (watery, tasteless, blech).  Nothing else was vegan (except for the strawberry salad, but I'm allergice to strawberries, so that's out).  Vegetarian yes, but not vegan.  Big difference.    Sorry, I am NOT going to spend all that money just for a salad bar with a side of water with veggies in it."}
{"text":"We used to love eating here. Today was not one of those days. We should have known better when we had to dig through a big stack of plates and trays to find any even relatively clean to start with. We started loading our plates, and as we were pushing through the line, my salad started waving! There was a large, LIVE green worm waving around on the broccoli. Not very appetizing, to say the least! The staff was nice about it, though. They gave us free beverages today, and 2 free meal passes for a future visit. (There were 3 of us in the party.) Then we got to the table and realized the drink glasses had sticky finger prints and smears/lip prints all over them! After getting new glasses, it was off to the soda machine. Unfortunately, it broke after dispensing 2 cups of soda. The staff tried but failed to fix the machine. They said they would have to call Coke out. Since they only have one machine, the only other drinks available were water and weak, lukewarm tea. Good thing our drinks were free! I feel sorry for the other diners who actually had to pay for that! We tried to blow it off and eat what we could, and to be fair, what we did eat was pretty good. However, to add insult to injury, when I finally put my fork down at the end of the meal, I realized it was still crusted with someone else's dried crusty food. UGH. That was just too much. This place has just gotten too dirty. I don't think we will be using those two free passes."}
{"text":"Came into this Sweet Tomatoes for the first time yesterday. Its a very clean restaraunt. The soup and salad where really good. The pizza bread was not very fresh. :Other than that would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Well, i used to really like this restaurant.  I hadn't been there for several months when my husband and I decided to go for lunch on 8/11/2016.  Everything tasted bland.  Really bland.  I assumed it was just me.  Maybe my taste buds took a vacation?    I decided not to say anything.  But then my husband made the comment that it all tasted so different than the last time we were there.  He said it all tasted SO BLAND!  I am going to assume it was really bland.  We couldn't both be suffering the same hallucination."}
{"text":"i love sweet tomatoes because i love buffet, and i don't feel too guilty eating at this one. in fact, i'd imagine heaven to be a huge buffet, where you never get full and you never get fat. so it was super packed when we went. sunday afternoon, where hoards of these wholesome (read \"fat\") all-American (read \"white\") families go after church. i like the looks i get from them like \"why isn't he clearing my table? doesn't he see this stack of empty plates?\" and \"are workers allowed to eat at the tables amongst the customers?\" but i guess the bigotry of fellow customers cannot be blamed  on the business. anyway, they used to have this pre-made salad with spinach, bacon bits, and onions that was my absolute favorite. this recent time, it was replaced by rabbit feed, so i had to attempt to make the spinach salad myself. which kind of sucks, because there's really nothing i hate more than doing things myself. but all in all, i like eating fresh veggies and their chicken noodle soup (minus the noodles and the soup), and that is why i like sweet tomatoes."}
{"text":"They got rid of the amazing Coke Freestyle machine in favor of dumb Pepsi. Gross. Place was empty too. People are mad."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, and overall, I have had good experiences.  I am a huge fan of their specialty salad, Wonton Chicken Happiness.  I also love their Big Chunk Chicken Noodle Soup (although today it was a little bland). I have found that their selection of both salad greens and toppings as well as pastas, soups, and baked goods are \"souperior\" to other similar establishments like Souper Salad. Sweet Tomatoes is a little more spendy, but I think this is a good example of when you get what you pay for. I initially gave them 4 stars, but took off a star for an experience I had with a group (6 people) where we felt very rushed, and the staff was rude."}
{"text":"My mom and i love this place, is light, healthy and you get full. The people who work there was with smile and ready to help. The prices are a little high but if you are member of The club veg you always have coupons in your email.  And the great thing, I don't have to print them, just I show them in my phone. I love the couscous, I wish they always have it.  If you want to try something crazy, make yourself a strawberry shake with their strawberry lemonade and vanilla yogurt."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is my favorite quick and healthy choice for an anytime meal. I especially enjoy it after a good work out! The vegetables are always fresh and well stocked.   The chicken noodle soup is the best with large pieces of chicken that you can use to enhance your salad without having to pay extra for chicken they sell in small containers at the counter.   Join Club Veg to get coupons to use and save even more money off their already very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Self serve.  You come in straight to the salad bar.  They have 2-4 pre-mixed salads.  I've always liked their Chinese chicken salad, their Caesar is too lemony for my taste.  They do have a strawberry candied walnut salad for summer.  Or you can make your own with the array of items you can pile on your choice of lettuce or spinach.  Then mosey on to the back where you'll dead end with a row of different kettled soups, pasta & breads.  They don't have much of a desert selection, but I'm usually stuffed after my 3rd visit with the chicken soup kettle & corn bread tray.  Still a good value for under $12/pp"}
{"text":"Not good. There are no meats for the salad on the salad bar.. There are very few options and the atmosphere isn't very welcoming. As well as the restrooms were very dim lit. Just not good and you'd think desert would be better, just no. Save your money."}
{"text":"It seems this replace suffers from inconsistently. One time you go in and it's good and the next time it's garbage. Tonight, the place wasn't too busy yet the food was atroshish. No silverware and employees spending way too much time socializing with each other than the reason they were there. No plates and the food was just thrown out there. I won't be back"}
{"text":"It's vegetarian and you will get a lot of thing with a good price. I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I remember when Sweet Tomatoes was the big new lunch place, and now I feel old. I feel even older when I realize that I used to come here thinking I would eat a huge salad and then I'd eat a plate of blueberry muffins. And corn muffins. And all the other muffins. I've had a few of their soups that I've enjoyed, mostly the veggie options. The last time I was here for lunch the salad mix itself tasted bitter to me, I'm not sure if it was just the combination of things or what, but I was glad I'd put a few muffins on the side of my plate."}
{"text":"Food is passable when you can get it, but items shown online are frequently unavailable. The employees don't speak enough English to say if or when they will ever be available and do not hide their annoyance that you asked. The used plate gatherers are aggressive and won't leave diners alone. One gorda laughed rudely when we asked her to leave us alone"}
{"text":"Basic good fresh food. Our go to place when undecided. Have been multiple times it's steady busy but tables are always cleared and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have a hard time paying ten bucks for a salad, especially when I have to make it myself. But as far as salad bars go, Sweet Tomatoes is pretty good. The vegetables seem fresh and there is a variety to choose from. More importantly, they also have an ice cream machine and cookies. If you are looking for a quick bite in the Henderson area, the Sweet Tomates is your spot!"}
{"text":"We come here at least three times a month. We love it! The salad bar is always fresh and well stocked. The soups are delicious! They have breads and pastas and ice cream too. All delicious! It's a great healthy alternative to other buffets. Not as much stuff but enough to satisfy. My only complaint is that the drink machine is in a horrible area. People standing there waiting are blocking the main isles. Other than that it's perfect."}
{"text":"I'm extremely selective on the buffets I will go to. This place was bad the food was bland and just did not taste good at all. There was one thing that I eat that I thought was good it was a turkey stuffing soup. But for close to 25$ the food should of been better. I gave it an extra star because my wife does enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"I've liked Sweet Tomatoe but this has to be the worse one I've ever been in, it looked dirty.  Some of the items weren't labled well the Balsomic dressing tasted like it had been thined out with regular vinagar.  The small drinks were over priced it should be lable with two $$ instead of one.  Employees were BSing in spanish loudly (I underdtand Spanish). The soup bar was messy.  Too bad most Sweet Tomatoe places I'd rate higher, but no way here......"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't feel the need to write this review in as much as I used to love this place. But things have changed; the quality of thier soups and \"pizza\" (bread really) has dropped considerably, and the last time I went there I got food poisoning. The salads are still good (or this review would be a one star), and the staff is still friendly, but the muffins are hit are miss and honestly, the soups taste like they came out of a can (or worse)."}
{"text":"This place is one of the staple restaurants for my  wife and I. We love it! They make a Cream of Mushroom soup that I'll stand in line for. I've seen one couple get six bowls of it at once just so they don't miss out. It's also a great place for my family. We bring the kids along and they have the choice of a variety of different foods that none of them will turn their noses up at."}
{"text":"Came visit the town and this restaurant just next to the resort we stay.  Have been to so many Souplantation / Sweet  Tomatoe locations, this is the worst. Soups, salad and desserts option are basic not as many as other locations and the lighting is dim which bothers me. The restaurant is in an enclosed tin long building, the only glass you can see out or look in are the entrance and exit door. From outside we weren't even sure if this place is in business, maybe that's why this is also a sweet tomatoe that I see no crowd."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews against this Sweet Tomatoes. In fact, it's one of the best ones I've been to.   I love the redesign. True, most Sweet Tomatoes restaurants have a sort of \"home\" like atmosphere, but this also comes at the cost of being tacky and outdated. This one has a cool, contemporary, minimalistic sort of design that I really do enjoy. It certainly doesn't feel cheap, and I for one like that the trays are a lighter metal material than the typical heavy plastic trays. Other Sweet Tomatoes will use heavy trays so it feels like you have more food on your plate than you really do.   The soup bowls are a bit bigger so you get more soup each time you go up to serve yourself, and they also have fairly big plates for the bakery items like muffins and mac and cheese. Most Sweet Tomatoes restaurants give out TINY plates that barely fit 3 muffins on them. These plates could easily hold 8. The plates also work for the pasta; this location doesn't have those tiny oval shaped pasta trays either. Seriously, this location doesn't try to use psychological tricks to get one to take less food. You can get a bit more soup, have an almost regular sized plate (less going to the food area) all on nice looking white dishware.  They also have an updated soda machine with touchscreen that will dispense pretty much any soda (or powerade) flavor you can think of. This includes strawberry, grape, peach, and regular Sprite--in fact there are more Sprite flavors, but I just can't remember them. Also, there is more than one entrance to the food area and I think the Andrea reviewer was being a bit silly to try to squeeze through where the soda machine was as that isn't the only way to get to the food area!   Soup was utterly fantastic and had a lot of good flavor. My time-proven favorite, kettle chili, was scrumptious. The chicken and rice soup had a wonderful home-made flavor to it. The other soups were tasty as well.   The salad was just fine, and I must confess salad isn't what I primarily like about any Sweet Tomatoes restaurant as I'm not much of a salad fan anyway.   Also, it is true that this Sweet Tomatoes location doesn't have big tags indicating what each soup or salad menu item is, though the tags ARE THERE. I would almost guess that the reviewers who complained of the lack of tags just didn't look hard enough or forgot their glasses.   Honestly I think the people who have given harsh reviews are just incredibly picky. They take off 2-3 stars because there are no kidney beans (which I think they do have) in the salad line or because the ice cream which is already cheap and crappy to begin with tastes a bit watery? Silly.   Yes this location does serve alcohol, but they also serve odwalla drinks. And have a huge selection of soda.   This place is booming...seriously, most tables were full the night I went (Tuesday night) and doing well. Don't be scared by the negative reviews. Totally worth going to in it's current Sweet Tomatoes form unless something radical changes."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the quality of everything. Very fresh and very clean. The staff at the salad bar and register were so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love salad buffets but unfortunately there isn't very many to choose from. There used to be one across the street  called soup and salad and it was at least 4 bucks less. There is little to no protein on the salad bar portion of the buffet and the soup is mostly watered down or if it is a creamed soup there is a thick crusty layer on top so I try to pass that  up. I go just because I am too lazy to cut up my own veggies sometimes but it does make me miss or regret there isn't other choices. With the way this place is always so crowded and packed with people you would think  a competor would open up soon."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes is one of my 'work late and try to avoid eating garbage for dinner' gigs, and it's actually very good. The large variety of salad bar ingredients are kept very fresh as you would expect, the staff is very friendly, and the establishment is kept clean. They have a small but well done variety of soups and other hot items that are rotated once a month or so in accordance with the corporate food theme. Overall the price could be a little bit better but it's not unreasonable. Reader be warned that it can get overwhelmingly packed with people during prime time hours at lunch and dinner so try to hit it at off hours."}
{"text":"This location is very clean and always stocked.  It is also vegetarian friendly and I love that everything is labeled!!  Service is the best with very nice people working there and always have a smile.  It's a buffet so of course you can't customize.  But I go here every few months when I crave a really good salad because their salad bar has everything!"}
{"text":"Really love the salad here very fresh and the soup is excellent will definitely come back for more!!! My little ones enjoy the pizza breads and spaghetti and the ice cream!! Corn bread is a must try and also the muffins blue berry is the best one I think... hope this helps u guys thanks!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food and clean place to eat. Love the process in getting food. Love the buffet style."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service.  My family and I ate here every Sunday morning and never were disappointed.   They went out of their way to bring refills or fresh cookies by since we had two small children, and the salad bar was always clean and fresh.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and it took forever to get checked out because there was only 1 cashier   I felt sorry for him because he was servicing both sides and was swamped. When u got to him I said you need more help.  He said yes he did. We sat down and a young guy was walking around the restaurant just looking and chatting with the servers. I saw him few min later behind soup line just standing there hands folded. I asked him if he was the manager and he said yes. I mentioned the long lines and the cashier and he said he was short handed. I then said BUT YOUR JUST STANDING THERE and he just ignored my comment.   The place is great to eat at but the manager needs to go back to manager training.  A good manager should step in where needed and not walk around looking like a superior twit."}
{"text":"NASTY! Manager should be looking around at his dirty restaurant instead of making small talk with his employees. I've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes in such horrible condition. I hope we don't get sick from eating here tonight.  Atmosphere was aweful too. Industrial looking and unfinished looking. What's with the big screen TVs at some tables running sweet tomato ads the whole time?  I LOVE Sweet Tomatoes but I will be bookmarking this location as a Don't Ever Go There Again place!"}
{"text":"Food is good but for some reason the dishes are always dirty.  Must have some real ignorant people cleaning the dishes and the quality control by the management is poor."}
{"text":"I'd never been to this restaurant before and I really liked it. Huge salad bar, bakery items, soups and desert. The lunch special is only around 10 dollars. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Been an amazing experience here! I love this place, its so yummy. Good to take your kids too and has a wide variety of soup, salad, pasta and more."}
{"text":"Place is very fresh food and big selection of salads and about half dozen homemade soups.  Very friendly atmosphere and workers are always friendly. The only meat in the entire place is the chili but otherwise all vegetarian style fresh food. Price is very reasonable and you get coupons if you sign up on their website. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Not as good as I remember. My first bad experience. Food just wasn't up to par - prepared salads look like they were old or kept one too many nights in the bucket."}
{"text":"I don't live in Arizona, so it's always a treat for me to come here. I love the large salad bar that I can't find in my own Midwestern state, and I love the large windows that let in the wonderful sunlight. At the same time, I don't think I would like to come here all the time. Not all of Sweet Tomatoes' food is vegetarian, but it leans toward the low-fat, low-protein options. That's not a bad thing in an all-you-can-eat buffet, but I'm more accustomed to eating heavier food in smaller portions. So Sweet Tomatoes is a great change in pace for me, but I always get a sense of recreational eating when I come here, rather than a meal that is designed to satisfy my hunger for the next six hours or so. I particularly enjoyed using maple cream in place of butter on my bread on this visit. That was an unusual option and a nice touch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here tonight for dinner when we found out the store was unfortunately closed due to a pipe line that had broke on southern.  They were so pleasant and offered us cookies and the location to the nearest Sweet Tomatoes.  We will definitely be back to this location!!!  Thanks for the kindness!"}
{"text":"The food and customer service is great. The line starts with a different variety of salad.  The Margarita muffin is one of the best muffin I have tried so far. I would definitely recommend someone to try this for a change"}
{"text":"Heard Sweet Tomatoes was doing breakfast and had a coupon so grabbed a couple of colleagues and decided to give it a try earlier this month. Carb lovers rejoice - French toast, biscuits and gravy, outstanding gooey cinnamon rolls and waffles abound -- along with Sweet Tomatoes' standard fare.   There's even cereal!  If you are a healthy eater, many of the salad options are available during breakfast, but not many \"clean/healthy\" protein options. All of the egg options I saw were studded with sausage or cheese. Clever creations -- like a build your own breakfast burrito bar."}
{"text":"Ok, so usually I love this place but this time it was a little shady. I payed with a coupon for dribk and buffet but the glasses were FILTHY. It was so gross and I  had  to pay for a to go cup. So the food was good, but pasta looked a little old so I figured I would wait for a new pot but they didn't replace it until I was just about to leave. (Pasta was ok) So altogether I give them 3  stars."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to eat salad today so off I went to Sweet Tomatoes.  I've been to this location several times.  I must say the salad topping selection has always been plentiful and fresh with several dressing choices.  Im not a prepared salad gal, but there are many to choose from.  Today they had lemon pasta with capers...it was so good...I had to have a second helping.  Not a soup person in 100+ temps, but the bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup was a nice way to end a meal.  See you next time Sweet Tomatoes when I need a fresh green salad."}
{"text":"I went with my family and thought this would be a fun and healthy treat for dinner. I was wrong. We went in and saw a row of bowls filled with pre made salads as well as pickings for a make your own salad. The bowls of the already mixed salads looked as if they had been there a while so I chose the do it yourself option. We were charged $60 dollars after we got drinks! The other food options were cafeteria style and not what I would have expected for that price. The worst part about the whole thing was that after only a few hours after eating their I got terrible cramps and diarrhea for the rest of the night.   Don't go unless you have an iron stomach and some cash to throw away."}
{"text":"Breakfast not good . Been here plenty of times for lunch/dinner but I must say the breakfast is VERY disappointing.  Foods cold by the time you eat it & the over blown AC even cools your coffee more. The orange juice was good if you like it room temperature.  No sausage,bacon or other breakfast meats. Won't be back for breakfast"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would...food was cold, no seasoning or flavor at all.  My husband said the soup was good.  We tried lasagna, spaghetti, breads and desserts and they were all completely flavorless.  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"For food and the price are reasonable, but the dishes and the silverwares aren't that clean. Dishes came out wet and greasy.  The booths all need to clean up. If you want to go try the food bring your own disposable utensils /plates and asked to be seated on the table not booths"}
{"text":"Food...meatless buffet. Oh wait they have chicken in the chicken soup. The food is not good and it's not bad. There are more choices at the QT and believe it or not the QT has more flavor. The salad is quite good but they want to charge you more for meat, avocados, cookies.......???? What it's a buffet??? I hate this place on every level as I think they are cheap, money grubbing, corporate..... but give it two stars as the salad is good and the valley has limited choices for salad bars.  Ambiance.....it was clean and crowded. Very noisy, the high ceilings lead the way to this level of noise, a cacophony of sound, from screaming kids and crying babies unparalleled by any other restaurant. I came to the conclusion that they designed this restaurant with the intention of exponentially increasing the noise level to distract you from how bland the food is, how few choices there are, and how much money you have just wasted.  Staff...what staff??? Oh the people that come around once a millennium to clear your plates.  Verdict....unless you are a fan of salad and have a coupon from the sunday paper (that tells you more than anything about this restaurant) then run away. It's a complete waste of money and they try to upcharge you for too much."}
{"text":"Not worthy of soup or salad, for 11.95 I rather go to Five Guys, which is next door of this place. They have staff eating ice cream, while cooking the food. The food selection is limited, soup are salty for chili and chicken based soup, muffin taste like cement, and special lemonade is too thick. I have been to other location of sweet tomatoes, they have more selection than this place. They also have a teenager cooking the food. Nothing against him but doesn't know how to cook."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go since you have fresh salad, soup , pasta and deserts. Staff here is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"The service is always good and the food is fresh made while you wait. The value is great when you join \"Club Veg\". Would definitely recommend if you want a healthy meal for a great value!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have gone here several times in the evening when we want a simple, casual and easy meal and we don't have the time to cook or feel like it.   Getting coupons in the mail or through the Sweet Tomatoes club definitely makes coming here more attractive-buy 1 meal, get 1 free . Hard to beat a meal for two for around $10.   The food has always been fresh with a wide variety of options to place on your lettuce. There are usually about 5 choices of soup/chili.  The Chinese Chicken salad is always a good option.  I enjoy the blueberry muffins.  We went here the other night and were treated to a pretty good strawberry and apple cobbler. In the past, we went when the dessert was carrott cake and that was very good.  The self serve ice cream is always a nice touch or to use and make a root beer float.  This location is usually busy, the couple of times we've gone  but not too loud.  We've only gone on Sunday evening and mid week though."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this location. Let me start with the poor management here. It was a Saturday night during dinner time and they had 2 people working behind the hot counter which struggled mightily to get anything fresh or hot available. Waited almost a half hour for fresh biscuits to come out and even then they were over cooked. The manager at this time was too busy horsing around with the cashier and eating treats to offer a hand. I was appalled at how poorly run this place was. It all started with the manager and the rest of the staff took his complacency. And not sure what's with the presentation/set up but it's awful compared to others in the valley. Not appealing at all. Felt like a hospital cafeteria with troughs of soup blocking lanes."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving Sweet Tomatoes two stars is because of the salads and soups. I would go to one star if it was based on service and the other items they serve alone. The salad bar has a good selection of toppings and dressings. But they should get rid of the premium toppings. The items you get for another $2.50 and are just not worth it. I also do not see why we have to pay extra for drinks. With the cost of a beverage added it brings the cost above that of other buffets in town. Other pretty good buffets. If it weren't for the salad and soups I would not go at all. The soup is always pretty good and I just love the chili. It does not seem to be consistent, but always good.  This last visit the line we ware in was just stopped. We stood in line for over ten minutes while the other line was processed and seated. People that came in long after my wife and I were seated well before we were. It seems there was a large party at the front of our line and they had them stand there waiting to be seated. When we got to the front of the line we asked to talk to a manager and the lady behind the counter said she was one and how could she help. We explained what had happened and she said she could not do anything about it and we needed to speak to the people doing the seating. Excuse me! A manager has no control over how the staff is working? That does not seem right. Once we were seated we did talk to someone who was a manager and she was very thoughtful. She even gave us coupons for a free visit.  Another thing I do not understand is there fresh fruit bar. It consisted of whole apples, grapes and oranges. The other items were chocolate pudding, jello, and another pudding I could not identify. Fresh fruit? I don't think so."}
{"text":"My hubby & I used to be obsessed with Sweet Tomatoes. We would go like once a week, no joke. After a couple years we got so burnt out on it & didn't go for a while. I have been to this location several times for lunch with mainly my mom, but today I went with my husband. Parking can sometimes be a bitch, especially around noon. I don't know why but every time I am at the salad bar I smell B.O. even if there's no one by me! Maybe it's me, ha, but I think it's the building.   Any who, we love the caeser salad & I really like the tuna tarragon pasta salad. Their soups are pretty good but I am not a huge fan, hubby loves their chili. The steamed veggies are just ok but I always get them, the mac & cheese is kind of blah but I will get a lil bit sometimes. The focaccia breads are good & I love the blueberry muffins. The chocolate brownie muffins aren't good alone, but top one with vanilla fro yo & it's delish. Their cobblers are so good though, wish they had them out during lunch too since we haven't been for dinner in a long time!  Sign up for their \"Club Veg\" to receive coupons. I never go here without one & it makes it a pretty good deal when they have their buy 1 get 1 free coupons."}
{"text":"I went there today and the food was fine, but the service was horrible. I didn't know it was possible to have a bad experience at a Sweet Tomatoes...I mean, come on. I had paid for a fountain drink, but the man from the Coke company was there fixing the machine, so I wasn't able to have a drink through my whole meal. I asked for a refund for my drink, and the staff was so confused as to why. I explained that he was there fixing it, even though they probably should've known that. It took way too long for them to find a manager and explain the situation again, even though it wasn't that  complex. There was no \"sorry about that\" or any simple remark a normal person in customer service would make. F for service. Basic stuff here."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience in the past 15 years I have been coming here. they get really busy but the food is always fresh and they have good service. Love this place."}
{"text":"My kids love eating here (4 y/o and 1.5 y/o).  We're treated so well, and Nicole is by FAR their best waitress."}
{"text":"I just moved here and did a google search of where to go. Sweet tomatoes came up and I decided to go. I loved there salad buffet and all the fresh veggies to pick from. I will definitely continue to go here. If your looking for a small lunch with variety this is the best place."}
{"text":"The food was good. The staff was friendly.  I only wish they would offer Clam Chowder every day... We would eat here a lot more if they did!"}
{"text":"Everything is super fresh whenever we go. Easy to fill a plate with healthy, delicious salad, but hard not to overheat! Their chili is also very tasty. We always try to eat there when we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time to go to a restaurant of this nature.  Reasonable price to enjoy a variety of tastes and eat moderately healthy foods, i.e. salads, vegetables.  We enjoyed it a lot and would definitely go again but live a 1,000 miles away.  We would love for a restaurant in this chain to locate within reasonable driving distance of us."}
{"text":"Ehh this place is very clean and the food LOOKS good. However, as I ate the food, the tastes seemed to get worse and worse as I tasted different foods. You can try it for yourself but ehh not really something to look forward to. Lesson from all this, looks can be deceiving."}
{"text":"Today was opening day and if were rating just on cleanliness and service, Sweet Tomatoes would get 5 stars.  Everyone was very friendly and smiling- quick to take plates away.   This place has great salads selections and you can make your own too.  The soup selection is great too - Broccoli cheddar, New England Clam Chowder, Chicken noodle, Chicken and Lime, Cream of Mushroom, Chili and Tomato soup.. they had more but I don't remember them all.  Pasta salad was good but wasn't too many too choose from.    Now for the not so great, pizza was soggy and inconsistent with some pieces no having any cheese. The toppings for the baked potato don't have the proper spoon to put them in the little cups causing me to get sour cream all over my fingers.  Muffins /cornbread not that great bland tasting.  The dessert is just frozen yogurt with toppings and puddings.     Overall wouldn't pay $25 (which includes the $2 tip we left for the servers who were very attentive) for soup, salad and two drinks.  They do have a breakfast buffet along with the usual stuff on Sunday mornings from 9AM to 12PM or 1PM."}
{"text":"I take the whole family her after the soccer games. A lot of food for all of them for not a bad price. Just wish they had a few more selections."}
{"text":"If you looking to lose weight and eat right this is the place where you want to be sweet tomato offering you Verity of vegetables and vegetarian soup it's fresh it's clean and it's very affordable the workers are very polite and smiling. good atmosphere there I do recommend go ahead and try you and your family"}
{"text":"When you come to the salad bar I will give you five star tomato everything fresh and clean very friendly people and not expensive at all. Happy with the quality happy with the taste and definitely coming back thank you sweet tomato"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Tried it again today after a few years of not being g here and it's gotten  gross. Everything tastes bland. They have gotten rid of the chicken in the salad bar which was the best part of coming here. The best part of my lunch was my strawberry lemonade and my soft serve everything else was just gross and bland. I doubt I'll be coming back especially at the prices they charge."}
{"text":"I like the idea of a salad buffet ... their selection of vegetables is great ! I wish they had the choice of chicken or fish as protein that you can add to your salad.  I love their soups. . Everytime I come in they have a different selection .  However. . I am so soo disgusted with their water cups! They are so stained and look so dirty. I won't even give my dog water from that glass.. I wish they had disposable cups for water .."}
{"text":"I am one of those weirdos who come to Sweet Tomatoes for salad and vegetarian soup. You know, healthy food. Food that makes your colon look up to you and say \"thank you,\" to which you reply \"no, thank YOU.\" I don't come here for the greasy, bready pizza and flavorless old-people pasta - although the lemon cream and caper pasta is so delicious I want to fill a swimming pool with it and... but I digress.  So how hard is this, right? It's a salad bar. get fresh veg, cut it up, serve it. Have competent dressings (their Greek is quite good) and BAM - you're done (except for an ironic month a while back where they had signs up about not having any tomatoes on the bar because of some crop devastation or I don't know what). Ah but the soups - what I love about Sweet Tomatoes versus other salad joints which shall go unnamed is their soups. They always have a couple of vegetarian options and they are uniformly delicious (if somewhat lacking in salt, but let's get real - this place is for geriatrics, not soccer parents).  Another thing I appreciate about Sweet Tomatoes is that they don't try to get their busboys to act like they're waiters. Thanks, no, I don't need a glass of Phoenix tapwater ice for my bottle of purified water. Thanks, no, I doubt I'm going to need to ask you for anything, IT'S SELF-SERVE. But they do come around and offer you cookies. Those are the kinds of nice touches that make me come back."}
{"text":"Excellent for vegetarians like me, Great service I go once a week. Real easy to grab your food. Great prices, love the menu and location. 5 stars for anyone who wants to eat healthy."}
{"text":"I enjoy the selection of vegetables and pastas. But when I made my way up to the cashier, and I paid for my meal, she begged me for money for charity! I was furious! This was the SECOND time this happened.   Our presence at the register as customers should never be construed as an opportunity to beg us for money. There are so many people begging for handouts nowadays, you can hardly escape them. And now businesses are getting into the game. I guess they don't care that they put customers in an akward position by asking for handouts. I don't believe I am going to return. And unless enough people complain, this irritating practice will continue.   It's a shame that it had come to this."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really like going here. It's a bit expensive to dine in for the buffet at 11/person, especially since we are not people who like to gorge ourselves. We always do the to-go combo. We split the salad and each get a cup of soup and fill a small bag with muffins, corn bread, and brownies. A good meal for 2 for under $10 when getting it to-go. We opt for the pre-made salads and then add our additional toppings. It's healthy, cheap, and yummy."}
{"text":"We LOVE going here on Monday because they have the best cream of mushroom soup ever. Great chicken noodle too. Been coming here for years and we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"If you're craving for a salad bar with your family this is a great place. On the go I usually go to Whole foods for a salad but seats are limited in most of their stores. Menus are online so you can check beforehand if you have a picky family. All six of us were full and happy when we left. This is my second visit to a Sweet Tomatoes and the staff is friendly and the bar was clean and stocked.  They have Vegan and Gluten sensitivity options which are labeled. It is strawberry month. I loved the Strawberry Fields salad with strawberry vinaigrette. Please tip the bussers."}
{"text":"Not sure if she's a manger and didn't catch her name but a girl working in the front on 8/17 with long brown hair made my experience great! She went out of her way to be helpful and accommodating and it's people like this in the service industry that make places worth coming back so thank you!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time, and this location is #1 in my book of experiences.  They now serve beers. They take suggestions via a phone call: 888.374.8358 They also serve... Wi-Fi! I am writing this review from Sweet Tomatoes Wi-Fi :)  Lots of greens! Lots of veggie choices! Fluffed (processed) Eggs Cottage Cheese Cheeses Soups Ice Yogurt & Muffins -- CHECK YOUR CALORIES -- at the website! Some are relatively lower than others...  -- DJ"}
{"text":"First time I've eaten at Sweet tomatoes. There is very nice. Employee's are courteous. I want to try the one closest to me."}
{"text":"I always love Sweet tomatoes. But I am about a rabbit and love my salads."}
{"text":"I actually did my internship at this location when I was at UNLV. This place has great sanitation and very fresh produce. They make everything from scratch. It's a very good company and this is an excellent location."}
{"text":"Nice selection of salad ingrediants so you can get exactly the salad you want. Also a variety of soups to pick from the selections change from time to time so you can always see new items when you go there. A selection of pasta, baked potatoes and other things also available along with a few desserts and drink choices. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes! It's such an awesome place. You get unlimited soup and salad and pasta for one low price. Sign up for their e-mails so that they'll send you weekly e-mails on discounted prices for their food. I really do like their cheesy bread and garlic bread. I really wanted to go recently for their chicken pot pie soup which actually did come with a biscuit. The soup was delicious except for those stupid peas. (sidenote, I HATE peas). Their pastas are never anything special. I feel like they have no flavor. I do wish they had the rosemary potato soup year round, though.   I grab a ton of their wonton happiness salad. I think they used to add chicken to it, and they no longer do. I wish they would add wonton strips to their regular toppings. I do love their feta cheese, so I pile that on!   One complaint is that after soups and salad, I always feel pretty quickly. But that's not their fault."}
{"text":"Probably the best salad bar restaurant I have been to.  They have a great selection of items and everything is fresh. They have a few prepared salads if you are not in the mood to build or just want to use it as a starting point.  My favorite section though is the soup bar.  They always have a great selection to choose from, no matter your mood.  My favorites are the chili and of course the Sweet Tomato soup.   The staff is usually friendly and not a nuisance like they can be at some buffets.  There is always someone circling the floor with a basket of cookies.  Definitely a favorite of ours when we lived in Phoenix.  I wish they were in PA and MD so we could visit again. If you are looking for a quick healthy meal (with the not so healthy always available) look no farther."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area, so we are going out to eat A LOT!   This place was one of the first new places that we tried after moving to Arizona. If I could, I would eat here every day.   The first time that we ate here, we entered through the wrong door. The nice girl at the register helped us by showing us how to go through the salad bar line. After going through, she gave us a free bag of cookies and some coupons for being first-timers!   The salad bar is amazing. The cashew/broccoli salad... WOW. The soups are always great! I love the mini pasta bar area and my husband loves the cornbread. I am usually too full for dessert, but I have had some a time or two. Again, amazing.   The staff is always friendly. They fill your drinks, take your plates, and ask you how your food is.   We signed up for their email program and get coupons.   See you again soon, Sweet Tomatoes! :)"}
{"text":"1st time here and loved it !!!  All you can eat salad, pasta, pizza and soup bar!  Everything FRESH!!!"}
{"text":"Your food is exquisite. I especially love the chicken noodle soup. Your muffins are delicious, especially the blueberry muffins. I love how you guys give out free cookies, my grandchildren love it. Your drinks are very good because you make them homemade. Most of all I wanted to say how I appreciate that your food is self serve. Thank you sweet tomatoes!"}
{"text":"I'm starting to think I am a masochist.  I keep going to Sweet Tomatoes, and I keep having more painful experiences.  My buddy likes the place and always wants to take me there for lunch so I indulge.    This last time around, two of the dishes were so inedible and horrendous that I actually stopped the manager and asked him to check the \"integrity\" of them.  Free lunch is not worth this kind of punishment.  No More!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I agree with others that I don't really care for the minimalist, mostly windowless, silo-barn like/cafeteria design of the interior.   I do like the wide selection of soups at this location. However, that whole area where the soups and drinks are seems jumbled and disorganized by design,   One of my biggest rants with Sweet Tomatoes is, ironically, they sure don't have anything in the way of TOMATOES at the salad bar. At their expensive prices, I think it is cheap of the company to not at least have cherry or grape tomatoes if not baby--or large--heirloom tomatoes to choose from!"}
{"text":"Glad there here for my mom, that aside I can't stand to spend 25 bucks for salad that taste bland. Who ever designed the salad bar is an idiot  the middle row on the bar is to far in my mom couldn't reach anything and when I went to get it for her I smashed my face in the snot protector 5 times now I'm pissed off b4 I even payed. Then I'm told there's no ice in the soda machine and the ice machine in back is broken. Employees were great but I can make a better salad experince at home and for less money."}
{"text":"Good fresh salad bar with a nice selection of soups. Can get crowded and loud during peak times. Join the email list and get weekly discount coupons sent directly to your inbox every week."}
{"text":"This place is great for the kids. All you can eat salad buffet, soup bar, ice cream, pasta, and baked goods..."}
{"text":"Going to be brutally honest, but this dining experience was highly disappointing. I've only been to the Henderson Sweet Tomatoes, which in my opinion has a much larger selection and better quality food and service. This location's soups however, looked crusted over as if they've been sitting still for a while. I find it very concerning that besides the fresh piece of pizza bread I got, that most of all the other food that should have been warm was completely cold! The salad bar is pretty comparable to the other location other than the fact it's hard to reach certain toppings due to their set up. Toppings and dressings were very cross contaminated from previous customers. The venue is larger and more modern than the Henderson location, but the food service is undeniably lacking. I would love to give more stars, maybe in a future visit, but I honestly don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"-----------------------More Like Sweet TomaNO's-------------------  This Location has major cleanliness issues. My family went in one night looking for a light dinner and what we found was stomach turning.  The Red trays at the start of the salad line were filthier than Red Foxx! We took tray after tray from the pile and they were clumped with wet napkins and food, as if the staff had just piled them in the dishwasher without removing the former diners debris, and they just got wet , not cleaned. I mean come on, PILES of these things were literally clumped with nasty wet used napkins! I finally found a napkin spitwad-free tray and \"Thought\", \"oh I found a clean one guys\", NO.... It had weird black grease on it, so we all just left assuming if they cant get cleanliness down by the tray phase , then it would probably be best to not risk illness with the rest of the establishment. Buffet style restaurants NEED cleanliness , or its just plain foul.  No thanks, Ill pass on the 10$ a plate funk-athon."}
{"text":"Yippee Sweet Tomatoes is back! The best family friendly restaurant around!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.  Not heavy but healthy food with affordable price. They also change menu for specific holidays. Also, I love their coupons !!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner...salads and soups are always fresh and delicious.  This place never disappoints.  Reasonable price for adults and children...and I can usually find a coupon somewhere."}
{"text":"Bad experience today. A group of us showed up on Sunday afternoon with our kids. We ate as usual, had dessert and decided to have some coffee afterward. When we arrived at the drink station, the coffee pot was brewing and about to overflow. Shortly after, one of the bussers, a short gal with dark hair and short bangs approached the drink station. We told her that the coffee was about to overflow, which it seriously was, and she proceeded to have a nasty attitude toward us. We were just trying to help and didn't expect her mouth to run...telling us that she knew how to do her job. We were just trying to explain to her that we weren't telling her how to do her job but she wouldn't let it go. Sheesh...we sat back down, pissed off but whatever. We proceeded to enjoy whatever coffee we were able to get and about 5 minutes later, the same rude gal passed right behind me with a dish box full of dirty dishes. She purposely hit me on the back as she passed by, causing several dishes to fall on the ground. She glared at me as if it was my fault but not once was an apology given for such horrendous behavior. She proceeded to keep walking and left all the dishes on the floor. WTH? We are definitely not ghetto but at that moment, I blew up and flagged the manager down. I don't know if he did anything about it, but again, no apology either....what gives? We decided to go elsewhere...where we are treated with respect. Not going back. Food not that good anyway."}
{"text":"Good buffet, we come back time after time. Love the coupons and a free meal on your birthday! Family friendly!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby! If you're looking for a healthy alternative to fast food, this is good choice if you have the time. It was a happy surprise to find quinoa at the salad bar and sugar free chocolate pudding in the dessert area."}
{"text":"I eat at Sweet Tomatoes 6 days a week and I find the food exceptional, we have many hotels here in Las Vegas and they all have buffets but NONE can compare with the freshness of all the  vegetables soups that taste your mother was in the kitchen cooking. the small various little pieces of pizza are also great.  the only negative would be they have a hard time keeping the. coffee hot, other than that it's great otherwise I would not eat there almost everyday. the manager April Presley is a real joy, she is very accommodating.  my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting. Plates were dirty cups were dirty even the trays were dirty. Food was cold."}
{"text":"I do realize places like this have to manage the product closely to make the bottom line, but in this case it works against them. I think the public is aware of this because they were not getting the turn over to move the food of the counter. So in summary the food tastes old. My family came into this location at 4:00 pm.  Was it too far away from lunch and dinner rush? What ever the answer maybe... I can't recommend this location."}
{"text":"This one sucks.  Had two lines going but only one cashier working??  So she would go back and forth between the two lines, had to wait a long time to pay.  Seriously?  Then half the food was missing and not replenished, meanwhile i watched workers move around slowly and not really doing anything, stopping and talking with each other and customers.     Huge mess."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  I wish they had their tomato bisque today but they didn't. Employees are very kind and helpful.  I saw an employee help a single mother carry her plate while the mom carried her child.  It was very generous and thoughtful."}
{"text":"Wish they had more variety for soup but it's an interesting place.  I'd come back.  So far their clam chowder and chicken noodle soup was good and their pastries are good as well"}
{"text":"Very good.. A little pricey, not bad if you take a coupon."}
{"text":"Are you gluten free? Are you hoping to get a yummy plate of veges covered in your favorite salad dressing with some great pasta on the side and a tasty desert on the side that you cant wait to get to?  Well, if you have gluten allergies, you will pay what everyone else is paying (10-15) and will only be able to eat 1/3 of the buffet that is offered!!!  Why in the world do that? Pay for what you cannot eat? Hell no. They are not about to jack the price up so they can offer gluten free substitutes. Know what I mean?  Skip it"}
{"text":"I have been sad wishing the Soup or Salads were still open in our area. I was happy to find this place while out shopping.  The salad bar is stocked with fresh veggies and add ons. It's clean and inviting. The soup bar, bakery have a nice selection. It can get quite noisy, but I'm here for the food."}
{"text":"We always love this place for it's fresh salad bar. I was not disappointed. They had seasonal soups which were so yummy. We even got free sugar cookies. What could be better? The folks cleaning the tables removed our unwanted dishes promptly even though the place was packed. Fresh salads were made before our eyes."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes always satisfies my itch for plentiful greens.  The salad bar is fantastic and  packed with a diverse selection of fresh veggies  No wilty, slightly browned lettuce leaves here!  I only wish Sweet Tomatoes' other selections were as good.   The soup is severely hit-or-miss.  While I appreciate that they're creative (hello Chicken Dijon), generally the execution is poor. Dessert is always good, but, you can't really go wrong with warm brownies and soft serve.  I'd rate this location as the least preferable in Las Vegas.  It's smaller and has fewer pasta selections than Henderson or Best in the West.  It does have outdoor seating but it's generally unusable because: (1) It's too hot; and/or (2) It's too windy.    Also, I've noticed a lot of children emitting piercing screams at this location.  So, if you're a pasta fan and hate children, maybe try Henderson."}
{"text":"The soups are the best.  I enjoy the fresh salad varieties as well. I had the potato and rosemary soup.  I had multiple servings of this soup.  The cornbread with the honey whipped butter is a must have for me every time I go to Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"So I mostly hate salad. Not like root canals or Mondays...but I still dislike salads strongly. So now I get to write one of those generic liens about how I loved Sweet Tomatoes, despite the fact that I should despise all they stand for and salt the earth beneath them.   It's true though. I, hater of rabbit food actually enjoyed my visit. The ingredients were crisp, fresh and tasty. This is especially impressive given that I'm in Vegas, aka the enemy of all things crisp, fresh, and tasty, not necessarily in that order.  Not only did were they good, but the ingredients were also plentiful and the choices were many.  Even the ranch was tasty, and usually people mess up ranch. It's either too thick, too thin or just tasteless altogether. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine, actually. Sweet Tomatoes did not leave me peeved, though on the all important ranch issue.   Aside from the greenery, they featured a varied stock of soups, which are cooked in gigantic pots in the morning. Seriously. I saw into the kitchen. I could probably sit in one of the pots. The soups were also tasty, and well flavored. Not overflavored like many do. Just flavored.   In general, keeping it simple and plentiful seems to be the entire mantra of Sweet Tomatoes. It works. From the food to the flavoring to the seating arrangements and decorations, it all falls into that line of thinking. In a world of overwork, overhype and overpushing by restaurants, Sweet Tomatoes went the opposite direction and they are all the better for it.   If you like soup, go here. If you like salad, go here. If you like having prepackaged choices waiting for you...go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is good quality and it's fresh.  The staff is very accommodating.  I like that it is open between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to Sweet Tomatoes at least 30 times. Does this compare to a great steakhouse for dinner, well no... But guess what this is a Salad Bar. And this is the best salad bar in town. I dare you to find a salad bar where you can get 107 different items for your salad, 5 different soups, a taco bar, a pasta bar, a desert bar. I'm sorry but the people on Yelp need to learn how to review something. If you are reviewing a salad bar you have to review it against other salad bars not gourmet Italian Restaurants. There is no way you can say the good things you say about this place and then give it only 4 stars. This is a 5 STAR SALAD BAR."}
{"text":"As far as buffet style salad bars go this place has everything you need at a good price ($10+beverage... I did the free water).   I walked in at 12:30pm on a Tuesday/lunch rush was able to walk right in sit down and on my way in 15-20 mins.  Prefect for a quick healthy lunch option."}
{"text":"I bring EVERY friend/family member from all over the valley to visit, what \"we\" now believe to be the VERY BEST Sweet Tomatoes in the Valley.  This restaurant is exceptional in its' cleanliness, freshness of both hot/cold food, and outstanding staff both on the floor and behind the counters!!  Can't say enough about being proud that being a \"towner\" that my friends/family drive in specifically to eat at this particular Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Last night my SO treated me (a new mom) to dinner. It's difficult for us to do dinner with a 2 month old. Nonetheless, I received an email saying they'd be offering LOBSTER BISQUE for a limited time only. That's my favorite soup. We went straight to the restaurant and to our surprise, there was no lobster bisque. No one new when they'd be serving it and had no clue why I received the email.  I spoke to the manager and told her how disappointed we were. I didn't kick or scream, I just explained how it made me feel (hormones are still in full effect I guess)  Manager was very gracious, kind and understanding. She gave us 2 vouchers to return at a later date. I thought that was so nice and unexpected."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a cozy spot perfect for those who like to build their own salads. There are so many different foods to add to your salads, everything from peas, to nuts, to many salad dressings, you could fill up just on that. However, to their credit, they have warm foods in a different section.  Several soup options are available in breads and soups. You can also choose pizza slices and macaroni and cheese, which is great if you have kids with you.   To top it off there is jello, other desserts and self-serve ice cream. A nice selection of beverages meets you after the cashier area, closer to the salad fixings. The booths are sized nicely and it is always clean and bright.  Nice spot to eat healthy without sacrificing options. Staff is limited but they have nice attitudes and helpful. No problem recommending this eatery to others."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Everything is good, food is fresh and recirculated often. Lots of employees around to help and clean up."}
{"text":"I was holding my breath waiting for this location to open because it is a nice alternative to the fast food joints in the area. Most of the time I have eaten at this chain has been at the Souplantation in San Bernardino on Hospitality Lane. The food there has always been good, just the location has always been kind of a dump. It was a nice surprise to see what a new location is like. The restaurant  itself was decorated in a wholesome/industrial motif with exposed ducts and big pictures of fields and fresh healthy messages across the wall.   This is the first location that I have been to that offered outside seating. It is a welcome addition, the only down side is that it is next to the street. The food is standard for this chain, plenty of it and all very good. For desert, don't for get to hit the soft serve machine for the win!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is the buffet capital of the world. It just doesn't make sense to pay $11 for a buffet that is so limited. Yes, they have a long salad bar and they have 3 soups and 3 pastas, some muffins and some soft-swirl ice cream.   For the same price you can go to any of a dozen casinos and have all that and a lot more. Most of the buffets feature carving stations with turkey, ham or beef. They also have Mexican or Chinese food and usually piles of fresh cut melons, not to mention a tempting array of desserts. The off-Strip casinos are about the same price as Sweet Tomatoes.    The only benefit I see to Sweet Tomatoes is that it isn't in a casino which is a plus for families. To me it's not worth the money."}
{"text":"They have the best mix of salad, soups, breads and dessert for the price. When I want to go out and eat healthy, this is my favorite place to go. I just wish there was one closer to my house."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location a 2 Star review based on the full experience at this location.  The salad had wilted leaves and there was jello all over the floor. I have been to this location multiple times and it seems like it just keeps getting worse. When I purchased the 2 adults for 19.99 coupon dinner,  the cashier handed me two small glass cups. (I have always received the to-go cups so I assumed they came with the meal since I've used those coupons before and never got questioned at any location) after telling her I would like the to-go cups, I was rudely told \"Well then you should have told me that before hand- you already purchased these ones.\"  I wouldn't mind paying he whole 1 dollar more for the to go cups. But to be rudely told I should have said that before my transaction was complete- was completely uncalled for. There was no line behind me- I wasn't holding anyone up. Teach your employees some manners- you have lost two  frequent sweet tomatoes  eaters at this location. We will travel the extra  8 miles to the desert ridge location."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner around 8 o'clock pm, there were two huge flies in the salad bar... One was in the celery and the other one was in the shredded carrot, I picked up both of the containers and put them on the back counter and told the woman that they were full of flies. She blamed it on the door being too close to the salad bar, I can dig it... But why is the door so close to the salad bar? Anyway, we took the higher road and use the other salad bar that's further away from the door, made some great salads paid $11.49 for the great salad, paid another $2.49 for a cup... Salad was good, food was great, service was crap. I went to the front desk and asked if I could have a to go cup for my iced tea on my way out and the girl told me it would be another 50 cents... Really? You're already charging $11.49 for a salad, you're charging $2.49 for a drink, and if I want to take that drink home I actually need to pay another 50 cents? That's ridiculous. My dinner was $14, I can go to some of the nicest places in town and get myself a steak and guess what, the nice restaurants would ask me if I would like a to go cup when I get ready to leave. $11.49, I won't be back for fly infested salad... What's funny is, had the manager on duty just given me a to go cup instead of explaining to me the costs associated with the to go cup I probably wouldn't be here telling you that there were flies in the salad... Its funny, when you get bad service you feel like you need to tell the whole wide world."}
{"text":"As a devout omnivore I must qualify my review by saying that I would ordinarily not pick a place that's predominately vegan.  It was my wife's choice that day but I have to say that I would definitely go there on purpose sometime.    The salad was great and I did not want for anything that I did not see including my favorite dressing.  Indeed I could go there again just for the chili.  You dump that chili over a freshly baked potato and wallah, ya got yourself a meal.  Next time I think I'll try the chicken noodle soup, it looked good.  Price wise it falls into the range of any of the family sit down type of restaurants but being an all you can eat style buffet puts it over the top.  Try something, if you don't like it, just throw it away and get something else.  You can't do that at Denny's."}
{"text":"I eat here on a regular basis, because this particular one of the chain is near my home. I have eaten at many other Sweet Tomatoes and they are better. They saturate the prepared salads with too much dressing and have decreased the amount of meat in their soups and salads. My favorite item was the mushroom soup, but they no longer offer it, even on Mondays. I had a bad experience the last time I ate their because the cashier ( her name was Tanya)  would not honor our coupon and did not want to give us our meal at lunch price. It was 4:30 pm and they have this special until 5pm during the week. After we argued with us regarding this she then said that special is only for Seniors. LoL. My husband and I are close to 70. We look at least 60. Lol. If that is not a senior, I don't know what is. We will be looking for another restaurant and not going here very often. This restaurant is not run well. Probably at least 1/2 of the patrons are seniors and this happens to them they are going to lose a lot of business."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with the family! The food was very good and the staff were all polite and friendly. The bakery items were a bit hard but we went towards the end of the night so will definitely have to give the baked goods another try. Prices were decent for a buffet."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet, especially if you are vegetarian!  There are an endless variety of salad add-ins, and an lot vegetarian options in addition to the salad (soups, breads, desserts, etc.).  There were only a few dishes with meat in them, so if you're looking to eat lots of meat at a buffet, don't come here.  But if you're a vegetarian like me, you will love it!  Everything I tried was delicious, and I would definitely come back again.  I am also a big fan of the service!  Everyone working there was super friendly.  They had a guy walking around, handing out chocolate chip cookies.  It was pleasant.  Altogether, it cost about $11, not including drinks.  It was worth it."}
{"text":"Very disapponted. Used to go there a lot, but when quality went downhill we stopped going. A few weeks back we decided to give it another try. What a mistake. First thng I did was check the plates when I walked in, cause half of them are dirty, just like the silverware.There were 3 'waitresses' sitting in a booth next to us not acting very professional. The food selecton was even worse than normal. In all the years we been going there, there was aways at least pizza (the only thing I find halfway decent besides the salat) but not this time. I kept checking, but nothing. We were so diaspponted that we didn't even leave a tip. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Bom Bom love this place life is about the adventure and sweet tomato was on my list. Definitely five stars will come back again"}
{"text":"I am torn in my rating. At one time I would have given this place a solid 4 stars, but it has gone downhill quite dramatically over the last year. They used to have green olives, regular tomatoes, and dill pickles on the salad bar. Now they have no green olives, only grape tomatoes and no dill pickles. The pre made salads no longer contain chicken and the eggs are mostly egg yolks with no whites.  I still love the idea of this place, but everything I liked on the salad bar has changed."}
{"text":"Being a minimalist on carbs, I'm not keen on Sweet Tomatoes.  All the usual salad offerings you can find anywhere else, and at home - but the salad bar itself offers few lean proteins, except  tuna buried in a carb and calorie laden pasta.  I asked if they offered something like plain chicken or fish, and he said no, but there's chicken in the soup.  The only protein options available were quinoa with corn (and of course the usual beans), which was acceptable, but I don't see a compelling reason to revisit Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Dirty.   I love this chain in other locations but this one is ill kept. The bathrooms are dirty. The floor in the dining area is dirty. The chair I sat on was dirty. The table was dirty. The salad bar was dirty.   Decent food. Not as much of it as other locations. Some bins were empty and never refilled while I was there .... Maybe cuz they were dirty. :)"}
{"text":"The salads are always hand-tossed and fresh. Unlike other Sweet Tomato's, they don't charge you extra for premium toppings. The soups are always tasty as is the pizza and pasta. The service is always friendly here. You pay a little more than other buffet's, but you get great quality of food and get to each much healthier."}
{"text":"I love Sweet tomatoes, but was extremely disappointed in how rude the brunette woman at the register was. She didn't so much as greet anyone or say a single word to me or my friend while we paid. I visited this location around 4pm today and was very pleased with the quality of the food!  The woman at the register was the only negative part of the experience.   It would be 5 stars if not for the unfriendly experience. :/"}
{"text":"I used to go very regularly to this place. I like the freshness and the service. They used to do themed months and now I went only 2-3 times this year, because I just got bored. Now is every time the same. The salads at the beginning of the line are ok, but nothing spectacular as it used to be. If they bring new soups, new muffins, new selection and overhaul the assortment once a year I would be back as I used to - every week."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good because they had variety of food. I liked it a lot. The food taste was very good and I want to come back again. Employees were very nice because they came to our table often and check if everything is okay.   Every employees were very professional and nice."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the staff was not very friendly and they gave me odd looks when I asked for a few simple things."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for lunch many times and while it's not the best meal in town, it has always been OK.  However last night I went to dinner there for the first time and I'll never make that mistake again.  All the breads are left over from lunch  so the cheese bread could be used to shingle my roof and the cornbread was not far behind. The dressings were 99% water and 1% actual dressing.  The puddings tasted like paste. I guess I'll stick with lunch or just forget this place altogether."}
{"text":"Love Sweet Tomatoes!!! We have gone to the ahwatukee location multiple times and have never been disappointed. The kids love it too and actually want to come here over everywhere else. The food always taste great and the staff is always friendly. They will offer you cookies, refills, pick up the dirty dishes right away, and are asking if you need anything throughout your meal. For it being a buffet, I think this is a huge add on because I have been to other buffets where the service no where near matched sweet tomatoes. I seen on previous posts that some people were upset over not many meat options except for in the soups, but honestly I feel like reading the sign is pretty self explanatory. This is suppose to be a healthier option- and meat is not the healthiest. If you are looking for a filling meal that kids will love too, this is the place! Oh, and the rosemary soup is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"If you LOVE salad then go here. The foods are labeled perfectly showing what is vegan friendly and have many options for vegan and vegetarians. I got two plates of salad and they have several dressing choices. For soups however there are no vegan soups which sucks BUT they have baked potatoes and vegan butter available. He last time I went there was a vegetarian soup, but the cheese in it was a no go for myself. Friendly staff and all around clean place. Just be careful of kids eating too much and throwing up by your table. As the kind of people that filled restaurant were not the classiest of people."}
{"text":"Decent food but the table was dirty. Need a little more help on cleanliness. Other than that the price was reasonable"}
{"text":"If you're trying to go healthy for the day or you just are heathly, this place is a treat !!"}
{"text":"Fresh salad buffet, with soups, pasta, breads and desserts.  The salads ingredients are always fresh and tasty with a lot of great varieties.  The soups can be hit or miss, however the chili is consistently good.  Freshly baked breads and focaccia complement your meal.  Round out your meal with soft serve ice cream, a variety of baked goods or sugar free desserts.  Join \"Club Veg\" for updates and coupons via e-mail."}
{"text":"Love this Sweet Tomatoes location and layout.  My kids are picky eatters and love this place!  The staff seems to be quicker at picking up empty plates at this location compared to other locations.  Food always tastes fresh.  Sign up for their e-mails for great coupons."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Sweet Tomatoes, but met a friend for lunch here today.  Typical soup and salad bar fare, and decent enough.  But I have one MAJOR complaint: the plates and bowls for your food were NOT CLEAN.  And not just one or even two.  Dish after dish had old food particles on them and it was hard to find one clean enough to eat off of.  I'm not very squeamish, but this is something the management needs to address.  It was that bad.  I hope someone there is listening."}
{"text":"I love the food at Sweet Tomatoes. Love the veggies and my husband loves the soups. I just visited there this week and was surprised to see dirty dishes and cold and dried out pasta. I hope this was just because of the holiday rush because I do not want to stop going there. So, I cannot give 5 starts this time."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I would recommend it to anyone. The price is low but the food is of the best quality. My wife had a special request and the manager went out of her way to take care of us. We were here during a busy time as could be seen by the few tables that were empty. We sat down right away and it didn't feel like it was that busy. They had all the food full and the kitchen staff was on the ball getting food out. I will be back and very soon!!  A++ and an extra star."}
{"text":"Took my family of five go lunch here today as we are fans of Sweet tomatoes buy have never been to this location yet. The place is bigger than the one on West flamingo and the décor and design is a lot nicer too. Food was awesome and we even bought the homemade chocolate chip cookies get had for sale because it literally is the best cookies I've had in awhile. Horchatas was good. Food overall was excellent and their service and cleanliness was great! We will be going back in a couple of weeks when we go see out monthly family movie! Can't wait..."}
{"text":"I am now changing my review as they seem to have worked some kinks and the place is much better. The ice cream station and the soda station need some work as it is too crowded but other than that, it is back to my favorite salad place again."}
{"text":"Closing at the end of November? WTF?  Will there be a new CenPho location opening, i hope??"}
{"text":"This place is a part of my weekly schedule. Buffet of salad and soup is definitely a heaven for me! Don't forget to sign up on their newsletter and print out coupons, considering the price is already cheap (for a buffet), you can still save a lot more. I am never disappointed when i get there. They've always got a fresh selection at the salad bar. Decent selection of soups as well and few of their pastas, breads and pastries are good enough to fill you up.  Service has been okay. And in one of my visits, one of the utensils was unclean. Nonetheless, food is great."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about this place! Always great, now if I can just get my husband to join me!"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes.  This one was average sized but I didn't care for the layout.  I would have liked to revisit the salad bar (and FYI they charge extra for certain toppings).  The soups were delicious and the red velvet cobbler-like dessert was very yummy!"}
{"text":"We come here once a year for a family reunion tradition. The only reason young, hip people would be here is to be with family and eat a lot of food. The unlimited soft serve ice cream is the best, with the sweet potatoes, gf horchata muffins and salad bar being the best things there. My husband said he liked the mac-n-cheese there, but \"it wasn't the best thing he's ever tasted.\" The pastas were actually fresh-tasting, vegetarian and flavorful for a buffet. They've updated it since I was a kid with gf, vegetarian and more flavorful items."}
{"text":"Great place for seniors to go during the week before 6pm. They have a great promotion going in right now.  The salad bar was clean and the veggies were fresh. The folks there kept our table clean. How can you go wrong for $15 for two. BTW my favorite soup was the mushroom."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is my #1 restaurant of all time! Subscribe to their newsletter for weekly coupons!  FOOD: I like that Sweet Tomatoes uses the buffet concept because I often just want to create my own salads and try different combinations. Their ingredients are extremely fresh. If you don't want to create your own salad, they often toss their seasonal salads for you to enjoy. From the hot foods section, they have delicious soups that change often. The chicken noodle soup is my favorite and is always available. They have baked potatoes that are pretty popular among customers. You can stuff it yourself with all the butter, cheese, sour cream, and bacon that you want. The pasta section is not that great. The mac n cheese is all I ever eat from there and I add bacon and sour cream to it. Lastly, they have great pizza bites that go well with ranch dressing.  DESSERT: You can never go wrong with soft serve ice cream. They even have dry toppings and chocolate syrup! They also have a fruit bar that includes seasonal fruits, jello, pudding, and mousse.  DRINK: Sweet Tomatoes has a drink bar that allows you to serve your own drink. There is everything from water to soda to hot tea to coffee to their freshly made lemonades and iced teas. I often see people getting creative by mixing drinks. Sweet Tomatoes also have seasonal drinks like Limenade for St. Patrick's day.  ATMOSPHERE:Sweet Tomatoes is a buffet will a focus on salad and soup.  NOTE: Yes, it's a buffet, but they work hard to clean your tables so it doesn't hurt to leave a small tip."}
{"text":"Great selection at this salad bar type place!  Pros: Won ton chicken salad Edamame Fat free honey mustard Blueberry muffins Coconut muffin (limited time!) Chicken noodle soup  Cons: Lots of slow elderly people  No warm dessert when I went at lunch Balsamic dress- not a fan!  Truly a decent casual spot to stop in and eat fairly healthy.  The lady clearing tables was extremely nice!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sweet Tomatoes since before I started Yelping, so there's a long history behind this review.  PROS: *  Extensive salad bar.  Almost always full.  Prepared mixed saladsare freshly made and refreshed often.  (You can watch the staff make it if you happen to be there when it's happening.) *  Extensive soup menu.  Despite a review stating three soups, there are either six or seven bain maries for soup (I can't remember exactly).  Soup is always freshly made; never boxed nor canned.  Certain soups are constant, like their Big Chunk Chicken and their Chili; some are seasonal. *  Fresh pasta (three types) always freshly made. *  Baked potatoes (and recently added baked sweet potatoes).  Condiment bar right there. *  Several types of breads and muffins, both sweet and savory.  Butter, margarine and \"honey whip\" available. *  Staff is pleasant and always helpful.  I have a bad leg and my wife has had back reconstruction; when we walk in with our walking sticks, we are ALWAYS asked if we need assistance taking trays to tables.  Frequent offers to have our drinks refilled instead of us walking to the beverage station.  Empty plates and bowls picked up from the tables on a regular basis.  CONS: *  Specifically addressing a comment made by another Yelper: sometimes the customers are faster at making a mess than the staff is at cleaning it up.  Splashed dressings (a teaspoon or so of ranch in the French, for example) can't always be resolved with the lines of patrons running through the place.  Also \"mixed vegetables\" (some cabbage in the radishes, for example) ... same concept.  Not everyone has the same accuracy.  Myself included.  As full as they get the bins, I tend to spill a bit of cabbage or a few pieces of mushroom myself.  My apologies to the folks behind me if I don't always get a chance to clean up after myself.  If you don't like serving yourself when you go out to eat (my dear mother, the venerable Mama Hawk, is one such), Sweet Tomatoes may not be for you.  Otherwise, \"come 'n' get it!\"  You may just see me and my darling wife there. -- -- -- -- -- On the newly-established Nighthawk 100-point scale:  97."}
{"text":"Warning for carnivores like myself:  This is nothing more than a large vegetarian salad bar/buffet!  This was my first and LAST visit for so many reasons besides the lack of meat.  There was no assistance in directing us on how the restaurant operates. For instance, guests pick up plates and trays as soon as you enter and then you proceed down the single row vegetarian salad bar (which was soaking wet because there was a woman wiping it down every few minutes for some reason and not wringing the dish cloth very well) and pay at the end of it. No one directs you to beverages or the fact that there is another side of the restaurant that has the vegetarian soups (I think there were 5 to choose from), three types of bread including cornbread, and sad looking deserts like plain chocolate brownies and a couple of healthy muffins. They have a soft-serve ice cream station, but no cakes, pies, cobblers, pudding, cheesecakes, or cookies (not even oatmeal-raisin).    We sat at our table (all self - seating) after we figured out how to get our food and beverages by watching other people, because no one working there offered any help to my husband and myself who obviously looked as if this was our first time at this poor excuse of a restaurant. We even had to place our trays on a vacant table next to us because it seemed the thing to do as we saw other people doing the same. Again, no guidance or help from the staff in clearing tables.    We paid $32 for myself, my husband, and a friend of ours for soup and vegetables at a fully self-serve restaurant. It wasn't worth it especially in this town where we could have gone to any number of the neighborhood buffets for the same price and had more of a variety of foods AND have someone serve us our beverages (with refills), clean our tables, and answer any questions we may have about the buffet.   Sweet Tomatoes was totally sour and not worth another visit."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years now. Always enjoying my visits but lately the cleanliness of the place has been poor. For starters the mens bathroom is in extremely poor condition. The sink has rust running right through the middle of the basin. More importantly the silverware and plates have food stuck to them. The tapioca was soggy and looked like it was mixed with water. I shouldve took pics but I failed to."}
{"text":"Disappointed in Sweet Tomatoes tonight. I walked in with my family around 6pm and they were out of Salad and there was no urgency to make more. How does this happen? Not properly managed? Understaffed? Careless workers? This was upsetting. We walked out because of their lack of preparation. As a restaurant in my opinion, your efficiency is based on your busiest day at full capacity. If you can't run smoothly at that level, you need to adjust your training and leadership."}
{"text":"Travelin Shoes just arrived. Fill up your plate, pay $14.92, eat and drink your way to vegetable heaven. It's a buffet so create whatever you like. It's Vegtastic! Oh yeah, pasta and soup. Hmmm can I fit in desert? Love this place! Wait! That's not all...Great music! I almost broke out in song!"}
{"text":"I love the food. I especially like the dairy free ice cream they serve, since I am allergic to dairy. it was some of the best I ever had. Conscientious staff"}
{"text":"I was super excited when this Sweet Tomatoes opened up since it's so much closer than the one at Best of the West. It feels smaller but the salad bar is just as great and now there are the \"premium\" toppings (more than just the cups of chicken from before). The selection is always consistent. I love love love the bran muffins and they replenish them fairly often so there are fresh ones out. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is very helpful and friendly. If you're not a Club Veg member, sign up! The deals are amazing."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time, and it's always amazing. There isn't a large variety of food but there's no need, the food they have is more than enough. The food is excellent and the staff is super friendly. A special mention to the manager who went out of his way to help me and was really helpful. We will continue to come here"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the negative reviews come from.  We've been coming here for years (probably 50-60 total meals) and I can only think of one or two experiences that were just mediocre and none that were bad.  This place amazes me, because it's one of the few buffet places where the food is actually consistently good and fresh.  Many of their dishes are always served, but they also do rotational dishes based around specific themes for limited times.  That keeps the menu from getting stale.   The salad bar is long enough for the 100 yard dash and the veggies and all the accompanying toppings are countless and plentiful in quantity.  The salad bar is just the starter.  They also have a hot food stations that serve rotating dishes of various pasta, sweet and baked potatoes, pizza, multiple breads and muffins, desserts, drinks, and a 6-7 choice soup bar that's outstanding!  Their soups are very good and made in-house.  What I like best is the value.  You can find coupons for different deals, but we use the Family Meal Deal that feeds 2 adults and 2 kids for a flat $19.99 + drinks.  You can't find a better selection of healthy choices anywhere for less.  If you go to Sweet Tomatoes expecting a Michelin star dining experience, you will be disappointed.  If you expect lots of good, fresh dining options at a great price, you will be pleased with your choice to eat here.  TIP: If you plan on visiting regularly, try to get the kids drink cups.  They offer free refills on future visits."}
{"text":"All I can say is...Cool and Refreshing!  On a hot summer day, nothing better, fresh Vegetables, oven baked pastries, and homemade soups...Yum"}
{"text":"WTH?  People are complaining about the \"industrial look\", the fact that they serve alcohol, and the décor being so avant-garde?  I guess that's more an indication that the regulars are more into the traditional cookie-cutter midwestern fast-food chain (Denny's, for example). A little style scare you?  Get out of Arizona sometime and discover the 21st century is what I say. This is the coolest Sweet Tomatoes I've ever been to. And the food is great."}
{"text":"A quick and healthy lunch option.....  Sweet Tomatoes offers a salad/soup/pasta bar at a very reasonable price.  The value here is great, and if you come early, the food is very fresh.  Be sure to try the muffins, they are the highlight of the food offered here.    My only complaint is that a few times I've been here for a late lunch, the salad and soup selections are messy, and need to be maintained.  This is a very small complaint, since this happens at just about every buffet, but it should be noted that early is really better when dining here.  While I've never eaten a tomato here, the name sums it up:  \"Light, healthy, colorful, inexpensive.\""}
{"text":"Great service. The manager greeted us when we arrived and explained how it all worked (I had never been to a Sweet Tomatoes before). I'm really not a \"salad\" type of person, but every once in a while I don't mind. I do like soup, though, and they had several to choose from. I just found them OK. The salad was just about the same as any other salad to me. I mean lettuce is lettuce, so it's hard to compare. Since it's a buffet, you had many options for your salad to choose from. I liked how they had some pasta and pizza. Overall, the food was just OK and the service was good."}
{"text":"This is a Sweet Tomatoes, no more or less.  The facility is maybe a little nicer than many.  It tried to turn into one of the new \"bistro\" locations and remodeled but abandoned that concept with every one else.  Still, the facility is nice.  The food is the same as you see everywhere.  Beware, it's easy to rack up a 3000 calorie salad here.  The down side is that this chain is overpriced.  You can always find coupons online, but even with you're in for a considerably more expensive salad than a lot of other places."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes but usually visit a different location but I like the warm colors of this one and the layout of the seats. Additionally the food was very good as was our server. My favorite dish was the albondigas locas soup which was slightly spicy but flavorful. The Wonton happiness salad hasn't been on the salad bar lately but you can ask for the salad dressing and make your own. Sign up club veg and they will send coupons and update you on the variety of flavors, dishes and specials every month. Right now they have their red lava cake starting but only at dinner. I don't give 5 stars because the meat has been removed from the salad bar nada the foccacia bread was put a few times we went for refills but I will be back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"We went there just yesterday and the reason I'm giving 3 s is because of the few items they served they were tasteless and the soups had more herbs floating than anything else .   The place was clean and the service was great   I know this is a place where you don't get your average burger with fries or fish ,nothing like that but  we payed $30 just for tasteless food and that $30 was with a coupon for drinks   When going to this places keep in mind that maybe the only best thing is the salad  passed that area you will only find 6 different soups -pizza- mac &cheese -pasta noodles and for dessert  ice cream , chocolate mouse , jell-O , tapioca and apples   so be prepared to be hungry with in an hour  many of this places called soup plantation in Ca have so many more items  to choose from and tasty (think they are the same chain even tho they have different  names because soup plantation coupons are accepted here ."}
{"text":"I must say Sweet Tomatoes is a Saaweeeeet Treat ;)   I love the fact that there is a huge salad bar with salads already prepared and always fresh. A big plus for people on a diet (me), veggie lovers, and vegetarians. The variety of soups were hits too. We were lucky enough on our 1st visit to experience the \"Asian Ginger\" soup, which according to the staff, is only offered once a year in Sept :( This by far is one of the best soups I've ever tasted! You can add your own ingredients such as tofu, mushrooms, or green onions. mmmm. Be on the lookout for it next time.  My daughter is already spoiled, but Sweet Tomatoes spoils my little girl even more by having the Macaroni and Cheese dish, kid size muffins (blueberry, banana nut, etc.), and for dessert - ice cream w/miniaturized ice cream cones. Definitely a way to kids hearts and mines.   The quality... the atmosphere... and the service are key leading points to bring us back again soon."}
{"text":"Best Salad etc place....love the salad the gluten free muffins the service...the north vegas location was clean, helpful and had a professional staff......will certainly return next trip to vegas.....have been to other location in FL and other NV locations and this location is by far the best, not saying others were not good, just that this is my fav......GM Chad was so helpful"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They always greet me with genuine care and full of smiles. Rick the General Manager, Michael (kitchen prep) and the rest of the staff are absolutely amazing. The place is kept clean and the food are delicious. I can't complain about anything...I would give more than 5 stars if I could. If you ever want to eat at a reasonable price at a buffet, this is the location. They will take great care of you! :)"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch and stayed visiting with friends for a couple hours.  Everything I tried was fresh and very good  I normally don't eat at buffets but very pleased with this one.  Price reasonable"}
{"text":"First timer, thought  it was a restaurant and realized it was a buffet. Kind of don't like buffet but I tried it anyways! Great selection on salads. Soups are awesome. Desserts were good and the staff was really friendly. I think I found a buffet that I will enjoy."}
{"text":"Sound levels continue to be a problem with this restaurant.   Sometimes one of the machines in the center (the one for frozen yogurt? the one for ice?) makes a loud, throbbing noise that is disturbing.   Other times the music is oppressively loud.  On our last visit, when the restaurant was relatively empty, the intrusive music made it hard to converse or think about anything else.   The song tracks have tempos that are too fast for relaxing eating.    Sometimes the songs are not so much sung as \"belted out.\"   We love the food, the wait staff, and the people working hard behind the counters.   We would eat at this Sweet Tomatoes branch more often if we didn't always have to wonder what sound level and what kind of music will greet us when we arrive."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes, you can have your 4th star back and a 5th for good measure.  You've redeemed yourself from the Field Kitchen fiasco and are once again the all-you-can-eat salad bar we'd come to know and love.  The cool thing is that this location got to keep the Field Kitchens decor, which was really quite nice.  The interior looks fresh, chic, and has plants growing out of the walls, hanging from the ceiling, and in vases on the tables.  The family dining table is a nice touch too.  The food (including the mac 'n cheese) is back to it's previous quality.  I've newly discovered the french onion soup, which is fantastic.  And they brought back the sprinkles for your ice cream! Whew!  Sweet Tomatoes, I appreciate what you tried to do, but I even more appreciate that you listened to your customer's [loud] opinions and put your restaurant back to normal.  And great job on improving things to even better than before."}
{"text":"Well. As we came in, it was kinda uninviting due to just salads and soups for $8.99 so we end up walking out. Since we wanted to try this place we came back in. Got our salad, then boom there's actually more food in the back area. The best thing is that this place serves healthy food. So it don't matter if you stuff your face coz you know you're eating good healthy food. I didn't mind at all. They serve gluten free food which was bomb and taste really good. I ate so much though lol. We're definitely coming again. I just love food. I didn't felt guilty eating so much food. A+"}
{"text":"The absolute worst restaurant.  It's filthy, poorly run and an embarrassment to the Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes organization.  We walked in on Sunday evening around 7:45.  The restaurant was about half empty.  The salas bar was stocked but only one side was open when you got to the cashier.  There was only one and unfortunately it was not on my side. We stood there and was ignored for a few minutes.  I finally asked if someone could help me ring us up and the girl I asked looked like I had asked her to name all the state capitols.  The kid that was on the register on the other side finally came over and threw a clip board towards me and said,  \"SIGN HERE\". It's in caps because he barked the order at me.  Rude was the least of it.  When we went to sit down we counted 12 tables that were empty but filled with dishes.  Once we sat, I went to get some soup. The chicken noodle soup looked great.  The soup spoons were so dirty that I landed up eating the soup with a fork.  It would have been great to share my frustrations with a manager but I could only assume that she/he was busy doing something way more important than running the restaurant. Then again, the restaurant wouldn't have been in the shape it way if the management was doing something/ anything to take care of business.   I'd bet their salary they are down in sales- and its no wonder why.  We've been going to Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes for more than 25 years and I guess it's time to move on."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  There are plenty of salad ingredients, including some fancy fruits and vegetables you wouldn't normally put in your salad at home.  Everything is fresh and clean, and legibly labeled above the items on the plastic dome shielding the food from contaminants.  Behind the salad bar and pasta bar counters, plenty of food servers are constantly freshening up the ingredients and wiping up spills, splashes, and the occasional spoon/tong mishap from diners.  In addition to the wide selection of salad ingredients, there's also every dressing imaginable to choose from.  If you don't wish to put together your own unique salad, you can instead grab your choice of an already prepared and labeled gourmet salad.  I recommend the Asian chicken salad mix with its crunchy won tons and zesty sweet dressing.  There are also hot \"bars,\" with do-it-yourself pasta and soup stations.  These items are controlled via hot water tanks and heating bulbs, so the freshness isn't always what it should be.  The noodles tend to be stuck together and using two tongs sometimes works best.  They have a good selection of tasty soups, everything from French Onion to Minestrone.  In addition, they've also got tasty breads and simple pizzas in this section.  It's always nice to have a small square of pizza with my salad.    Finally, we have the dessert section, with a do-it-yourself soft ice cream machine and plenty of candy sprinkles or nut toppings to choose from.  There's also variety of cakes and cookies here.    I guess I should also mention the fountain drink station, which includes options for hot coffee and tea.    The major downside to this establishment is the seating process.  It's a cafeteria setting, so you may find yourself holding your food and beverage tray, craning your neck to spot an open & clean  table that will fit your party, while kids and other diners zip past you.  Once seated though, the experience can be enjoyed.  However, if you want to keep your table, you and your party will have to return for seconds or thirds in shifts.    This is not a restaurant where you can take your leftovers home.  Although, apparently you can order a box to go, fill it up, and take it away with you.  But if you dine in, it is all you can eat for under $10.  Of course, there's only so much anyone can eat, and with all the choices and temptations it can be a bit overwhelming.  You may find that you want a little bit of everything and end up gorging, which is never healthy -- even when the food is.    Sweet Tomatoes is an establishment I visit from time to time, but I usually wait till I have a coupon, so I can really feel like I'm getting a good deal without having to stuff myself.  I will also visit the newer location on West Flamingo next time, because from what I've read it sounds like it might have a nicer atmosphere.  So maybe I'll post a review of that one in the future."}
{"text":"Is there anyone in customer service at Sweet Tomatoes/Soup Plantation?  A couple of months ago there was a gift card promotion, so I got 1 for my parents' anniversary and 1 for me to use.  My parents used their gift card on their anniversary and should have gotten the Senior discount of $7.49 each when they go before 4 pm; they went around 1ish.  They were charged the regular adult price.  On top of that the cashier did not give them back their card.  A few weeks later when I meet my Mom for lunch and we talked about their gift card, she said they used it all during the ONE visit for both of them.  I went online to check the balance, then called the customer service #.  All they can do was take down my information and someone will contact me.  That was 3 weeks ago.    My parents live around the corner from this location and we all come here often, but after I use up my gift card WE won't be coming back.  I will find another place for us go.  Talk about ripping off people - how does it feel to rip off the old folks Sweet Tomatoes?"}
{"text":"The quinoa black bean chili and cornbread had me swooning. Catch the buttermilk biscuits fresh off the oven. And dont forget their gluten friendly coconut muffins!!! Yelp had a 15% online discount coupon, and we used it. Soo worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I love me some Sweet Tomatoes. The fact that I can build my own salad of whatever the heck I want without having to deal with a menu choice is fantastic. And I love all the soup options, bread, pasta and ice cream as well.  The Sweet Tomatoes on Southern and McClintock though is terrible. It used to be a regular ST, but it closed and opened as the Field Kitchen experiment. I never went there when it was like that, but I heard it was bad.  The reopening of this location with the promise that they are \"just like every other Sweet Tomatoes\" out there is so untrue. First of all, the whole place reeks of rosemary from the chicken they grill at the end of the salad line. It's super overwhelming. Second, the options in the salad bar aren't marked (so you get to guess what you're dumping on your plate) and they don't have nearly as many options as other locations.  The layout is horrendous as well. To get to the soups, pastas and breads, you have to walk through the line that is inevitably standing at the ice cream machine. Which is in competition with the line at the soda machine - because there isn't enough room for everyone to get around. And put in more than one soda machine for crying out loud! Especially when the ice takes freaking forever to dispense.  I will continue to go to Sweet Tomatoes, but definitely not this one. I'll drive out of my way to go to one that I know is real and still good."}
{"text":"What a great place to have lunch. The food was fresh and delicious. Andy was very attentive and professional. A very clean and comfortable setting. The selection of ice teas were wonderful.  The creamy rosemary potato and the kale and potato soup was wonderful and a great change to the plain soup. Cornbread with honey butter is to die for. Will make sure to eat here at least once a week.."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this Sweet Tomatoes location for over a decade. I like it better than some of the other locations in the valley.  If you want a salad you can't go to a better place. If you don't care about salad there's also a ton of other yummy stuff to eat. The cornbread is a must have.  There are coupons available online!"}
{"text":"This sweet tomatoes has really gone down hill. We have been coming to this location for years and its always been good. A few months ago the restaurant got a makeover. Its looks great! Sadly it only looks great because the cleanliness of the restaurant has really suffered. First off trying to get a clean plate is almost impossible. I litterally checked 10 plates before i got a clean one, the beverage cups have food stuck to them and smudge marks all over. We even had to  clean off the forks. Unbelievable!  I let one of the workers know about the plates, she didnt seem surprised and  her response was that the dishwasher just doesn't wash them that good. Needless to say we are never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Usually come to this place on a weekday or early Saturday.  The crowd is reasonable on those days.  Came here this Sunday it's crowded which isn't a big deal, but you can clearly tell that they are under staffed.  Food stations are a mess and food doesn't look as fresh as it normally does.  I still give them a 4 star because we are regulars on other days however Sunday's they definitely needs some work.  I just picked over the foods that didn't look as fresh and still had an enjoyable meal.  I don't think I'll be back on Sunday's though."}
{"text":"Nice restourant.  Healthy food and nice and friendly environment.  The fresh fruits, salads and services are good.  Go sweet tomatoes and promote healthy living."}

{"text":"Life's question to people who eat at Souper Salad: Why? Why would you punish yourself with a crappy salad bar when you could spoil yourself by eating at Sweet Tomatoes? Ohhhhh my gosh! Sweet tomatoes: and endless ocean of comfort foods, all you can eat for a low price. Sounds too good to be true doesn't it? I've been eating here since I was a little kid, not at this one specifically but at this chain. It is called Souplantation in California. A huge line of salad goodies (a ton of yummy treats, too many to name), usually 6-8 different soups, potato bar, pasta bar, bread bar, muffin/dessert bar, fruit/jello etc..., and a soft serve bar. Not to mention they have a pretty great beverage selection. It's hard to not overeat here but I never feel guilty since I eat so many veggies while I'm here. Beware if you go at 6, this place gets rocking for dinner. If you're lucky, you'll be there while they walk around with hot chocolate chip cookies. Bottom line. You like choices, you like salad bars? Eat here. :-)"}
{"text":"A little pricey but always tasty. Menu is always changing and so many delicious homemade breads, muffins, soups, and so much more. There is always something new and delicious to eat! I regular this place when they send out coupons. Nice friendly staff and always clean give it a try you won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"When I first experienced the salad-buffet restaurant concept (well, beyond Sizzler anyway) back in 1992, I thought it was the greatest invention ever.  \"I'm eating healthy!\" I told myself, \"and therefore I can eat whatever I want, because everything in this place should be good for me! Including multiple bowls of tapioca pudding for dessert!\"   Fast forward to now, where I've gone to this specific Sweet Tomatoes location a number of times, and I realize I have aged, as I now think to myself, \"How many calories am I actually ingesting for this simple 'healthy' lunch?\"  First, there's the salad bar. Somehow the pop-up dishes here have issues being completely clean. Not the best sign. Now, when you're trying to eat healthy, you realize that you're skipping at least half of what's offered in the salad bar. You're limitied to the veggies. Maybe some \"fat-free\" honey mustard dressing (which is probably still laden with high-fructose corn syrup). And thus when you're thinking \"healthy\" and carry this over to the soup/pizza/muffin/pasta area you realize you're more or less going to skip everything, save a baked sweet potato with some chives and salsa maybe. And an odd melon ball from the fruit bar.   Now, when I was 18 I ate EVERYTHING at these places and enjoyed myself to no end. Hell, even several years later when Sweet Tomatoes opened up in my hometown, my appetite felt like it was in a culinary Six Flags and wanted to be on each ride at least twice before closing. But many years later, I'm realizing eating everything in such places means I gotta go buy a new pair of work slacks. Which costs, uh, money.   And when I take stock of everything healthy on my tray, is it worth the $7.50 or however much it is? One plate of salad? A baked sweet potato? A bowl of cut up melon? No way. Especially since the quality of the veggies isn't that great to begin with (such as the driest broccolli I've ever had).  But if you throw caution to the wind and think, \"I'm way hungry right now - and I am not going to give a rat's ass towards being good today\" then hey, you've found your nirvana, because amidst the 1500 calories you just ate, you probably got your day's worth of folate, fiber, and vitamin C, along with a perfect ending of your very own soft-serve cone of chocolate-vanilla swirl."}
{"text":"Very good food. It's was great to go somewhere different. The selection of salads and soups are amazing. Went here with a family group. It was quite busy. Great location and nice atmosphere. Would recommend to others especially if looking for a buffet type place to eat at."}
{"text":"Love sweet tomatoes but to be honest I think is too expensive, 2 adults a teenager and a 8 year old is almost $40 . Just my thought and also coupons don't seem to do much and they never use the right one."}
{"text":"The Sweet Tomatoes on Ray Road is really run down/dirty and in desperate need of remodel.  The bathroom is really gross...hate to see what the kitchen looks like.  There is a newer, remodeled Sweet Tomatoes on Southern/Rural area in Tempe. Even though we are two minutes from the Ray Road Sweet Tomatoes, we drive to Tempe. It's worth the drive from Ahwatukee to go to the Sweet Tomatoes in Tempe.  Better offerings, cleaner environment, looks like there is someone managing the location in Tempe.  Also, I think Friday is kids day in Ahwatukee/Ray Road...might want to avoid this time if you are worried about germs.  Most of the kids are running out of control (certainly not the restaurants fault!)  Love Sweet Tomatoes, just not the location on Ray Road."}
{"text":"By far the best Sweet Tomatos franchise I've eaten in.  4 stars for the food, toom off 1 star because a few salads were bland and no clam chowder, and 5 stars for the service."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite buffet. It is always fresh,delicious, and You can choose anything you want and eat as much of it as you like. They always have fantastic coupons that you can have emailed to you on line or find in the paper. The price is right. The food is always just made. They are very friendly and they even have Sunday breakfast now.  It is great for the whole family everyone will find something they like. The best thing is it is Super healthy. Love it always."}
{"text":"I really love all the Sweet Tomatoes that i  have ever been to in the valley. This one even has a few extras. Incredibly clean like all the others. They kitchen is wide open behind glass so  you can see just how clean it is.  The food selection is wonderful and everything is always fresh! Plenty of parking in the giant parking lot. You can even sit outside if you can stand the heat. Well, for the extra added touch.... there is a pond outside filled with fish, turtles and ducks. You can bring some food with you(Bread has no nutritional value for animals), and feed the animals either before or after you feed yourself. Kids absolutely love it! So do i!  Also they always have coupons which save a lot of $$$ as well."}
{"text":"I'm really not a salad person. Never was. I still like it here.   I really don't like how you're forced to pick out a salad before you pay(I was worried you couldn't go back to the salad bar, but you could so it's all good). The price is decent enough until you ask for a drink and you have to pay more than $10. My favorite salad was the Chicken Wonton Salad, mostly because I'm a sucker for Asian-style salads. Once I was done with my salad, I hit up carb-city with the pizza bread and cornbread muffins, which pretty much totally negated the healthfulness of my salad, and that pizza bread's pretty damn addictive to boot. The soups are delicious though, I couldn't stop getting bowls of gumbo.  The dessert section was boring to me, but you really shouldn't expect that much out of a soup and salad place to begin with.  If you're trying to be healthy/lose weight, stick strictly to the salad bar and the soups, avoid every other section as all of that stuff is filled with carbs. If not, then just go for it, the pizza bread is amazing."}
{"text":"Decent pricing and fresh food. Good customer service. I like getting their pomegranate iced tea and vanilla nut coffee. Clean environment and their food is always immense. It can get busy especially on sundays. However, theres never been a wait time all the times i went. Theres a good variety of different soups to choose from. Also, the diy baked potato is one of my faves. Try googling for coupons cause usually they have it. I used the 2 for $22 with beverages coupon from online."}
{"text":"I frequent Souplantation so I was curious as to what Sweet Tomatoes was about. Well, there's nothing different. Salad, soup, breads, pasta - pretty much the same at Sweet Tomatoes that you would find at Souplantation. Salads were good however it was strange that they were made in the back and then brought out. Unlike Souplantation where the premixed salads are made in front of you, for the most part. Got to end of the salad bar where we paid. The cashier was friendly but not over and beyond. It was very busy and seating was scarce. The restaurant itself felt small. Found a booth, placed my salad, and headed to the soups and pastas. The soup was very watery. Not the consistency of what I'm used to - not sure if this is a Sweet Tomatoes exclusive or if this Sweet Tomatoes just always has watery soup. Even the chili was watery...  They also had focaccia - a pepperoni focaccia and some roasted veggie one with thyme - both good however the bottom was soggy. Overall not a bad experience. There was some opportunity in execution of the food but I would go again... P.s. sign up for their emails and get coupons..."}
{"text":"All areas are clean. Nice service. Salad bar and soup bar are full of food. They offer many soups and toppings for your salads!!"}
{"text":"This place is everything I love wrapped into one. Salad, soup, bread, and desserts. You can build your own salad or select a pre-made salad. Unfortunately you cannot go back through the salad line...so stock up! Soup, breads, and desserts are unlimited. I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Salad and potato bar for the masses.  Good grief, pay a couple dollars   more for something good.  The mac and cheese looked like it came from a Kraft box.  There is no way I would go back.  Made for big people who want to think they are eating healthy."}
{"text":"We like the large choice of veggies for salad. I do wish that there was a little more chicken or something for protein. The soups are decent for buffet, I do not like unpeeled potatoes in them, but I do like the tomato basil. The iced tea is good- large choice of drinks. Soft serve ice cream, muffins, fruit and pudding for dessert. Good for groups and when you want to load on veg!"}
{"text":"I always went to the Sweet Tomatoes on Indian Bend, then the one on Camelback, it closed, so I went to Metro Center, it was ok, I went back to Indian Bend, it was good...then I went to Tempe! Look no further! I have found my favorite!! The Tempe location has been here for years but was remodeled about 1 1/2 years ago, according to staff. It is much nicer, comfy, warm and welcoming inside. There are glass hanging planters. There are glass jars on the table with fresh rosemary speigs. They have glass glasses! They serve beer and wine along with all your Sweet Tomatoes favorites. Allie was super friendly and really hustled to keep the dining room clean. She answered questions about the company and was very knowledgeable. All my favs, Tomato soup, wonton salad, rosemary focacia, a yummy salad with spinach, beets, etc!  The only reason it is 4 instead of 5 stars is that they don't bring around the hot chocolate chip cookies anymore and the chocolate muffins were real dry! I will go back!!"}
{"text":"Although, I really like this place. they started adding more chunks of tomatoes in the chili. Plus to make matters worse they now serve Pepsi, why would you decide to serve inferior soda? Maybe they are in trouble and trying to save money. At any rate will not be going as often as I use to."}
{"text":"I visited this location with my 18 year old daughter and 22 year old son, with the intention of having a healthy meal, and that we did. If you are ok with mainly soups and salads, this is the place to go.    But we has an absolutely HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE because of the manager on duty. The treatment we received was DISGRACEFUL AND SHOCKING. This is all done by one man, ..the manager. UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE HARASSED, NAME CALLED, AND HUMILIATED BY MANAGEMENT STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AND TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO ALSO!! I was told I was a thief and accused of stealing, was told to leave and never come back, laughed and pointed at by the \"manager\" as he got other customers to join in, then I WAS CALLED A HILLBILLY. Let me let you know we are a typical middle class family, income of about 110K a year, dressed clean and casual in shorts, sandals, & casual shirt. We look and act just like anyone else, an WE DO NOT STEAL..    Here's my story: When you walk in, the first thing you do is grab a tray and make your salads. At the end of the salad bar line are the 2 registers, one on each side, where you pay. My son was on 1 side, and my daughter and I on the other due to a crowd. When we got up to the registers the man said  \"Hi folks, would you like drinks with your meals?\" I made sure he knew the 3 of us were together and I was also paying for my son on the other side, and replied, \"Yes sure\". He then handed me a stack of 3 cups. I took the wrong debit card out of my purse at first, I had just come from the bank and I had my kids cards mixed up with mine, so the card I used was declined. He came over and very loudly and rudely stated, \"This card was declined!\". I apologized and paid with a $50 dollar bill. (Thanks for being polite about it, but whatever, I blew it off.) We went and sat down, and during our hour there we made 2 trips up to the bar and filled our drink cups twice with tea & soda. When we finished eating the same man who rang us up approached the table. He had no name badge, but looked like a manager because he had a dress shirt on. He told us the blue cups that we had are for water only and he's been watching us drink other beverages. I was surprised by this and really didn't get it since I had no idea about their colored cup system, nor why he was saying this because I thought I DID pay for our drinks. When I tried to say that, he rudely interrupted me and over talked me and insisted on us paying for the drinks. I agreed, still a bit taken back, and he walked away to go ring up 3 drinks. During the few minutes he was gone, I had a minute to grasp what just happened and became irritated. When he arrived back and said \"I need $5.16\", I informed him that I was not paying for anything else, and that when we paid we were asked if we wanted drinks, said yes, and were handed cups. He said, \"Well I was the one who took care of you and remember you because your card was declined.\"  I was shocked he threw that I my face and said, \"What??\" He then told us that we were thieves, and told us to leave and never come back. I told him wed be leaving in a minute anyway and he walked away to go stand at the door and chuckle with his employees and other customers that were leaving, as he clearly talked about us and pointed. We get up and head towards the door where he was standing. My upset son tripped on the way out and dropped & spilled the beverage he was holding on the floor in front of this manager. I immediately started apologizing 3 times for the spill while all this man could do was rudely nod and say, \"Oh that's real nice, You people are real funny. You did that on purpose. That's real classy\". I explained it was an accident and he told me I was not and told his employee to call the police. I sad \":Fine, call the police, we will wait right outside for them. What is your name and I want your corporate offices phone number. He refused to give me either, and told me I can ask the police when they got there. He the called us all hillbillies as we went out the door. My son didn't like that he called his mother a hillbilly and had a few words about that one. My kids and I waited outside for police about 15 minutes. I was shaking and couldn't even speak I was so angry and belittled and humiliated. He continued to laugh and point at us through the glass, talking about us to each customer who left and every employee who passed him. After 15 min we just walked to our car. We were followed at a distance and were watched all the way to our car. All I have to say is it was UNBELIEVABLE. I cant even believe someone in a professional position would act like that. I am a manager in retail business myself, and would NEVER EVER get away with anything close to what this man did. I'm still in shock the next day, and cant believe this all happened."}
{"text":"Love going here. Fresh salads, delicious soups, pizza, mac and cheese, and yogurt to end it all! Makes my day, I think it'll make yours too!"}
{"text":"i did like the salads a lot but the soups where not that good"}
{"text":"This Location is slipping. Had dinner here last night. Wife thought some of the lettuce was too old. I thought the cornbread, which is one of the foods I really look forward too, wasn't as good.  Some of the little food signs were missing. Men's restroom was a disgrace.  Positive - soups still wonderful. Complimented lady cleaning the tables (she was prompt) and she said she had been doing it there 20 years. Place is due for a refresh."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the chain restaurants, something blah about your run of the mill, every cities got at least one type of places. Something to be said about them though, if you're hungry, don't feel like cooking and want to satisfy a craving you have a go to plan and can count on them. Found myself having one of those days recently, craving a good salad on the way home from a track meet. Out in the sun all day braving 100* weather and a smorgasbord of cool crisp fresh salad options seemed like it would hit the spot.  What did I do you ask, I was up in the Arrowhead area so I put in my DH for such an occasion and pulled in to Sweet Tomatoes.  They've never let me down and came in clutch! The bar is always stocked with fresh options and the servers are super attentive at their tables.  They have a great selection of soups, chowders and yes, kid friendly options if you have picky little ones that will only eat pizza or Mac and cheese. To satisfy your sweet tooth there is even a soft serve bar with all the toppings."}
{"text":"Nice salad bar. Reminds me of Souplantation. I will be back. Wish they had clam chowder and a more desserts!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Yummy!!! Always fresh and delicious! Love the salads, Focasia bread pizza, the muffins are great too..  The pasta is ok, but often very blan tasting. The BEST Strawberry Lemonade Ive ever had.. We love this place! Watch your mailbox for coupons."}
{"text":"This loc8ion has made some nice improvements 2 their interior in the last year which make it a more pleasant dining experience (dimmer lighting & earthy toned walls). My light~sensitive eyes used 2 squint, straining against the harsh bright lighting ricocheting off the white walls which used 2 give me a bit of a headache & felt more like being in a hospital cafeteria setting. (Sunglasses indoors r'nt cool). Even b4 these upgrades, I still preferred this central loc8ion over the I-17 North Black Canyon Access Rd 1 in atmosphere & service.      I do enjoy the selections & most items I've tried have looked, smelled, & tasted of fresh ingredients & good 2 the palate. I don't eat much pasta or breads so I can't provide much input in that regard other than the gluten~free coconut muffins which I couldn't get enough of. My dinner companion mentioned their pasta didn't have much flavor, leaving over 1/2 of it 2 b taken away. I always luv their sweet potatoes w/ a li'l brown sugar/cinnamon.       Most Xs their soups r flavorful & deliciously appealing w/ a nice selection 2 choose from (potato/leek a personal fave) & usually their tapioca pudding is perfect w/ the right consistency. My companion really enjoys the foccacia bread(s) & the servers r always very nice & accomod8ing which is not always the case other loc8ions. I'd steer clear of the caramel topping as it tastes like some1 puts salt in it & isn't complimentary in passing 4 what it's supposed 2 b w/ bit of a funky after~taste, but overall this was an enjoyable place 2 go this wk~end (& whenever I'm in Central Phx)."}
{"text":"Always a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes. They have a great selection for vegetarians and meat eaters. I enjoy their soups and the pizza bread they have as well. When I went this time they had an amazing jalapeño Mac and cheese that was delicious (add some Tabasco and its next level;)"}
{"text":"Ummmm...  everything here was absolutely great!!  I've been here once before with a family friend several years ago and the food was good. Honestly don't remember the food being this good but am so glad the decision was made to come back. Clean environment and staff was helpful. Food like I said was great   2 thumbs up in this guys opinion. Thank you sweet tomatoes"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. When you first walk in it looks like a cafeteria where you make your own salad. There are so many toppings! You pay at the register, all you can eat plus a drink was about $10. Then you seat yourself. There's another part of the restaurant where you can get pasta, soup, and dessert. All the food was so yummy! They have a lot of vegetarian options and even a vegan soup!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuuum yum yum!   Sweet tomato is yuuuuuuuuum!  I go thinking I'm being somewhat healthy and leave with a tummy full of bread!  Gahh how did this happen again!?!?! Hahaha"}
{"text":"It doesn't always have to be fancy schmancy to satisfy my hunger.  I much prefer Sweet Tomatoes to other salad bar joints because their ingredients are fast superior. They have several types of greens and the toppings can include fresh beets, butternut squash, garbanzo beans, and more! They always have multiple soups with at least one vegetarian option and different pastas, pizzas and muffins.  I also like their themes (strawberry, lemon, orange, etc.)...keeps things interesting. They have sodas, flavored teas, juices, milk and water and a soft serve machine with various toppings for dessert. Bring your student i.d. for a little discount, too!"}
{"text":"This is the second time dining at this location. The good is fresh and, fir the most part, very healthy. Lots of choices for all kinds of tastes with the exception of meat. Great selection of soups, salad fixins, pasta, baked goods... Highly recommended. Go online and check for coupons to save yourself a few bucks."}
{"text":"I choose sweet tomato when I am crunched for time and don't want to sit around at a regular restaurant, but yet don't want to slam down junky fast food. When I go here I am in and out usually less than 40 minutes, because you pretty much just grab what you want and get down to business, no waiting to be served, and it's relatively small inside. So, if you want a quick but healthy meal, this is a great alternative.  Food is fresh and there is so many variety of toppings, you can't really go wrong and will make the prefect salad to your liking. I prefer to make my own, over their pre made selections. I always get a coupon before coming here. You can get them sent to your email, or they can easily be found online.   I love their iced and green teas. Soups have good variety as well and hot food bar is always great but consist of lots of carbs...so I tend to make that very limited! It can get a little busy in there, and you feel like everyone is almost bumping into each other and can get a little hectic, so that is annoying sometimes. One time someone (an employee at that) did literally bump into me hard and I dropped a small plate of food. No bueno.  Other than that, sweet tomato is a great healthy and quick eatery."}
{"text":"I was initially fairly unimpressed with Sweet Tomatoes after my first visit, but have come to like it a little more each time I visit.  The food is pretty basic, but there are healthy choices. The salads, soups and pastas aren't necessarily outstanding dishes, but they are decent.  The customer service is OK, but could use some improvements. I have found that some locations are strict with coupons. If you can find a good coupon though Sweet Tomatoes is worth visiting."}
{"text":"No protein option! No chicken, no beef. Nothing.  All it is a bread, salad and watery soup and pasta  But I like the ice cream"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes on Central got a much needed re-do on the décor. I don't know when because it had been that long since I'd been. I really do enjoy Sweet Tomatoes when I'm hankering for a salad & just can't pick a place I want one from. The prices have gone up substantially over the years & it's priced like a single high end salad would be now but with median ingredients. Kind of a bummer when you look at it that way vs. that you're paying for which is variety & a full meal. So if you're wanting a bunch of diff salads options go for it. It's tasty, clean & updated."}
{"text":"Always great eating here. Bought a gift card the other day for a friend and was in and out in less than two minutes. Always very happy with the service here."}
{"text":"I like this place veggies are fresh and soups delicious , they took the ingredients that they use to charge extra for no more confusion for some ppl I would like for them to have a better varieties in fruit tho ."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so good and I don't know if you can call their food healthy, but it seems healthier than other restaurants. Except the fact that you can stuff your face as much as you want to! My only complaint is the price, but I guess you can say that you have to charge that much for a buffet. I love the fact that they change their menu every month. Their soups are so delicious; I particularly love their onion soup. Also their pastas are very good, as well as the baked goods like the lemon or blueberry muffins."}
{"text":"I love this place! go there and spend like $12 to stuff my face on a huge fresh salad, pretty much all of their 7 soups and then dessert"}
{"text":"After resting at the hotel we headed out again on the road and it was close to dinner time. We remembered one of our twins Faith and  another family member mentioning about this awesome place. Braddah and Titah took us here and by golly wow!! It was fantastic! Love the salad bar carb section but most of all the soups! Gotta guarantee broke da mout their Mushroom soup! Along with the fresh hot cornbread is so yummy! Have have to try!  Thank you for taking us here and recommendations! we love it!"}
{"text":"I like going to Sweet Tomatoes when I want some comfort food. Soup, salad, cheesy bread and lava cake with tapioca. It is typically about $45 for a family of four. I always find a coupon online or here with the check-in so that's nice.   I love that they have a bounty of vegetarian options.   The only complaint is that on less busy nights like Sunday or throughout the week, sometimes they don't replenish the food as often and it isn't as fresh.  Overall, I enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I had forgotten how fresh and good this place is. Their salad bar was phenomenal and the eight soups delicious. Great value for lunch at $9.99 a person. Yes, there's unhealthy items like pizza, muffins, pasta, etc. but if you stick to the fresh food, you can enjoy a healthy meal. The mini ice cream cones for dessert are the perfect sinful pleasure!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today.  Last time we ate here, it was clean, the food was prepared very well and the ladies behind the food service kept everything exceptionally clean. Today, we found tables that rocked back and forth everywhere, the booth seats were filthy and the floor was something you would not want to look at again...food and spills everywhere.  When we tasted our salad the cucumbers were not fresh at all and could not be eaten. The chili was all tomatoes and overkill on spice. They don't serve tall glasses any longer, only small. The gals behind the food counter were not paying any attention to things needing attention, instead, they were too busy talking and laughing with each other.  Will not return to this Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Its a big salad bar. I was impressed with the flavors of dressing and the oriental chicken salad is really good. With a coupon $7 is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I go to Sweet tomatoes about once every three months because it's convenient next to my massage place. The salad bar is good but sometimes a vegetarian options on the soups are horrible. It's very pricey especially if you go there and don't get to eat a lot."}
{"text":"Some huge company own this place and Souplantation because they're identical which isn't a complaint for me. I like these kind of salad places. Come and eat as much salad as possible and this location wasn't bad. Salad was fresh. Also, military discount."}
{"text":"Came today with my girlfriend for her time she enjoyed the salad bar the pizza and spaghetti but not so much on the desert but she says she will return"}
{"text":"WOW! I had such an amazing experience here last night...  I had finished some shopping and recognized the name on the sign from a yelp review I had checked out just a few days earlier.  I wasn't sure if I was in a salad mood, but the scenario was way too serendipitous to pass up.  I was a little confused upon entering on where to start, but one of the servers showed me the ropes.  He was so sweet.  I loaded up on salad!  Wonderful selection of toppings.  After that I hit up the soup bar, pizza and desert only taking a little of each.  All of this for $11? Thank you God! I wish I could eat a lot because I would tear this place up!    The servers were really kind always checking to see if I was finding everything ok.  I haven't been this catered to in a buffet ever!  Abraham is such a sweetheart!  Be sure to tip before you leave, they work hard up in there!   I can't wait to take my NY friends here when they come visit!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Very cool laid back environment.  I LOVE that they did a gazillion free chocolate chip cookie runs throughout the restaurant while we were there!  And Sweet Tomatoes chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I've ever had.  My friends and I stayed quite a while here.  Great place to study and just chillax.  Really nice staff.  Make sure to check your weekly flyer for coupons!"}
{"text":"Where I come from we're accustomed to knowing it as Souplantation, but over here they call it Sweet Tomatoes. The idea and concept of having an All-You-Can-Eat Salad and Soup Buffet Style is very enticing and it's a great place to eat healthy! One thing I'm certain is this restaurant will always be my favorite go-to spot when I am craving for a ton of salad. I always pile my plate full of greens with an array of pretty colorful condiments. I was hoping they have the Asian Ginger Broth soup but it wasn't available. So I got the Chicken Noodle Soup which is still a good choice. The nice thing about this restaurant is that they do offer a variety of food choices like cold and hot pasta, focaccia bread and pizza, and an assortment of dessert such as fresh fruits, muffins, soft-serve ice cream and pudding. Signing up to receive discount coupons via email is a major plus on savings."}
{"text":"Come at 4 pm. It costs more because they just switched to dinner, but so much less crowded.  As good as it gets in Vegas for healthy food that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"This is our go-to-we-are-tired place, and I think we eat here probably weekly. The salad is fresh, and lots of variety. Since it's a buffet, each of us get to pick what we feel like that night.  I'm glad to see the buffet style back, with the addition of the skewers along with beer/wine. =P  Their chicken skewers are very tasty. My only slight negative is that some of the nicer soups and things that were added don't seem to be in the rotation. Great for the family, as our daughter can graze and find something that she likes."}
{"text":"Family favorite.  Could have a few more salad options on the salad bar.  My very favorite is the broccoli salad. They have some delicious chocolate chip cookies too. Not a big fan of the cheese they use in the foccocia bread. Overall a decent place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I don't visit often but when I do decide to come by, I always enjoy the food.   You start off with getting your fresh salad with all sorts of fixin's. I usually just opt for their Caesar Salad or the Asian Wonton Salad. You pay after you get your salad then once you're situated at your table, grab a drink and more entrees!  It's basically endless bread, soup, pasta, pizza, baked potato, ice cream etc.! Every month, they try to feature different dishes depending on the theme they choose. It was Italy when I last visited so they had 3 different pastas & various soups to commemorate Italian culture.  I just chose my usual staples; Garlic Foccasia Bread, Cheese Pizza, Corn Chowder, Broccoli & Cheese Soup & most importantly Cornbread with Honey Whipped Butter. GAHHH! My favorite. I also love their Strawberry Lemonade.   I think it's a pretty good place for brunch/lunch, there's not a huge selection for food but trust me, you'll always leave full. You'll feel quite healthy too, no-guilt attached. I think that's a pretty good feeling considering we are all foodies here. :)  (Sidenote: Price is pretty good, even better when you use coupons from those mailers/newspapers)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes/Soup Plantation is the one restaurant I can probably dine at everyday. Salad bar with pre-tossed salads and DIY salads, various soup choices to your liking, baked potatoes with condiments, breads, muffins, pastas (most if not all taste bland, I would say avoid them unless you pour mounds of soup or something on top of them), a few fruit choices, and dessert. For the most part, this restaurant is vegetarian; so, if you're feelin like grubbin, I suggest you go somewhere else.  You can always find coupons for this venue online, and they accept coupons presented on the phone (no need for print-outs).  This specific locale is nothing more, nothing less than others, besides the fact that they no longer serve Clam Chowder. Average cleanliness, pleasant staff, and nothing out-of-the-ordinary that has stuck out the various times I've dined here."}
{"text":"I can't say that I ever go into Sweet Tomatoes and walk out disappointed.    If you want a  good salad this is the place to go!  You can create your own and the choices are endless!  My only wish is for a few thing to be added tot he salad bar:  dried cranberries, walnuts and chicken.    My kids love the Macaroni and Cheese and cheesy foccacia (which is just a fancy name for pizza).  My headband lives the Chicken noodle soup because it is just that chicken, noodles and broth.   I must have their cornbread with every meal!    The best part is the dessert is included!  I LOVE the chocolate lava cake with vanilla soft serve on top. You can make healthy dessert choices to:  jello, pudding or a piece of fruit!  I highly recommend Sweet Tomatoes!  Save your kids cups and you won't have to buy them a drink next time you come of you bring their cups.   Sign up for their email newsletter and get free coupons and a bonus coupon on your birthday!"}
{"text":"So good! If you're looking for a fresh, unique meal, this is where to go. The salad bar is very large with seasonal offerings and all the basics as well. There is also endless soups, bread, pasta, and dessert. The staff was friendly and helpful, and it is nice to visit a healthier restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the Sweet Tomatoes brand! Consistent at every location. The salad bar is the best part, and it is particularly good because of the variety. There are probably more than 30 options- and you build it yourself! (Or choose from seasonal pre-made options). Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Love Sweet Tomatoes!  I could eat here everyday.  Fresh chopped veggies, tasty variety of soups and desserts.  Sign up for the Soup Plantation coupon and get weekly coupons."}
{"text":"Salads were not fresh.  Soups were bland, tasted like old dirty socks.  Limited variety.  Will not go back, prefer Olive Gardens' unlimited soup and salad, cheaper too!"}
{"text":"We Love this place! They open at 11 AM, so it's  best to get there before the lunch rush. Everything is always fresh and delicious. There \"to-go\" containers are the perfect size as well. Great place to swing in for a nibble, or meet a friend for a quick, healthy, and affordable, lunch."}
{"text":"This is not the same great place it use to be. Very little attention is given to keeping the pasta / potato bar tidy, clean & warm. Wild kids were fingering up the choc sprinkles at the sundae bar. Hand sanitizer is broken & place was dirty. If seating are is dirty what does the back look like. So sad, this was once a great place to dine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place because I know that I could eat till I'm full and watch my calories at the same time.  I took my fiancé there and he hadn't been there in over 10 years but he really enjoyed it and we decided that we would eat there at least once a month! We get coupons for joining their mailing list. This location I feel I had more items on the menu and may be a bit cleaner because it was newer maybe? Either way. Full, full, full!!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Sweet Tomatoes. Their salad ingredients are always fresh and crisp, and there's always a good variety in their soups and pastas. It gets a little pricey when I take my family of five here, especially when you consider the menu options. Yes, it's unlimited salad, soup, pastas, etc, but we can also hit up a regular buffet in Vegas for the same price with even more options. That being said, I still choose ST every once in a while for the more family friendly atmosphere. Also, if you sign up for their rewards program, they offer better coupons than what you can find online."}
{"text":"The food is good. I dont like many salad bars, but this is the only one i ACTUALLY like. The specials are sometimes good. The soup is da BEST. I hope we can go here this month. Good thing is we live very close."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. I was excited they had gluten-free options but hoped for more than 1 soup. My fiance isn't gf and still said there are better salad bars for the money."}
{"text":"Always descent. Can't really mess salad up especially when you put it together yourself. They could use better soup options though. Usually mainly vegetarian selections. Also don't ever put out a crappy brownie with chocolate on it again and call it dessert. Last time I was there that was the dessert and it was pathetic. Tasted like a sugary crappy mess. On the other hand that pumpkin whatever you guys made around thanksgiving was one of the tastiest desserts I've ever had. Just don't be cheap and keep the dessert interesting and I'll be happy"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to restaurants after a hard workout. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet with a gigantic salad bar--offering everything a vegetarian could want on a salad.   In addition, they have a wide selection of soups (about six options), including at least one vegetarian choice. Their pasta options are made in front of you--the macaroni and cheese is fantastic! For breads, there is usually focaccia and corn bread as well as several muffin types (the chocolate muffins are divine!).   To mix things up, their soups, pre-mixed salads, and muffins general infuse seasonal flavors.   The have a full potato bar and, of course, there is fresh fruit and a dessert bar. They round out dessert with a soft serve ice cream machine and (rarely) bring fresh baked cookies to your table.    Though you serve yourself, they clear the tables. Promptly!  This Sweet Tomatoes has always been exceptionally clean and there are never any empty food bowls."}
{"text":"First time here. This restaurant has a great concept that is AYCE soup and salad. There is also pasta, pizza breads, and desserts. Salads are fresh and soups are tasty and hot. I first sampled all the 8 type of soups to see which was to my liking. I enjoyed the El Pasto lime chicken and chicken noodle the most. Its good to take a break with all the eating till my stomach bursts meals I had. I had a good experience and it was one of the healthier meals I had on this trip."}
{"text":"Has gone way down hill.   Not sure why it still has such great reviews.  Salad bar is messy - and only half stocked.  Not a great selection.  Pastas are boring and been sitting out for a while - usually they take care in this section in a Sweet Tomatoes.  Baked Potatoes are small and cooked wrong.  Soups, well, nothing special.  Oh, and the \"Lemon Lava Cake\" - WTF? Do people actually come here for it?  Was printed in the ad, was a pile of mess, in the corner of a pan."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. This was our first time as we were very happy. The salad bar was very clean and organized with a large variety of salad toppings and sides. The floors were cleaned and all the tables were clear. The staff was very pleasant. The hot side of the bar was just a fresh. I had a great plate of salad and a small plate of pasta with a cornbread and a bowl of chili. Of course at the end I had to have some soft serve ice cream. It was a great lunch with great customer service and we will be back again."}
{"text":"The food is way better than it has been in the past. I think this location is under new management. They had ice prepared so you can grab drinks without waiting the ice line. The service by far has improved from my previous experiences. Paul was amazing and made sure that we everything that was available was out for us to try. I thought it would be busier when we arrived since the parking lot was full but I think they may have just a small parking lot. I wish the bus person would come around more frequently, but overall... I cant wait to return for my next meal!!!"}
{"text":"When I go to Sweet Tomatoes, I go for the salad. And not to be healthy, mind you.. Because by the time I'm at the end of the salad line, my plate probably has more calories than a double cheeseburger. It just feels healthier? Anyway. The salad ingredients are always fresh tasting and yummy.   I always sit down and eat my not-so-healthy salad before heading to the soup/pasta section. This area reminds me more of like Cici's pizza quality. The soups are good enough, but usually pretty bland. A little salt and pepper definitely adds flavor..   The breads and pastas are also so so.. Nothing to get super excited over. That being said, I think it's a little pricey to just go for an amazing salad, but then again we've all been complaining for quite some time how a Big Mac is cheaper than a salad, and soda is cheaper than water. Something completely backwards about good ol' 'Murrica."}
{"text":"Not always in this area but worth the drive next time I want sweet tomatoes best customer service I've ever experienced everyone is so nice at this location I would pass 4 sweet tomatoes just to come to this one!!!"}
{"text":"Watered down soups... 2 of them with broth and no noodles or chicken... Sourdough bread stale... Cornbread stale... Poor excuse for a soup plantation"}
{"text":"NO MEAT HERE!! Didn't know that because they trick you coming in. The line started in the sale portion of the buffet. Then you stop to pay. Then you venture around finding out there is no protein. Did not know I would be paying 25.00 for me and my daughter to eat a vegetarian dinner. I came in starving thinking I was going to fill up!!.. well that didn't happen!! When I asked the manager he said they have been meat free for six years??? What a disappointment. Ended up at chipotle with a mostly chicken bowl."}
{"text":"The staff here continues to be great. One incident that I saw during our last visit left me angry. I was approaching the muffin/bread area when I saw a disgusting person take a piece of corn muffin, and it accidentally fell onto the floor. She picked up the muffin off of the floor, and then put it back onto the buffet serving platter! She took a different muffin and walked away. Luckily I saw it because I took the muffin that fell onto the floor and discarded it. What a disgusting person! My advice: keep vigilant. One never knows how many times something similar happens at this location. Your health may depend on it."}
{"text":"I really like this location. Plenty of food options and variety and the staff always have a smile and a friendly greeting."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST buffet of any type i have ever been to. i have only been to Sarasota, Florida's location on vacation, however, if i lived there, i would be frequenting Sweet Tomatoes weekly! My absolute favorite salad is the Wonton Happiness Salad. Their food is ALWAYS fresh, and the service and staff at this location have always been great. i always recommend this restaurant to people. it is my favorite place to go, and will be my first stop for dinner next time i am in Sarasota! SWEET TOMATOES, would you please put a location in Peoria, Illinois?? We need you here! p.s. if you sold a tee with your restaurant logo on it, i would wear it! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to many of the Sweet Tomatoes locations and have always been extremely satisfied with their food, selection, and service. This experience was better than the rest. The manager Mike was super attentive and willing to not only answer questions, but make recommendations, assist in almost every duty, and I don't think he stopped smiling the entire hour we were there.  The food was exceptional, especially the corn chowder, and as always the salad bar was spectacular. Food, service, cleanliness, this location is spot on a great place and we'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Excellent quick lunch as usual. Always reliable Clean and fresh veggies Great range of good soups. Cannot pass opinion on pastas but the various breads are good Just enough desserts to keep the sweet tooth happy Lady came round twice with chocolate chip cookies1"}
{"text":"Sad to write this review as we come here at least once a week....tonight service was horrible; we were a party of 6, two servers were cleaning a table and the cashier sent us that way and one was cleaning it for another group and one was cleaning it for us....the other people sat then the server told us to find our own seat....we asked her to lead the way and she pointed to a corner booth and said sit there....a table of she was so rude!  Her name is Diana!  Make sure to ask NOT to be seated in her section!  To top it off we asked 3 times to have our table cleaned while we were eating....plates piled up and finally a gentleman came but we were leaving at that point.....sad that we paid so much money and didn't even enjoy our family night out"}
{"text":"It's a buffet style healthy restaurant. The food is pretty good. Mostly big salad bar then they have soups, breads, and baked potato/sweet potato bar. It pretty pricey but there is pretty good amount of people there. The customer service is good and it's clean there."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Soup Plantation / Sweet Tomato's, however the AZ locations do not bake there own breads.   The sourdough bread tastes stale.   Their prices keep going up in the qualities just goes down to meet simpler and I can prove their profit margins."}
{"text":"The food was really good tonight.  It is always clean and that is unusually for a buffet.  I love that the table helpers walk the floor to clean your table & offer refills.  They ALWAYS have a smile.    I love that they have fresh veggies including fresh bets, not just the picked ones.  Though I really dislike the tarragon tuna salad...GROSS!   I love to take a pasta dish and use it to put a baked potato in it so I can top it with cheese, chili & sour cream.  I also use the same pasta dish for dessert...cookie/brownie on the bottom then ice cream on top.  Much bigger than the ice cream bowls they give you."}
{"text":"I have to the place several times and always had an enjoyable experiance but tonight was no bueno.  The salad bar was fresh & good (as usual), the soups were not so good and lacked ingredients.  The lobster bisque had some lobster flavor but no lobster.  The chuncky chicken only had bioled chicken and noodles.  You will need to try for yourself i guess.   The worst was the cleanliness.   Not once did a buser come to our table to pick up our dishes.  The same with the other tables.  A party left 20 min before us and when we left it still wasnt cleaned up.  The drink and ice cream area was messy too.  I dont know if they were short staff but it didnt feel good."}
{"text":"So sad when they closed this location. We've been coming to this location on Central and Camelback for years. This place was always clean and well stocked. Employees were pleasant and helpful. Many a nite we would stop in here for dinner and many days for lunch. Never any complaints. And it was always great getting the coupon for half off on your next visit.  A tear drop for you Sweet Tomatoes on Central and Camelback."}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! The strawberry lemonade is 100% made from real lemons and strawberries!! It is delicious!!"}
{"text":"The people working there were nice enough but the food was not good at all. If you are looking for quality salad and soup--this is NOT the place to go. There was a macaroni dish and ONE soup that was edible. The rest of it tasted... Off. Flavorless. Even the soft serve ice cream was bland. The mousse tasted like chemicals--seriously!  If you can find a Jason's Deli and have a few extra dollars in your pocket, go there instead.  However, if you don't care about eating good quality food or are just looking to fill your belly with as much food as you can stuff in your mouth at a cheap price--then this is the place for you! :)"}
{"text":"We are definitely regulars here since we try to eat healthy.  We even subscribe to their coupon deals which you can pull up on your phone.  Every month they feature some different menu items so you never get bored with just the salad line.  There is always a big variety of soups and they are fresh and hot.  We usually stick with the salad and soup but they also offer baked potatoes and focaccia bread with different toppings.  They usually have some flavor of \"mousse\" that is 40 calories per servings, always delicious.  For the kids, there is also mac and cheese and a soft ice cream bar with all the toppings.  I have 2 complaints:   I wish they would stock more fruit.  Usually, you have grapes and whole apples to choose from.  I would like to see a mini fruit bar with some more choices.  They also need to expand the drink bar and have more than one ice dispenser...it's Arizona, people want cold drinks!  The wait staff is hit or miss, some nights they are very attentive, some nights we have plates piling up."}
{"text":"Stopped in this ST location last night and haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in awhile. Last one I went to was in Henderson.   Everything was so mediocre last night. First I noted that the spinach leaves weren't topped off and fresh, there were broken leaves and some of them looked limp.   Moving on to the soups, the chicken pot stew was OK, I did like the french onion soup.  Tried the chicken noodle soup and the chicken was really dry and tough.   The brown whole wheat honey bread was good, thats probably the only thing that was on point last night.   I had some of the spicy italian meat pasta and the pasta was mushy! No bueno.   For the price two dinners and drinks = about 28 dollars. I don't think it was worth it and I probably won't be back because the quality was not up to par and in my opinion, I could have been satisfied elsewhere for salads."}
{"text":"Come here often. Place is always clean and table clean up is good too. Sometimes they pass out free cookies. Strawberry lemonade is really good!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Sweet Tomatoes since before I can remember and I love the consistency of the fresh produce in the salad bar, the tastiness of the soups, pastas, and pizza, along with the kind, helpful staff. I went here for lunch on a Wednesday and the lines were not long and all of the buffet items were well stocked. I eat at Sweet Tomatoes various locations about twice a month and this location was satisfying and made my lunch hour enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss for me, sometimes when I visit they keep the food stocked and the plates cleared other times it's like they are fighting to keep up to keep fresh food out and plates taken off tables. The last visit was one of the miss times for me I went up to the bread station 2 different times and there were like 2 or 3 pieces of bread left and some of the muffins were hard. The pasta station was ok for the most part, and some of the soups seemed a bit old they had thicked up which happens when they have sat for a long time. The salad bar was stocked and fresh which was nice, the drink area was messy as were a lot of the tables, we had to find someone to clean off an empty table so we could sit down because there was several empty tables that were not cleaned off. You would think with the volume this store gets they should be able to keep up. The staff that rings you up is friendly but the people who are suppose to clean off the tables not so much, nor are the ones in the soup and bread area, I asked about a soup and the guy turned like he didn't hear me and went into the back, I was trying to fig out what days they have the clam chowder i know the one in St Louis always had their on friday. I just feel like this place is just all over the place i mean how hard is it to run a soup salad bread and pasta buffet?"}
{"text":"Very average salad buffet. One macaroni salad I ate was absolutely disgusting, but my regular salad was good...I was able to prepare it how I like. Not too many other options, but this location also seemed a bit small.    They had a great little ice cream station. I made a brownie sundae. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this location. Lot of windows with enough shines that brighten up my mood when eating"}
{"text":"I go here every couple of months from lunch.  I come especially for their Caesar salad.  It's not a bad place the salad stuff is usually very fresh Caesar salad is excellent in my opinion.   There are many soups to choose from and they have been very good.   The pasta I didn't care for every time I go it's very bland. The mac & cheese is always watery I don't like it that way.  The sweet potatoes are also always and I mean always mushy.  They definitely don't know how to make sweet potatoes. other than that place is pretty good salads are excellent the soups are good the muffins are pretty decent also.  I like it just not the mac & cheese and those nasty sweet potatoes"}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet, quality was decent.  The day I visited they were missing some key produce due to supply issues.  Good service."}
{"text":"Man oh man. I used to love coming here, get my greens in... fresh and delicious. But the cleanliness has gone down a bit, having silverware and debris left on the sides of the seats. Unfortunately today's experience will prevent me from ever going bake to this location...  There was a bug in the food. I thought it was the dark portion of a mushroom in the salad, but as you can see in the picture... clearly not.  The manager explained that they had a recent \"fly infestation\" and the exterminator cleared it up... but 1 must have made it in the food... and apologized.    Apology accepted, but IM OUT"}
{"text":"I wish I had a better explanation for the low rating but all I know is each time I eat here, I get sick. It's crazy because the place seems clean, the food doesn't taste bad or seem gross so I'm not sure. My wife and I ate here tonight and were walking out asking each other why we had because we know we'll feel ill afterwards.  All that I can think of is that they put some sort of filler in the food and I'm no conspiriest (besides that I know for a fact we have not ever landed on the moon and that area 51 will soon be fully exposed for what it truly is).  Not sure what the deal is but besides getting sick each time, $11.95 for a salad buffet, sounds a little redonkulous if you ask me, throw in some flippin meat and maybe I would reconsider the price."}
{"text":"I wish they offered some protein options. You can make a decent salad and their mini muffins are the best. I think it's way overpriced though. Was $45 for 3 of us the other day and for some reason the food wasn't all that good. I found a dead fly in my broccoli salad too. Must have been a bad night"}
{"text":"This location has everything one would come to expect from a Sweet Tomatoes.  The salad bar is fresh.  There are the soups.  There is the banal pasta bar.  The bread.  The potato bar, and the desert section.  The service is friendly.  Especially friendly were the ones working the dining area.  What made me a fan and offered up a unique dining experience in the Sweet Tomatoes experience was.....................an outdoor dining area!  What?!  This addition was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Freshest greens and other vegetables on the buffet. Soups galore. And bake potato too. Can't miss the different breads and muffins. Top it all with frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped by while shopping on Sunday July 23, 17. I have never been more disappointed with a salad bar restaurant in my life. We were charged 10.29 for our salads which in my opinion is highway robbery when the salad bar has no protein. We expected some ham and turkey, but the only protein was crumbled egg.   We will never go there again."}
{"text":"all-you-can-salad? YES!  It's basically a place where you can gorge on veggies all day. They also include soups, breads & desserts & soda for around $12 a person.   The location is set up like Soup Plantation if you've ever heard of that before.  There are some pre-made salads as you walk through a cafeteria style set-up and then immediately have romaine, iceberg, spring mix selections to choose from.. with toppings like bacon bits, eggs, cucumbers, cheese, pasta,  etc.  The only complaint I have is they charge an extra $2.95 for ''premium'' toppings like tofu, croutons & chicken and you can only get it ONCE.. which is a major rip off and bummer.   There's plenty of seating & parking since it's located in the Desert Ridge Marketplace.   The ice cream and brownie muffin were a nice way to end a meal."}
{"text":"If you're a carnivore, this may not be the place for you, but despite what that one guy or girl that refuses to eat vegetables said, they DO serve meat.   When you walk in, you grab a plate and a tray. It's cafeteria style, but cleaner and with good food. I always grab two plates and fill them both up with salad and toppings. I'm not a big guy, but I eat a lot of food. They also have a few sides to choose from at the salad bar before you make your way to the other food options.  Before we get to the register, we ALWAYS have a coupon ready. I don't think we've ever been to Soup Plantation or Sweet Tomatoes at a time when they didn't have an active coupon available. You don't need to print it out. Just use your cell phone. Once you pay, you are seated. This is a buffet, so you can get up as many times as you want to eat whatever you want.  I like their clam chowder with Tabasco sauce and sourdough bread. My daughter likes their macaroni and cheese with bacon. My wife likes their chili with cheese. There are plenty of options to choose from, and they usually have some sort of theme going with a few of their entrees. Oh, and the staff has always been very friendly to us!  This is a great place to go with a large group or families. We love it! The restaurant and restrooms are clean, and I never leave Sweet Tomatoes unsatisfied.  For dessert, get the lava cake with vanilla ice cream. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Regular price for one buffet is $11.29 plus drink is $2.49 that is about $14.00 per person total for two is $28.00.  There is a coupon out there 2 for $22.00 w/drinks.  This is my first time there and I had a coupon for boss's day buy one buffet and get one for a $1 plus 2 drinks.  My total was $18.67.   I would not return because the only thing I would go for is the cream of mushroom soup and the asian salad, but the price is not worth returning for those two items only."}
{"text":"The trouble with corporate chains is that they are all the same.  That's true with the good thing about them as well.  I guess that's why we support them with our business.  There's few surprises... and there's none here.  Nutritious soups and salads.  I'd give them 5 stars if they kept their menus heart healthy, but they've caved into the demands of over-weight Americans.  There's plenty here to clog your arteries and pack on the pounds."}
{"text":"We went there last night for their featured salad, The Zesty Turkey Taco Salad.  There was No \"Zesty\" in this salad, and the only Turkey was an M&M size piece of ground turkey that tasted like cardboard.  The only thing on the entire menu that was tasty at all was their Broccoli Salad.  A 5 or 6 yr old sitting in the booth across from us made this comment to her Mom, \"I think I can make better Mac and Cheese than this.\"  I think that says it all... I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The chicken noodle soup is my favorite! Really, all their soups are good."}
{"text":"My hubby and I are all about buffets, so when we found this all-you-can-eat SALAD buffet we thought we'd try it out to be healthy.  Everything is very FRESH. Mon-Wed they have a 2 for $20 dinner meal which is a great price! They even allow the ''premium toppings'' like tofu & grilled chicken which normally costs $2 extra per plate.   Once you walk in, you're not really greeted but the salad line automatically starts. It starts off with some pre-made salads but then you can continue the line and make your own with your own toppings.   There's a hot station that includes 4-5 different soups and some breads (just okay not fabulous).  They have a delicious berry tea drink that is seasonal but their strawberry lemonade was too sweet/sugary for me."}
{"text":"They have stepped up the chicken noodle soup supply. Another point I want to touch on is how awesome their staff is. No one is ever rude or seemingly annoyed. From the dudes cleaning the tables to the kitchen staff they're all awesome."}
{"text":"sub-or lunch buffet. wonton happiness salad left me disappointed; too soggy and not much left on the bar at mid day."}
{"text":"This particular location is filled with happy people both diners and workers. You can eat as clean or as dirty as you want at a Sweet Tomatoes.  I have a plan about how I want eat when I roll into vegetable chute, but whatever healthy options I choose are instantly ruined by the copious amounts of ranch dressing and cheese.  When paying do a little research before had an find an online coupon.  Show them you phone and they apply whatever the discount would be. Once you find your table, it's off to the soup, bread/muffin, and pasta bars.  After partaking in the human version of grazing, if so inclined you can hit the soft serve and other sweet treats.  Better yet, nurse the upcoming food coma with a cookie brought by the table by a smiley employee."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a salad, so I did some yelp research and decided to check Sweet Tomatoes out. When you first walk in, you're immediately greeted with the huge salad bar. They have pre-prepared salads, and then a large variety of toppings for your own salad. The salad bar was clean, and well labeled, so you could tell what everything was. At the end of the salad bar, you pay for the whole buffet. I was with another person, so we did the 2 for $20 deal that includes 2 meals and 2 drinks. The guy told us that separately the 2 meals and 2 drinks would be $27 so the 2 for 20 deal was totally worth it.  There was a separate section for soups, pizza, muffins, fruit and soft serve ice cream. They had so many soups, but since it was already 90 degrees outside, I didn't try any. The pizza was pretty decent, and the muffins were a little hard, but I didn't really have high expectations for the hot food.   The dining area was very large, a mix of booths and tables. The crowd was definitely a lot of senior citizens and families.   Overall, the highlight was the salad bar, so if you're craving a make your own salad place, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, everything is so freshly made here from scratch.  Even thought this is a vegetarian paradise and I'm not a vegetarian at all, I still enjoy coming to eat at this place.  I would only come here when I have coupons because without the coupons, it's a little bit too expensive for me.  Overall service was good."}
{"text":"Having heard great things about the chain, we gave it a go. While I would have liked to see a protein offered as well the good variety of fresh veggies and sides (grilled chicken for example) overall, we enjoyed our lunch"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. It is a bargain if you have the coupons that are available in the mail or online.  The past couple times, I have noticed a downward trend of quality. recently, some items were added to the \"upgrade\" section. For almost $11 for dinner, I would rather pay an extra buck & just have as much chicken as we want. Not for $2.49 & only one 3 or 4 oz serving!  The soups are fairly good quality. The chowder & the potato leek soup alone made a star on the review.    The pasta dishes have dropped badly in quality. Fazoli's had better pasta - and that is a fast food place! I would like to see a return to basics on their pasta. What's the use of sausage & peppers if you cannot get the pasta right?  For a salad bar restaurant, Sweet Tomatoes has a very poor selection of fruit. Watermelon, pineapples, & cantaloupe should be standard, plus maybe one or two others. They had bananas and apples! Wow how imaginative for the price we paid. Not.   The selection of hot tea is quality. Two different red tea selections. The pomegranate green tea was tasty. BTW, it is the Republic of Tea company, not Lipton or Nestea.   Jason's Deli does offer a better salad, where a soup can be bought for $1. Maybe we will give Sweet Tomatoes another chance in a few months. But it is no longer the go-to place it once was."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was five. Lived it before I became vegan and still love it now. It's a bit of a hit or a miss with what I can eat sometimes but there's always the salad bar and usually there is a soup I can eat. They are great about labeling everything for food allergies and different diets. They have tons of options and you can look up the full menu for the season online to check if they have soups and dished you like. They need to work on making a pasta option available because I think that would be pretty simple but other than that they are accommodating. My favorite super far has been a minestrone with pasta and veggies and lentils. If you don't love salads it might not be worth it for vegans but I've been happy with the food. It's a self serve, all you can eat buffet. You grab your salad, pay, and then there are soups, pastas, breads and desserts inside."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good and there is always something everyone likes. Their premade ceasar salad is probably one of my favorite salads ever. I also love the tuna tarragon.  I love that they have seasonal items and they switch them out all the time. I have never been let down by this place. It's pretty basic, not too extravagant but always tastes good to me. The only thing I was mislead by was the ice cream. It says ice cream and then by the condiments it says yogurt bar. My husband is lactose intolerant so there is a big difference between yogurt and ice cream to him. We had to ask whether it was yogurt or ice cream and it is not yogurt."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is like Fresh Choice in north California - a buffet-style veggie restaurant chain.  It's great when you crave fresh salad selections."}
{"text":"I am not a vegatarin , But this place is awesome, HUGE assortment of salad, soup, bread, chili, desert, gosh just amazing! I love this place and the price is good, only 11 bucks per person!!"}
{"text":"I was a fan, but it seems as time goes by, the price keeps going up and the quality goes down.   Jan. 2015 prices went up $2 per person, and for that price, you can have some pretty good meals in other restaurants.  All-you-can-eat, no, but you are definitely swapping quality for quantity. So unless you can really stuff yourself, its probably not a good deal.  This probably isn't the fault of Sweet Tomatoes as it is the amount of food people waste. As quality drops, people get more food that they don't eat, and the cycle continues."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes sucks and I'm always confused about how many people are always there. The food is always old, food trays and surrounding areas are filthy, and the selection is so extremely limited and disgusting. Also, the charge is about $13 per adult plus extra for drinks but you can get such a nicer meal elseware at so many wonderful restaurants. I've only been there twice and was regretful both times I went...can't believe I gave it even a second chance. I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"well Rand H. finally talked me into one of these rabbit food buffets.I am a meat and seafood lover and i usually skip the salad table at most buffets.So for me it was going to be tough to give them a high rating. I skipped the first part of the buffet because it was pretty much just leafs but past that I filled a couple plates with potato,pasta and tuna fish salads, beets and pickles. it was alright the other side of the buffet had some good soups and breads,mac and cheese that was only so  so and deserts and fresh fruit. well when i left i was full and nothing was really that bad so i am giving the 3 stars. But if i was a rabbit they would get 5"}
{"text":"It's a decent place to go for lunch as it has a lot of healthy options. I took my daughter and her two friends here for lunch on a busy Friday afternoon. I had an iceberg lettuce based salad which was really watery and I didn't finish it. It's like they rinsed the lettuce a ton, but never drained it. My vegetable soup was good as was my dessert. My brownie was fresh out of the oven and literally melting in my mouth! YUM! The girls had soup and salad as well. However, their darker leaf salad didn't seem to have the issues mine did. I liked the fact that the kids can help themselves to food and drink. In addition, they loved the fact that they could serve themselves soft serve ice cream and load up on the toppings. My biggest issue here was that the staff wasn't picking up our table's empty plates in a timely manner. I took a photo of some of our stacks of plates, and I wasn't happy to be trying to eat around them. Overall, it was a decent lunch though and Yelp gave me a 15% off coupon when I checked in!!!!  The pros - a good selection of soups and salads, clean environment, self serve drinks and food make it convenient.  The cons - parking was a challenge at lunch on a Friday and the staff didn't clean up our plates in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Green is good. I enjoyed my lunch greatly. Fresh, clean and bountiful. I leave satiated yet wanting a little more. Soups were delicate and delicious as was the corn bread, muffin and roasted garlic dressing"}
{"text":"Plates and utensils are frequently dirty from the get go. Don't agree? Look more closely next time. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing,  my only down fall is I found ants all over the grapes in the fruit bar, but it still hasn't stopped me from going there,  I'm just at a little weary of the fruit bit everything is still amazing"}
{"text":"I've always loved coming to Sweet Tomatoes because of the fantastic, fresh food and quick service. Plus they always have delicious soups and pastas as well as a 40 foot customized salad bar. So what's not to like? I just came today and got the dinner buffet and they have a broccoli-cheese potato soup and it is phenomenal!  Though it's seasonal so I'm kind of bummed... just means I'll have to come more while it's here!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner. They offer a plethora of tasty salads, some are pre-made and others you fix yourself. They also offer a variety of soups that get changed out depending on the time of year. An added bonus is the pizza, pasta, baked potatoes and desserts which include a soft serve machine with all the toppings.  Sweet Tomatoes has a vast selection of items but the taste is just average, many of the items are very bland that lack seasoning. If you are looking for an all you can eat restaurant that offers healthy options, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic lunch the other day with two lovely individuals who raised me. Yes, I was not raised by a pack of wolves, even though it seems like it by the way I eat at 3AM.   My lovely parents and I popped into this location for a quick little lunch, and it hit the spot.  There really isn't much to say about this place that hasn't already been said. It's a salad buffet joint. You start out by creating your own salad. All the fixins.  Then, you have a nice selection of soups. Something for the vegan and carnivore alike. There's also a potato bar.  My favorite section is the little pasta section where you can get some Mac n Cheese.  Nothing here is gourmet, so leave your fancy palates at home.   Sweet Tomatoes is just a fun, chill place to have a meal. Simple. Fun. Fast. Also, this is the same chain as Souplantation. A joint I used to frequent when I lived in Los Angeles.  If you are one of those weirdos who likes to bring your diet to a restaurant, I suppose they can accommodate you. Pile some raw vegetables on your plate. Whatever floats your boat, but if you are normal and can enjoy a meal like a decent human....this is a good place for that."}
{"text":"Being the only vegetarian in the family, I love that we can all go here and grab lunch. Even my honey's grandmother likes this place. The price is usually right and I tend to get my fill of salads-which I rarely do when I am away from home."}
{"text":"Great salad choices. Wish they had proteins to add. Carb fest unless you stay to salads"}
{"text":"I've only been to one other Sweet Tomatoes and this one is above par to the usual one we go to.  I like their layout and tables, the food is delicious as usual and they  just seem to be run better.  If we are in the area, I'd definitely come here again.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Their soup is to DIE FOR!!!  My new fav restaurant especially during the fall/winter season, they've got all the perfect comfort food  I love that it's an all you can eat for $9 at lunch and $12 for dinner. The food is all fresh and made in house. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This review is for the breakfast.  I totally love them for lunch and dinner.  You order your scramble.  They say they will bring to the table.  They brought one at a time.  The gross sausage was still frozen in the middle.  Took 15 minutes between the first and last scramble brought to our table of 4.  It was inedible.    They should stick to what they do well and breakfast is not it."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since a bad breakfast experience 1 1/2 Years ago. Now I ask myself why. Fresh salad ingredients, great soup selection ,  pasta and pizza. Can't go wrong   Planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Love this place if you go away hungry it's your own fault . The salad bar is massive and all you can eat ice cream and everything else, how can you go wrong???"}
{"text":"Soups are hot and everything looks fresh for the most part. This place offers various dressing options to fit in with anybody's preference. Soups look delicious."}
{"text":"GREAT customer service.  The cashier Jacob was very helpful with my to-go order, plus probably three or four other employees smiled and greeted me while I was there ... and I was only there for 20 minutes or so.  It was a really great experience and I'm excited to come here again."}
{"text":"We were out shopping and a Dust Storm was about to hit.  We figured we'd ride out the dust storm and have something to eat.  This place was across the street from where we were shopping so we stopped in.  We've been to the Sweet Tomatoes in Phoenix so we were familiar with their food.  Have to say it was consistent with what were were expecting.  The staff was just as if not more friendly.  Have to say the Green Chile Soup was excellent!  After having it, the red chile, which is usually my favorite.  Wasn't as good anymore.  I'm now spoiled for the Green Chile Soup.  It would be heaven with potatoes in it.  Maybe I can get some to go!  :)'   I hope they make it a staple!   My other fav is the broccoli salad.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Thank you for making fresh healthy and delicious food for us! My favorite family restaurant in Las Vegas. Great atmosphere and always clean and welcoming. Five stars 100%"}
{"text":"My family really enjoys Sweet Tomatoes. We go usually once or twice a month. I'm always careful at a buffet to make sure that I watch what other people do. I guess that's because I'm in the food business. While there the other night, we were behind a family with several little children. I'm really glad that they were on the other side of the salad bar. Everything they touched should have been thrown away. They had their hands on every utensil they could possibly touch. Later on,  I observed one of the little girls picking food off the spoon and putting the spoon back into the macaroni and cheese  I informed the girl working behind the counter what had just happened. She did change the spoon but I'm not really sure what else that little girl touched. And who knows where her hands were before she touched. Couple minutes later a little kid licking his ice cream cone held his freshly licked ice cream cone over the sprinkles and proceeded to spoon sprinkles over his freshly licked cone. Disgusting! Now all those sprinkles that didn't stick to his freshly licked cone have his saliva on them. I also observed another child take silverware  out of the bin, touch  every end that you put in your mouth and then put it back into the silverware holder. What were the parents doing? Absolutely nothing. I can't imagine that they did not see any of this happening. They allowed their children to act like animals in a restaurant. Food was all over the place. I will hold Sweet Tomatoes responsible for not stepping in and doing something about all the things these children did wrong in a food establishment that is a buffet setting. We will continue to eat at Sweet Tomatoes but we will also continue to watch for unsafe situations that could possibly get many people sick."}
{"text":"Good place for salad. As good a salad bar as I have ever seen except for the odd placement of the bar itself. You get in line and fill plates with salad. Then you pay for the buffet and it feels like you don't get to go back there. (Note: You can, assumably, go back...I just don't.) Then the rest of it is decent carbo loading. Baked sweet potatoes. Okay pizza and pretty good muffins. Pasta. Soups that range from delicious to \"I can make better soup at home\" soup. Pepsi products. Tea. Sweet lemonades and a dessert bar that is at best an undiscerning little childs dream. Not a bad place at all except i personally think a little bit high on price. Although if you have a family that's hungry and likes to eat different things and doesn't mind skipping on meats...this might be your ticket."}
{"text":"Everything is average at best. You're certainly paying for unlimited quantity as opposed to unlimited quality. Cafeteria style set up and cafeteria style recipes. Mac and cheese is solid and mini pizza things are worth snacking on. Ice cream machine dispensed at a unhealthy rate. They really should serve alcohol because buying a drink and watching the elderly clientele would hands-down be the most entertaining aspect of this restaurant. You must survive an obstacle course of senior citizens in order to exit. Overall it's just meh."}
{"text":"They have a nice freshly made spread and a good drinks selection, I just wish that because they mainly present themselves as a healthy place to eat, that they would go organic and provide more gluten-free options as well.  Other than that, the price is reasonable and whenever we go there, the hot food items are usually served warm and freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Ok, the original post was deleted as \"outside the guidelines.\" Let me delete the section that I suspect as the feather-ruffling and try again.  It's a $15 AYCE DIY salad bar, after drink & tax. Hummph.  But it is a pretty good one, I suppose. I've hit it about five times and I don't have any gripes regarding quality.   And they have a fill-u-up on-the-cheap 'carbs' bar: potatoes, breads, pastas. And some desserts.  But you'll go entirely blind looking for a scrap of meat anywhere in this joint.   Oh wait ... there IS some creamy tuna salad pasta. I'll just get me about five plates of it ... then sort out all the little tuna bits.  For a $15 plate, you should expect more. As in \"more meat.\"  [Deleted here: the stuff about \"the business's extraordinary circumstances.\" You can look in Wikipedia, I suppose. But I think my own prior verbiage was much more entertaining.]  Point of all that being, don't look for anything but downhill-slalom of product & service at your nearby Sweet Tomatoes anytime in this Century.  CONCLUSION: Again (for the moment) it's a good $15 plate of salad. If you really wanna pay that much for it. But where's the beef?"}
{"text":"First off, the distressed comments from idiots complaining about there \"not being any protein\" made my day, thanks for giving me a good laugh!  Everything here was clean and looked fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by the carrot sriracha soup and the carrot cream cheese lava cake. Prior to this, I haven't been here in about 7 years! My boyfriend and I will be returning soon most definitely."}
{"text":"Came to this place with my sister, and me being a fruit salad type of girl, I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have any fruit offerings so I just decided to try the items in the bakery. The cherry muffin was pretty good, and there was some kind of focaccia bread that tastes like pizza that was also pretty good. I didn't get any of the soups, but I did try the broccoli and cheddar that my sister got, which had a bit of a spicy kick to it. The selection of desserts was okay, they had vanilla and chocolate soft-serve, tapioca pudding, and chocolate lava cake. I got the vanilla-chocolate ice cream and bathed that thing in rainbow sprinkles and that was the best part of my visit, I would say. The place itself is big and roomy, with lots of places to sit - including an outdoor seating area. It was good to try it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"I've always loved the rainbow best of the west location, but it's just so busy. I seem to only go to these with coupons now because of the price=recession and all. This location was beautiful! Rewarded my kiddo with a trip here, which we both loved. She loves to serve herself and I just love the damn focaccia bread! lol that's not all, all muffins, chili,soups, dammit pretty much everything they have. Even their \"other than soda\" drink selection. Now I wanna go there this minute :( Really new, nice and clean, friendly, and lots of parking with yogurtland in the same complex! sweet."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I actually really like this place. Other than it being a little crowded during lunch hours (duh, that's to be expected).... I really don't have any complaints. We go there at least once every couple weeks, and have never had a bad meal. The service has always been great.... there's a really nice male waiter that works days during the week. Don't know his name... but he's always exceptionally pleasant.  The prices for a bit high (considering I really don't eat much).... but that's to be expected at an all-you-can-eat joint. I went online to their website and joined their email club thing.... I get awesome coupons almost weekly, buy 1 get 1 free. Yesterday we paid $13 total for both of our meals and drinks.... no complaints here!"}
{"text":"So I would normally give this place 4 stars, but after my last visit I feel a fifth star is deserved. I have recently been put on a gluten-free diet by my doctor and was very happy to learn that Sweet Tomatoes has a gluten-free menu! When my husband and I went in we asked the manager how it works and he took time explaining the gluten-free options and gave me a sheet to reference. They didn't skimp on the gluten-free options and I was actually able to have a full meal! So kudos to Sweet Tomatoes for being accommodating to those with food sensitivities!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a Sweet Tomatoes in nearly 15 years or so. The last time being in California. Then it was good. Not great, but good. Decided to go there over the weekend because I wanted some soup and salad. First off, the price was ridiculous for the quality of food/atmosphere of the place. Everything was severely lacking and it was such a disappointment. The food was nothing to get excited over. The free cookies they handed out during the meal were hard as rocks. The blueberry muffins were bland. The gentleman who seated us, he was the bright spot of the whole experience. I just wish I could have remembered his name. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I miss the days when nobody knew about it because the wait is long, the food is not replenished in an efficient manner, and it is over crowded.  The coupons bring in an undesirable crowd, dressing like they just rolled up into Walmart.  I'm obsessed with the food!  I love the salad line.  I visit so often I think I've memorized where all of the food is on the buffet line.  I love making my own salad.  I also like the fact that there are featured foods throughout the year.  Tons of toppings for your salad and pre-made salad options.  There are seasonal slaws and macaroni style salads.  My favorite is the pineapple coconut cole slaw.  There are vegetarian, vegan, and meat lover options. There are tons of drink choices from tea, lemonade, sodas, coffee, and milk.  There are fruit options, delicious soups, baked potatoes, breads, muffins, pastas, and plenty of toppings for all of these.  Choose your poison on the butters, since they have plenty to chose from.  To end the day, enjoy yogurt/ice cream with all the yummy toppings like cookie crumbles, chocolate syrup, caramel sauce, sprinkles, and nuts in a small cone or bowl.  If you visit for dinner, try their dessert of the day.  One of my favorites is the brownie crumbled over ice cream.  If you are lucky you will get a homemade fresh cookie brought over to your table.  Google coupons!  There are killer deals.  Join there club online to get coupons sent directly to your inbox.  My advice is to arrive early or late, visit during the non-rush times.  Weekends can be extremely busy, so avoid at all costs.  If you go during busy times you may feel like the buffet line is dirty, not replenished, and you have to wait several minutes to be seated in an undesirable seat.  There are people who clear your plates off of the table.  That is a hit or miss type of service.  I've been there when the people are on top of their \"A\" game and are clearing tables quickly and I've been there when I didn't see anyone clearing tables during the time that I ate my meal."}
{"text":"Yay, they're back!!  All the stuff that used to be there is pretty much still there.  The soup/dessert area seems to be a little smaller and that beverage station they used to have is no longer there but the food is still yummy and yes, they still have their soft serve!  I'm not fond of the aluminum trays they've got now and their salad plates seem t be slightly smaller but everything else seems to be back the way it used to be.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place!  Management and staff are super friendly.."}
{"text":"Very surprised at how good this Sweet Tomatoes is. First time at this location. We went at 1pm. Usually the buffets are tired, wilted and grungy by then, but everything we had was fresh and clean. The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive. Could not have asked for a better lunch. This was just added to the preferred list."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a (good) all-you-can-eat establishment, especially when kids are involved. I met a friend here on a Monday afternoon (President's Day) for lunch, with kids in tow. 2 adults, 4 kids...you can imagine the line that we held up while going down the salad bar but everyone behind us was great. When we got to the register, one of the bussers offered to bring all of our trays to the table so we could get a seat comfortably.  The dining room is large and there are a lot of tables on the patio outside. We opted to eat in. Once we got our clan settled, we took a trip over to the soup and bread area. There were a lot of nice options to choose from. Love the cornbread and the cream of mushroom soup! Kids love the pizza and mac and cheese.  On our way to get dessert, we decided to all go together. I put the \"We will return\" card on the table, only to come back and find that our table had been cleared. One of the managers was walking by and could tell that a mistake had been made. She apologized and brought back brand new drinks for all of us. Great service.   All in all, it was a good experience and I would recommend Sweet Tomatoes to anyone who is looking for some family-friendly dining. Oh, and if you want to save some money, sign up for the email coupons."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!  salads are insanely fresh/chrisp, staff is very friendly.Soups are like home made, bakery is \"Nirvana\".While you CAN go back for seconds on the salad, if your not full from everything else your middle name has to be \"Hoover\".The breads are great! If your even thinking of going to places like Cici's Pizza (BARF) spend a little more and try this place.This is not just a \"Salad Bar\" this is a everything bar.Get on their mailing list for COUPONS! Eating healthy and habit forming.....doesn't get any better than this"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  Confusing layout.  Where do you start and where do you pay?  Why aren't there plates accessible next to the hot food items?  Do we have a server who comes to refill our drinks or do we get them ourselves?  The cashier said a server would get them.  When a server never presented themselves to us, we got them ourselves.  Fucking send somebody around to clear our plates once in a while because if I have to ask for someone to do this then I'm not dropping a tip.  Here's your tip, \"Be attentive.\"  Two adults, three kids, three drinks = $43 bucks.  That's not bad.  It's like eight bucks and some change per person.    The salad bar is basically what you're paying for.  Good, fresh ingredients.  The 'Greek' dressing was really good.  A ton of variety.  The hot food,...eh.  Nothing outstanding.  All the bread, even the freshly stocked items, seemed stale and bland.  I'll probably come again but maybe only for lunch."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you happen to be a vegetarian, but even if you aren't, the selection of things is wonderful.  The salads and soups are always great."}
{"text":"Human grazing at it's finest!!  Since initiating my war on wheat flour places like this are not much fun anymore.  Sure it's bland but it will fill you up and people watching is part of the fun.  My one recommendation if your looking to dine at ST is you should NEVER pay full price.  Take the time to find one of the many coupons that are on the internet.  They will even accept coupons on your smart phone."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The salad is so good and I love how the salad bar is the first thing you see when you walk in to the door. Then after sitting down and enjoying the wonderful salad they have even more food, some pastas, soup, breads, and the muffins are amazing. All the desert is so good also, and the ice cream is amazing. Sweet tomato is like a buffet for organic lovers, vegetarians, gluten-free eaters and just those who love to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Bear recommended food place by a local. Everything was fresh, crisp or hot and delicious. I wish it was closer to the strip, I would go there a lot."}
{"text":"I adore this place! I was so excited to see it in AZ. I had forgotten they came from out west. We normally go to the Orlando location, but it's been years since we have been. I just love the salad bar! Everything was so fresh and colorful! I love all the veggies, so many to pick from! They always have fun pasta salads and a really good curry chicken salad and a nice farro salad that was so good. I had to go get a little bit more I liked it so much!  They have I think 6 soups to pick from. The Split Pea with ham was excellent! I also really liked the veggie and there was a ratatouille soup too. So similar, but not really. They both had a unique flavor. I like to just get a little of a few so I can try more than 1!  The also had pastas, sauces, and even baked potatoes and sweet potatoes! They really have it all! The muffins, rolls, and garlic breads were also excellent. The double chocolate muffin was simply amazing. It was a white muffin, but had chips and powder so double in that way, not a dark muffin. And we shared a little red velvet cake pudding. Like bread pudding, but with red velvet cake! I don't even like red velvet normally, but this was good!  They also had fruit, pudding, and ice cream!  Drinks are extra so it can add up, but they just have so much choice and everything was so good! My dad misses the meat when we go to Orlando, but you don't always need a big steak! Pastas, Potatoes and soups is where it's at, total comfort food!  The staff kept our table clean and our checkout was easy. You pay after you get your salad before you sit down.  I wish they would come to the MidWest."}
{"text":"I Love this place.  It is a great way to fill up for about $11.00 on fresh, yummy food!  Every time I go the salad station is full and clean.  The soups always hot.  The staff is quick to clean off the tables and clear your used plates.  When you go please remember to leave a tip on the table for the people clearing tables, they are working hard!"}
{"text":"I like to think this is a healthy lunch spot but I'm a sucker for the pizza, the ice cream and the muffins.  My grandsons love this place and they eat more than their money's worth. Good spot - go hungry :-)"}
{"text":"I have never been to one of these chains before.  So stopped in for lunch to pick up a salad to go.  A plethora of options for salads, which is the point of a salad buffet.  Decent price and it was super clean (always important)."}
{"text":"I like salad a lot so coming to sweet tomatoes should give a lot of variety .i would give them only 3stars since too many dishes end up to be made with spaghetti ,and that does not give a different of option to the one cannot eat any kind of carbohydrate ."}
{"text":"Yes I admit I love this Sweet Tomatoes! I have always had great customer service and really fresh food. The employees are always friendly and smiling. They work hard to keep your table bussed and the buffet clean and I love when they bring out warm cookies to the table! I am a simple woman and this place makes me happy every time I visit."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. I love salad. Lots of salad. Actually, if i could be anything in the world, i'd be salad dressing so i could hug salad all the time.  You see, when ur starving, health conscious and indecisive,  this place always leaves u proud to be full of leaves n things. Sometimes i wish i could eat there twice a day but that would be ridiculous even for me.. Their hot food sucks, but idc. Im a two plate salad person.. If ur a student, they offer discounts. Sometimes i dream about my next salad in class n doing fancy things with dressings. Like putting some on the bottom of the salad! Genius! The staff is friendly. I love people watching n this place does it for me too.. Oh n its cheap as hell.. Plus theres a nice park behind the building.. Only thing i wish is that it was open 24/7.. Its 6:45 am n im craving greenzzzz."}
{"text":"Decently surprised with this chain! Reminds me of Souper Salad, which we have back in Texas. I like how you are able to immediately pick up a plate and start assembling your salad as soon as you walk in, and that there are two sides to the salad bar itself- made things move quite quickly. Or at least that was the intention. There seemed to be some sort of issue with the cashier on our side disappearing, and an employee stocking silverware had to hop on register at the last minute but her login was not going through- luckily, the cashier on the other side (Jarra?) came to the rescue and began attending to both sides of the buffet line and alternating transactions with her register. Way to step up!  The salad bar portion started with a few premade featured salad options, then had all the ingredients, add-ons, and dressings to fix up your own. BF and I did a little of each. You're able to customize to make your meal as healthy or unhealthy as you want- I really try to stay away from the premade versions as they general are over-dressed and have more caloric ingredients.  Once you are seated, you can then add on soup options. Tomato soup was delicious,  cream of mushroom was a super-fresh featured flavor, and the clam chowder was very flavorful. The black bean chili had surprising depth of flavor but didn't really suit me, nor did the chicken noodle chunk.  The baked potato bar, pasta options, and dessert area are very limited- which for us was a good thing, as we could not really be tempted and could focus on the healthy meals we came here for. Lots of breads though- add a stick or two to the bottom of your soup bowl, especially the garlic bread + tomato soup combo.  Service at the table was surprisingly attentive about clearing dishes, asking if there was anything we needed, and generally maintaining a productive and positive attitude throughout the dinner rush time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for their salad choices. The cons are that it is quite over-priced in my opinion and their soup choices are usually very bad. Souper Salad has much better soup choices but Sweet Tomatoes has a much better salad bar. If I have a coupon I will head here for lunch otherwise I steer clear because it ends up costing close to $12 for a buffet and drink, multiply that times 5 lunches a week..."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of the old chain Fresh Choice that used to be in California...exact same setup and just as delicious! I really like this location compared to the one in Mesa."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place to eat at!  I used an on-line coupon I received by joining their club and received a nice discount!  The Cream of Mushroom soup was the best I have ever tasted at any restaurant.  The only way to improve it would be to make Cream of Mushroom AND Hatch Green Chile soup - mmmm - just think how that would taste.  Obviously I love Hatch Green Chile!  The restaurant is ultra clean, as are the bathrooms.  Service is so good, I gave a 50% tip.  Every time I finished a plate and put it on the edge of the table, someone was coming by to pick it up.  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I was impressed they had very fresh salads and toppings. Also the baked goods and the chocolate mud cake were on point."}
{"text":"Dude. It's salad. I've been to locations all over the country and I'm satisfied every time. If you want to build a huge salad with fresh ingredients in a clean environment, this is perfect. The soups are good too. Some items may not be to your liking but they're trying to appease a large audience. I always feel better after eating here and I love that they post calories in each item (of course salt/sugar/fat grams would be nice, but you can only expect so much)."}
{"text":"I feel that there is not enough variety for the amount of money you have to pay. Souper salad is cheaper and offer practically the same thing. Although they do serve fresher items then souper salad."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place! The food is fantastic. The staff is nice too. Its a little expensive, so bring coupons if you have a large family (like me)."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a large party of approximately 14 people. We arrived early so our table was not ready. Not their fault. They have a family deal that was not offered to us and we ended up paying $20 more. I brought this to the cashiers attention where she very rudely told me I needed to give her a coupon. I informed her there is no coupon as it is written on the board, then she said if I didn't tell her about it she wouldn't give it to me which was another lie because she offered the discount to other members of our party. Then family members noticed her making comments about us and pointing in our direction. The manager never came up to us to check up despite our large party. Overall dissatisfied with the employees and the cashier who looked rather vapid when telling me her name was Carla between text messages."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who likes soup and salad and isn't looking for something fried. I always leave this place feeling full but not overly heavy and yucky which is how most buffets make me feel.  The only negative is how expensive it keeps getting every time I go here it seems like the prices keep going up. I don't like going to dinner here since the price is almost $12 w/out drink, I try and stick to lunch or go when I have a coupon."}
{"text":"I did not like eating here. I normally go to the Sweet Tomatoes on flamingo and the 215, their food is always good and fresh. I love it there but when I went to this one, the food was yucky and seemed to be siting out longer. I did not have a pleasant experience here. I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to sweet tomatoes for many years sometimes twice a week. Due to recent surgery we haven't been in 6 weeks.  It was a shock today that when we finished paying for our salads we were unable to find a table. Not because people were sitting eating but because there was insufficient staff to pick up the last occupants plates etc. shocking. I was told that they only had one person whom we've known for years working on clean up duty. I spoke to several staff members who shrugged their shoulders and were afraid to answer. They told me to call management. I will never return to this location nor will my many friends. Shame on you management. No problem raising the prices though did you."}
{"text":"This place was alright. The already made salad selection was little and the bowls were mostly empty.  We went on a Saturday night so it was pretty busy. A lot of the tables were occupied and the ones that were empty were dirty. We found a semi clean one and sat. The buffet selection is pretty little, about 6 different soups, pizza, baked potato section, and a pasta section. Oh and there's a bread section as well. The pizza and soups were really good and although I tried to like the pastas I didn't because they had no flavor.  Beware of the bathrooms! People that eat here DO NOT know how to flush. Every stall that I tried to use, had a nasty surprise...."}
{"text":"Up front: I am a Sweet Tomato fanboy. I am in love with this place. I'd marry it if I could! Huge salad bar, potato bar, drink bar, dessert bar, soup bar, pizza, steamed veggies, I'm drooling now!  Even the dining area staff are fantastic, esp during the day.   I do have a some complaints, some may not be their fault. 1. You cannot rely on the online menu to be accurate, so why even have it? The only way to truly know what soups are there is to call. 2. At busy times there can be waits for tables and there are generally a couple screaming kids because parents don't teach their children how to act in public anymore - so at noon this place can get rather loud and crowded. Personally, I don't go there between 11:30 and 1pm any more. 3. Parking is bad, scarce at lunch and dinner times. 4. The Desert Ridge complex is hard to navigate and get into or out of easily. Which means a quick trip here for a carry out lunch is out of the question. 5. I am a meat and potatoes kind of guy, so some of their soups are horrid, but I understand that most people these days like conflicting flavors in foods and call that good. (Some people would like steak with sugar sprinkles and chocolate sauce, or baked potato with Ice Cream on top, but I am not one of those people) So some of their soups are odd mixtures of things like vegetable beef with lavender and mint.  Go figure.  Otherwise, this is a wonderful place to eat with fantastic service, the salad bar is always well stocked and fresh. No brown and wilted. Just don't go there at lunch time and if you do, bring ear plugs and plan to park far away. The reason why this place is packed is because it's great!  I would like to see them move to another mall where parking and traffic flow are better, like Scottsdale 101.  Update: check the fat content of their dressings and soups before you go.  I finally went here for Sunday breakfast. Not very impressive. Most of the breakfast specific items were on the \"bar\" where potatoes and steamed veggies normally sit. Very limited selection, difficult to reach some items, I burned my hand on steam trying to reach a slice of french toast. I would recommend you go to The Good Egg for breakfast and skip this place. They still had out most of the normal salad bar lunch items."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.   Haven't been here in years.  Wanted something different.  Someone had mentioned sweet tomatoes and I had a coupon from the mail.    The parking lot was full.  So I thought they might already be packed for lunch, even though I was just before the noon hour.  They were busy, but plenty of tables and no line.  Everything was clean and prepped.   Can't say I had any issues.  It was their standard food.  Several soup choices, pastas, baked potatoes.   I do love their brownies for some reason."}
{"text":"This location of sweet tomatoes is very favorable to me.  Located on the corner of Stephanie and Warm Springs, it's easy to find.   You'll notice there isn't a plenitude of parking but there isnt really any space to expand.    The restaurant has been newly updated.  New floors, paint, dishes and decor.  The salad bar is your first stop before paying.  Several pre-made salads are available if you don't want to build one.  The toppings are abundant in a clean buffet area.  After paying you can then visit the soup/pasta/bread area.  The specialties change from month to month depending on what is in season.  Leave room for dessert as well! Ice cream, pudding and dessert breads are there for your enjoyment!   If you sign up on their email list, you can get pretty good coupons.  Otherwise just look one up on your phone before heading in.  They are more than happy to scan a coupon from your phone.    As far as buffets go, I don't feel as guilty for eating at this one."}
{"text":"Always down for endless soup and salad.  My only complaint was that they didn't have any fresh bread last time I was in.  Other than that, it's a cheap way to get plenty of veggies. Everything is pretty fresh.   If there is something you want, they will usually make it for you if you just ask.   They also do check in offers and have coupons if you forget yours!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite is the ceased salad. I wish I could get the recipe for this creation. Today I had two large plates of it and wanted a third. I tried the broccoli bacon salad which was wonderful. The food is always fresh and tasty. They also carry Pepsi products which I prefer over coke. I have been going to this location for over 20 years and will continue. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We eat here way too often, and at this location over the closer Tukee store because the mac/cheese is usually dry at the Ahwatukee bar.  It is a little overpriced esp. for lunchers considering your drink is extra.  This is the same chain as Soup Exchange I believe, and I recall that drinks were included in the SE buffet.  Plus they served cookies for lunch as well as dinner and had a variety of whole fruits, not just an occasional banana.  Could be Soup Plantation that is affiliated w/ST.  Ok, back to Sweet T.   The worst aspect of any buffet, is the rude people that insist on reaching over your plate to fill their tray, rather than waiting for you to slide away, where they can shovel directly in front of the bowl to the plate, or the inconsiderate eaters that make old people with walkers wait while they pass carelessly back to inhale more food instead of allowing the less able get by first.  Where are the manners and respect for your elders, esp when disabled.  Oh, wait! There's the parents that let the little kids dig through the food as if they're at home, not in a public restaurant, contaminating everything for the next unsuspecting diner.  Parents, get up and serve your children when in public!!  This isn't the time to give them choices.  What is wrong with people?   Where is the discipline?    WHY is it that most parents of youngin's today do NOT teach basic manners from the time they are babies?  Do they think their kid is that inept that they must wait until they're so old at 10 when it won't be 2nd nature anymore?"}
{"text":"This place it's great! My 93 year old grandmother loves sweet tomatoes restaurant we always come here for lunch. The price it's very good for around $10  you can eat as much as you want from salad bar to desert everything it's delicious and fresh. Perfect place to come with a family and kids also"}
{"text":"Nothing like a great salad in this Vegas heat!   We love to come here for a great salad (and more)! It is always packed during lunch time. I like the buffet style they have set up and the staffs are friendly! They are pretty good at helping you find a table too!   The variety of soups, bread, cheese sticks and mini muffins are great compliments to go with the salads. They also have a sweets section. Yum!  This place is great to take the young ones! They will sure enjoy the variety of foods they get to choose from and in the end, they can have a little soft serve frozen yogurt! :)  I need to try this place for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sweet Tomatoes location that I've found so far mostly because I visit during the week when it is not as crowded, it is brand new, and it offers flavored iced teas (green tea, white tea, and a decaf herbal) that are really delicious. I was surprised to see some negative reviews of this chain, I adore Sweet Tomatoes, I find the produce fresh, the soups and baked goods delicious. You will always run into high fat and high calorie options at any restaurant, you need to be intelligent with your choices. This is a wonderful option for vegetarians and for anyone who is sick of eating fast food and really wants some fresh options. I find the food and the service wonderful and worth the price. I'm methodically visiting all locations I can find in the Phoenix area I like this chain so much! Still, this location tops the list."}
{"text":"They've stopped putting all those prepared salads at the end! No potato salad, no tuna salad....   I saved room on my plate for .... nothin'!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Salad bar was fresh as always. Atmosphere was very comfortable and relaxed. Soups were on point. Very delicious. The coffee could have been better though. It was warm and tasted like it has been sitting."}
{"text":"So so.  Soups were either boiling hot or tepid. The salad was brown on one side of the buffet.  There was only a skeleton crew on.  The muffins and desserts were awesome - but the overall atmosphere of the place was a downer."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was great, DH kept asking  where the Real food was but he was able to find enough food to sate the 6'4\" hunger. Soups, salads, pasta, what more do you need? And soft serve ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is awesome. Produce was fresh, clean dining area, bathrooms were clean. Love the many options, breads and muffins, cheese bread and corn bread. Baked potato bar and the chii and soups. Dessert was included. All you can eat!"}
{"text":"Indeed, one of my go-to places if I want some good old fashioned healthy eats.   The staff members here are great people.  When I see Rosalba and Juana, I make sure I get up from my chair and give each hugs and ask about their families because that's how they treat you, like family.  They take good care of us when we eat there and when it takes a while to return there, they get excited to us.   This location has improved upon their cleanliness and the way the staff handles and treats their patrons.  Friday's are the only day they offer our favorite Clam chowder soup, not like in San Diego, they offer this soup everyday, but to each is own.   I recommend this location to locals and visitors a like.  Their food is fresh, the counters are kept clean and the staff are all friendly.  Enjoy!!1"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on the 10 of this month.  It is very clean and the staff is friendly. The products were fresh and very good. I would recommend it for all......."}
{"text":"Another place i would not waste my time or money at again!  There is a VERY SMALL selection, the soups were terrible and for the price, I would rather just go to the feast buffet at sunset station for less!!!"}
{"text":"I would give Sweet Tomatoes a 3.5 if I could. I went over Thanksgiving break for lunch and was excited to be back for the first time in a while. Although the layout and options remained the same, the flavor and tastes do not stand out as much as I remember. Now that I am older, I also would like to see more options for any type of protein (I understand it is a salad bar, but salads can come with meat). First though, Sweet tomatoes is great for people who like salads and soups. There are about a dozen different soups and a huge salad bar where you can choose between pre-made salads (Caesar, garden, etc.) and creating your own. There is also a baked potato bar, foccacia breads, muffins, mac and cheese, Alfredo and some pasta. There is a small dessert section that is usually pudding, jello, soft serve, and some fruit. All in all, Sweet tomatoes is a nice place for healthy options, but for those who are looking for more than soup and salad, I would recommend elsewhere."}
{"text":"The coupon situation is now officially a joke.It is only effective if you use the coupon with a drink included,  COST without drink lunch --  $9.99 Cost   with drink lunch - $10.99 Coupon - $8.99 without drink  (save $1) Coupon - $9.99 with drink   (save about $5, $2.50 per drink)  Overall the highlights of the meal were slim. The baked potato bar and the chicken pot pie soup were good. The salads have lost their unique qualities and the cheese bread on this occassion was burnt and lacking any cheese. Choose wisely grasshopper."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! I absolutely love that I walk in and can make a salad completely to my liking. The toppings seem almost endless, and if your plate doesn't look like a small mountain, you're probably doing it wrong. They also have prepared salads which never seem to disappoint. The wonton madness is my fave! They also have a few pasta salads, a potato salad, slaws, and other treats towards the end of the salad bar. Another thing I like is that as the seasons change, so do the salads and other food they have available. Moving on... the soup bar. Wow. They have some really amazing soups. The chili is superb! Add some cheese and a dollop of sour cream and yummmmm! They also have cheesy breads which they have a fancy name for - I just can't remember it at the moment. They have freshly baked muffins and brownies, 3 different freshly made pastas, anddddd a dessert bar featuring puddings, mousse, fruit and more. And wait for it... a soft serve icecream machine withhhhh a topping bar. You really get a bang out of your buck here. I always leave feeling like I got my money's worth ( and like I'm 9 months pregnant with a food baby) . If you're looking for a tasty spot for a healthy, get delicious lunch/dinner. This is it! They also have to go options- which I've never utilized, but always see them available. Staff is always super nice and pleasant too which always makes the experience more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I am NOT a buffet fan so going here was a HUGE stretch for me. Because of our company's choice, this is where I ended up. First thing I saw was a line with droppings of every salad item out on counter. Sloppy! At least there wasn't much wait to cashier. Tables were clean and hot section looked much better. Well kept. Everyone got their trays of food and I went to bathroom to wash my hands after touching all the spoons and utensils everyone else had used to scoop food. A group of young girls had been sent in un-attended and proceeded to leave without flushing their poo or WASHING THEIR HANDS! Animal Style! Exiting restroom, I see these girls all over the dessert table! Scooping pudding, ice cream and the toppings on new dishes. Did I mention . . .THEY DIDN'T WASH THEIR HANDS? This is not the establishments fault just nasty parenting and why buffets gross me out. I would rate this higher in spite of untrained kids if the saladbar was at least clean. I gave it a 3.5 for the hot food area and nice waitress/bus girl."}
{"text":"Great variety of salads!!  Super clean and service was fast and friendly.  One of best deals in town.  The soups and breads were outstanding.  And to top it off,  dessert was a plus.  Definitely will return"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place!  It is always clean and well managed and is perfect for kids and adults alike.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We were greeted with smiling faces as we walked through the door.  There was a wide variety of things to choose from, something for everyone.  One thing I loved was the other bars, like potato bar, soup bar, and pasta bar as my bf isn't a real big salad eater, he had the options of having other things.  It was definitely a win win situation. The atmosphere was up to date, the service was awesome, and the restaurant was clean.  I'd dine here again, as it's very clean for buffet style of service."}
{"text":"Ever since Sergio, the manager that used to work at this location, disappeared it hasn't been the same. The service isn't as good, there's always dirty tables. I always liked coming when Sergio was manager, he was always on point with everything, tables were always clean and he had VERY good customer service with all the customers. I used to come here everyday and now I don't know anymore. Things are just different now. Please bring back The old manager he was super cool!! And sadly, the soups lately look like they've been sitting there for a little too long i don't know why but the soups didn't look very appetizing last time I was there."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes is better than the rest for the sheer fact that they value your business and care! I was in a late mood for Sweet Tomatoes one night and was straddling the closing time. I called this store and asked if i could still eat if I was to come right around 8:50 (they close at 9) - \"yes, we start to put the food away at 9:20 but your absolutely free to collect your food and eat for as long as you'd like.\" Then I called the Henderson location because I needed to head that way for other errands and preferred not to go out of my way for the former - \"no, we close at 9 so there would be no point.\" Well, OK then. This location didn't have to accommodate me and could've said no and I would've understood. By no means am I entitled to slow down their cleaning or any of that but so very kind of them to openly invite me to come in. Even as I sat there past 9:20, the employees came up to me to ask if I wanted so and so before they put it away, no need for that either. I really appreciated their generosity and service especially around this time of the year when your running around like a chicken with its head chopped off and forget to eat!"}
{"text":"My parents were in town visiting and Sweet Tomatoes was one of their favorite restaurants to frequent several years ago back in Chicago before they all closed. We drive passed one while running errands at Galleria Mall and knew we had to stop in!  It was exactly as we remember it. My favorite salad there is actually a staple on the menu - win! My parents particularly loved the soups and the cranberry apple cobbler this visit. My faves are the wonton happiness salad, Joan's broccoli madness and the mac and cheese.   Employees were nice. I got up to take a picture of one of the food signs for my mom and the gentlemen behind the counter was ready to solve problems until I told him she just wanted to recreate it at home.   I wish their were more drink options. I recall our old Sweet Tomatoes having a cookie bar as well which I miss. One of the breads, possibly the focaccia was way too spiced up, as in too much ginger, I immediately spit it out. The linguine alfredo was ok, not as flavorful as I would've liked.   Overall a great, moderately healthy food stop. Be sure to check in for the savings!!!"}
{"text":"There was no meat on the salad bar. That was odd. No bacon bits? No chicken? No turkey? No protein? I don't even remember seeing any eggs. It did seem clean, and well stocked. The tables were kept clean and plates efficiently picked up. While it was overrun and loud with little children, it was still easy to access all the different bars, from salad, soups, pasta, pizza, baked potatoes to ice cream. I loved the idea of the table card, to let the staff know if you are still there or not. $10 for all you care to eat salad (and carbs) is not a bad deal."}
{"text":"The salad was fresh and the wait was short.  They had a small leak in the roof so they had a bucket in the area of the soups.  There was a guy scooping soup to help you out so that was nice."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. I much rather drive to the Stephanie location way better everything!!!!! First I was confused because there was a sign that said wait to be seated so I was standing there like an idiot for 5 min and the workers were just passing by me not giving a crap so I just sat myself down I was pissed because the sign said to wait yet no one even comes to seat you. Then the only reason why I came was to get some cornbread, tomato soup, chicken noodle, and brownie bites and sadly this location had NONE. So I was already annoyed and the bowl racks were empty so quick so you have to wait then the mac and cheese taste so watered down, doesn't taste very cheesy. The spaghetti here as well the sauce tasted watered down..... not to mention they barely had a variety here. SO disappointed!!! this place is only good if you're coming to eat a salad the rest is Yuckkkkkkk. Save yourself and go to the Stephanie Henderson location. Much better and less aged. This place needs to be remodeled."}
{"text":"Now I love sweet tomatoes, but I cant even believe the horrible experience I just had at this location. The food was all cold and soggy, the restaurant was incredibly dirty, the bathrooms were so bad that I actually decided not to use them (even though I really needed to), there were no utinsels like anywhere along the buffet lines, and the employees.... Oh my god the employees. I can't even go into detail because ill get carried away, but in a nutshell--they were unprofessional, rude, LITERALLY throwing food at eachorher behind the counter, inattentive, and having the most inappropriate conversations in front of customers. The manager (who looked like she was maybe 19 years old at most), dropped the f bomb multiple times, audible from our table. And one of the kitchen guys was talking about not washing his hair for 4 days--while FLIPPING IT AND RUNNING HIS HANDS THROUGH IT... Of course... No surprise... He handled food immediately after. Basically I'm so infuriated and was irritated with the restaurant from the time I walked in the door, but kept trying to give it the benefit of the doubt because of all of the previous positive experiences I've had at other locations. I hope that someone addresses the issues at this location because its really bringing down the sweet tomatoes name."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 15 years or more. Through the changes they have always been very consistent. Fresh salads, I love the Tuna Terragone. Their soups are fantastic, Chili, tomato Bisque and chicken noodle are my favorite's. Warm breads and muffins are also yummy. Soft serve ice cream! There prices keep going up, basically $15 with drink and tip, but if you like fresh its worth it."}
{"text":"Much better food today...back to normal. May seems like a good month for the special salads. Highlights were the Tangy Turkey salad, cream of mushroom soup, Horchata muffins and the creamy Italian dressing.  Maybe if you arrive right after opening like I did, everything seems fresher and tastes better. Of course, the free birthday coupon meal saved about 10 bucks, one of the better birthday deals around town."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in a very long time but was very impressed with this location.  The number of soup choices have increased to 8, there were 3 different types of focacia breads, both russet potatoes and sweet potatoes with the accompanying toppings, and the salad bar was excellent with many different fresh choices and dressings.  I could not have been more pleased.  The ladies cleaning the tables were pleasant, quick and efficient.  The cashier was personable and friendly.   The ice cream was smooth and there were three choices instead of two plus the caramel and chocolate sauces."}
{"text":"My wife and I used to visit this location frequently; however we are much closer to the W. Bell Rd. location in Glendale. We're fairly disappointed that they ran out of tofu. Since we're vegan, it's one of few options that brought us in. Right now, tofu is advertised as being on the menu, but...we were bamboozled by their fine print of \"while supplies last.\"   Dear Sweet Tomatoes, No tofu sucks for vegan visitors. Sincerely, -Disappointed 3 out of 5 sad faces"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this location best of all the area Sweet Tomatoes. The decor has a warmer style, the staff is exceptionally nice, and the food rarely disappoints. I'd recommend that if you plan on coming, then you should opt in to their weekly email club for coupons. We never pay full price. So, it's usually under $20 for lunch for the two of us. Great eats! And excellent place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Best fresh salad buffet selection I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  Would go for the salad more than the soup. I tried the house made soup but wasn't anything special...bread was pretty good, though but didn't seem fresh. Medium strong coffee that wasn't refilled when went out. Kind service."}
{"text":"These places are pretty much the same everywhere and there is little difference in terms of food and service. This place is no exception. I will say that the person managing our table was more than attentive and returned often to offer refills. That's pretty cool.  While everything is fresh and tasty, there is one thing that irritates me a little about this place. I don't like the way they cut up their veggies. Almost everything is julienne or match stick and I don't always like the way that feels. I would rather the salad appear that it was prepared just for me. It would make me feel a little better about $12.00. That's about what it is with a drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good Sweet Tomatoes location. Even when busy, we find a seat right away and they open up both sides of the salad bar. The layout is a bit different and a tad crowded where the drinks, soups and desserts are located. In fact, the drink area  has no place for you to set down your tray, which is very dangerous for a clutzo like me. :-) Kids under three are free and they always allow my husband to pay first while I sit with our toddler and then I go through the line.   There are several unique, pre-mixed salads (the lemon/ blue cheese one today was the best ever!) and also build-your-own salad toppings. They have zucchini, squash, beets, corn, peas, raisins, feta just to name a few. Potato and pasta salads and a wide variety of dressings. In addition to the expansive salad bar, they have a baked potato and sweet potato bar, breads, pastas, pizza(make sure to get some when it's fresh) , 8 soups, variety of fresh drinks, and a soft serve machine. Oh yeah...and some fruits but we always seem to forget about those as we drool over the other items. They often seem to be out of side items or take a long time to restock, like ice for drinks, crackers for soup, peanuts for ice cream, etc.   Workers at this location are a bit slow at taking away plates and don't offer to get refills or offer cookies like all of the other locations that we have been to. Wondering if the service is part of the reason it is not as crowded as other ST's? Not bad service, by any means. They simply do not go above and beyond like staff at their sister restaurants. Dinner usually offers some type of cobbler or lava cake along with dessert. The sugar free chocolate mousse is pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying this place forever but I was actually so disappointed ... I was in the mood for some kind of salad bar, so I ended up at Sweet Tomatoes. It immediately reminded me of an industrial themed high school cafeteria salad bar. The toppings are clearly straight out of the can, and there's no protein! So I walked out with a super sad, meatless salad with cheap dressing that I'll probably skip for my own. Even the employees seemed really ambivalent. Also they don't accept the Yelp 15% off coupon for to-go!!  Long story short, you can probably get a better salad at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Had food poisoning for 3 days after eating at this location, I suspect the soup. It's a shame as it's right by my office but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go about once a month to this location. It's easy and the food is always good.  I was really bummed out when they stopped making the feta salad dressing.   Great if you are going vegan or dieting. The cream cheese carrot cake is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I really don't eat 'good'... I go buy bags of salad from the grocery store, let it rot in my fridge and it makes me feel like I ate good for the week. So a salad bar is usually not my first option for lunch.  But.... looking how it was 105 degrees today, I decided to venture and find something cool and refreshing.   First thing I notice is that everything is very clean and the staff are really quick to clean up any mess you leave on the table. I like their pre-made salads (especially the Hawaiian), but also made my own personal salad. The Big Chunk Chicken Noodle soup does actually follow up on it's name! Large, white chunks of chicken, good broth, no skimping on the noodles either. Lots of fresh veggies and leafy greens (no, not just iceberg) to choose from. First salad place I've seen that serves jaimca (?) I think that's what it's called.  The only thing that bothered me was the layout of the store kind of made it easy to bump into each other.. maybe a little more space between the food area and the eating area would help? Atleast they were lightning quick to clean up this toddler's horrible tantrum of flying food display going on in the desert area.  I actually didn't feel bloated and tired going back to work - that must be a first! About $9 for me, (no drink included), but how can you argue with unlimited everything?"}
{"text":"This our family's go to for a quick and healthy meal. The price is reasonable (sign up for their veg card for coupons or you can google them before you go). The food is always freshly made and delicious. If it doesn't look fresh (like the salad bar) you can always ask for new food and they'll change it out. There is hardly any meat in any of their food. Only some soups and pre-made salads. The staff is always so nice & friendly. Kids 2/3 and under are free and kids are 12 and under. Their soups are so good especially durning the colder months. It can get crowded during the busy eating times but we find the best time to go on weekends is around 2/3 and there's plenty of room and not so busy. This place is very family friendly."}
{"text":"Best buffet in town. Chicken noodle soup is my favorite. But they take awhile to refill the soups.Which I don't like waiting. They are  Always crowded and busy. Very clean and excellent service taking plates off the table when  your finished. Salad is always fresh when you walk through the door."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed when i came into Sweet Tomatoes tonight.  I got a beverage fully expecting to get diet Dr Pepper, and to my surprise when i went to gety drink i found that not only did they remove the diet dr pepper, they switched to Pepsi products.  Ihad i known this i would have not paid for a beverage and had water."}
{"text":"My wife finally got me to try this place after souper salad closed.  What can you say about salad, it was fresh with a good amount of choices for toppings.   The choices for the sides are plentiful as well.  Plenty of soup choices and was skeptical about the Mac and cheese but it was good.   I will come back again even though it is a long drive.   Prices go up on weekend so plan on spending more"}
{"text":"Great service and great selection of food. I love the Asian ginger broth and the salads. This is a great place with great service-they are always very attentive."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the years. Yesterday was the worst. Every plate I picked up had food stuck to it. The potato bar area was a mess with cheese and green onion in the sour cream, the chili was luke warm and the food overall was mediocre. When we went to sit down there were maybe 3 clean tables in the whole restaurant. I thought since we came in at 1pm that we may have just missed the lunch crowd, but only a handful got cleaned off by the time we were finished with our meal. Hate to leave a bad review about a place I have enjoyed eating at. However, we will not be back."}
{"text":"SALAD BAR!!!!!  My carnivore soul might have been burning when I walked through those doors, but, an all I can eat salad bar, c'mon now!  I was thrilled to find a place like this as they're nearly extinct in Minnesota (except for some lunch places downtown, and Qcumbers I believe). The process was a bit confusing at first. I stepped in, and BAM, salad bar right there, no explanation of what to do, which was kind of strange. So, just grabbed a tray and some plates and went at it like a mad man.  Prepared salads, very good. The broccoli salad was a nice, prepared caesar salad was solid. The ingredients were fresh and a work was always changing things out, which was great to see. I did have a slight concern for the eggs. I'm not sure if it was just the prep method of what looked like grinded together, but, getting them onto the plate was like dropping a ball of mashed up, clingy tofu onto the plate. I'm thinking it was just because they weren't sliced, but, ground together... which was odd to say the least.  I grabbed a couple of the muffins, because, how could a man pass up a muffin? Blueberry was VERY good. Apple Cinnamon, totally forgettable. Flavor was a mix between cinnamon and baking powder. So, skip that.  Soups... blah. Tasteless. The chicken noodle was extremely blah. Others, nothing worth even noting, even the Thai Shrimp & Udon Noodle was a total miss and tasteless.   Didn't go for the pastas or baked taters, wasn't feeling the starches.   My last comment, because I'm a meat eating monster, very little protein options available for the salads. Some eggs and cheeses, and that's about it (soy beans maybe too, can't remember totally). But, I ended up taking some boiled chicken from the chicken noodle soup and throwing it in the salad, tossing with the red wine vinaigrette and enjoying it that way.   Will that stop me from going back or wrecking a few plates of greens next time? Heck no!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here at dinnertime and it was really busy.  Took a bit of time to get through the register, but not for lack of service just lack of tables to sit at.  Salad bar was well maintained, toppings were well stocked and fresh.  I was disappointed in the price for a protein was $2.49 for ONE time through. That seems a little steep for a $10.49 buffet.  Anyway, the salad was great. There was an Asian salad that was amazing!  The soups were good, but nothing fabulous.  I really LOVED the dark bread with honey whipped butter, yum O!    The pasta was a little bland, but decent.  Disappointed that they had run out of baked potatoes and hadn't even put any in the oven.    For dessert, skip the ice cream and try the fresh strawberries with whipped cream and chopped almond granola from the ice cream bar.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Sweet Tomatoes before (mainly in Florida) and this was my first experience at one in Vegas.  I was not impressed.  We used to visit the one close to work in Orlando often because the food was awesome and the selection was amazing.    This one disappointed me.  The selections were slim past the salad bar, most of the dishes were empty or close to empty and my biggest complaint is the ranch dressing,  It was thin, unflavorful and just plain awful, which completely ruined my salad. This means I'm limited to what's left.  Which wasn't much.  I was expecting the pasta bar, wide selection of bread, and bigger selection of sides, all of which can be found at the one in Orlando on Kirkman Road.    I won't be back, nor will I recommend."}
{"text":"I do love this place as I'm always down for a good salad. I love how they switch out items and how the salad bar along with soup stations are always fully stocked and fresh. Can't complain about their fresh desserts as well. I do have to say that this place is way better than Zupas as Zupas' soup pales in comparison to this place.  I have to give all stars as my friend and I visited this place recently and after still being there half an hour before closing, they tossed the perfectly good hot items and placed fresh new batch. It shows that no matter how late and how little the number of customers there are, they still are keen on quality even with so much waste."}
{"text":"Nice selection. Only four stars because it was kinda hard to find a clean table. They may have been short staffed or had new people working the dining room. But once we got settled to our table everything was good! The soups were good, but a little on the salty side (veggie beef one) however the clam chowder was awesome!! Very nice selection of salads. I love to try their creations. A go to place when you're feeling like you need to eat your veggies!!"}
{"text":"It's really good if you're vegetarian (which I'm not). You can get great to-go value if you squish your food in real tight."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place. The food is great and the employees are kind. I go here with family, friends, and even by myself when I need the time alone but also want to eat tasty food. Thank you Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Spend the couple extra bucks and go to any other casino buffet in town. Salad bar is nothing special and the food while as advertised as healthy is very bland.   The service was poor but I made the mistake of coming during dinner time and the employees were enjoying their dinner time and or hanging out conversing with each other.  The trays and plates were wet and ALL the soup bowels were gone. I had to ask and the pasta chef for a soup bowl and he put a box of some out on the counter."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, and it wasn't too bad.. I signed up for their \"Veg Club\" online (where you can receive 20% off your bill, show it on your phone), and it worked nicely when we paid. Their stock of salad, baked goods and soups were well maintained and clean. I'm glad there were clean tables and plenty of places to sit. The employee who was constantly busing the tables was doing a great job, he even smiled at us a few times and asked how things were. Definitely come back if we're back in the area."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  I suggest signing up for emails and getting the discount, otherwise it is over priced-especially for dinner.  Watch the salad bar they have some meats they charge $2.49 extra for, and so not worth it.  Pasta sauce is good, but always over cooked noodles.  Love the sweet pot. bar.  Dessert isn't much.  If I ran the place I would get rid of the muffins and bring other things in.  Service and appearance about right for price point."}
{"text":"We go here often but yesterday the lettuce was brown and watery on most of the green lettuce, especially the iceberg. The staff was nice and notified the manager when we brought it to their attention."}
{"text":"I love this location, it is much better than the other locations (except maybe the one by talking stick) and their food is always fresh and their staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Texting while making a salad is not appreciated. Management has no control over staff who text while restocking or not restocking salad bar, texting while cashiering and who knows who else is texting. You also got that one big dude just standing over the bread area like a monster watching every move you make.  It was Italy week or something also. Tortellini salad was good Chicken soup good, cornbread and cheese bread good, yogurt good. One soda machine laughable.   Pasta soup not good, most stuff just average, no non-fat dressings. Good thing I had a coupon. Maybe the employee was texting out coupons - doubt it. save it for home pal."}
{"text":"Always good. For the price and convenience, you get same decent soup and salad. The muffins are always good as well. I think the food is a little under seasoned, but you can just salt it :)"}
{"text":"Awesome buffet for only 10 bucks during lunchtime. Lots of vegetarian choices, salads, soups, pizza (at least it looks like pizza) and desserts including ice cream. It's all included with the buffet. The mac and cheese looked amazing! I haven't ate here yet. I just took my girl here and seen everything they had to offer and everything looks fresh and clean so I'll change this review if my girlfriend doesn't like the food or if I dont like it once I try it myself."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan Sweet Tomatoes.  I like that nearly all the locations are similar in layout, so each one feels familiar.   I love bringing my kids, because they can eat whatever they want, in whatever quantity and arrangement that they want.  The seasonal specials are usually very good, and a nice change to the usual offerings.   I just went last night, and it was the first day for a California Cobb Salad and Key Lime Muffins.  Both were very good.    The staff was fast at the register and they roam the dining room to remove used plates quickly.  Nobody was refilling water glasses, which I could have sworn they've done in the past, but not a big deal at all.  There was even a guy walking around handing out fresh baked chocolate chip cookies! Bonus!  I like that there are items for everyone's tastes.  Excellent selection of premade salads and lots of options to build your own.  Several soups and pastas to choose from too.  I love getting the baked potato.   My kids are fans of the soft service ice cream."}
{"text":"For the record, I have been coming to Sweet Tomatoes restaurants since they opened in the early 90's. They have been a consistently good brand and they don't disappoint. Food is fresh, soups are good, the staff takes care of things.  My issue is not with the company, just this location...and in just one regard: NO FRUIT!  This location for some reason never has fruit on hand, they only offer frozen yogurt and junk food muffins for dessert, and ZERO healthy fruit options. Frozen yogurt is loaded with sugar and it is really no different than ice cream despite what advertising tells you. Not to mention the fudge and caramel fountain right next to the soft serve machine make it a truly white sugary nightmare. In a salad bar that caters to healthier eating, there should be healthy options for dessert, not ONLY frozen yogurt sugar and a sprinkle station and white sugar/enriched muffins.  I have avoided this location because of this, If I go to sweet tomatoes now I go out of my way to the location on Ray Road and the 10, they have fruit all the time, this one never does. It's weird, it makes no sense, and it should be fixed. A healthy eatery should have all healthy options."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat. Good salad.  Gluten free muffins.  The soups are a hit or miss.  The music is horrible.  Absolutely terrible.  It would be better off without the loud annoying music."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick and somewhat healthy lunch!  I have been here many times and will continue to come back. Good variety of salads, veggies, toppings, and dressing. Always nice and clean, staff is always friendly also.   But I come for the soup, specifically the chicken noodle soup. Large noodles and chicken pieces, sweet and savory soup, very healthy and delicious! Chili is also really good, topped with onions, and a little cheese if you want. They have other soups that changes throughout the season, good variety of creamy and brothy soups, there is a little something for everyone.   I honestly just come for the soups... soups all day long!!"}
{"text":"Typical Sweet Tomatoes, nothing too special about them. It's a very small venue and fills up quick. They seem to keep up with demand, but again, nothing special to report.   We've decided not to go back (unless someone we're spending time with specially requests it) as we just don't feel like the quality is worth the cost at this point."}
{"text":"i am a sucker for this place. its not that is soooo fantastic, its that to me when i go to phoenix/scottsdale (to visit my snowmama)  i feel like im kinda in that albert brooks/meryl streep movie that i love where they die and are in some pre-heaven place where they can eat shit all day and never get fat so the portions are huge and obscene. i dont know why retired people get more food than the rest of us,  but the sad reality is that we do get fat when we eat huge amounts of shit.   and while you can still get fat eating at this place (watch out for the choc chip cookies and the entire hot food section), you can be good, and pick the healthy good stuff and go back and feel good about yourself. its hard cause even though that pizza aint that good, after broccoli it aint bad. and again, those choc chip cookies are all over you- i dont really get why they cant leave them at the buffet but have to have some waiter come offer them to you ever 5 seconds. if you have some will power, its pretty good."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my visits here. Checked in on a Friday night tonight, and didn't realize it was themed so they had a tostada bar available and other Spanish inspired goodies like margarita muffins, nachos and posole. I tried the nachos and posole. All amazing-not super salty. The quality of their food in general is trusted. It's a clean restaurant, and the service is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Salad and the vegetables were fresh. There was a good variety of soups. Overall I had a good experience and I feel like price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place, huge! I eat here at least twice a week, it's that good!  They have a huge selection of salad items and they're always fresh and available. The toppings are just awesome if you love vegetables!  It's always clean, and sometimes there are lines, but they go fast and I've rarely ever had to wait for a table. Everyone is super nice and accommodating here.   I think the only thing that bugs me is that it is a little high for the salad and soup that I get. Lunch is around $12 and dinner is around $15 even though you get the same things. Not sure what the price difference is for.  They always have a selection of baked potatoes and toppings, lots of muffins; from corn, to blueberry to lemon although the selection can vary. They also have mac 'n cheese and pasta, but I skip that - it's way too fattening for me. They have a large selection of both regular, vegetarian and vegan soups that are all delicious. They also have a dessert bar, but I've never used it.   This is my go-to healthy place when I want  a big salad after working out. It never fails me!"}
{"text":"This is a good salad bar and you get what you paid for.  The salads that are already made are really good but not the lettuce and spinach. There were a lot of wilted pieces. They only had one type of soup I liked which was really good! Cream of mushroom was delicious.  The pastas were just okay and not a lot of flavor. Service is good and all the staff are nice.  You also get 15% off for checking in on yelp."}
{"text":"I'm livid.  I was rushed to get food for lunch but really wanted a salad and decided Sweet Tomatoes sounded like a good option. I'd never had the food here before but had heard good things.  I get to the restaurant and these two kids with their parents are being kind and holding the front doors open for me as they are entering, so I quickly hustle in behind them. I get behind this family and they take FOREVER in the line (they've got kids, I get it, I'm okay with waiting) but I wait for a long time. Finally it's my turn to pay. I'm getting the food to go so they hand me the to-go utensils, lid, and bag. I'm putting it all together and the employee tells me my price. I try to hand her my credit card and she says, \"We don't accept credit cards.\" So I ask if they take debit cards. \"Nope, only cash.\" So I asked her why they only accepted cash. \"Credit cards machine is down. It's posted on the door.\" Now I followed the family in through the front doors and didn't see anything posted, no employee at the front was greeting anyone warning us that the machines were down. So I ask what I should do with my food and they just take it and throw it away.   I go to the front door and yes there is a sign, and it's about 5x7 inches small.   So now I've wasted a bunch of time waiting in line and have to get back to work. Missed lunch. So I'm pissed. Yes they had a warning sign, no I didn't see it and no one told anyone until you got to the register.   So now the garbage really enjoyed my food, I'm starving, and I'll never attempt to go to this location again.   Excellent customer service......"}
{"text":"I went without knowing much about this place at all and was kinda apprehensive. I left more than satisfied on many levels! I am a carnivore and it did not bug me one bit that there are no meats here. I loaded up on Caesar Salad and Chinese Chicken Salad to start. Next the Broccoli and Cheese Soup was OUTSTANDING. I then tried the Chicken Albondigas and they were amazing too(only meat I saw). We were kind of in a rush so it's awesome that it is buffet style and you can get your own food and drink. Definitely recommended and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Salad, Soup, Pasta, Sweets, Fruit.  It's all fresh and you will find something you'll love.   I always go for the, what I think is called, wonton salad? Yummm. The staff there are helpful and quick, they provide great customer service.  Now let me tell you, if you do dine in, bring a sweater because it gets cold in there."}
{"text":"i'm not in love with this chain, and this location in particular is pretty bad. usually dried up or slightly brown lettuce, dirty floors, etc. when you go out specifially for fresh salads, it's just the last thing you want to be surrounded by, i guess. i lived in an apartment in the same complex as this one for a year and literally went there one time."}
{"text":"This is a buffet restaurant.  It is clean and the food is slightly above average.  I dropped it a star because they dropped Coke products in favor of Pepsi"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place love the tea and salad.  Always clean good customer service and usually have a yelp promotion going on for a bit of a discount."}
{"text":"Excellent selections, service and staff. Tammy the manager is wonderful so are the rest of her staff. The Cashiers, Oscar the table staff, etc. Every visit is a consistent experience. The Sunday Brunch is good as well. They have the best chili."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Sweet Tomatos I have been to, well looked after and clean.   They make a great effort to clean away empties fast!   Even when the place is busy it doesnt seem busy and the food is replenished fast."}
{"text":"I've visited this place many times, but always with my wife and at dinner time. Today I went at lunch and what a difference!, I never had my plates removed or even have someone ask if everything was ok. The young man was more concerned that I got the correct color glass than listening to me say I was a senior. The food was excellent as usual and the price is cheaper for lunch."}
{"text":"Clean, and stocked but so many poor points.   But getting very high in price for what they offer.    $30 for 2 for lunch... and really what do they have... a bunch of veggies 6 soups and a veggie dish.    We went there at 358pm, and was charged full dinner price.... they had not changed their signs from lunch prices... so we complained and got comps... but the menu actually did not change like you would expect most buffets to add the good stuff later when they are charging nearly double the price.    Also the dessert, whole apples and unbunched grapes.  So no one put any effort into the dessert on the day i went there.   I willl go 1 mile down the road and get Chinese, Sushi, Mongolian, Salad etc for less price."}
{"text":"Good salad bar place, my only complaints are:  1. No meat options for the salad bar.  2. Their food is pretty bland, and need salt/pepper to give it any flavor."}
{"text":"After hearing so many people rave about this spot (and being hungover and having eaten way too much greasy hangover food), I finally got over here to try this place out. We were definitely in need of some healthy, non-stomach churning items. And this place definitely fit the bill.  It's pretty cheap, especially considering how much you get and the quality of it all. All of the salad and pasta items were delicious. And most of the soups were tasty. And then there's the make-your-own sundae bar... We definitely filled up and left quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Fresh veggies buffet plus soup, pasta, breads and muffins. For about $10 per person, you can enjoy a healthy meal without a wait.   Sweet Tomatoes is pristine. The staff keep the dining area and the salad bars clean and tidy. Props to them.  They have prepared fresh salads like Caesar Salad, Wonton Salad, and a Citrus Salad. I loved the Wonton Salad. They have pasta salads like Tuna Noodle and Corkscrew with Citrus Dressing. Then, you have a build your own salad. Some of the unusual but fresh ideas were fresh beets and chickpeas. Their house dressings are pretty tasty, too. I liked the fat-free ranch and balsamic vinaigrette.  They had a variety of soups: French Onion (sans baked crouton with gruyere, or course), black bean fiesta, New England Clam Chowder, and I enjoyed their Chicken Pot Pie stew which you could top with a biscuit.   In their hot foods bar, they had spaghetti with marinara sauce and a couple of other pasta like dishes.   Their bakery had corn bread, muffins, cheesy garlic bread and a 4 cheese flat bread.  $2.50 for fountain drinks.   I am glad I tried Sweet Tomatoes but it is too much food albeit fresh and healthy for a little too much money. The salads and soups were okay, but did not have the WOW factor for me.

{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes has to be one of my favorite salad places in Las Vegas. I am originally from California and there is a place called soup plantation out there that is very similar to this place. So if you are from out of town, Sweet Tomatoes might be a comparison of what you are looking for. If you are in the mood for a salad that you can create on your own this is the place to go. They are very reasonable with the prices and they also have a pizza, pasta and desert section. It is a clean establishment and the service is excellent! I would recommend this place to anyone who is out for lunch or dinner and is craving something light and tasty."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. I wasn't impressed with the desserts. What happened to all the puddings? Ice cream or dry brownie muffin."}
{"text":"This place is like coming home.  The food is good enough but exactly what you expect and want.  Sometimes it's a bit messy and I wish they would swap out the serving utensils every 15 minute to keep things sanitary.   After the Field kitchen debacle this place is now always busy.   One piece of advice for the management.  How about bringing out enough fresh baked cookies for everyone instead of half your patrons?   And that's my only complaint.   See you next thyme.  Haha."}
{"text":"I don't believe that I can go longer than one week without this place.  I love the fresh salad choices!  Also the selection of delicious soups, bread and deserts.  If all I was rating was the quality of the food, I would give it 5 Stars. However, it is no different than any other buffet when it comes to hunting for clean dry plates. You still have to periodically inspect 2 or 3 plates that are wet and have food stuck to them. Given the choice between Souper Salad and Sweet Tomatoes... The winner is Sweet Tomatoes by a mile!

{"text":"I had loved this place in the past , and was surprised at what I saw one day. I had t old him how great this place was and clean so he wanted to check it out. We were there at the end of lunch  and the start of dinner.To see how the  2 are different and I wanted to see what changes they made for dinner. So we stuck around to see . What we do see was a big supprise they pit bags go dirty towels by the soups an a lot of them. They all most layers over in to the soup. To say the less we did not want to have any more soup! I even goop a photo and waited. 10 min to see if this bag would be moved but that had not happened yet. I did not care to eat any more and left. Went t  I called the main  offices they had nothing to say, So is  this ok that will be up to you."}
{"text":"I'm a salad FREAK, and Sweet Tomatoes does not disappoint! If you can't find something to eat here, you're not hungry. From the massive salad bar, with super fresh toppings, always filled to the brim, to the baked potatoes, pizza, chili, bread, many, many soups to the pasta...and so on! Something is always coming up ''fresh'' and you don't have to wait long. I really have never had a bad experience here. The staff is friendly, the 'servers' very attentive at clearing plates. They keep the place nice and clean. Yes, it's a family friendly restaurant so there are going to be kids.   The strawberry lemonade is DELICIOUS and I'm so glad they made it a regular part of their line. Now they just need to add in that delicious cucumber dressing they had once, and I'll be totally happy.   I love Sweet Tomatoes. With the coupons online it's a really good deal for all that freshness. Custom made salad, soups, fresh baked breads, pasta, baked potatoes, ice cream, brownies, make your own sundaes.... What's not to love???"}
{"text":"this location had the nasiest food I ever ate. We ate there tonight after 4 everything was so bland and nothing was stocked on a regular basis. Would really like all money back, went home and all 3 of us threw up.Food here was so gross!!! Ill never eat at this location again, Very very nasty!!!  Our seats were taped with duct tape in a booth,very much in need of a update, Puke is all I can say!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at these places before (different city's) usually have no issues, however this place is not clean and no longer has cold cut topping (ham, turkey, etc) \"due to theft\" what I was told. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with an old teacher who lived in the area. Enjoyed it mostly because of the company. It is what it is, a simple soup and salad buffet, no matter if it's named Sweet Tomatoes, Soup plantation, or fresh choice. For $9 a person, it's not bad. The food was pretty fresh and the staff was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today. Light, flavorful and nice variety. The buffet was very well maintained. The floor staff were all very happy, friendly and kept the place immaculate. We left refreshed and happy. Thanks"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sweet Tomato and I was not impressed.  I'm not dying to return.  My salad was the best part of the meal.  With all that said, the price was affordable. $10 for lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Never eaten at this location & will not make the mistake again. The place was filthy- very dirty stained carpets, spilled food on the carpets, tile floor by warm food area was sticky and dirty, and a ceiling tile that was bulging from an air conditioner leak, exploded over a couple of tables. The food was a bit old, even the breads under the heat lamps were cold. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Giving two stars is generous for this place.  Salad bar with empty containers, as were many of the things in the section for soups, etc. Really pretty ratty place."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is best described as a soup and salad buffet. Considering there is no meat on the menu, I think the price is a bit steep @ $11.49/pp NOT including a drink. Drinks will set you back an additional $2.49. So basically almost $14/pp for  lettuce and soup! The good news is if you sign up for their rewards club, you get an email every 2 weeks or so with coupons that take about $5 off. Luckily I had just received a coupon when my aunt invited me to dinner. The cashiers can scan the coupon code right from your smart phone, in case you forget to print it out.  The buffet line begins as soon as you walk in the door. You grab a tray and a plate and proceed down the salad line where you can build your own, or try some of the pre-made ones they have, like my favorite the Asian wonton. At the end of the line you pay and then seat yourself. Then you make your way over to the hot food items, where they have 5/6 different types of soup and chili, a few different breads and muffins, baked potatoes, and a few pasta's. This particular visit I tried the tomato soup and cream of rosemary potato, which were both very good. The pasta I tend to stay away from because it is too watery. For dessert they have a soft-serve ice cream machine as well as pudding and fresh fruit. I usually take the brownie muffins and put them in a bowl with some chocolate soft serve on top and some hot fudge and it makes for a pretty tasty dessert.  Yelp 2015 Review #18"}
{"text":"This is an excellent salad and soup bar. You can chose from an enormous selection of  salad ingredients, all fresh, and make you salad as  big as you can eat. Also, the have 5 different soups, several pasta choices, and Dessert!!  Yea! Take that, diet! You can feel virtuous and full at the same time, while bragging to your friends \" I had salad for lunch.\""}
{"text":"We were in Gilbert for a softball game and stopped for dinner at the Sweet Tomatoes on Power Road.    Mistake!  It was filthy.   Waiters were no where to be seen.  The assortment of food was scarce.    The bowls were empty of lettuce.   The floor were so dirty and hadn't been sweep.   The soup was horrible.   The sweet potatoes were discussing.    And the cost was $23.00 with no drink. (2 people). We won't be back!     We go regularly to Arrowhead Sweet Tomatoes and I guarantee they keep everything full and have waiters that come around and pick up your empty dishes and the restaurant is spotless."}
{"text":"I don't know why Souplantation names their restaurants outside of California Sweet Tomatoes, but I don't mind either way. The design/logo is similar enough that my family and I realized what it was.  The decor in this restaurant is nicer than other Souplantations I've been to in California. It was less crowded (granted, we went at 3:30PM) and it was very clean.   All you can eat salad and soup, plus pizza, breadsticks, and dessert. They only have one soda machine - it's one of the fancy new ones with 100s of flavor combinations, so the line can be pretty slow with people deciding what they want or trying to figure out how to use the machine.  A couple of downsides: limited selection of fruit and no clam chowder when we went. Those are my two favorite things I look forward to when coming to Souplantation!  Otherwise, a great, family-friendly place to have a healthy, inexpensive, and yummy lunch.  Tip: Look online for coupons! They usually have a discounted price and a free drink for lunch."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes is always a good move. They'll never get your salad wrong cause you make it yourself! Pretty much every type of lettuce, vegetable, mix in, and dressing imaginable.   They also have a selection of hot foods such as soup, pizza, bread, pastas, and warm pastries to enjoy as well. It's pretty easy to get a bang for your buck too since it's all you care to eat once you've paid."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Be good if there was someone that cleared tables. We come here often and it's usually 5 stars. The past two times we have been here they haven't come by to clear the old plates. Makes me want to use the same plate till they tell me I can't, then I can tell them there's no room for more plates cuz you haven't removed any!!! Party of 5 in a table that seats 4. We are already crowded. Cmon people!!!!"}
{"text":"OMGosh! Such a nice place! Sort of like a GOlden Corral but with salad. They are kind of pricey and more than what I imagined. Went here with my BF and one of her classmates. We literally only had about 25 mins to closing as we thought they closed at 10:30, not 10pm. We got on line, got our plates and started to build our salads. We pretty much closed the place as we were the last ones there. The staff was VERY nice, especially the one guy Abraham...he was so nice we tipped him!~ :-) The drink options were good. The Strawberry lemonade! The muffins, pizza,brownies, fruit and cornbread...in addition to my yummy salad...I ate like a champ! Small issue with salad dressing. Apparently they do not carry the ONLY dressing I eat...Ceasar.  How is this when they have an ALREADY PREPARED Ceasar salad? Weird.  The soups looked old and had a nasty film on the top layer, but seemed to be good when they were fresh. I opted out!  Great place. Would certainly return."}
{"text":"Love to go and pile up my plate with tons of salad and eat all the ice cream and bread I want...it's a full plate of oxymoron for sure!  Eat all the salad and bread you want and it's still supposed to be healthy...Yah Right!  So love to go and recommend it always!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to wanting to feel healthy eating at a buffet, Soup Plantation or Sweet Tomatoes is always first pick for me. I enjoy the pricing, the foods that are normally on the healthier side, as well as the soups, pastas and desserts.  This time I will say the restaurant was lacking a bit. The salads were amazing. They had a broccoli in a sauce with bacon, cashews, cranberries and other ingredients that made for a sweet and delectable and enjoyable bite. I enjoy all the dressings and cheeses available, especially the blue cheeses, because its my favorite.  As for the soups, that is what normally limits when I go. I love me broccoli cheddar, but there was none yesterday. I wasn't a fan of trying most of the other soups, though the pumpkin bisque was nice. I think sp/st has such a great chicken noodle soup, however, yesterday was somewhat of an exception. Though the soup was good, it could have been great, like it normally is, if they would have added some salt or flavoring. The chili is always a favorite of mine too, but I guess they've changed recipes over the years... so instead of a mashed thicker chili, it was more of a liquid soup with beans in it. (I used to enjoy putting a corn bread piece in the bowl and dousing it with chili). I'm not the biggest fan of this new chili, though still good, not as great.  The breads were all good. The pizza like bites were delicious. The corn bread was a star in the buffet, as usual. Extremely delicious. I really enjoyed the baked sweet potato with maple butter (I ate 2, wanted another but was extremely full).   Pastas were a let down this visit. Normally very rich and delicious, this time only tasted like pasta with store bought sauce. Not bad, but not great as normal.  As for desserts: chocolate mousse is sugar free and should not be consumed by anyone lol I'm not a fan, and never have been. Sugar free isn't good, but I guess it is healthy. The pumpkin spice muffins were delicious, and as were the brownie muffin which you can put underneath a nice thick blanket of ice cream!   All in all, I enjoy this place, but it could be better as it used to be."}
{"text":"This location has such spectacular memories for me. Having hosted many fundraisers for Scottsdale Desert Stages (my home away from home)   I love the support this location has for their community.   Also they never shy away from offering Military discounts. My husband and I showed up after he had drill in uniform and they offered a discount for us both.   I also love their cream of broc soup. It is what I hold all other soups too :)"}
{"text":"My family of six loves the healthy food at a great price that we always find at Sweet Tomatoes (particularly thanks to their online coupons). It is a relaxing and comfortable place to eat. However, the same can not be said for the bathrooms, unfortunately. They are simply disgusting -- like nasty gas station bathroom disgusting. Broken tile. Damaged stalls. Filthy counters. A few days ago we went to the restaurant and upon entering the bathroom (already nervous because it's always yucky) I discovered that the only urinal in the room was covered in a plastic garbage bag with an out-of-order sign on it. Super gross. My wife says the women's bathroom is always equally disgusting. This is where the employees do their business while preparing our food? It makes us question the cleanliness of the kitchen food prep areas. Yuck. We unfortunately will not be going back to the Henderson location of Sweet Tomatoes until their bathrooms are remodeled. I'd rather use the bathrooms at McDonalds.  I will happily change my review to 5-star once the bathrooms are remodeled to be clean, useful, and welcoming."}
{"text":"The only reason I did not give Sweet Tomatoes Souplantation five stars is because I did see some customers not handling utensils properly.  In addition to people improperly handling the utensils there were solicitors looking for us to buy food and we were already eating food so moot point right. Hats off for Candice and Evan, those two managers totally Rock.  They both handled my dilemma that I had before coming to Sweet Tomatoes beautifully. Candice initially was going to handle it but she was off,  so Evan ended up handling the matter and they did a great job working together as a team. Great job Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Clean and fresh, management keeps treating me like family every time I come in!!! I love this place, healthy and easy! Here almost every day and my expectations are exceeded again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, it's clean salad bar with a good choice of soups too! Well managed and not to pricey."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes has lots of great healthy options that never fail to leave me full but feeling great. Great place to go for lunch with friends and sit around sampling all the different soups, salads, pastas, breads, and desserts."}
{"text":"I love salads. My husband calls me a rabbit because I prefer salads over hamburgers etc. For it to be a salad buffet, they are totally lacking in the salad dressing department. Customer service was nice and they also gave me a cookie gift bag because it was my first time there. I just didn't like much of the choices and the soups were warm. Not as hot as I would like them to be."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Food is always fresh and the price is right! Great salads and yummy baked potatoes. Nice little dessert set up as well."}
{"text":"There was a good variety of salad items to choose from. The soups were fantastic. Customer service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, fairly clean, and since it's all you can eat I guess you can't complain about the price.  I wish there was more.... Meat? There wasn't any meat in the establishment unless you count the bacon bits. Chicken is cheap at least let me get some chicken on my salad. I was full when I left but hungry an hour later"}
{"text":"I've been going to sweet tomatoes my entire life and while I always really enjoy it my recent visit to this Tempe location has been my best experience this far. The salad bar was top notch, the selection of soups and the muffins were fantastic. For families, this is a great option for going to eat without spending a fortune as well."}
{"text":"It's salad................ and lots of it. great place to go when your looking for something light that wont bog you down later when you find yourself running from the police. The food always tastes great and is as fresh as it gets."}
{"text":"Regular place with decent food for an affordable price. The service, however, goes above and beyond the kind of service I would expect from a place like this. I'm not sure what their job descriptions are, but the employees who collect plates are simply delightful. I wouldn't expect them to get refills for me when I can walk 3 feet to do it myself, but they offered and it was a most welcome gesture of good customer service. Additionally, we were asked if there was anything from the food bar that we wanted brought to our table (again, a simple but very kind and thoughtful gesture). Those employees are exemplary and whoever manages deserves recognition as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE SWEET TOMATOES...nom nom nom nom NOM! Oh they have a theme that they change monthly and my month of weakness is when they have their tomato soup and grilled cheese bready goodness. I would be embarrased to say that during that month I ate here as much as possible, but I'm going to blame it on the prego hormones. I would drag anyone and everyone here just to stuff my face with its goodness! That month is over, I still go once or twice a month. My stomach can't hold as much food as it used to since the space is currently occupied. My family and friends got sick of it, too, so its harder for me to find people to go with me haha."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that the Sweet Tomatoes was returning to it's original format, but I was disappointed to see that they kept some of the worse elements of the Field Kitchen. The lightbulbs on the booths are seriously eye damaging. Who wants to stare at uncovered lightbulbs, for God's sake. The salad bar has been reduced, although the new dressing choices are nice. They got rid of the shredded zucchini, which was my absolute favorite. They kept some of the WORST employees on, and the same leering guys behind the hot counter to make all women feel as uncomfortable as possible. The drink/dessert station is about a foot wide so when two or more people are there, it is mayhem. The soup bowls are made for burning your thumb. The glassware makes for a very nervewracking trip to your table.   The thing that I hate the most, there is only iceberg or spring mix lettuce on the salad bar now. So your choice is either the zero nutrional crunchy iceberg or soggy nutritious spring mix. I miss the straight romaine option. I really don't think that Sweet Tomatoes execs. understand their customers AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going for the BBQ chicken a it had chicken particles in it.  You literally would needed a telescope to find the chicken. If you want sugar, white flour items your in heaven. I was disappointed makes me wonder if they are having $$$$ problems even the potatoes salad is cut up in rations. I think Jasons Deli is a healthier abs better value if you want healthy food."}
{"text":"We frequent this location quite often. The employees are always very friendly, food is always fresh, and overall always a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with the sweet tomatoes brand. I enjoyed the giant salad bar that you walk in and see. I wish they had bacon in that line but have no fear it's over by the baked potato bar. The food was good 4/5. Mac and cheese had very little flavor, same with the cheese bread and chicken noodle but the salad and soft serve made up for that. 10ish bucks a person makes this place a good stop for lunch. Coupons are plentiful with a quick google search and then go enjoy! (This place is not for anyone on a diet)"}
{"text":"This is our nth time visiting Vegas and earlier in the day we had our customary buffet on the Strip.  It was 7pm and because we had way too much meat and crab legs for lunch, we thought a nice salad dinner was a must.    Getting here from the Strip takes about 15 min. w/o traffic.  Be sure to take the \"82B\" exit from the I-95.  It will lead you straight into the humongous shopping center and Sweet Tomatoes will be right behind Applebees.  I have to admit I'm a regular at the Souplantations in the OC.  My favorite item there is the Clam Chowder, but for some reason Sweet Tomatoes (which is pretty much the same thing as Souplantation w/ a different name) does not offer this soup.  Because of this tiny little detail, I couldn't give it 5 stars.  The veggies were fresh.  Chocolate lava cake, that's only offered after 4p, was delish.  And the lady who took away our dishes was kind enough to bring us a plate of freshly baked cookies.  The staff overall was very polite and that made the whole dining experience pretty darn great."}
{"text":"Ate there today .....in a word YUCK !  I should say the salad bar was ok, fresh veggies, but pretty boring. Pasta salads that were just noodles. But we managed to put a plateful (plastic plates) of salads together. The soups were disgusting, ....you know the water left over when you boil hot dogs? There you go. The bread was stale and looked like Wonder bread left unwrapped for 3 days. The chocolate moose left a strange aftertaste. The tapioca looked more like chicken noodle soup, than the soup ! Needless to say , we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very clean, good service, and fresh food when I went on a weekday in the summer. For those of you from California, this is the same as Souplantation. Be sure to look for a coupon online before you go, they usually always have a dinner + drink discount.  If you've never been, you grab your salad bar items before you pay. It is a buffet, so feel free to grab a tray with usually one or two plates. The have premade salads (sometimes soggy but premixed for you, my preference) or build your own salad. They also have a ton of toppings and side salads, which I really like the tuna pasta salad and the broccoli salad.   After you pay, you seat yourself here. It was very busy the night that we went, but we were able to find a table pretty easily. They have a large variety of soups, 3 pastas, 2 flatbread/pizzas, different baked quick breads, baked potatoes, and simple fruit & frozen yogurt selection. Its a great spot to go if you can't decide what to have for dinner."}
{"text":"The sweet tomatoes is the best for a quick soup and salad. They always have fresh ingredients to build a salad just the way you want it. And you must try the broccoli salad- It is the reason I go there. But note that they do not offer any meat for your salad.  After you finish your salad there are a handful to delicious soups waiting for you to try them. They also have servers walking around clearing plates and making sure you have everything you need.   Sign up for their emails and get great discounts because it can get pricey."}
{"text":"Love this location! They have the coolest decor, industrial/rustic. So cute. Staff friendly and super clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant for several reasons.  The food is healthy and it's not a fight to get the kids to eat it. They request to come here.  It's VERY reasonably priced, and their soups are delicious."}
{"text":"I really like the concept behind Sweet Tomatoes: salad buffet!  It's a fun way to get your greens when you're out and about.  In addition to salad, you can supplement your veggies with soup, pastas, and desserts (think homey cobblers, brownie bites, and muffins).  Sweet Tomatoes is definitely \"cafeteria casual\" and its clientele is compromised of young families, vegetarians, and seniors (my observation on several visits).  While I appreciate the freshness of the produce and prepared foods -- turnover seems to be very quick -- I think that the price is a little high for what you get (about $12 for one adult dinner without drink), especially since there are hardly any protein options (beans in the salad area, cheese in some of the pastas, and chicken in the chicken noodle soup consist of all the protein offerings).  However, for my pickier friends who just can't decide on anything and who want to eat healthier, I'll typically suggest Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, salad bar is always clean and lots of fresh stuff to choose from. Nice selection of soups and sides."}
{"text":"Great food and an awesome selection of food. I have only been to Sweet Tomatoes a few times, but the salad bar is always fresh and full. The selection of soups is always great. But I don't think that the Chicken Noodle can be beat, yet... Bring some company and try a little bit of everything because you are bound to get full."}
{"text":"Hell no!!! This is just ridiculously sad. Healthy?  Nope!!! Nothing heathy. Nothing is actually fresh!!!! You really are eating canned prepackaged foods."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes. It's alright, but it seems a bit pricey for soup and salad. And though there are other things besides these, the choices are still pretty limited."}
{"text":"The food is always on point here.  During the last visit tho, most of the plates and trays weren't clean.  They had food debris on it and some trays felt oily.  We will be back though.  The kale soup is really good too. Would be nice to have some chicken or other protein in the salad line."}
{"text":"I only came here because someone gave me a couple of passes. Their salad was same 'ol stuff, nothing to write home about. Their prepared salads like the pasta variety was meh at best. They had 2 kinda of chili but no clam chowder. (That can never happen at a soup and salad place) Drinks like Arnold Palmer and Strawberry Lemonade were just colored water, no flavor. Disappointing."}
{"text":"So I have to say Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite places to eat but this is by far one of the worst locations.  Let's start with the dishes. Had to get water cup swapped out because it was very dirty and then silverware as well because there was gross left over food stuck to it. No napkins stalked at our table so we had to pull some from another table. Table was very dirty as well so this location has to work on cleanliness.  Second the food... So disappointed. Salad bar ok... however soup selection wasn't the best and what they had wasn't good. The vegetables inside the soup were extremely hard. Like they had cut them up and put them in the soup raw.  Muffins and bread were hard like they had been sitting out. All around the food was just gross.  Mentioned it to the manager and he could have cared less  Lastly... last time we were here my 7 year old burned herself grabbing one of the utensils to grab the bread. They get very hot. She needed ice and it left a mark. This time she remembered because it literally scarred her... this time the little girl right next to me did it with the garlic bread. They should really put something in the handles or have a warning. They are metal handles sitting Under heat lamps. that's a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Won't be returning here. Especially after manager didn't care about us not being happy about this visit."}
{"text":"I've been to this ST a few times and have always experienced friendly staff and fresh food.  I've noticed that the salad bar turnover is high, which explains the high quality of vegetables.  The soup station features 5-6 different soups, all made on-site and all tasty.  Baked offerings include several different types of bread (foccacia w and w/o cheese, cornbread, muffins) and dessert (crisps, cobblers, molten cake).  Frozen yogurt and fruit station seem popular, but can't tell you what they're like as I've never had any of it!  ST is great for vegetarians and for those wanting a lighter meal (as long as the desserts and cheesy items are consumed in moderation).  Cheap buffet + cafeteria style ambience = casual meal out.    Hey, no tip necessary!  :)"}
{"text":"$9.07 is your total cost if you just get the salad buffet and a glass of water. Pretty reasonable. Sweet Tomatoes consists of one huge salad bar, a six soup bar, three pasta dishes bar, baked potato bar, and a dessert bar of some fruit, cottage cheese, pudding or apples. Everything is self serve, and they have fountain soda. Fountain pop? Fountain soda pop? Fountain cokes? What do Nevadans say? I haven't found out.  After four trips, I'm starting to find the salads monotonous. (Four trips to the restaurant, not the salad bar!) But when the urge to pack myself full of romaine and spinach is at hand, this is the best place to turn to in south Henderson.  Every day they have a lineup of homemade soups and chili. They tend to lack salt, but Sweet Tomatoes's whole raison d'etre is cheap healthy eating.  They have these fresh baked breads that are borderline pizza which are great."}
{"text":"Salad bar is full of varieties veggies croutons dressings oil pasta and all. Pasta varieties are not that great. Can go der for focaccia and strawberry punch cake .pastas needs to be changed in cooking perspective need to add more varieties in softees"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good it has an awesome buffet with so many options. Not too pricey but still really fun and yummy."}
{"text":"It been sometime since my last visit. I have always been fan of Sweet Tomatoes for many reasons since my first visit. The things I like is the simplicity of the buffet nothing too crazy but simple food, fresh, and really not lot of unhealthy food on the menu. It all starts with the obvious the salad bar first thing hit before even pay and sit down. The selection of salad greens great (choose from head lettuce, organic mix greens, romaine greens, and one more think fresh spinach), and two prepared salad ceasars salad was one of them. The toppings is pretty diverse from raw vegetables, pasta salad, garnishes, and something NEW never notice before have premium topping that  can add too salad for price (honestly none of it looked that great too just ify spending more plus still the soups, mac/cheese, and more things the menu not even checked out yet). The salad dressings over ten different ones too choose one. Me generally italian dressing guy or creamy italian dressing. Once done with the salad get seated unfortunately being holiday ended up waiting ten mins at most. Still not that bad wait. The manager very friendly, and made the short wait go by easy.  The soups range for four too five usually vary from day too day. Most part there all pretty solid soups. I had the chili and the creamy mushroom soup on this visit. Both of the soups were good and hearty. Nice and hot perfect on cold day. The cornbread I LOVE it. Between Famous Dave and Sweet Tomatoes could be in cornbread bliss. I ended up getting four pieces of it!!!! The mac and cheese is good. It little on the running side which prefer more thick and cheesy one. Still works for me. The pizza is good but this visit ran out of room.   Another thing enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes is there lemonade. It says house made so assume the obvious. I enjoy the strawberry lemonade! It nice and refreshing perfect compliment with nice salad (light, hearty, or any style you choose). Not super sweet just right amount.   The price is very reasonable and if looking for light buffet Sweet Tomatoes is the way too go....."}
{"text":"We came here the other night since we had gone to Tempe branch and they are closed.  We were able to use our coupon which was buy one get one free. Great coupon! 2 meals for 17.00, excellent food ,great salads. So many soups to choose from.  Everything you could want. They have here and the turn over is so fast they are always fresh.  Kidney Beans were all smashed up & no one changed them out other than that every thing looked great! You can eat on the patio as well as inside. Like this place,it is good ,food is fresh and I will for sure come back."}
{"text":"First visit in quiet some time...salad bar was very good, just as I remembered.  Good choice of soups and various pasta's and breads.  All you can eat (which can be a good or bad thing) but all the food is very fresh and a good value for the price."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and with all the coupons they offer, you can get a healthy meal at a decent price. They have a big selection of veggies and my daughter likes that they have tofu. The chili is pretty good and my son loves the pasta."}
{"text":"Portions are EXTREMELY small other than the salads. Other than that the food is really tasty! This is a family place so be prepared to see old people and crying babies"}
{"text":"It's not that I don't like Sweet Tomatoes, I still do. If you asked me a year ago I would've said it was 4 stars but now that they've raised the price a few times since then, it's not really worth it to eat here anymore unless you get a coupon which are usually available in the newspaper or via email if you sign up for their e-club. I came here last weekend and was shocked to see that the lunch price was now just under $10! For a salad buffet? WTF  The benefits to eating here are that you get to build your own salad from an extensive line of veggies, toppings, and seemingly homemade dressings. There are also pre-made salads and pasta salads but none are usually very good or worth eating. I usually try a couple but then end up grossed out after a couple bites. Once you get to the end of the salad bar, you select a drink and pay for your meal.   In the dining room there is a soup, pasta and potato bar where you can choose from about 6-8 different kinds of soup and also load up on extra carbs like breads, pizza, pastas like mac & cheese, and baked potato with various toppings. I usually just go for the soup and breads so I can't comment on the others.  There is also a dessert area adjacent to the soup bar with fruit, pudding and soft serve ice cream. The only thing worth eating here is the tapioca pudding and ice cream. I even realized on this last visit that these 2 things are even better mixed!  Overall Sweet Tomatoes is a good place to go pig out on food you think is healthy, but really it's not...unless all you get is plain veggies. I used to love coming here (and their other locations) but now the pricing is just getting out of hand. Is food cost really up that much for a bunch of veggies and soup stock? Doubtful"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience at sweet tomatoes. Super friendly staff. The line is a bit slow at times, but it may well be because everyone is armed with coupons!  On my lazy days, a soup and a salad to go from this place is god-sent.  I have to say the hot dish selection is not as good as it used to be, and the last time I tried the ice cream it tasted too watery for my liking. But for how little I paid, I am not complaining."}
{"text":"Been to Sweet Tomatoes before and love it.  First time to this location and I was not disappointed.  The selection was good, the place was clean and the staff was helpful and friendly.  All salad items were available and fresh.  All you can eat salad, soup, bread, dessert and a soda was $12.  Not bad, especially if you are hungry. Very spacious with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"The food is fine, with the exception of hot beverages,  which are always lukewarm. The upholstery in the booths is filthy and most of the vinyl seating in the booths need to be redone. This place is showing its age and lack of reinvestment."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in the lobby with my friend waiting for our other friends to finish because nothing here looks like food. It's all slimy-looking salads and gnarly soupish like concoctions. Gross."}
{"text":"The thing i like about this place is the selection and it is all very fresh!    The coupons really help as well. It is always very clean here,the kitchen and dining area.   So no problem there. Soup is fantastic and if you can't find what you like ,then you are very picky.     Something new that they have started is charging for special toppings.     Which can really up your bill.  But, other than that, you cannot beat the choices.  Bathrooms are somewhat clean. I am sure it is hard to deep up with it all the time. Lots of parking in the lot."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a year with a large group of ladies. We live the treatment we get, they are great about handling groups. The food is such a great large variety of salads, soups, breads, drinks foods etc. I appreciate how they make us feel welcome. They have plenty of inside and patio seating. Is great for small groups or individuals. Love it! Thank you"}
{"text":"Seems like the quaility of food here wasnt the same as soup plantation at California.   All the soup and salid had a funny taste to it all."}
{"text":"Wow, this was the worst experience I've ever had at a sweet tomatoes. It was my first time at this location and it'll be my last.  Customer service was great but the food was horrible. Talk about carb central. The options for the salads were great, and fresh. Just very unconventional that you have to walk all the way out to the front of the restaurant to get more salad. The soups were flavorless, and watery. The chili had no flavor, and the chowder tasted of pure sweet corn. More like a desert than soup, yuck! Said potatoes in it but I saw and tasted none. There was \"pizza\" if you could call it that. Just tasted like a bread stick.. And not a good one at that. The pastas vey flavorless and cold. The sauces were dried to them which meant they'd been sitting under the lamp a while. The only thee option was a baked potatoe. Which were dry and over cooked. Fail.  The corn bread was good but that's about it. Especially paired with the sweet butter  Only desert was ice cream and these midget cones. They were so small you couldn't put ice cream cause its fall off.  The one on lake mead is ten times better and I will tell everyone to stay away.   For four people it cost us 50 bucks. It's crazy it's ten a person not including your drink. I would have rather had mc Donald's or Taco Bell."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled this location and now it looks a lot nicer, especially with the new wood floors. I used to come here regularly but since they keep raising their prices I don't see how it's worth it anymore, especially when their food has little proteins and service is mediocre. Takes forever just to pay for your food since they only have 1 cashier despite having 2 separate lines at the salad bar.   Sign up for their e-club to get regular coupons sent to you.  During the holidays they also have gift card deals where you get a free meal with every $50 in gift cards purchased. Makes it a lot easier on your wallet when you get a craving for a DIY soup and salad spot"}
{"text":"They are either lacking employees or the ones there aren't doing their job at all. There's food all over the buffet line, food mixed in among other containers, serving wear placed on top of the food so the costumers touch all the pizza and muffins when grabbing the serving wear, they don't clean the table when you are eating.. plates piled up on every table in the restaurant. Employees coping attitudes, not greeting customers, hiding in the back nor did they bother to smile as they stand behind the hot food buffet area. Terrible dining experience all around!!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want unlimited salad and soup, there isn't much of a selection of anything else. They have homemade soups and dressings which are all very good, but most of the soups were on the salty side. About $12 a person for dinner and free refills on drinks (sodas and juices) but if you're not on a budget there's plenty of better places to eat."}
{"text":"This place has not MOVED! It is just changed names back to Sweet Tomatoes again.  OK, here is a word to the wise. If it is not broken ,do not fix it. This was one of our favorite Sweet Tomatoes to go to. We really liked it , plus it was close  by. Then they changed it to Test Kitchen or something, and it flopped big time. So now they have changed it all back to Sweet Tomatoes, or so they say!  We came here last night for dinner. We were pretty excited because, we really liked Sweet Tomatoes. Well, now it looks very industrial. The lovely plants that are growing outside on the planters are all starting to die. This is an indication of what is going on inside.  Everything is tin now. TIn strays and ice cream bowls and all the containers they put the soup and other items in to.   Nothing looks like it used to. It all looks cheap, like they have changed the ingrediants. Because, it certainly tastes like they have. They have glass glasses now,which I do like better than the plastic. The Pasta looks aweful, we could not even try it. It just looked bad.  The salad was good, but they have taken away things like the chickpeas and the kidney beans. In its place they have a 3 bean salad type thing.  They did still have sunflower seeds and raisins  which  is good,as well as the Joan's Brocili dish.  But, even the soup seems differant. The lemon Orzo tasted like fake flavors and hardly any chicken. The Chili was a little better with more meat. But, I have to say I was in no way impressed. They do not even have real Butter anymore. It is margarine and flavored Butter, I just want the real thing.  What they were presenting as Ice Cream was not, More like an Ice Milk that had an artificial taste to eat. No one ever came to clear a single dish away from our table. The staff used to be so good about that. Maybe most of them have left because, it has all changed and they are losing money as well. With no so much tipping.  I can honestly say we will never be back to this location,if it stays as it is.  I guess we will drive out to Phoenix, or Awahtukkee.  We used to go to Sweet Toms once a week. But, not know. The have ruined it.  Oh I forgot to mention that they now serveAlcohol. I just do not see why that is needed at all. This is suppose to be healthy dining."}
{"text":"I just can't help myself when I go to Sweet Tomatoes. I go here thinking I am going to eat healthy. But I end up with one plate of salad and make about 5 runs for the baked goods and ice cream!  The selection is nice of salad items and premade salads. And their soups are great. I like to get creative when I dine here, trying to mix everything together. Can't say the food is always fresh, but its decent, not old and dry looking.  I like to get the baked potato with their fresh honey whipped butter and sour cream and then put chili in it with some tabasco! YUM!  And then the chocolate brownie muffins with ice cream for dessert.  Their seasonal items are always great. For the fall, or maybe just November.. they had chicken pot pie with biscuits, pumpkin spice muffin with cranberries, and after 4pm, they have a gooey pumpkin cake.  Don't expect too much and you will be surprised what you do get out of this place. I always leave happy and really stuffed. It may just be soups, salads, and muffins, but they do it well.  Generally I try to eat low carb and high protein, so this place is not a \"healthy\" choice for me at all. Pricing is good and there's plenty of seating. And they have good selection of beverages. What more can I say? I am a fan. But it isn't good for my waistline to eat at Sweet Tomatoes too often.  Oh yeah, and when I was there last Sunday, right before 5pm, they brought fresh baked cookies to our table!"}
{"text":"Its a salad buffet....thats it! It's boring.  It's clean, good service, but its not exciting."}
{"text":"Cool! Sweet Tomatoes has improved significantly since I had it last (about a year ago). This was my 5th time eating here over the course of 4 years, and by far the best and most appealing experience yet.  If you're looking for a salad bar along the lines of Ruby Tuesday's - here you go. Cold, fresh, and a very impressive selection. The few times I looked down and wondered, \"Are those carrots or squash? Zucchini or cucumbers?\" there would be a sign on the sneeze shield indicating what it was. There are some smart folks running this franchise!   Soups (included) were great. Especially the baked potato soup, the chicken & rice soup and the chili. And none were too salty - a great thing.  Glad I gave it another shot. A fun, healthy alternative to the smorgasbord of Asian / Mexican places that we usually end up at for lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Healthy, clean and great service! I Know you service yourself but every time; they clear the old plates quick and offer to fill our drinks. Every time I use a coupon I get another for 2 adults and 2 drinks for 16.99. Not a bad deal!!"}
{"text":"This place is great, they have just about anything you would want for a salad on the salad bar, the soups are different every week,  baked potatoes, focacia pizza, pasta, fruit and desserts. This place would get a five star rating if the parking wasn't so bad and it's a hit or miss on screaming kids,  Sometimes the place is so bad with all the little kids running around bumping into you and throwing food over booths but other than that the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's a nice clean restaurant with lots of healthy choices. My personal favorite is the fresh broccoli salad.  My \"only issue\" is that it's $31 for two people to eat salad, soup, bread and pasta.  Which is why I am giving it 3 stars and not 4. However, if you like to sample soups, I am a big fan of having a few bites of their various homemade flavors.  Their corn chowder, broccoli soup and chicken pot pie soup was excellent. Knock yourself out with a tasty soup buffet. :)"}
{"text":"even though its all you can eat, i usually only get one plate of salad and then just a bunch of soups and other stuff. its always clean, except when you got dirty kids playing on the floor and then touching silverwear and bowls, then put them back. i love the food here but sometimes feel a little grossed out and annoyed when parents dont keep an eye on their kids and let them run around like its a mcdonald's playground. all the servers are super nice. when i have an empty plate and get up to get more food and come back, bam! plate disappeared. i wouldnt use any of the condiment spoons for the ice cream or desserts bar. just watch what happens on a busy night with children running around..."}
{"text":"I always like putting eggs on my salad and they were out. No biggie. Waitress took awhile to come grab our dirty plates so they sat at our table for awhile. The veggie soup was ok. Felt like the food was a bit bland. And on top of that, they didn't have a variety of fruits for deserts, just pineapple. Don't think I'll be returning but the price wasn't bad."}
{"text":"It is really hard to eat a buffet when you don't eat meat.  Sweet Tomatoes makes it so much easier for those who want to indulge in a good buffet, and not feel bad after having it.  They have an abundance of choices to make your own salad or you can also have some of their pre-made salads.  I also love their baked potato.  I really need to learn how to make this.  They also have an extensive varieties of soups.  They have bread, pastries, soft serve ice cream, fruits, and pasta.  Also, after 4pm, they serve a special dessert just for dinner.  I for one enjoy everything they have.  If you do go there, be careful not to over indulge because that will defeat the whole purpose of \"eating healthy.\""}
{"text":"Its a massive, massive, two sided, every option having, never ending, flowing sea of SALAD BAR.  Overall, I think this is a great place.  The one thing I am not so sold on is the price of it(12 bucks a person, for salad,) however, they ease the pain with soups, desserts, pasta, and some baked goods.    The service was absolutely amazing.  The manager even came over after we told the cashier we were first timers.  He gave us some cookies and 10% coupons for our next visit.   I will definitely return just for the service alone.    The salad choices, as I mentioned, are plentiful and ever flowing.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The buffet is usually clean, and there is always hot bread.  I mean it's a salad place.  They are usually pretty good at identifying the gluten free items and they also have pretty decent soup selection and potato bar. Something about the ice cream here is also really really good. and the fresh baked cookies are also amazing. typical chain restaurant.  nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. It has always been pretty friendly staff mostly from bussers. Food is always fresh and tasting great. The price is perfect and the strawberry lemonade is better than anywhere else! Sometimes dessert could be better at dinner times."}
{"text":"I've come in here a number of times - it's a decent salad bar. They have salad options with the bar, and the soups are the best part. The freshly cooked pasta leave something to be desired.    I used to really like it, but I find it harder to keep coming back. The service gets poorer all the time. They used to come around with fresh cookies periodically, but that has completely stopped - they will sell you some. The cashiers and managers are the biggest challenge. I get coupons by email, and every time I go in they refuse to honor them - they add some requirement that doesn't exist on the coupon. Both times I involved a manager, they were smug and blew me off.    With no discounts, the price is pretty high. At $10 for a salad bar, I really would expect something more."}
{"text":"We used to dine at Sweet Tomatoes in Peoria AZ many years ago.  Then they made a transaction to Sweet Plantations which didn't make it.  Approximately 3-5 years later we thought we'd try it again in January 2017.  We walked in the door and the employees were speaking Spanish, we noticed that the variety of food on the line had been reduced (not like before).  The food quality and quantity was not acceptable and the bill was $32.47 for two.  We even saw a customer washing her hands in the soda machine."}
{"text":"Comfort food at its... well, not at its best, but not at its worst either.  The buffet is very hit or miss; you have to use your instincts to navigate the dangerous line of mediocre salad items and cringe-worthy side dishes to find the really good stuff. Whenever I come here, I stick with sampling a few different pasta salads and then gorging myself on the pizza bread.  This place also has macaroni and cheese, soup, salads, muffins, corn bread, etc. The food is all very \"homey\". It's good for a lunch date with a friend, although my buddy got sick from the soup here once. But he is a voracious eater.  All in all, a decent experience for me whenever I visit."}
{"text":"I'd rather drive to \"John's Incredible Pizza Co.\" by the Boulevard Mall for a buffet OR drive to \"Golden Corral\" on Charleston & Lamb for a buffet. You get better variety of food & better variety for dessert, than at Sweet Tomatoes.  The good: Variety of salad options & salad dressing. Able use coupons they send in the mail.  The bad: Got charged for a kids buffet (did not have kids in line) & used a 20% coupon. The charges were reversed. When they voided out the charges, they did charge us for 2 adults with 1 drink...but, they did not apply the 20% coupon, though. They weren't paying attention.  A word of advice: Make sure you look at your restaurant receipt very carefully."}
{"text":"I am fan of good salad bar with plenty of options!  As I was walking in I was greeted by friendly employee explaining to my mom and I how the process works. We proceeded down the salad lane to start with pre mixed salads then all the options of the salad toppings. I was pleasantly surprised by all the options and cold salad options - Tuna salad and seafood salad just to name a few.   There are also plenty of hot fresh soups, baked potatoes(russet or sweet) and baked breads.   Don't forget to get ice cream cone as you finish off your meal!"}
{"text":"first time ordering here a few days ago and I only spent $18 for me and my husband. You get a great amount of food. I was getting confused on how everything worked ordering Togo and the manager helped me the whole way through. Great customer service. their veggie pasta was delicious and their soup is amazing. Definitely will come back and actually sit down and eat."}
{"text":"All you can eat places need to be expensive or use cheap food.  Restaurants are a business.  Sweet Tomato is kind of in between.  It is the type of place you go when you don't feel like cooking dinner but don't want to comb your hair.  The salad bar is good and you can pile up a bunch of veggies and lettuce for healthy eating.  Then you can add some unhealthy carbs at the hot bar.  Once or twice a year is plenty."}
{"text":"I like Sweet Tomatoes and I love this location. The salad bar has fresh veggies. I like the salad of the month too. Yes the dressing is too much but I don't mind it. The salad toppings and dressings are too many to select from. The soups, baked sweet potatoes, bakery section, pastas and deserts are sooo good. The cookies they serve are moist and good too. On the whole I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this location. Their options and ingredients are way better than most other places in my opinion. There's plenty of seating and it looks like it's been recently renovated or updated slightly so it looks really nice. Overall, we were really impressed."}
{"text":"My wife and I just didn't care for it.  We are not huge buffet people.  Food was just ok at best."}
{"text":"Love their salads, always seem to be fresh, crunchy and so delicious! CLEAN restrooms. They are efficient and fast in cleaning up dishes etc..The cashiers are also very friendly and polite when greeting you. Personnel, cooks behind the food counter are also wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh food at a reasonable price. I think some of the other reviews overstate this restaurants healthy food options, but there is so much to choose from its hard to go wrong. I really enjoyed their soups and their gluten free coconut muffins. Salad fare was kind of typical but again lots of variety."}
{"text":"Compared to all the other buffets out there this place is probably my favorite.  They don't seem to skimp on the quality of their items like a lot of other places (Golden Corral or Souper Salad) I get cravings for the broccoli salad!  My only criticism is the hot pasta section.  The pasta is kind-of gross:  soggy with bad sauce.  Good thing for them I don't usually want mac and cheese with my soup or salad anyway.  Sweet Tomatoes is always clean with good service."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite place to get a nice salad and soup. It was horrible and tasted nasty. Never coming back here again. Plus I wanted there soft serve ice cream and wanted the swril well come to find out it was all lemon flavored ice cream."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a quick bite...the lovely thing about Sweet Tomatoes is that you can dine in, get cozy in a booth, but still get your food in a jiffy. Everything is fresh because it's constantly being replenished. The staff did a really good job at keeping the salad bar clean, as well as constantly picking up used plates on the tables.   Today was pasta night so they had three types plus the cheese tortellini soup which I enjoyed, and of course they have four in-house made drink options such as the Arnold Palmer, lemonade, strawberry lemonade, and unsweetened raspberry (not too sure if it is) tea. You have to save room for dessert because they have soft serve, toppings, and cobblers.  The food has always been pretty consistent but this time it seemed like the staff was friendlier and they made it a point to keep everything clean. Plus, I saw that they have an A rating posted up at the front. Don't forget to check in with Yelp! to get your discount or bring the coupon you get in the mail!"}
{"text":"Still one of the best salad bars around. I remember the Souplantation off Mission George in San Diego. The soups are good...different then I remember  and I miss the clam chowder being a standard, I know its available on Thursdays. Clean, friendly and you can always find a coupon online."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sweet Tomatoes. I have a closer location near my house, but since we were out shopping and were hungry, we decided to come here. It's a pretty clean place. I'm not a huge fan of the layout because parts of it are closed in and where you get your food, isn't very open so it gets crowded when there's lines to get food. But the food itself tasted great. Everything was fresh and hot and didn't taste like it's been sitting out for a long time, like it does a lot at some of the other locations. It did take awhile for stuff to come out when it was empty and I didn't like that very much, but it just gave my stomach more time to digest everything and it gave my boyfriend and I a chance to just have a conversation so it wasn't all bad. As long as you have the time to wait, if you go during a busy time, than I thinks it's worth the trip. Make sure to sign up for their emails. They send out emails all the time with coupons to save you a few dollars per meal. It adds up if you go often or go with a big family."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes. It's my go to place for great soups and salads. They have different themes every few weeks so they always have new things to try alongside the usual stuff. They have a lot to choose from, from toppings for your salad, to toppings for your baked potato. They always have a good variety of soups to choose from. They have different pastas every month, except for their mac n cheese which is delicious with some bacon on it. Their fresh strawberry lemonade is also delicious. I would give 5 stars, but their prices keep going up, so now I only go when I have a coupon and don't go as often anymore."}
{"text":"Always a good selection of items. Always fresh and always kept stock, I literally never seen empty containers. Staff is always friendly. This is a family restaurant so please don't complaint about loud kids. Also take advantage of their email coupons, why pay fully price when they give you the option not to. Some of my favorite items are the wonton asian salad, their chicken noodle soup(something about their thick noodles is what i like about it), their pepperoni focaccia to name a few."}
{"text":"The variety of food wasn't the best... but you still go in hungry and leave stuffed!  Towards the end of our meal we were offered freshly baked chocolate chip cookies :).  I'm a salad fan so I'm sure I'll be mozying back here at some point."}
{"text":"As many times as I've made the trip to Sweet Tomatoes I always leave there with the same thing to say about it.. so I thought I'd share those thoughts with everyone for a change! (exciting, right?)   Grab your lunch room tray, a plastic plate and lets get the party started! Your first (usually) 3 options are mushy pre-dressed \"theme\" salads, great for the folks lacking imagination in putting together their own salad from scratch. Then on to the salad troff's..   Three types of lettuce to choose from, just about every veggie you can think of, along with a decent spread of additional salad toppings and dressings to choose from; the sky is the limit (or the sneeze guard for that matter) when it comes to piling on a massive salad creation.   Next you'll grab your lunch room plastic cup, pay and proceed to the drink station. Depending on the day of the week, you may get to choose your own seat (yey!) or a host/ess will seat you.   My experience last night consisted of more children than adults (it felt like it at least) and the smell of dirty feet and a mild side of locker room over powered the aroma of the soups and hot foods out on display.   As much as I enjoy a good salad and a hearty (or several) bowls of soup along with mac and cheese and the frozen yogurt bar, I hardly feel the experience is worth the $13 I paid to dine there. The concept is great but it's hard to enjoy yourself when you're tripping over toddlers, waiting on zitty teenagers to hand pick each individual mac and cheese noodle.. and getting past the locker room smell was just a bit much for me last night.   All in all, if you have a coupon, if it's not a weekend night, fine, go for it, but other than that, save yourself the special trip unless you absolutely MUST have some of their amazing (and only redeeming part of this venue) chicken noodle soup. :)   Oh, yeah! The service is always great, that's another saving grace."}
{"text":"Salad was good so many options soup was good also corn claim cowder ! Dis was my first time here I most def.. will be coming back"}
{"text":"Quick lunch option and for a great price .... $8.99 for the buffet (plus $2.49 for premium ingredients), which consists of a huge salad bar, 4-5 soups, three pasta dishes, dessert and frozen yogurt at the end.  Definitely worth the price and a great option for lunch.  Everything is always fresh and readily available"}
{"text":"Large selection salad bar and really good fresh soups. Decent value for the price and the frozen dessert is a nice end to a nice meal. If you are not a big meat eater you certainly should try it."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go for a change of pace meal.  All you can eat salad is a good idea, but you can only eat so much of it and then need some real food.  There are a few choices for different soups,  a couple of different style focaccia style breads, a couple pasta choices, baked potatoes, and ice cream.  They make pizza style breads that are not bad but are not great.  The pastas are usually overcooked and either drowning in sauce or not enough on them.  The soups are not homemade, but are the frozen concentrate kind that you add water to.  The salad bar has many choices, and is usually well kept and clean.    For the price of 2 people to eat this place definitely is not a bad choice if you want to try a different concept and you will not leave hungry.  I have always had an issue with the staff here.  Some of them are extremely friendly, but others, especially those behind the counter with the pasta and breads, seem rude.  The sit around speaking spanish gibberish and like they are talking about the customers.  I have even seen them talk closely and point out at people.  It's the way that they do it that makes it a bit uncomfortable..  Of course I may be just reading the whole situation wrong.    My in-laws love this place so when they are in town we go here for them or if we have business at the mall we will stop in here."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Salad bar and soup, if that's what you want, you will be golden, if you expect a buffet like one on the strip then go there and spend the money. I wasn't feeling well so I wanted something to settle my stomach, this was perfect, had some salad, some tasty soup, and bread, what more could I have wanted."}
{"text":"I love this place,  it is sometimes a hit or miss but mostly a hit.  My salads are always great and why I really go is for the soups and the cornbread with whipped honey butter!! The chicken noodle is amazing and today I had the posole,  so flavorful I had 3cups!! The soups vary so you just have to check online before you go what's on the menu.  Favorite soups,  chicken and wild rice,  the broccoli cheese,  sausage and red bean is amazing.  I don't mess with desserts much but when they make the cobbler it's pretty good,  check online got coupons you can always find them!!"}
{"text":"FRESH delicious salad bar with a reasonable price tag. I like it. Hunnie Bunnie likes it. I can eat A LOT and not feel SUPER weighed down by greasy food or junk. WIN!"}
{"text":"I eat here about 2-3 times per week.  With the coupons I receive via email, lunch is $6.99 + tax, and it's all-you-can-eat.  The salad is very fresh (95% of the time), and the soups are to die for!  The focaccia is excellent, and the selection of salad toppings is huge!  I like to come here after a hard gym workout to pig out on veggies and whatever yummy soups they have - I wish they would bring back the Albondigas soup!  It's incredible!  5 stars for Sweet Tomatoes, Flamingo and Ft. Apache!  EDIT - 07/21/17: since going Vegan a few months ago, i continue to frequent Sweet Tomatoes ... they have at least one Vegan soup available every day (Vegan items ate marked as such) and i have to say that Sweet Tomatoes is still my go-to for post-workout sustenance..."}
{"text":"Always a great spot. Fresh food, friendly staff. Not fancy but a solid restaurant. They do a great job keeping the product fresh and the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Perfect for the vegetarian diet! It's always hard to find great places to eat that have a decent selection for the vegetarian diet. This place tops the cake! Huge salad bar, several soups, even pastas and other dishes to choose from. I never leave feeling hungry and always feel like I had a nice variety of foods to choose from. One suggestion would be to offer a few more sugar-free dessert items and since the name of your place is Sweet Tomatoes, it would be nice if you always had your tomato soup stocked in the soup bar. This is, however, one of my most favorite places to dine out. And, it's all you can eat, so if you leave hungry, that's no one's fault but your own."}
{"text":"The staff doesn't get enough credit for how much ass they bust cleaning, cooking and keeping up with the amount of traffic that comes in and out of this place. Great variety, tons of great food, and moderately priced."}
{"text":"Great food!!! A lot of variety and choices. The service is always great! They have specials during different seasons and throughout the month. Clean. Always a great place for food, and with the buffet how can you go wrong! Eat until your full, and you'll feel happy after this amazing meal!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always fast and fresh! Such a good spot for fresh salads and soups!  The salad bar has many toppings to choose from and then they have seasonal salad mixes, a Caesar salad mix and others.  The broccoli cheddar soup, clam chowder, potato soup and dumplings soups are yummy.  They even have some soft serve ice cream and toppings.  Love their lemonade and teas!  Oh and the price is reasonable! Well worth it"}
{"text":"Great variety of salad items, soups, pasta, and desert.  Having recently gone vegetarian, this is a good place for me.  However, the soup selection is limited for a vegetarian.m  Still, I get a lot a food that I can eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"So sad to hear that this location will be closing at the end of November. Have eaten here for years and it has been a great place to take my elderly parents. Anybody have any suggestions on a dependable weekday buffet restaurant in the central Phoenix area?"}
{"text":"I like to think I come here under the guise of being healthy but who am I kidding? LOL. I love this salad bar since they have everything I need for my salad. Since I'm making it, I can choose all my favorite toppings and drench my salad with ranch dressing. I love their creamy pasta salad and their premade broccoli nut salad they have in the salad bar. I don't know the names of both but I always get both.  They have a variety of soups which I like to sample at least two or three of them. They have pizza, bread, mac-n-cheese, & baked potato. It's your standard buffet food. Also, like their strawberry lemonade.  To finish off my \"healthy\" meals, I end my meal with soft serve ice cream in their kid size cones."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is one of our family favorites! This couldn't be a better choice for vegans and non vegans a like. They have a huge salad bar with so many different veggies, beans,nuts, and pre-made cold salad dishes to choose from. They also have a lot of heavy fat laden dressings,cheese and a few pre-made salads that will definitely deep six your efforts to not eat loads of extra calories and fat. Just grab the various balsamic or other vinegars to top off your salad instead. You can also find fresh lemon slices to squeeze over your salad by the drink counter.  They also have a hot bar with a variety of soups, pasta and potatoes .   They generally have at least 2 vegan soup choices to choose from.  You can go back for plate refills as much as you like but for me I just start with 2 plates when I make my way through the salad bar so that I don't have to get back in line. I always finish my meal by bypassing the frozen yogurt machine and filling up a plate with some delicious cut fruit instead.I also like that when you sign up for Sweet tomatoes or Soup plantation club you will receive weekly discount coupons on what already was a great deal even before the extra discount. Kids under 2 also eat free. Incidentally Sweet Tomatoes is a great place to expose your kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies that they may not other wise be exposed to on a consistent basis. When my girls were very little I made sure that they always picked a few new veggies to try. I also like that they have locations in other states so that when we travel we can often find a quick veg friendly place to stop."}
{"text":"Come here to fill yourself up with veggies, simple pastas, soups and some soft serve ice cream.  Each location is the same and you can have your food exactly the way you want!"}
{"text":"We used to go here more frequently but lately it's just not as good and not worth the money unless you have coupons. We gave it another shot tonight and I left feeling it will be a while before we try again.  Let's start off with the salad bar. The variety of toppings to put on your salad is excellent but the ready made Caesar salad is bland. I love Caesar but what they serve has no flavor at all.  The corn bread is good and so are some of the focaccia's. They also have a baked potato bar with tiny regular and sweet potatoes that you can top with cheese and bacon bits.  The selection of soups is good but they are slow to replace them. Like everyone else, I like the chicken noodle with the thick noodles and big chunks of chicken. I guess everyone else likes it too because it seems I am always swirling the ladle through a pot of broth and one or two straggling noodles.  Lastly the desserts. First of all, an apple is not a dessert. Someone needs to stop putting them out there trying to convince us they are. The soft serve ice cream is decent and they have sprinkles. They also usually have a hot dessert item. Tonight it was a apple blueberry crumble. I waited 20 minutes for them to replace the empty tray on the table. With all the staff milling about I just don't get why it takes them so long to replace empty trays of food.  Lastly, the floor service is pretty good. They do a good job of coming by and picking up your empty plates and bowls to make room for a second trip."}
{"text":"I'm a Salad Bar junkie. I love the fresh, colorful, flavorfun choices (no, that's not a typo) that I can make while there. My baby loves the finger size munchies and there is something for everyone there. Sweet Tomatoes isn't necessarily my favorite though because they charge nearly $10 per person for SALAD. There's just something fundamentally wrong with that.  So I went to this particular location when I had to head over to Ikea recently. It's quite a drive from my house so I won't be hitting this spot up again anytime soon but that's not to say it wasn't worth the visit. The reason this was just A-OK was because the Lemon Orzo soup tasted like Lemon Dishsoap Soup. I did mention it on their Twitter page after they commented on my Yelp check-in and they said they would look into it...but I never heard from them again. The other reason this was just A-OK was that I would have told someone about the off-taste of the soup had anyone bothered to come by and say hello! At the Arrowhead location, they are on you like white on rice, insisting on taking your tray before your butt has a chance to get comfy in its seat but this place? Not once did anybody even stop by my table to do anything much less say hello. They stood around the drink area and chatted. They stood up by the macaroni and cheese and chatted. They stood by the bussing station and chatted....but no chatting with any customers. Not good.  I'll be back to Sweet Tomatoes, but because this one is way out of my way, I'll probably pass on it next time I'm out in Awahtukee."}
{"text":"The only downfall to Sweet Tomatoes in general is the price. It shouldn't cost me more than $20 for 2 plus drinks. At Sweet Tomatoes, it's at least $25. That's kind of annoying because....IT'S JUST SALAD! But--that having been said, the salad is fresh, the soups are flavorful, and the other hot food items are plentiful. The staff is friendly and polite. It's always a good visit but the sticker shock can be a little surprising because IT'S JUST A SALAD BAR."}
{"text":"It was a typical sweltering day in Las Vegas, so my wife and I thought that we would eat light, so we headed to sweet tomatoes. Well it was very light dining, too light. The salad bar was ok, nothing that was outstanding.  The soups were not exceptional, and not very hot. The pasta at the \" hot bar\" we're cold. It was just ok at best. For $12.50 at a Buffett, you can do much better in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Soups and salads, can't go wrong with that! It's just like soup plantation if you have ever been there.  Lots of choices of different veggies and you make your own salads.  Everything was fresh and organized.   The soup choices were weird, but I stick with the French onion.  It was okay.  I've had authentic French onion soup from a French restaurant many times, and nothing can beat those, but Sweet Tomatoes French onion was decent but I wouldn't say that it was delicious"}
{"text":"I loved this place sooooooooo much!  I did kind of want some kind of meat, but after I saw how much this place had to offer, I was ON FULL."}
{"text":"The ranch dressing is so watered down its quite ridiculous. Got blue cheese on my second trip and it's just as runny.   Had the chicken pot pie \"stew\" and it was super watered down as well. Tastes good though. My guess is the general manager of this location is adding water to everything to try and stretch his food cost. Was kinda bummed that they don't have clam chowder.   The blueberry muffins and buttermilk cornbread were amazing (pretty hard to water those down).   This was my first visit to this location and while it definitely did not live up to my expectation, it wasn't horrible. Next time I'll drive the extra miles to the warm springs and Stephanie location. Much better quality there, plus they have clam chowder."}
{"text":"I've definitely have had better!  There was a big salad and salad topping selection, but that was about it. No pizza, some sticky pastas, a really runny ice cream machine, watered down tasting teas.  It's a nice restaurant, typical decor, lots of windows.   Will we return?? Nah."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Went here tonight. A good place to have a salad, since it is a buffet style make your own salad kind of place. Along with the relatively good quality soups, and the baked potatoes among other things, this place is a very family restaurant style kind of place. Would recommend coming for relatively good food at a good price. Good money for the food that you get."}
{"text":"Alicia is a huge asset to this location. You can tell are genuinely cares about her customers. She offers to go above and beyond to make sure they're not only satisfied but more than satisfied.   In the last few months we've noticed a difference at this location. People are friendly and more helpful.   As always - the food is fresh and tasty. Thank goodness lemon month (April) is only once a year or I might gain 20 lbs on the delicious lemon salad, caper pasta and lemon muffins. Dangerously yummy."}
{"text":"Never had a bad visit. Food is always fresh. Only complaint is its a little pricey for a salad buffet especially when you can go to station casino and eat all the salad you want for cheaper and just as good. Wish they would price it better for what you are getting. Other wise its an awesome place to eat."}
{"text":"I like this place, the salads are good - and the accessories to put on the salads are very fresh and flavorful.   The only downside is that the staff working up front aren't that friendly, especially the younger ones. And the cups and plates are not thoroughly cleaned.   Other than that, the food is good, the interior is big and the lighting is comfortable. I appreciate that they have sugar-free chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight since I'm new to the area and we always pass by- plus it's down the street from me. I didn't know this was a vegeterian establishment- there is NO MEAT (no meat entrees). It's an oversized salad bar with maybe 5 different soups, some breads (foccacia with different cheeses), a baked potato bar, a small dessert bar, some muffins, and drink station. I LOVE that they have a blueberry iced tea *lighlty* sweetened with Stevia (though it tasted unsweetened to me, it was still very yummy). I don't drink soda or juices so this was a warm welcome compared to bland unsweetened black iced teas. The salad bar was pretty decent. I was of course, bummed about missing meat but...i did get full. They do have bacon bits and chicken noodle soup. This is a great place for lunch and you won't leave filling guilty. Although,  I'm leaving guilty over their amazing coconut muffins (gluten free) bc I'm on a Ketogenic diet and i ate 2 of those things and i want some more! I'm glad there is a restaurant that caters to the Vegetarians. Overall, pretty good experience except for the initial shock of there being no meat lol"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant with several locations throughout the Phoenix area. As with the other restaurants this location was similar and had the same quality as all of the other locations.  The salad bar in the restaurant very clean well-maintained and all the products are very fresh and made daily. Sweet tomatoes you can be sure to getting what you want and since it is a buffet style dining experience you don't go home hungry.  One of the areas that I've extremely like this restaurant is the homemade soups and especially the chicken noodle. This chicken noodle has large pieces of white chicken meat and home made excellent noodles. There's a variety of selections from pasta red's pizza and of course numerous types of salads and sides. If you're looking for a healthy place to have a very good meal Sweet tomatoes the place to go."}
{"text":"I am normally not one for buffets, but Sweet Tomatoes came highly recommended by some family members for a healthy place to go have some soup and salad quickly.  We stopped in one night and really liked it.  The homemade soup selection was plentiful and made it hard to decide which one to try.  The salad bar was huge, fresh and a really nice selection of veggies.  There were many options of pizza, pasta, breads and desserts too.  You certainly shouldn't leave this place hungry!"}
{"text":"Finally a place that my almost 2 year old will sit at and stay quiet for a solid 30 minutes!! He loves this place and therefore we love it too! He eats for free and we use coupons that are so easy to find online. I love the Caesar salad, chicken soup and the blueberry muffins. They keep the restaurant clean and and are constantly baking fresh good to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"My wife introduce me to this place and this has been our spot for lunch once a week. The salad and soup are pretty good."}
{"text":"Y'all totally rocked today!!! It was crazy busy but it was really controlled!! The March menu was really awesome! Ginger broth, coconut muffins and that ginger peach tea was the best!!! Thanks to the whole staff for keeping everything up for lunch today!!! You guys are the best!!! See ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"I have a thing with vegetables, I love them so much! I go crazy here walking down the salad bar line because I love everything. I usually get too much and wind up hurting, but everything is so fresh and tasty it's hard not to. The soup selection is always top notch as well. Its hard to pass up all the great flavors! I took my non-veggie loving boyfriend here and he liked the pizza bread and the mac and cheese! Whatever your preference,  just remember to wear loose fitting pants when you go!"}
{"text":"Went on a saturday dinner time, before father's day. Place was busy but not packed. Customer service was good.  What i liked about this place is that it seemed to be better maintained the Sweet Tomatoes that we've been to. The food are well served and well stocked. The dishes/utensils felt and seemed well washed.  We will be back for sure soon."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  I have not been to a Sweet Tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices, but I went to join a friend for lunch on Friday.  Their pricing is still high -- about $12 for lunch and a standard drink.    The salad selection was sparse.  A few green salad types and additives.  Dressings were thin and not very tasty.  Toppings were sparse -- no cold cuts of chicken, pepperoni, nor any bacon crumbles.  And even the soups were not very hearty or tasty.  I remember them being better some years ago.  I think I will stick with the salad bars at SouperSalad!, Golden Corral, or even Sizzler's.  Better salads and better prices."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  They are pricey -- more than Sizzler's and more than SouperSalad. But their menu items are much more extensive/numerous. But we were disappointed. The salads were nothing to talk about; the salad dressings were watery and flavorless. Being Asian Celebration month, they had a lot of Asian salads and soups, and two noodle dishes -- curry veggies with rice noodles, and noodles with tofu and chicken broth. But no depth of flavor to any of the Asian dishes --- I think the basic problem is that their Asian items had no meat in them, including no meat stock for the broth. So they were rather bland and tasteless. Oh yeah, their tuna noodle salad had so little tuna in it, we couldn't see it! Maybe the tuna just swam thru the salad before serving it."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the wide assortment of salad goodies available to make oneself a very custom made and healthy meal. The soups were very tasty. Desserts were good. It was a meal we enjoyed very much as we were craving greens, something healthy and something warm for our tummies (the soups). The restaurant was very clean, our used plates removed promptly and the service was attentive and very polite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends.  There always some kind of coupons online. You can redeem coupons by showing the cashier the coupon code on your phone. Extra savings help for sure."}
{"text":"I was satisfied with my meal here. We have a strong lacking of buffets in San Francisco, where I'm from, so I was appreciative of what this restaurant had to offer. Unlimited soup, baked potatoes, and soft-serve ice cream? Oh yeah, and salad right?"}
{"text":"Well priced for a \"healthier\" buffet, but a bland, non-organic salad bar and not enough VEGAN OPTIONS makes this place a bit lackluster. Please bring in more VEGAN items!!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch spot!  Where else can you get at least two days worth of vegetable servings and overall quality/quantity/selection/value for the same price as a fast food value meal (ugh!)?  If you join \"Club Veg\" you get a 2 for 1 coupon emailed to you at least once every two weeks.  So, for two buffets and two drinks, it's $14.00 including tax...this place rocks!  My favorites include:  Won Ton Chicken Salad - YUM! Broccolli Salad - Healthy! Homemade Chicken Noodle soup w/ green onions on top -  The BOMB! Low-fat bran/orange/cranberry muffins w/ butter - Delicious! Hot brownie w/ non-fat chocolate/vanilla swirl yogurt, carmel/chocoloate sauce - Heaven!  The service at this location is always great.  I meet my girlfriend at the Desert Ridge location and we love it because we typicaly sit and talk for hours after having lunch on end and they never bother us.  I just love buffets in general, but most seem somewhat unhealthy.  This place is just a great healthy alternative....I can't wait for the next coupon to arrive in my email!"}
{"text":"I like this place!  Others have complained that the food is bland, but I beg to differ.  The lunch special is a good (not great) deal for 8 bucks, and the salad toppings are bountiful.  No - you're not going to find extraordinary quality here, but for those days when you can't make up your mind between a few different places - its a good spot.  Go for the soups.  There will be six or seven of them, and I suggest you try at least two.  On their menu, they list over 100 different soups that make the rotation and they're creative.  While I've only been here once, the day I visited I found one vegan soup, and two other vegetarian offerings.  All were very good.  My buddy told me the mac n cheese was good, too.  My chocolate muffin was great, too, and the frozen yogurt was a nice surprise.  The foccacia was a bland disappointment, but overall - not bad for the price and exceptional when you just can't make up your mind as to what you want to eat - but ya gotta be in the mood for soup..."}
{"text":"Wow - I have to admit I was impressed!  When a coworker suggested a bunch of us go here for lunch, I was a little weary.  A buffet?  Ewwww....  But no!  It was delicious!  The salad bar was fresh, staff were actively replenishing everything, it was clean, and there were a lot of great choices.  I greatly appreciated the vegetarian and low fat/healthy labeling and options.    I can't believe I'm going to admit this, but I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Buffet serving tables and serving utensils had been slammed by a previous Sunday rush.  Food bins were mixed.  Food was all over the buffet and utensils.  My hands were filthy by the time I tried to serve up a plate off the buffet, from the dirty utensils.  Staff was working hard, but seemed oblivious to many empty food bins and allot of filth.  There was food all over the floor of the place, smeared in by stampeding customers. I completely lost my appetite.   I was looking for management to speak with, and they were nowhere to be found, until I snapped a couple of pictures of the disgusting food service.  Immediately, a manager appeared and I was told this was private property, and no photographs were allowed.  I spoke with the manager, who although he refunded my money, seem unapologetic and only offered up multiple excuses of how hard it was to keep up, when parents don't control their kids at the buffet....GROSS.......I submitted complaints to corporate, via the internet, last time I went here about a year ago, and never received any response whatsoever.  Management seems to know they don't keep the place up when it is busy, and they don't care.   If I ever return and the restaurant is that filthy, I will skip speaking with management, and contact the Maricopa County Department of Health Services."}
{"text":"My kids are used to going to a newer location. This one, although in Scottsdale, is old and outdated. Kids love the salad bar but today not so much. The few main pasta selections are flavorless and tasteless. I felt like I was at a dirty location with healthy food options but no taste. My husband thought it would be funny if we sat right next to each other on separate booths. Him with my son so me with my daughter and trying to talk to each other was terrible while avoiding the big dust layer on the wooden divider.  Ewww. Lunch with a side of dust.. No thanks. Also, my cup and dishes were so dirty and full of food residue?. Took a pic of my cup with broccoli bits all over. Yuckkk. I wanted out of there ASAP. So we did."}
{"text":"I love bringing new people here because they are like, \"Soup and salad? Uhh..\" but we all know, it's not just that. It's the most amazing salads put together by them or DIY salads.. they're all good since it's basically the same ingredients. The soups are always steaming hot and muffins, I go for the crunchiest ones. The only thing I don't like about this location is that clam chowder is only served on Fridays?? What's the deal with that? And also why can't the drink be included in the price? Kind of sucks but doesn't matter, I'm a water person. I could eat here everyday and not get tired of it probably. Once, I ate 6 blueberry muffins in a row :| No regrets either."}
{"text":"Love me some Sweet Tomatoes. This location is about 2 miles from my house which makes it super convenient for lunch. I joined Club Veg through the website so I never pay full price for my meal. They e-mail coupons right to my inbox so I can just print them and go.   This location is always clean and the staff is continuously wiping down the salad bar and cleaning & bussing tables. The food is fresh and they have tons of options to chose from. I try to start small but when I reach the end of the salad bar I always need a bigger plate cause mine is overflowing with fresh greens, ripe veggies and salad toppers.   If you have never been to a Sweet Tomatoes soup and salad buffet you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Sign up for club veg and use the coupons to save on every visit.   This is a great spot for vegetarians to bring non veg friends because their is something for everyone.  The food is pretty consistent and quite flavorful.  If you're going to eat at a buffet,  this is a great alternative.  Recommended for sure."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The mac and cheese is perfect for our daughter and the salads are delicious for adults. Its perfect for those nights when you didn't have time to make dinner.  The waiters always clean up after us so you dont have a big build up of plates all over the table. The cashiers are always nice and welcoming. I haven't had any issues with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomato has the best chicken noodle soup. My husband and I eat twice a month in Sweet Tomato when we lived in Glendale. After moving to Eastern valley, we found out one in Gilbert. This location food looked not so fresh and employees looked really unhappy here. No say Hi or No smile face."}
{"text":"1st experience,  ALL GOOD. Casual cafeteria style service. Good super fresh, lots of varieties is salads a and dressings. Many flavors of soups and types of pasta. Also ice cream. Everything tasted fine. GR8 place for KIDS."}
{"text":"Every once in a while after eating poorly, I need to have a salad the size of my head.  The prices are a little steep, but the email coupons take out a bit of the sting.  The food is fresh for the most part, the lettuce seemed to be a little wilted on our last visit though.  After my healthy eats I'm always sure to cancel it out with a warm brownie topped with frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"After looking online for a healthy option for dinner, my husband and i decided to try Sweet Tomatoes. They had great options at the salad bar and so many soups to choose from. I love that everything is made daily from scratch. The food was great, though the atmosphere left something to be desired. While it wasn't terrible, it was a little loud & crowded. Lots of kids running around. If the food weren't so darn good that might scare me from going back. But I'm already looking forward to going back & chowing down on more soup & salad. The biscuits were amazing too. I like that they have smaller plates & bowls to help promote portion control. I had plenty to eat w/out stuffing myself. All for a great price. The only thing I would change is to have a server fill drinks."}
{"text":"I have visited this location COUNTLESS times over the years so I'm surprised I hadn't reviewed it until now.   The food here is fresh, properly tempered, and the store is VERY clean...well except the bathroom. The bathroom is always a disaster. I'm not sure why. Even after the remodel, the women's bathroom always is sticky, dirty, and just makes me feel like I need to go shower afterwards. It's weird.   The staff is usually very nice and friendly but they get very frazzled when the place is busy...and this location is BIZ-EEE. When the snowbirds come and especially during Spring Training, this store is PACKED. As a local, I usually skip ST's lunch time mid-February through beginning of April because it's just too busy.   All in all though, this is a good location with consistently good food.  The only other aspect of this store that prevents it from getting 5 stars is that Sweet Tomatoes is ridiculously over priced. It's soup and salad for goodness sake. It shouldn't cost me $25 for 2 people to eat soup and salad with a drink. But that's just me. :)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is always a good meal. The variety they offer is guaranteed to fill you up before you leave. We arrived about an hour and a half before closing time and no line in front of us. Salad bar all to ourselves. We loaded the plates up with plenty of greens and toppings for the \"healthy options ;-)\" then grabbed a glass of the refreshing strawberry lemonade and water.  Note that on your birthday they send an email for a free meal so sign up!  After my healthy plate was devoured...ventured to the hot food line next and enjoyed a bowl of spaghetti and some macaroni and cheese. Grabbed a mouth watering cornbread and some of the honey whipped butter to smother it. The focaccia bread was good as well as the thin slices of pizza. To be a little sophisticated I grabbed some sour dough bread and ripped it up, then went to the salad bar and got a plate of olive oil and vinegar with cracked pepper, mmmm gotta love dipping bread in that mixture. One of the seasonal favorites was a coconut muffin, oh my so good had to end the meal with another. I tried some chicken noodle soup and then found two more cornbread on my plate somehow. Good food still fresh even before they close."}
{"text":"Good value here. Fresh salads and soups. For under 10 bucks it's a good concept and having an option for a healthy lunch in the neighborhood is always a plus."}
{"text":"The food was bland and the temperature of the baked potato was cold. I'm certainly never planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Thank you for getting friendlier employees who actually want to do a good job.  Had a nice family meal and enjoyed everything much more."}
{"text":"I like this place.  They have great blue cheese dressing and super fresh veggies.  I don't care too much for any of the pastas but some of the soups are good.  The baked potatoes are good too.   They usually come around with free cookies too.  My kids love this place, I simply like it.  And yep I'll be back when the mood strikes again. :-)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for about ten years, so that in itself is quite an endorsement :-).  The salad bar is always fresh and well maintained with a very nice variety of salad, toppings, pasta and dressing.  An every changing variety of several soups along with hot pasta and baked items really top off the selection perfectly.  But, I must confess, my favorite is the AYCE ice cream cones!  Their excellent selection of drinks is also noteworthy.  Whenever my wife and I feel like a salad this is always our go-to place."}
{"text":"Wow I was impressed with this sweet tomatoes location. I've only been to a sweet tomatoes in Florida and that's where I cane to love the combo of soup and salad. They have such a good selection for all diets they have vegan soups and veggie and regular like chicken noodle soup and chilies. I enjoyed the tomato soup and the fiery spicy vegan quinoa chili. Also the minestrone soup ahhhhh I had seconds for sure! I highly recommend this place for lunch if you go around 5:30 to 6:30 you will get there during prime dinner rush I believe. I like going around 2 or 3pm it's slow and quiet.they also have lots of dessert options and pastas! Please go here it's a must"}
{"text":"The salad bar is big and it has a lot of choices, but nothing on it really jumped out at me. There were some cold salad options (like potato and quinoa), but none of them had a lot of flavor. There's also a soup bar, but again it's very underwhelming on flavors. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years! I love this healthy alternative to other quick-meal restaurants. The salad is always fresh and there's a good variety of soups; something for everyone. If you join their email list, you will get great monthly coupons!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sweet tomatoes and Souplantation s. This is the worst of all. Actually never been to a bad one till now. No fresh fruit station no fruit salad . The pasta section consists of macaroni and cheese . Won't be back"}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong here. The food is always fresh and the staff are obnoxiously friendly. It helps that they always have a lot of coupons which is cool because fresh/healthy food is normally way over priced. Beverages here are a little ridiculous price wise, but you can always just drink water. :)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a buffet salad and soup bar much like Fresh Choice or Souplantation.  The greens are crisp and fresh.  There is a good variety of salad items and at least five soups and chilis, plus three pastas.  I am very fond of their Cream of Mushroom soup.  Not too thick and full of mushrooms.  Unfortunately it is only sporadically available.  My basic reservations with this restaurant is consistency.  Sometimes the soups are universally too sweet.  Sometimes they are all too bland.  The same is true of the pasta.  Sometimes they are a bit short of staff and the tables haven't been cleared in a while.  It is a good solid salad bar, but it is not great."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both lived in Southern California and truly enjoyed eating at Souplantation locations in Encinitas, San Diego and Oceanside.  We recently, just in the past month, realized that Sweet Tomatoes was part of the chain of restaurants.  We were thrilled, to say the least.   In the last month we have eaten lunch at the West Bell Road restaurant and just enjoyed the experience so much!  Food was very fresh and we top our meal off with the adorable tiny soft-serve ice cream cones.  YUMMY.   Now for a small down-side at this location -- it's the entrance and the exit doors.  SO STRANGE!   When the interior was designed they did not do a very good job of placing the doors.  Granted it is an odd parking situation, so maybe it was the best they could do, but it feels ever so odd.  Can I live with it?  Oh my yes.  To have a great salad bar filled with so many choices that also includes Pizza, baked potatoes, a pasta bar, fresh baked breads and soup, oh, too good to let a little thing like how to get in and out keep me away.   The lunch is truly the best value, in my opinion and if you sign-up for their email list, you receive discount coupons that save you even more money.    So very pleased we found this Sweet Tomatoes location and will now look for others in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I would be in serious trouble if we had locations back home! The salad bar was incredible (although the herb potatoes had a strange taste) and I was surprised at all the other options on the other food lines. None of the soups jumped out to me as looking great, but one member of our party liked the chili. The lava cake topped with soft serve was pretty incredible!! This is a four instead of five star simply because it took quite a while to replenish items on the food lines (corn bread and lava cake) after they had been emptied. Still eager to eat here again in the future!"}
{"text":"Fantastic soup and salad. The wife and I have seen it for awhile so tonight we tried it.  Great place , its buffet style so food galore.  Salad bar and soup bar great.  We highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Food is nice and the staff is attentive and tries to keep things clean and filled up. My issue with the place is that many people let their kids run wild and serve themselves causing messes everywhere. I have to be in the mood to deal with the \"kid factor\" and be ready to be bumped into, have food dropped throughout the place, and deal with the noise. I enjoy kids tremendously but don't appreciate parents who don't watch their children causing others to be impacted. The food here is quite good through for a chain.  They use fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and liked it a lot. The staff was nice and they seemed to pump out fresh food pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This was my worst lunch in a long time.  No taste.  Not much there.  Soup was bland.  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Huge selection. I loved the soup bar. If you want to eat healthy but don't know where to go, check this place out!"}
{"text":"It's a buffet that is all about quantity over quality. Food is mediocre at best and you have to dodge the obese and mannerless at every step. I ended up here because my family just defaulted here amongst many better decisions and then we all sat wondering why in the world we came here. It's just okay, my kid liked the free ice cream."}
{"text":"We went to here in December and we liked it a lot. The soups are really good and had a great salad selection. However today was a different story. We walked in and I had to go through about eight plates until we found one that did not have all the food on it. Every time we went for another plate, we had the same story. When they gave us our glasses, I grabbed the glass and it had stuff on the outside that I felt was real gritty and grimy the moment I touched it.  Later I saw them talking with the staff and showing tons of dirty glasses.   At one point I went through six soup bowls until I found one without old food in it. The soups were mediocre too bad. French onion was OK but lukewarm and would not melt the cheese.  All the other soups were subpar to not good at all, when they were really good the first time we went. After really looking forward to coming back a second time we will definitely not be back a third time."}
{"text":"Hello everybody!  I will struggle through this review because I want to love Sweet Tomatoes, and at one time I did. In fact I would have given it five stars no question, but then we turned vegan.   I like everything about this place, especially the rotation of the menu, and I believe thier concept is a great one. It is always clean and fairly well organized even though it is very hectic during lunch. The food is very good, not uber great, but higher quality, and delicious.   Only one small problem. If you are vegan it is not worth your time to eat here unless you only want a boring salad. I want to get some kind of specialty salad, soup, and pasta that is vegan, unfortunately I cannot. Except every once in a blue moon, and im not sure when that is.   They do a terrible job of labeling any item that is made in house as to its content. I only ask that things are labeled as vegan and not vegetarian. How hard is this.   I believe that it is very sad that vegans have a hard time eating more than 20 percent of the menu here.   Whole Foods is a far better choice for this meal choice.  Sorry Sweet Tomatoes.  Late Gordo"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be a lot better...the food was ok but personally it wasn't appeasing to me. I didn't like the presentation of it and a lot of it was bland. This place might be fine for a quick dinner with the kids. Aside from that the service was great and the people are friendly. It's clean and I always appreciate a business who takes pride in the cleanliness of their establishment."}
{"text":"Right by my corporate office makes it a convenient choice. Food is fine and service is good. Never lost a game of credit card roulette almost bumped it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love salad bars, but after having so much horrible luck at Souper Salad I was reticent to try Sweet Tomatoes.  I really shouldn't have been.  Where Souper Salad's greens were wilty and colorless, Sweet Tomatoes' were bright and perky and everything was delicious and fresh.  They make different specialty salads depending on what's in season and they're all delicious. Everything was clean, full and well maintained and the dining room was bright.  A good place for a really good salad."}
{"text":"Pretty good soup & salad buffet,  good for kids,  clean facilities,  fresh foods,  prices are sort of high but there are usually coupons available.  Cell phone coverage is horrendous at this location,  so if you need to make a call /text,  you better do it before you get here. Four stars."}
{"text":"I like it here. The salad bar is always stocked well and looks fresh. The focaccia bread and baked potatoes can be a little bit of a wait but taste good."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I'm visiting from So.Cal. where this chain is known as Souplantation and is known for fresh soups and salad.  Being that it's a little chilly here in the Phoenix area I thought a hot bowl of soup would be just the ticket.  The restaurant was clean and looked freshly remodled (or maybe it hasn't been open that long).  The staff I dealt with were very friendly.  The food I had was good, the only thing which disapointed me was there was no Clam Chowder soup.  In So.Cal. Clam Chowder is offered every night but I guess not here.  They did have Tortolini which we don't typically have back home so that was a nice surprise.  I'll stop-in again the next time I'm in-town!"}
{"text":"Selections were hit or miss.  Salads very good , tons of choices and I liked all I tried. The soups were another story.  Most were overpowered with spices to the point they were inedible .  The only good one we tried out of the 4 was the tomato bisque .   The desserts were meh...except for the soft serve ice cream which I paired with a mini brownie. Yum.  I didn't try the molten chocolate dessert, but saw lots of other people going for it. Hubbie liked it."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! If you are ever in the mood for a healthy dosage of vegetables....this is the place!! The salad bar is pretty generous and you just fee l so good after all those vegetables!!....OH but wait there is also the soup area and lets not forget the desert bar!!! who doesnt like a good soft-cone!!???? The Desert Ridge location is pretty new and very clean. The employees do such a good job replenishing the buffet and keeping things looking fresh!"}
{"text":"I always love these places when I come across them, but this visit gets knocked down one star because the fruit bar was not up to the usual standards."}
{"text":"Salad, soups, dessert always good and fresh. Place is very clean and friendly staff. Price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this location! Super clean and staff is really on top of it. I love how many salad options you have along with soup, pizza, and breads. Also, if you're military don't forget to ask for your military discount! This location is always busy but they always seem to get you seated in a timely fashion!"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes and have only been to the Arizona locations until now....this location was not the cleanest. The salad dressings were disgusting and mixed with others salad dressings that had fell in it by clumsy people. Some of the vegetables had the same thing occurring with other food particles mixed in. When I went to the soup station someone must of changed their mind and left their bowl there half full with soup....when I went back 10 minutes later the bowl was still sitting there. No one was bussing tables apparently because we sat with a couple of empty plates with no room for anything."}
{"text":"No protein on the salad bar at all except cheese (so no eggs, ham, bacon.) Wilted icky romaine. Soggy focaccia. Good pastas - especially the lime cilantro. Real brewed iced tea. Meh - not really worth the money."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes!  This location was extremely busy when we were there.  So busy we had to wait a couple of minutes for a table.  The buffets were well stocked and delicious."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes location is awesome!  I love Sweet Tomatoes and this location is very clean with good service and well stocked buffets."}
{"text":"Ah, where to begin? I come here at least three times a month, if not more. I usually come with family or friends sometime between lunch and dinner. It's always crowded, but I don't mind because the food is great! Sweet Tomatoes may be known as a salad bar, but it's definitely a place that has something for everyone, even if you're not really into that whole vegetable thing.  Sweet Tomatoes is completely buffet style. You grab a plate when you enter, choose your greens (or not), throw some toppings on it, dress it up, and pay at the register! But please, do yourself a favor and do not pass up the Tuna Tarragon pasta! I'm not even a fan of tuna, but this housemade pasta is one of my favorites! It's creamy and so flavorful!   Besides the AYCE salad bar, Sweet Tomatoes offers other options, many of which are also gluten-free and/or vegetarian. There really is something for everyone! They have a variety of soups that are always changing, depending on what they are currently featuring or what is in season. Lucky for me, the Deep Kettle House Chili and Big Chunk Chicken Noodle Soup remain a staple all year long. A favorite amongst everyone is the bakery portion of the buffet. The Focaccia breads and muffins are baked fresh daily. All are delicious! What carbs aren't though? One of my favorites is definitely the Buttermilk Corn Bread! There are real pieces of corn in the bread which is a nice touch. I suggest the Honey Whip spread for any bread or muffin. Please do not forget the Honey Whip! Do I need to say it louder for the people in the back? You will regret it. If you have room leftover by the time you're done devouring your customized salad, there is a soft-serve yogurt machine with miniature cones and toppings! Yes, there is hot fudge. As far as beverages go, they offer the usual Coca Cola products, milk, hot coffee, and oh my gosh, everyone needs to try the Strawberry Lemonade! The best strawberry lemonade I've ever tasted! The Arnold Palmer is quite refreshing as well.  Sweet Tomatoes has a rewards program called Club Veg. If you frequent this restaurant, I suggest you sign up because they constantly send out coupons with good deals and keep you informed of what the current menu is featuring! Also, a 15% off check-in special is offered for lunch and dinner... Winning!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. The staff is always friendly and the salad options are outstanding! I appreciate this restaurant because I do not have time to prepare so many ingredients in a salad. The price is reasonable and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: It's like Cici's pizza, but emphasizes the salad bar instead of the pizza aspect.  My fiance and I went here on recommendations from Yelp. Seeing both high and low ratings, we figured we had to see for ourselves.  You walk in and immediately have the full salad bar option. The dressings could have been labeled better (mismatched labels), but after pointing it out to a clerk it was quickly fixed. The hot line had a few tasty breads, including a dessert option and BBQ pizza option. The drinks really impressed me. They had the normal Coke products, but also a few coffee types, tea, two lemonades, a virgin hibiscus sangria, and strawberry drink.   As for their soups, there were 7 options when we ate. I tried the Claw Chowder. Not the best I've ever had, but solid recipe. Supposedly you can suggest new soups online and they'll be in the store within a few days.  Overall, great for a varied lunch buffet, especially at a terrific price ($11 at time of writing), but not the fancy restaurant you'd go to for an anniversary"}
{"text":"Clean, fresh, plenty of options! Love this location. Staff is super friendly. Kid's meals are only $3.99. Great deal."}
{"text":"Came here the other night, food was good, service was good, didn't get a drink so can't say much about how they taste but would recommend this place for a quick bite and a short wait."}
{"text":"If you like eating salad in a large warehouse, this is the place for you.   I am not big on their prepared salads but I do like to construct my own big salad (a la Elaine Benes) with their nicely washed and chopped vegetables that are way fresher than the ones that are in my crisper drawer at home.   I haven't had their soup in years since I always found them super salty with watered down flavor, and their pasta which is about a half-life beyond al dente, but I enjoy their baked potatoes, cornbread and soft-serve frozen yogurt.   It isn't fine dining but it is elevated fast food and can be a healthier option if you moderate the dressings and all the carbs they offer."}
{"text":"I like a big salad, ala Elaine Benes, and a lunch place that I can dine relatively quickly at so Sweet Tomatoes really fits the bill.   Their salad bar has a nice selection of prepared salads and all of the fixings to make yourself a macdaddy salad. They keep the salad bar clean and the food bins full so I have absolutely no complaints there.  The soups, breads and desserts for the most part are eminently forgettable.  The only things that I have found above average have been their corn muffins, their baked potato with all of the trimmings and on one visit they had a delicious warm apple crisp. The rest is like what your Mother would make if she was a terrible cook.    They obviously have a faithful clientele who visit frequently. I have been to this location 3 times and I have seen some of the same characters on all 3 occasions. It is hard to miss them since they have turned gluttony into an art form; piling their plates so high that they appear to defy the laws of gravity."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but tonight was very disappointing. I think they are cutting too much flavor to save $$$! The salad dressings are watery and lack flavor; the cream of mushroom soup was potato soup with a mushroom flavor; the mac & cheese has no flavor; even the blueberry muffins seemed to be missing something. The cornbread was bland as well. And I'm not usually very picky. They could do so much better. The ice cream was ok and the chocolate chip cookies were great and the water was good ! Let me know if you agree."}
{"text":"I like sweet tomatoes purely because I love salad bars! The food is fresh and it's relatively inexpensive for what you get. $12 per person for dinner gets you pre made salads, salad bar, pizzas, pastas, and dessert.  Add on for drinks.  Open seating. Very clean. Food tastes fresh and looks good. They have low fat and fat free dressing in addition to regular flavors. All you can eat. Friendly staff.  Good informal place to go for a low key meal."}
{"text":"Freshness and variety are two words that come to mind when dining at Sweet Tomatoes.  The staff always do a good job to keep the salad, soup, pasta and dessert bars clean, stocked and fresh.  Even the premade concoctions at the very beginning that can get soggy because they are already dressed.  Soup is one of my favorite things to sample.  I love that they always have 8 different varieties to choose from and include many vegetarian options as well.  I have not had a bad soup yet.  Even when they creamy potato gets burned from sitting in the well all day it still is very tasty.    Sweet Tomatoes will highlight a different ingredient it seems every season.  That ingredient will be incorporated in many of their salads or sides dishes.  This mean the selection will vary slightly if you space your visits out enough.  So make each plate your own and make frequent trips to the soup and salad bar.  Get creative and try something new.   The one issue I have with this concept is the price for soup and salad.  Over $11.00 for each adult not including a drink for dinner seems a little steep in my opinion.  Also why have a lunch and dinner price when there is really no different choices offered at 4 pm when dinner price kicks into effect.  Overall good choice for dining in Las Vegas for quick self serve lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes is a good place to go if you are craving salad! They have a long buffet of veggies, dressings, and toppings for you to make your own salad. They also have a variety of soups, different dipping breads, and pasta."}
{"text":"So I found a dead fly in my salad....after when I was practically finished with the damn plate. Ummm yeah...looks like I won't be going to this place for a looooong time now. I'm completely turned off by Sweet Tomatoes at this point.  Granted, I understand things happen and I'm sure I must of eaten some other \"unmentionables\" at one point or another in my life. Who knows what had happened \"back stage\" at other restaurants I've been to. BUT....seeing something like this RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME is just disgusting.   Imagine if I didn't see and actually swallowed it!? Geez...I don't even wanna imagine that. O_O   We told the manager on duty. He apologized and offered us two complimentary meal + drink passes for next time. HAHAHA....yeah, next time, my ass!!  I took a picture of it but after I posted it on the \"tip section\" of the Yelp app, I deleted it off my phone. Ugh..don't want to be reminded of what I ALMOST put in my body.  Peace out, Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"I have always loved this restaurant, it is healthy, delicious and fresh. It has a perfect variety of foods and drinks for me. Today, we saw a special part of Sweet Tomatoes' great customer service. My husband recieved a completely random attack from a woman in a nearby booth, her throwing a large ice water right into his forehead for seemingly no reason. (I think she was having a bad day haha.) Though none of the staff or manager was at fault, they immediately cleaned up. apologized thoroughly and dealt with the situation very well, even offering to refund our meals. This was far beyond what they needed to do, but we really appreciated their kindness and generosity in this regard. We will definitely be coming back soon, despite the damaged forehead!"}
{"text":"We frequent here at least once a month.  The place is ALWAYS so clean and well maintained. We have a child with special needs and were given special service and assistance without even being asked by the manager Candace.  We were very touched by her kindness and caring, not all people are so nice about a melt down. The food is always fresh and of course wonderful!"}

{"text":"Have not dined here in about a year until last Sunday.    First thing was that the initial pre-made salads were empty and no one was available to make them at that moment.    Next was the cashier line, both sides had over a dozen people waiting and only one cashier going back and forth to take payment.    Ok, the place was very busy, just way under staffed.  The food however was good as usual, and the staff was pleasant.   Now comes the very disappointing moment...my wife and I went to the bathrooms to wash our hands to discover that the bathrooms are in disrepair! The sinks have large brown iron stains, the countertops were falling apart, the surface on the bathroom stalls was falling off and the bathrooms were just very very unsanitary!  My wife walked out immediately without washing her hands because of the filth.  How can the employees keep themselves, their hands clean if the bathrooms are unsanitary!  Should of checked the bathrooms first and eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  Now it seems they are cutting back on more and more items. Now no cumbers.  Cashier said they haven't had any in a month. Never heard of a salad place without cucumbers. Two of my grandaughter's favorite desert toppings are now gone, nuts and sprinkles. Don't think we'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Always busy, bizarrely competent customer service. The guy must have come and taken old plates three times over our lunch.  The first time I went here I was very confused because it's a big salad bar with the registers at the end. You load up and then pay. Rather than the typical Vegas buffet style of pay, then plate.  I suspect someone at corporate paid a psychologist a lot of money to decide that, because even though they are very friendly, I feel awkward about walking past them again to get more salad. ALSO, there is a ton of food behind the line - potato and pasta and a dessert bar, all of which is included in the meal, but the temptation is to avoid the conflict by loading up on lots of salad and thereby not eating any of the hot food. It makes it difficult for me to portion it out properly, is what I am saying.  They had four kinds of butter for the potato, by the way. I went with honey butter, because c'mon, that is kind of excellent."}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for lunch and eat something healthy.  Their options of salad topping are delicious and extensive. I had a few questions regarding some of the ingredients in the salad dressings and Moses was able to look it up and answer my questions. :) As far as the other foods, I only had their chicken soup, which was slightly different from what I'm use to but I loved it!!  Once my diet is over I'll be back to try some of their more delicious looking foods."}
{"text":"We used to go more frequently. This last visit, the Caesar salad was almost empty & VERY soggy. There wasn't anyone working at the salad bar either. The other items weren't bad, but certainly nothing great this visit. They struggled to keep tables clean & the baked items were dry & hard from being warmed too long. Disappointed since I spent almost $50 for a family of 4. I think there may be better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"The thing that bothered me the most on my last trip to Sweet Tomatoes was the uncleanliness of the establishment. The carpet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years, and the bathrooms left something to be desired. If I can't trust them to keep the restaurant clean, how can I trust them to handle food properly? The quality of the produce looks good enough, but I think it's really overpriced for a buffet-style restaurant. You could get a lot nicer salad at a sit-down restaurant for less money. The hot food, as some other reviewers have mentioned, is pretty sub-par. I won't be coming back here again any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for some time and always enjoy salads and array of soups.  I like that they usually have some type of special theme like tonight. I had the Albondigas soup and it was delicious.  I will say that there is a foul smell that has always seems to come from the bathroom area that I wish they would fix.  Other than that we enjoy it."}
{"text":"Going home to suburbia for me means feasting at chain restaurants (am I alone in this?) Sweet Tomatoes is a great spot to tame that soup and salad and frozen yogurt craving while catching up with friends.  For price and convenience, it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"One of my fiancé's and I favorite place to eat in town! The staff is always super friendly and nice to us! They are a clean place that is always wiping down their food counters and cleans tables fast! The owner knows us by name and if we ever had an issue she made sure to take care of it! We eat here about once a week and is our go to whenever we can't decide!!! So many choices and fresh quality food!"}
{"text":"What happened?  Sweet Tomatoes used to be a treat; great salads, a wide variety of hot and cold dishes, plus amazing dessert options.  It's like someone waved a magic wand and said, \"Poof! Let there be zero flavor!\"  Seriously, the items are the same, but somehow the staff managed to make all the flavor and quality disappear.  So disappointing!  I can't say I'll return."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Long salad bar with tons of options.  Soup bar had a few good choices chili is always a good option"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love clean eating space and clean eats! Sweet Tomatoes is the fresh spot to eat a ton and not feel too guilty. With a hot summer coming up, I will be visiting more often. I attempt to mimic their salads at home but they beat me every time. For you aliens that have never been here before here's a quick overview. You walk in and begin at the salad buffet. There are create your own versions as well as ready made salads available. All of the fresh veggies you could imagine, pasta salads, dressings, fruits. Once you have your cold selections, you pay before sitting. Join the email club and you get coupons monthly which are good for your whole party. In another section is hot soups (seasonal offerings) that are delicious, potatoes, flat breads, puddings and more. There is no meat beyond the occasional soup. Such a feel good spot!"}
{"text":"No breakfast choices on Sunday morning. We love this place and are always impressed with all aspects. I guess it's my fault but I recently met a friend on Sunday morning thinking at 10:00am there would have to be some breakfast type choices. Their menu was exactly the same. I asked and was told there are no changes on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"don't ever eat there.  cashier who is asst mgr doesn't even know the special coupons online. no excuses for not knowing the web specials - why send out marketing special offers if their people are not familiar or smart enough to recognize the coupon. they got the customer in the door now you better assist them in getting the deal!!! or they are not coming back!!!!  this place was flithy and unmanned at peak dinner hour.  cook went to break on dinner hour. bowl rack dirty and no bowls????"}
{"text":"When we were here six months ago, I would have given it four stars. But someone is trying to make money by thinning everything down. The dressings are the consistency of water. What good is a salad dressing if it won't stick to the salad.   The same with the soups. Heavy on watery broth and light on ingredients.   Even the spaghetti sauce was watery.   This strategy only works for so long before customers realize you are scamming them.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love Sweet Tomatoes!  My favorite is their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad!  Although it can be expensive it is a great alternative for fast food!"}
{"text":"This place has great food! And can be relatively healthy. I ordered them for catering and it was decently priced and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Easy with a lot of kids with different likes as plenty for kids, basic veggies, Mac and cheese, pizza and soup. Also the brownies and ice cream desserts. However for adults, salads are ok but nothing special, pizza is eh and not many healthy options. I haven't been in a few years but I remember better food and more selections. There is no service anymore But the price is cheap if you want an easy option. We were on playdate and was easy but not somewhere I would chose to go on our own."}
{"text":"Consistently a great place to grab a salad and soup with friends.  With all the buffets in town (which I love), it's nice to have a place that serves all-you-can-eat salads and soup.  My family and I are regulars at this location.  You grab a tray and plate, build your salad masterpiece, then grab a place to sit and enjoy.  The veggies are always fresh and there's a wonderful variety of soups.  Several of the soups are seasonal, so be sure to watch for changes in the line up.  There's also a small assortment of pastas and breads to complement your salad.  If you sign up for their e-mail list, you also get coupons every week as well as notices when they make a change in a featured soup.  They also offer a discount for active or retired members of the military.  If you're hungry and in the mood for salad, try Sweet Tomatoes.  With plenty of booths and tables, it's a great place to gather with a group of friends for a meal too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I had a craving for a good salad we went to Sweet Tomatoes on Talking Stick way and both decided to have a chef salad unfortunately there was no chicken or ham or any type of meat to put on your chef salad we were very disappointed. So basically we had lettuce we tried out the soup very bland and the pizza bread limited cheese  so disappointed . for the price we paid we will continue to just eat at our lunch cafeteria"}
{"text":"I come here too often to not write a review.  I'll keep this short and simple since I'm sure everyone is aware of Sweet Tomatoes. Born and raised in So Cal, this place is known as Souplantation. I still prefer to call it Souplantation anyways. It just makes more sense!!! =) So it's basically a salad bar buffet. There's also 7 soups to choose from, your pizza, muffins, baked potatoes and 3 pasta dishes. Soups and pastas can vary. It changes each month.  I don't know how healthy this really is. Personally, I would like to think it's healthy for me. It sure beats the heck outta burgers, fries and tacos right?? The food here is pretty good...it helps you get your veggies and salad fix. Boyfriend and I always come here with their coupons from the weekly mailers. 2 adult lunches run about $20. Sometimes they have coupons were a drink is included."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite location in The Valley. It's not congested like other locations, I don't have to fight for standing room in front of the soda machine, I don't have to pump elbows with someone getting a drink while I'm trying to fatten up with ice cream. I don't have to wait for some unsupervised kid to get soup while spilling it all over the place. The soup is it's own little island so you can get it from both sides, the bowls are spaced out in front of the soup for easy access.   It's laid out correctly and I wish the other ones would follow suite.   The staff is always nice. I get to seat myself rather than have someone put me at a table I don't want.    All around, we have no complaints about this location.   Two Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"This place is only a few blocks away from my house. Reminds me of a sizzler location but without the meats. The fresh salad selection provides a large selection of toppings and greens. There were 6-7 different types of soups (my favorite was the clam chowder). Lunch is about $10, dinner is $12. To the left of the soup station, there is a baked potato station where you can stuffed your own potato. After that, have some homemade pizza and try the baked coconut muffin. I will return!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day for them but the food was NOT good.  I have been to other Sweet Tomato's and enjoyed the food but last Friday this location was disappointing.  The salads were limp and obviously not fresh. The noodles were dried out on the pasta bar and I had to spit out the chocolate pudding cake.  It had a dry, pasty taste. Not sure we will ever try a Sweet Tomato again."}
{"text":"First time here.... as I am from SoCal we have Souplantation. But I think this place might be a tad better. I wish there was clam chowder here but not the night i went. The food is good and area is clean. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was very nice. It's a great big salad bar with lots of choices - all you can eat. They also have a bakery, pasta station and sundae bar.  It all tasted fresh and didn't look like it had been sitting out for hours (like some buffets).  I would gladly return for lunch if I worked in the area."}
{"text":"This place has gone down the tubes.  We have been coming here for almost a decade and in the last year they must have a new manager.  The soups are clearly watered down, the place smells like a retirement home, and they have turned 1/5 of the salad bar into \"premium\" pay toppings.  For $8.99 you can find dozens of better buffets.  Why do parents let their five and six year olds go up to get their own food?  I witnessed one kid touch every brownie on the tray before picking one.  When I told the girl behind the counter about it (and said they need to dispose of the tainted food) she just laughed it off.  \"They do that all the time.\"  Really?  That is called a health code violation.  Honestly, this place should be shut down its so dirty now.  Never again will we go here.  Never."}
{"text":"Lots of fresh salad items, loved the quinoa salad. Cream of asparagus soup was amazing, as was the brownie bite (just the right size and warm!) Lots of vegan foods available. All you care to eat. Good soup selection and some desserts too."}
{"text":"Ok, so here is my obligatory review only because I go here more than I want to. I am a carnivore so this place is definitely not on my top places to eat list. I have 4 main reasons why I come here. 1 is because my wife loves salad. 2 and 3 because my two kids love mac and cheese along with the chicken noodle soup. Lastly, 4 because every so often I over indulge in having some kind of meat fest whether its a large Ribeye or at a buffet like Korean Barbeque or Brazillian so I tend to feel kind of guilty. So salad is in order.  So if you ask me where and what to eat, I will  never mention this place ever.  But for you salad eaters, I can see why this would be heaven for you. As soon as you step foot in the place, you grab a plate or two, throw it on a tray, then off you go to the long buffet bar full of all sorts of vegetables.  Then you pay and you're off on your merry way to go find a table or booth to sit down. If you join their email club, they send you coupon specials and promos. Also, if you look in the newspaper, every now and then they have 2 for 1 specials. When its really packed, you have to wait for a host to find you a seat.  Once you sit down, you have other choices like different soups, breads, pasta, etc. Every month they usually have different themes like lemon month, which means a lot of the items have some kind of lemon influence like lemon cake or pomegranate lemonade fusions.  Some random info: They have these card thingies at your table that indicates if you took off to go get more food or if you are done so the bussers know whether to clean your whole table or not. These guys are the same as Soup Plantation in Southern California. Dont forget dessert! They have frozen yogurt you serve yourself!  So from my point of view, my family loves it here, which makes it ok for me.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #26"}
{"text":"Just stopped by on the grand opening to see what the \"Express\" part of this Sweet Tomatoes was all about. Here instead of the all-you-can-eat buffet you simply point and tell the employee there what you'd like on your salad. The salads are big too so you'll get your money's worth.  It's very quick and they'll add as much of whatever ingredient as you like. Once your salad is built you have the option of adding a cup of soup or a muffin. I believe there were 5 different types of soups. I tried the Sweet Potato & Chorizo.. it was awesome!  The prices are fair, salad alone is $6.99 or $8.99 with soup.  The location alone will definitely get me to come back. It's very clean and the employees are friendly. Plus there's not blue cheese dressing sloshed in the other dressings like usual at the buffet locations."}
{"text":"We were excited when our closest Sweet Tomatoes location was reopening, however, we won't be coming back. We will continue going to the locations that weren't turned into a Field Kitchen at one point.  The salad bar is missing way too many items, the beverage area is too small/awkward and the soup/potato area is also a squeeze (and I'm a small person).   It's not worth having to wait in line for soup, not having enough items on the salad bar and being unable to get to the ice machine because people are piled up around the ice cream."}
{"text":"For a salad bar restaurant , its pretty good. Always fresh, great soup, some basic bread, baked potato, and pasta that is not special. Salad dressings are pretty good.  I am so confused by this place, if this is healthy food why is everyone that eats here so fat?"}
{"text":"If your in the mood for quick, fast soup and salad, this is the place. Many many choices and even had a potato bar and pasta. Loved the Mac and cheese also!"}
{"text":"The quality of the hot items is dropping.  No bran or brownie muffins, pasta sauce is weak, no veg soup.  They did not even have chopped peanuts for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and if you didn't think so, alert a staff and they'll fix it! I had a question about my bill and dismissed it due to a long line behind me. Later a manager came to asnwer my question and adjusted my bill. It was a minor difference due to coupon offers, but it was the friendly customer service that really makes eating here a good experience!"}
{"text":"Location here is very clean and always kept nice. Sweet Tomatoes is Sweet Tomatoes.  Great big salad bar and carb fest 3000 with some good ice cream at the end. And Atkins dieter can not eat here."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for fresh, healthy salads, soups, baked goods, and desserts. We love to go there.   Print out the Sweet Tomatoes coupons from their website to save on you meal, or print out the coupons you receive by email when you join their mailing list. They have senior discount there also.

Sweet Tomatoes is a great place to bring groups or to just meet with friends and family for a good meal.  This is always a favorite place to go."}

{"text":"Great selection of salad, soup, pasta and breads.  Lots of toppings for salads and the soups.  Chili with cheese, onions, sour cream, bacon, and chives.  I would give 5 stars but no cheese on salad bar."}
{"text":"This is probably the healthiest buffet you can eat at in Las Vegas haha! It's great. Unlimited salad and soup! Their pasta isn't as great, but they have a lot of breads and muffins too.   They have a full salad bar where you can assemble your own heaping pile of green goodness. Then you can migrate over to the soup counter where they always have around 5-6 different types of soups to choose from. A lot of their soups are seasonal too, so it's always something different when you come."}
{"text":"Iusually try to keep coupons in my wallet for this place or use my senior discount as it is one place I like going to. Salad is good and many choices to have to make a kings salad. I love the onion soup and mac and cheese sides. I take a baked potato once in a while. A no meat place and don't miss it. Who needs fast food when one has places like this to choose from.with it good food. One gets dessert too. Wow."}
{"text":"I've been to many Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes locations, and this was the best!  The selection was good, all items were fully stocked, but best of all, everything was fresh and the restaurant was clean!  Staff was among the friendliest I've seen at a buffet.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple years ago and would have given it 4 stars.  Here's why they've lost a star during my last visit: Selection has dwindled (no clam chowder, no cherry tomatoes, less hot food choices) The hot foods they did have were bland, not as flavorful as the Souplantation I usually go to.  Sweet Tomatoes, stock up on those sweet cherry tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast buffet I just went there with great expectations and I was very disappointed they didn't have good variety of foods like in a real buffet they only had 3 kinds of gross scramble eggs no hash browns no pancakes no condiments when I asked the waitress for catchup she said let me see if we have any. And it was expensive totally Not  worth it. Next time I rather go somewhere else thank goodness here in las vegas there are many other places way better then here."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Enjoyed the Thai crunch salad and garlic bread. Not too much of a fun of the chili. Strawberry lemonade was delicious as well."}

{"text":"Arrived on the 7th of January. My husband and our youngest daughter.   I have never been to one before so my kiddo and hubby were excited to show me everything they had.   The price for 3 adults and 3 drinks were $48.70. Guess a 12 year old in an adult now that I am reviewing my receipt.   The food was good and the array of variety is a nice change up.   The dining room and restrooms however were disgusting. Nothing was clean or wiped down and the floor was covered with trash and dropped food.   The two gals were to busy chatting it up for me to ask for a coffee cup for the coffee with my dessert.   Not sure if we will return to this location. Hubby and kiddo said this is the worst they have ever seen the restaurant. It was on a Sunday at 9pm."}
{"text":"Another disappointing visit.  The only soup that was decent was the Albondigas.  Mushroom soup used to be pretty good.    Didn't like it.   It just seems that they are disorganized when they can't have the lunch food ready on time.   This is one of the busiest locations, yet they always have an excuse for running late.   Whatever happened to being organized?  Yes, it's clean...........the baked items taste like they come out of a box.  The pasta is terribly bland.  Some of the salads are OK  depending on your particular taste.   Going here more than 2 times a year is a waste of my money.  The staff does work hard...........I just think that the management there has been weak for a very long time."}
{"text":"A lot of ppl think this place is cheap but I just love it  They always always fresh and I think it's the most important thing you can ask  They work fast and organize  The prices are good for what you get  I love how they always have everything never run out of anything  They love yelpers as well so if you check in you get discounts  I love this place always good  to stop by and get full .."}
{"text":"Well, who doesn't love sweet tomatoes? Mega salads, soups, bread, etc. $10?  Heck yeah.  Love all of it!!"}
{"text":"If it weren't the couple that were so nice to take my friend and I out to lunch we wouldn't have known about this place.  Inside, the first thing is standing in line, cafeteria style and getting items for your salad. Once you get what you want there, there is a cashier where you pay. Of course it doesn't stop there! Once you find your table and eat, you can go to the other part of the restaurant and help yourself to more! They have soups, pizza bread, mac and cheese, and for dessert: ICE CREAM!  Since there was so much to try I only had small portions of whatever I got. Believe me by the end of the meal, you'll be FULL. After my salad, I tried their chili and mac and cheese. Their pastas are yummy. I would totally go for seconds... But I just had room for... DESSERT! Chocolate ice cream, yum. It didn't end  there though! A worker came around and gave everyone a sample of their freshly baked cookies. This time it was chocolate chip!  If you want to take more chocolate chip cookies home it's $2 a bag!  Didn't finish or want to take home food? They have containers at the front of the store for your convenience."}
{"text":"Worst service. Started and finished my meal with no crew who even paid attention. Even customer from the next table left and no one from sweet tomatoes cleaned it."}
{"text":"We eat here quite often.  Instead of greeting us or saying hello, your staff is conversing in Spanish, with each other, laughing and having a party while we get our salad, that is rude, unprofessional and disgusting.  I counted 5 people behind the counter yaking it up, ignoring the customers.  Then we went to pay and the cashier was preoccupied with her conversation to another employee.  They shut the ice machine down due to cross contamination.  That could have been avoided if you weren't having a chatty party.  You are there to serve your customers and watch that contamination never happens...in addition , you were out of passion tea and no one refilled it.  I want a focus on the customers not you talking to each other...get it under control.  Also, shut up  and steam clean your grout, floors and bathrooms, filthy."}
{"text":"The managers here are amazing! We had a situation arise, and they took care of it and not only did they take care of it they made sure that we were satisfied. I truly enjoyed coming this week to meet us and enjoy the customer service it is here. We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great place to fill up on something light and healthy (er). I really enjoy sweet tomatoes in the summer, when it's robot for a heavy meaty meal. They could be a little cleaner at the buffet, and be quicker with the breads.  But over all a good place to eat"}
{"text":"For what you pay it's a pretty good carbohydrate shrine. I just wish they had the beets I've grown to love there. It looked like they took them away. :("}
{"text":"So if I could give zero stars to this establishment I would but to write this review I had to give one. So I had unfortunately left my phone behind when we left. I noticed by the next exit I left it I turned around to go get it. I pulled up at 9:15 and the doors were locked because of them closing at 9. Understandable of course but the gal that came to the door to open it looked at me and  she understood the fact I left my phone behind.  She opened the door and I asked the busser if they found a phone. Manager had it and almost wasn't going to give it to me because he was already closed. He apprehensivly handed it over and proceeded to scold me. He told me next time I leave it after hours I would of have to call and get it the next day. Then proceeded to ask me which one of his employees let me in. Seriously asked me to tell on someone. I left my phone and wasn't even gone 5 minutes after spending 50 dollars for soup and salads, and  sir because of your poor attitude  you will no longer have my, nor my family's business in your establishment. It's not as if I was sneaking in to steal food or something. I made a mistake and left my phone!!!  Maybe if I didn't feel pushed out because they were closed!!! The look on my face as I'm getting yelled at!!! Even my friends in the car saw the look on my face and asked if I was okay.  I am shocked that this man is a manager."}
{"text":"This place is a weird cafeteria-style eatery. Right when you walk in you see the salad bar. You get in line, fill up your plate with either a pre-made salad or make your own. Then you pay and grab a seat. I find this place to be odd because I'm the type of person who likes to scope out a buffet before deciding what to eat first. At least let me pay then check things out. But to grab a salad, pay, then get more food seems like a bizarre process.  All the food is average. Nothing exceptional, but a few items I would eat again. A couple of the pre-made salads were decent. The cornbread and chocolate peanut butter chip muffin were also good. The focaccia was decent, pastas were below average, and baked potatoes were tiny. They've got chocolate and vanilla soft-serve ice cream with some toppings to mix in. They has some sort of low-fat mango mousse which was not good.  The place is clean and the bussers were quick to pick up used plates. It's a family-friendly restaurant and relatively inexpensive place to eat, but pales in comparison to real buffets around town.  2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Over all it's a good place. Staff is very friendly. Their strawberry lemonade is the best all around vegas. I usually pay extra to have it to go. Only thing that makes me put 4 star is the price. I'd say a bit pricey for just veggies !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and wasn't too impressed. The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, furniture was nice and parking was easy, but that was about it. The food options were very limited, especially for non-vegetarians. I have been to similar restaurants in the past that have been amazing, but this food was cold and unimpressive. Don't think I'll be back here soon."}
{"text":"So very disappointed in this place. While in line a man was also in line with the \"f\" word all over the front of his shirt.  There  were so many young families in there. We complained to the manager and let him Know that we found it highly offensive and asked that the man be turned away. Management did nothing. He told us that his hands were tied because of freedom of speech.   Unacceptable.   I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just tried their horchata muffins for the first time and loved them. The salad and soups are always great. The busboy is very attentive and seems to proud of his job. My only complaint is that the employees on the other side of the serving bars do a good job but they do not clean up all the stuff that the customers drop all over the place. Just left the pasta bar and there is food and sauce all over the place. Same with the salad dressing. It is the customers that create the mess but unfortunately the workers are the last source to wipe it up. This is almost always the case, so I guess the management is not doing their job."}
{"text":"Ate here again.  Just love it.  Among many good things the bleu cheese crumbles were excellent.  I have never been disappointed at this place."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my boyfriend, which my boyfriend has never been to sweet tomatoes. And I've never been to this location, so it was confusing since I normally go to the location on chandler. The customer service is terrible here, and every staff member was completely rude. I love sweet tomatoes but this location upset me. My boyfriend no longer wants to go to any sweet tomatoes since we had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The food is always great and the staff if very friendly and helpful. The managers always are helping out that is refreshing to see."}
{"text":"Haven't been in years now i know why ! Ewhhh stay away dirty plates and horrible food and utensils on the salad bar line 2 thumbs down!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is back! Nice to see the filed kitchen concept gone. They kept a few nice things from field kitchen such as a more elegant decor. Gone are those ridiculous payment cards, inability to have access to the salad dressings and the confusion. Back is the simple payment system, all you can eat concept, self food area, ice cream toppings, and customers. Nice to see Sweet Tomatoes back and with some of the good elements of field kitchen."}
{"text":"Another must stop.  We don't have these on the East Coast and I am sure they are not on the way anytime soon. =(   I mean, how many times can you go to In N Out? You start off with a great salad bar, holy heck it has everything you need and want.  I can not even list what they have...I know there is lettuce.   After the salad I normally stroll over to the soups. I normally try 2 soups. Definitely have the chili, it is delicious.  Grad some breads, last time they had \"grilled cheese\" focaccia and a garlic focaccia.  The corn bread is a nice side dish for the chili.  I tend to skip the pasta so I can not comment on that.  I am more than happy with the salad, soup, and desert.  After the mound of salad, bowls or soups, and piles of bread (carb overload) it is time for ice cream. They do have fruit and pudding as well.  But, you can not end without taking the chocolate brownie (last visit they had PB/Choc bars) and covering it with your favorite soft serve ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or swirl).  Add some toppings and it is time to indulge.  Pass the salad fork!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was way over crowded and I have be vomiting ever since our visit. The last Time I had food poisoning  was In the 80's. I will NEVER go back. We went last nigh, and I still can't keep anything down.  Be CAREFUL!!!!!!"}
{"text":"They cleaned the place up by replacing the furniture and painting. It looks much better, food is the same, tons of carbs and veggies. $30 for 2 for dinner"}
{"text":"Last night my daughter and I went to Sweet Tomatoes on Stephanie to have dinner..We sat down and started to eat. My daughter got up to grab a baked potato, cheese and green onion. On her way back she dropped her cheese and green onion on the floor. Paul the Manager stood right next to my daughter and watched her get on the floor to pick up the items. While the Manager stood next to my daughter talking to someone at a table another employee walked past my daughter. I immediately lost my appetite seeing this type of action from not only 1 employee but 2, one of them being a Manager. Neither one voiced that assistance was called and neither one voiced that it was being taken cared of. Neither employee gave my daughter the chance to say no it's okay it's my fault I can take care of it. The Manager himself just stood and watched.  When I went up to the front counter to speak to a manager or supervisor that is when I found out Paul the person watching my daughter clean something off the floor was the actual manager. It then took a while for Paul to come up to the counter. When voicing my concern he didn't seem that concerned about his and his employees actions. Paul seemed to have a lot of communication with someone sitting at the table next to us versus being a Manager and dealing with situations that arise in the restaurant that he is managing.   I have been to this location numerous times and this time I felt that the customer service has gone down hill which is sad because I liked coming to this location."}
{"text":"Overall my Sweet Tomato experience was a good one, usually are. We frequent ST a lot. The salads are fresh, the condiments are tasty and the soups are filling. But....this particular visit was distributing to me......dishes were dirty!!! Food clinging to the plates...what happened to the dishwasher???"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were grabbing a quick lunch while we were waiting for an appointment to be over so we decided to stop in. The lady that checked us out was nice and asked if we wanted drinks but I said no. She handed us cups anyways so I was a little confused but didn't think anything of it. I didn't realize that these were just \"water\" cups and got some lemonade with my lunch. When we were almost finished an employee came up to me and started saying that these cups are strictly for water and I need to go and pay two dollars because I got lemonade instead. He was very rude and also he grabbed another glass for me and brought it to me and tried to take my other glass but at that point I was bothered enough by the situation and left. I'm not one to take advantage of a business but I'm also not okay with being reprimanded for getting lemonade instead of water. Won't be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"It's been 6/7 years since I've been to Souplantation, so when my uncle and aunt from Vegas suggested Sweet Tomatoes, I was open to it.  I like vegetables and stuff more now, so maybe I'll like it! I've changed!  .....but then I remembered that somethings never change. Sweet Tomatoes is like Souplantation, where you eat salad and soup, and there are no options for meat. Nuff said....  BUT the Rosemary Soup was amazing.  I don't think I will be returning to Sweet Tomatoes or Souplantation. Options are too limited, and eating leaves is not worth $10+ of my money in my honest opinion"}
{"text":"If you were JUST going for salad and soup, you'd be OK. but at $12 a person, not worth it. There is very little to eat other than that, and the couple pasta entrees and breads offered are not good. The atmosphere is old and outdated. Felt like a cafeteria. Worse yet is that the nearby dairy smell permeates the restaurant unfortunately."}
{"text":"The service was great and the staff was friendly. Phillip helped us and he was awesome. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"NO complains love this place  staff is nice, place is clean. I always come here  my fav for healthy place."}
{"text":"I have learned that the best time to visit Sweet Tomatoes is in the late afternoon after the morning and lunch rush. So much more peaceful and easier to get to the grub. That being said, I do like going to Sweet Tomatoe from to time. They have tons of soups and salads to choose from along with fresh focaccia, yummy cornbread, muffins, pastas, and depending on the which month, a certain theme and with this April being the theme was all about Lemons. Oh and don't forget about the dessert. YUM!  It is a seems a little pricey to me for a mostly salad buffet but its a cool place to go for a quick, fulfilling meal from time to time."}
{"text":"We love this place!! I can't buy, clean and cut up this kind of produce for this price! The quality of the food is excellent - a far cry from your typical buffet good. Much, much better!  All the pre-tossed salads are yummy, and fresh, and I love the seemingly endless options on the fresh, make-your-own salad bar. The soups are my favorite! I love the cream of chicken or turkey pot pie soups. Yummy!!   The potatoes, pizza, pasta, muffins, and desserts and good, and we LOVE the frozen yogurt to end our meal!! Delicious, affordable (look for coupons, or sign up online for the Club Veg emails) and good food!! The service is great too!! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this salad bar while killing time driving around Las Vegas a couple of months ago, and in need of something for lunch.  It looked interesting, so I did a quick Yelp search from the parking lot to see what it was all about, and seeing decent reviews, I stepped inside.    When I first walked in, it took me a minute to figure out the process, but thankfully there was an employee right there doing some cleaning, and he pointed me in the right direction.  Down the salad bar I worked, creating a huge salad of all my favorite veggies, many of which you don't see at a typical salad place.  I wish I had realized at the time that there were more delicious things down the other end of the bar and beyond, so I could have left some room on my plate!  Once you work past the regular salad stuff, you get to some prepared salads.  I tried one that was vegan.  After finish with the salad bar, you pay a flat rate per person, depending on whether it's lunch or dinner hours.  The cashier somehow realized that I was a newbie, so she explained the company to me and welcomed me.    After paying, you can chose your seat, and then make your way to the hot bar, which included soups, chili, bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and probably some other things I can't remember two months later.  Even though I already had a huge salad on my plate, I had to try a little taste of the ministrone soup, and a wheat roll. There is also a dessert bar, but aside from the fresh fruit, there didn't appear to be anything this vegan could eat.    While I was sitting, enjoying my meal, the manager, who apparently also caught wind that I was new to the restaurant, came over, welcomed me, and gave me a small bag of their in-house made chocolate chip cookies!  Never before had I felt so welcomed at a business, I knew I'd be returning before my trip was over.  Didn't even care about being given cookies I could not eat.  I was happy to share them with my husband's hockey teammates.    I did return a day or two later with my husband, who also enjoyed the experience.  Unfortunately on the second trip, we were rushed, so we didn't get to sit and enjoy our meal as much, but it was still delicious.    I really wish this business was in New Jersey.  Next time I'm traveling west, I'll definitely keep my eye out for a Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a ST's since I left Missouri so I was thrilled to see this one right up from our hotel.  For a family girls only lunch, the five of us went here after hiking and yeah, we ate!  The place is the largest ST's I've ever been in and I was happy to see some of my old favorites like the blueberry muffins and Caesar salad.  For some reason we all went nuts at the soup spot (most of us were inhaling the cream of mushroom) and none of us had any complaints other than waiting for them to refill some of the soups :)  Good bang for your buck here."}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect when I walked in. I thought it would just be a salad bar and that's it but they have so much more than salad here! The breads, soups and the dessert section is to die for. The coffee is great too! The service is amazing, everyone is very helpful and very friendly and the restaurant is kept very clean. There are so many options to make your own salad and so many yummy dressings to put on top. I had an amazing first experience here and I'm definitely coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Now from the looks of my profile pic...you can see I'm not really a \"salad guy\". I more of a meat and more meat type of guy, but I have to hand it to sweet tomatoes...they did a really good job with this concept. The salad was crisp, clean, and fresh, the tomatoes, cucumber, and other sides looked as if they were picked in the morning and the taste was very good! Also, they have great soups here and their desserts aren't half bad. Highly recommend this place if u are looking for a quick, healthy lunch. Lunch is $8.99, but there are always tons of coupons so you can get lunch for 1 for $6.99!"}
{"text":"They had NO OTHER FOOD OTHER THAN SALAD! Hardly any options! Soup was somewhat decent."}
{"text":"Always good to come here. Chicken soup is their classic all time favorite.  Easy going atmosphere, good for dinning alone or with family.  Food is healthy but can over eat easily... Worth signing for coupon emails"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one day. We were surprised at how busy it was. It's pretty much an all you can eat salad bar. They have a bunch of options for veggies which were all very fresh. Different cheeses, lots is dressing, so many toppings. They also have a hot area,  in which they serve soup, pasta, baked potatoes, mac and cheese, bread and ice cream. The salad area was exceptionally clean,  however the hot area needed some attention. There was a lot of food that was just everywhere. The soups were kind of out there, I think it would be better to offer basic or classic soups like chicken noodle or clam chowder etc. The only reason why I won't return is because they don't offer any protein for your salad! No chicken, tuna or even tofu? If it's about price then do an upcharge for it. Without some kind of protein, there's really not a ton of nutritional value. Your pretty much eating water which is pointless unless your a vegetarian. Other than that,  service was great. People constantly walking around trying to pick up dirty plates. plates Lots of families with little kids"}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant is soo yummy. Let me start by saying I like the options of salads that are offered. Their Caesar salad is amazing! Their clam chowder just complements it even more. I like this 100x more than Souplantation ..."}
{"text":"Think of a buffet combined with a Panera bread food selection that you can customize and you have this place! Back when I used to live in the Bay Area at those locations as well as here in Vegas, this was the spot my family would always go to. In Henderson, the one on Stephanie is the one we head to.   Just recently they've remodeled their restaurant, and now it has a cleaner, farm to table type look rather than a cafe zupas red plate type look. (Which is not bad at all!)   -Step one: Get a tray and plate. Then choose ether side of the salad buffet and fill that plate with whatever salad/topping you like!  -Step two: once you get down the buffet aisle, you pay for your meal.  -Step three: depending on how busy they are, you are allowed to find your own table, OR someone will be there to direct you to a table suitable for the amount of people in your party.  -Step 4: sit down, eat, and head over to the soup station/bakery/dessert counter/ETC. any time to feast on those items :)   **TIP: they have cards at your table that will say something along the lines of \"be right back\" or \"I'm finished\" in a cute clever pun. Leave whichever side up depending on if you're just heading to the buffet again or leaving for good so they know whether or not to clean up the rest of your mess!"}
{"text":"Three strikes - you're OUT!  A few years ago - I discovered Sweet Tomatoes.  Great idea.  A little over priced, but the selection was so wonderful - take what you like and make a fantastic salad with a nice side of soup.  I'd run down from my office in Lake Oswego, OR or from my home in Salt Lake City.  Those days are over.  I ended up with this same experience in Utah - and vowed I'd never go back.  In Oregon, I was consistently pleased with the offerings.  Occasional misses, but it was good.  I don't understand it.  Do these people taste the food they send out?  Has the official taster lost his/her taste buds and is clinging onto their job for dear lire?  The ingredients look fresh.  Everything.  But when I try the pre-made salads - usually - they're bland.  Really bland.  Potato salad that tastes like it was sitting in a water bath after it was seasoned.  A Sriracha salad ... flavorless (REALLY - a BLAND SRIRACHA SALAD?).  Broccoli salad - ok ... but way too sweet.  Each time I've tried a different \"Homemade\" dressing.  They  generally come up thin and virtually flavorless - I'm thinking - is this where the water flavor is coming from for the salad.   Last night i tried the Blue Cheese - homemade.  I added blue cheese crumbles too!  I ate about 10 bites of the salad and pushed it aside.  Over to the soup line.  Tried the Corn Chowder.  YUK.  It had a \"seafood\" overtone.  Really?  It tasted as if someone had used a seafood broth as they had run out of a vegetable or chicken broth.  Not good when you're expecting a corn chowder!  Chicken noodle looked like chunky water.  I passed on that.  The chili was ok.  I prefer Wendy's chili to the bowl I got here - but - hey - I was hungry by this time.  The flat breads were ok, but lost my appetite for the potato when a kid - too young to be at the buffet by them selves - was using their fingers to select product.  I tried the mac and cheese.  It was edible - but again .. bland - and soupy.  Kids would probably love it.  I topped my night off with a small bowl of vanilla ice cream with a scoop of apple crumble - which was quite good.    This watery/bland salad line has been my experience the last three times I've been craving a salad.  I'll not waste money here again."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, and it was OK.  We found it to be a bit hit or miss.  There was a nice selection of fresh salad greens and toppings.  But some dressings lacked flavor.  The Thousand Island didn't have much taste, but the Garlic dressing was awesome.  Likewise, the Mushroom soup was so delicious!  But the chicken pot pie soup was lacking.  All in all it was a good meal - we liked the clean restaurant, fresh food, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd eat salad, but somehow I was persuaded to check this place out... and well, I love this place! You walk in and grab a plate or two and start making your salad (or just scoop up some of the premade ones). I've been here twice and I always pick a premade salad. It's just so yummy! Once you have your salad, at the end of the line, you pay for your salad, and it's relatively cheap. Once seated in the cafeteria area, you can also pick up some soups ranging from clam chowder to chili depending on the day."}
{"text":"A gem of a place! Super affordable, great selections of salad and toppings.  For 12 bucks this place is an absolute steal especially when compared to Panera. Sure there isn't a sandwich option but you get so much more for so much cheaper.  I've been twice and I be going a whole lot more. Everyone in here is super friendly too."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes - That's Awesomeness' Placed  & Every one, Trying including Phoenix\" Tomatoes - People's In the Sweets Tomatoes, 100's & More, 5 Stars"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and helpful but the food was terrible. It reminded me of a public school cafeteria. I had been to this location before and I didnt remember it being so bad. Disappointed and not worth the money. We wont go back.  Again, we did appreciate the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab a salad with variety. The other options od soup, cheese bread and baked potatoe are ok too. Dessert is limited but good."}
{"text":"I love the fresh cookie lady! when she is around this place is defiantly a 4 star place! when she is not around I am reminded how very mediocre this place is. It is just another generic salad buffet place nothing special or fancy about it. not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Food is great (as much as it can be for a salad bar anyways), but it's REALLY crowded during noon.  On a Saturday no less.  Pretty typical Sweet Tomatoes though.   Salad, soup, and some pizza/pasta/bread based things.  And some desserts.   If you're hankering for a little something a bit better for you, this place is a good place to be.  And contrary to another review that said these don't exist on the East Coast, I can definitely say that they do since there was one pretty close to home.  The price is... ehh...    a little hefty for a soup and salad place, but it's expected just as anywhere else."}
{"text":"I think I made the mistake of coming here without a being too hungry.  We wanted something that wasn't fried or had to wait for service.  We had heard that this place was pretty good, so we thought we would stop by.  It's kind of intimidating when you walk in because you are slapped in the face with the salad buffet.  So, we were a little confused if we just dig right in.  So we got our salads and made our way to cashier.  We found a table and the place had kind of a weird smell.  They have a hot section next to the mega salad bar which consists of soups, baked potatoes, breads, pastas, and a sundae bar.  Like I mentioned earlier I wasn't really hungry and the placed had a weird old dish towel smell. Everyone was attacking the food bars like they had never eaten in there life!  I would be standing there and someone would just jump right in with no patience.  I hate to knock the place because it is OK.  I just not a big fan.  I just can't stop thinking about how dirty it seemed."}
{"text":"When I go to  Sweet Tomatoes for some reason I think about the Jolly Green Giant, and see greens, greens, and more greens that I can shake a fork at, and I have to admit, I'm a fan of this place, but on this last visit I had myself thinking....what the heck just happened?    Have the Green Giant sprain his ankle or was it an off day for them?  When I walked into Sweet Tomatoes at 1:00 pm,  there was a very slow moving line, because one of the register had some kind of software issue, and they had to deal with two lanes at the same time.    That girl looked like she was holding it together, but you could tell she wanted  to reach out, and touch that computer in a very nasty way.   It wasn't that long of wait, but it got a little worse.  The soups were messed up on this day, and the chicken noodle had more soup base than chicken and noodle, and there some rendition of a  Greek Lemon soup that was barely okay, and on that day...no french onion :(      The pastry area are usually a winner, and brownies are great, but the Blueberry muffins been taking a nose dive as of late.    Sweet Tomatoes use to make their muffins with some large blue berries that use to load up the whole thing, but in my first one on this trip only had four small blue berries in the entire muffin.    I had that flashback of the movie, Casino; when two blue berry muffins was an argument on how' the casino coffee shop was messed up  for being inconsistent like the rest of the operation.    The waitress didn't care too much on this visit, but they cleared up tables when they had too, which made me think the General manager was off for the day.  Don't get me wrong it could have been a off-day, and I'm still fan of this place, but on this trip is was more than less of a bad visit.         ."}
{"text":"Good ole Sweet Tomatoes!  AKA Soup Plantation!  The restaurant is very similar to Souper Salad but with a facelift.  It's a myriad of unlimited salad items, endless soups, unlimited fountain drinks, and an infinity of hot carbs.  These restaurants have a monthly theme where they utilize in-season fruits/vegetables to create special dishes aside from their already existing menu items.  February's theme was potatoes (ex. cream of potato soup, potato salad, etc.).  The West Flamingo location is the newest Sweet Tomatoes in the area and even boasts outdoor seating that overlooks the great I-215 (also a great view of Home Depot).  SALAD Fresh pre-made caesars, pre-made cold pasta salads, pre-made broccoli salad, etc.  The salad bar also boasts tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, cauliflower, and tons of other veggies!  For the chef salad fans, they have feta and cheddar cheeses, hard-boiled egg, croutons, and a boat load of different salad dressings.  Grilled chicken is extra $.  SOUP I've never really been a fan of their soups even though I've tried many of them :-\.  Each restaurant has about 3-5 different soups.    HOT BAR   Mac and cheese, Iike theirs because I like Kraft.  Perfect for the kiddies.  They also have at least one other hot pasta but don't ask me, because I stick to the Kraft.  While you're up there the have hot potatoes that you can load up, different bread sticks that are pretty yummy, and muffins!  OMG the blueberry muffins are to die for.  Put the honey butter on them--euphoria!  DRINKS Unlimited of course, just like everything else.  They offer Coca Cola products and also have different iced teas and juices.  Mix and match you crazy barista!  DESSERT I always stuff myself on the blueberry muffins, so I never visit the ice cream.  Yes, I said ISCREAM!  Dreyer's chocolate and vanilla, soft serve, if you will.  The sprinkles and chocolate sauce aren't just for the kiddies either, go ahead, I won't tell.  Don't forget the hot cobbler!  Overall, I love Sweet Tomatoes.  They are casual, consistent, fresh, good, and cheap.  Meal+Drink= under $15"}
{"text":"I love sweet tomatoes! Specially this location! Right when you walk in there's a salad bar that lead you to the cashier, so grab your salad (I usually filled up 2 plates so I don't have to come back out to fill me salad). Beside their deliciously fresh salad I also love their chicken noodle soup at the soup station! That soup was amazing! Big chunks of chicken and hot broth. I also love their garlic Parmesan pizza slices, sweet buttery house made spread, brownies..etc. over all I'm always excited to come here despite the fact I've already been here a few times."}
{"text":"My family has been going here since it opened I'm talking at least 15 years.. after today we won't be back.. sadly you don't carry the fat free Italian dressing anymore.. which I asked the girl behind the counter with the red hair about.. she replied whatever is out there is what we have.. ok that's fine.. paid sat down.  The lettuce in the salad was so wilted it was brown .  Ok went to get some pizza, the first pizza up there was old and crunchy.. we waited for new pizza, the crust wasn't even cooked all the way! Fine, I went to go get a muffin, the muffin was so hard I had to spit it out because I couldn't chew it.. now I'm a bit frustrated so I get some chicken noodle soup. Great except the chicken was little pieces of chicken fat agh I get some chili that is just room temperature not even hot! Food safety people over 140!  Not to mention my husband got 2 dirty spoons.. Come on.. finally fed up we decided to cut our losses and leave.. as we're leaving I get to watch an employee with gloves on taking a drink of her soda and snacking behind the pizza counter wtf? With her gloves on! I try looking for a manager and there's not one in sight! We're done!"}
{"text":"I've always loved eating here and have so for over 15 years. In the last 2 years the quality has slowly decreased but today was the worst. The fountain bar is always drenched and there was not even 1 piece of ice.Half of the salad bar had nearly empty containers and they were out of forks. Our salads were on point but when we went for the classic chicken noodle soup the chicken was so hard and tough we couldn't eat it. They pasta bar had mushy dry old pasta. It was approximate 5:30 when we arrived by 7pm it was still the same. The quality is just getting worse and worse. I don't know how their corporation could even be half pleased to allow the current quality of this place. Sad to say I'll have to find a new place"}
{"text":"So this place had a good rating and lots of review so figured while we were heading through we would stop and get something to eat.  Didn't realize it was a buffet like California Fresh but when we walked in that is what it reminded us of.  However they had way more choices of greens and salads and toppings. The place was way busier so the food looked fresher and rotated more often. After you get through the salad part you pay and go around to the many soups and breads and they even make fresh stir fry pasta dishes right there. Overall I really liked the place they had gluten free options of muffins and they had like 6-7 different soups tons of varieties of greens and veggies.  I liked the fact it was a popular place and you know the food was fresh and not sitting out all day.  I would visit again for sure."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here when you need a quick bite to eat. Many salads to choose from and the soups are great as well."}
{"text":"Stopped many times. Always fresh salads. Many different combinations. Greeted when came in Thankyou when we left-nice. Many good soups.  Nice hot bar for pizza and such.  Always enough to eat \"healthy\". Manager checked to make sure everything ok and kept dishes cleared. Great place for quick lunch"}
{"text":"Very clean, very modern, very well organized.  I came here for the first time with my mom on a lunch date after receiving some coupons for $6.99 lunch via email.   Apparently I was so excited to just eat that I forgot to get a plate when I walked in. I went straight to the salad with my tray and when I was just about to place the pile of salad onto my plate, I realized I didn't have one! I almost dumped the salad onto my empty tray. I looked over to my left and saw my mom cracking up. That's how much I love Sweet Tomatoes.  Great salad and soup selection. I was very happy to see they had tomato soup when we went (my favorite).  The people at the salad bar are always fixing the tongs and making sure everything looks clean. The bussers are on top of their game as well, cleaning up plates the second they detect you are finished.   The dessert section is never really amazing, but come on, you're there for the soup and salad. If you really want a treat though, you should grab one of their chocolate chip cookie bags, soo tasty and freshly baked!  All in all, I love this location. I'll be back many more times!  *Tip: Sweet Tomatoes is ALWAYS sending out coupons via email. They're almost always for $6.99 lunch or $7.99 dinner, so sign up for Club Veg and start saving!"}
{"text":"A couple days ago, I came here for an early lunch with Donald. We had a coupon for $6.99 lunch that was good for up to four people. They open at 11am Mon-Sat and it was only 11:15am when we got inside. When we started going down the salad bar, I couldn't help but notice that everything looked like it was just uncovered from the night before. A lot of the salad was limp and majority of the toppings were almost empty. Considering they just opened 15 minutes before, it shouldn't have looked like that at all. In fact, one would think we would be getting the best of everything because it should all be newly stocked. That just wasn't the case here...  We looked at the menu online beforehand to make sure they had soups that we would like. The main reason why I wanted to go was for the Cream of Broccoli and Sweet Tomato Onion, so after eating some salad I went to load up on soup. I saw French Onion, chili, Cream of Broccoli, Turkey Noodle, Dill Potato, and Split pea. What was missing? The Sweet Tomato Onion!! Apparently they just don't follow their menu that's posted online because the Tomato Onion and Chicken Noodle were missing, but they had Dill Potato and French Onion, which weren't even on their online menu.  The only thing I really liked about my experience here the other day was that it was easy to find booth seating right next to the soup/pasta section because it was very early on a weekday, but that's not enough of a bonus to add another star."}
{"text":"We used to love coming here, but am leaving very angry today so, I'm not too sure that we will be visiting here again.  Every time we have ever been here, they have had clam chowder. It is one of those staple soups. Each month they do feature something new or different, but there are a few things that are always the same. We came today. Still actually sitting here. Got our salads, paid, sat, and checked out the soups. My hubby went up first and noticed that the chowder only had scraps left so he figured that they were heating up a batch to refill the container with. When I went up a few minutes later, the container was almost scraped empty and the sign labeling the item was still there. We ate our salads and some other soups, waited for half an hour, saw a few other people waiting for that soup too, noticed they replaced the container...only to have something totally different in it!  I asked what happened and was told that they only make it on Fridays!!! On the site it says that it is one of the soups today and have never been here when it wasn't. But, now it is only on Fridays?  And, if I wasn't already disappointed enough, it got replaced with something I couldn't even eat because of an allergy to cilantro.   The glorified busser in our section asked if everything was okay, told him no, he said he would have the manager come over. Been another 20 minutes and that guy hasn't come over yet.  There was one lady, not sure if she is assistant manager or supervisor was super friendly, apologetic and even tried to see if they had any in the back. She at least tried, the manager could learn a thing or two from her."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite restaurants but they've been slacking lately. I came in the other day and it was just chaos. Food stations were a mess, it was really loud inside and the experience wasn't at all enjoyable. I ate a salad and left because I just didn't want to be there. I hope this was only a one time thing and not the new norm.   The pictures I recently added were from 11/10/17."}
{"text":"This location is always nice and clean. Sometimes I expect buffets to be dirty with unruly children everywhere when I realize I'm being taken back to childhood memories of Homestyle Buffet. The only issue was that there were no tables available when we were trying to find a seat. Lots of tables with plates yet to be cleared but none ready for dining pleasure.   They have home made soups, a baked potato bar, home made breads, a pasta bar, and desserts. Always fresh and hot. They feature different items seasonally so keep an eye out. I just had the Avocado BLT salad and it was delicious. I'm sure it was not as fat free as I'm going to make myself believe.   If you sign up for emails on their website they send lots of offers. Also, try their cornbread with honey butter, it's so good."}
{"text":"Good buffet (AYCE) place for picky eaters. Healthy foods with alot of flavors. My kids always love it and their cold foods are perfect for summertime. Their lil chocolate chipper cookies and strawberry lemonade are worth the trip! For the most part almost everything is meatless (with the exception of some proteins in the soups, or bacon for the potatoes).   Even if the parking lot is full, I've never had to wait for a table, and the line moves fast.   Breakfast is served on Sundays, coupons are available through their email club (good deal), and usually weekly with your ads that are delivered in the mail (usually a family deal for $19.99 for 2 kids amd 2 adults). It runs about $8-10 for an adult buffet and then a drink is additional. Just get a regular size since refils are free at their beverage bar."}
{"text":"All you can eat greens.  Get your rabbit on here!  To put my review in context, I love Sweet Tomatoes.  So it wouldn't bother me if one food container is spilling or if the cabbage isn't the freshest.   I just wouldn't eat cabbage that day.  There are so many options (and 2 sides to the salad bar!).  Super delicious, healthy lunch for around $10."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and spent $11.96 for the buffet and a soda. The salad with the fresh vegetables  was good and the clam chowder soup was ok. The pasta wasn't the greatest and I didn't care too much for the bread or pizza. Overall this place is too pricey, especially for lunch. Sometimes you need to re-visit restaurants to remind yourself why you don't go there."}
{"text":"Depending on what you take you can have a positive exsperience. If you stay away from everything they cook or prepare you can do well. I stay away from their baked goods and prepared salads and anything they whip up.  I only took fresh vegetables and dressing and a soggy sweet potato.  Service was poor the day I was there. Maybe they were short staffed? Nobody cleared our plates or trays.  We ate here because this Sweet Tomatoes is located close to the Musical Instrument Museum and the MIM Cafe is way too expensive for family dining.  My nephews and nieces liked it and took many plates of food.  Sweet Tomatoes it is what it is."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of those store purchased cookies from my childhood called Almost Home Cookies. They were almost good but weren't. Sweet Tomatoes is Almost good but also isn't. I tried a variety of things and couldn't find one thing that was good to me except for the service.  I made myself a nice big salad with mostly nice produce but whatever dressings were in the salad mix tasted awful to me so my whole nice almost good salad didn't taste good.  I tried the Thai Cole Slaw and after a bite I was done with that. It was almost good made with nice fresh vegetables but lacked the taste I wanted.   I tried some sort of pasta salad with turkey and the seasoning just wasn't tasty. It was almost good but wasn't. The pasta was very squishy and turned to mush and the turkey had a strong turkey taste to it so it needed a good flavor to cover that up.  I tried a piece of grilled chicken, it was moist but was over seasoned with some sort of Italian concoction that tasted awful. Too much dry maybe old herbs. Seemed like it could have been good chicken but wasn't.  Tried a little square of pizza. Wow that was bad and not close to almost good. It's kind of like Wonder Bread with tasteless sauce and almost no cheese.  Tried a spoonful of Macaroni and cheese, it was maybe slightly better than the blue box stuff and seemed similar to that with maybe some added real cheese.   I thought the sweet potato plain might be good. It was a real potato but it was water logged and seemed like it was steamed with lots of water entering the potato making it a watery potato like baby food.  The soft serve was almost good. It tasted watered down but was thick. The metal bowls were nice that kept the ice cream cold.  Maybe the worst thing I tried was the sweet orange cranberry muffin. It wasn't sweet and had raisins in it instead of cranberries. It just was very unappetizing and was very bread like.  Almost good........ but wasn't.  Sorry to put it that way but that's the way the cookie crumbles.  1.5 stars"}
{"text":"I forgot how good this place was. It's a healthy buffet option if you are trying to keep your New Year's resolution. I came around noon with my aunt and it was packed. We waited a little bit to get a table but it was okay. You start at the beginning by grabbing a plate and pile on the salad items first. They have a couple different salad and a whole bunch of toppings to add. You pay for your buffet and drink and then side down. They also have water bottle for purchase if you want them. We sat down and demolished our salad and then made our way to the soups. I grabbed the chili with some of their pizza breads. They also have spaghetti and mac and cheese too. After you eat there is a little ice cream bar with some toppings too. This place is a nice way to fill your tummy before going shopping or to a movie."}
{"text":"This is a great concept place. It is basically an AYCE Salad bar, with a bunch of extras. Extras include pizza, soups, baked goods, a few simple pastas and some deserts.  For the most part it is vegetarian, which is great. I think you can find some bacon crumble here and there,  The selection is simple, not over the top fancy.So if you are in the mood for some good fresh ingredients this could be just the answer.  It is clearly an AWESOME place to bring the kids, the restaurant was full of happy smiling young faces!   And they have a fantastic outdoor area as well. I can't wait to sit outside on a warm summer night and get my salad on! I am getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Bright sunny Sunday, I had a date with 7 years old young lady and she picked her favorite restaurant...Sweet Tomatoes it is.  As soon as you walk in the door, you can just grab a tray and plate, and pile up your salad.  Their salad bar is bilateral with variety of freshly cut vegetables, pastas and dressings.  At the end of salad bar, you select your drink, pay and have a seat.  They also have corners for pizza, soups and dessert selection.  You can get as many as your hungry belly desire. Vegan options available as well as some gluten-free ones.  There are many friendly staff walking around cleaning your empty dishes, refill the bar and etc.  I have been a great date for my young friend and we had a fun time eating here.  Would I come back?  Maybe.  But if you need quick and inexpensive lunch or dinner, this might not be a bad option.  -2018 review #2-"}
{"text":"It's not truly 5 star in the fine dining experience way but its 5 star is for rethinking the Dennys/Friendlys experience and making it affordable , self serving and Health oriented.  You walk in to this huge display of salad, some pre made some you make yourself.  I thought this was it but then there was the soup and chili bar, the bakery and the pasta station.  Everything is brightly labeled with VEGETARIAN and LOW-FAT being prominent on the description.  The staff is super-friendly and helpful and there is no rush to get out though the place can often be quite busy."}
{"text":"We paid $32 for two people. The food wasn't all that great and it's definitely not worth $32. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan. It is similar to \"Fresh choice\" in California, but I like the variety and freshness of the dishes. The salad bar is the same, so I won't go into to much detail about that. We like to go on Sundays after church for lunch.  What I do like is there soup bar, 5 to 6 different types of soups are very delicious ranging from (chicken noodle, clam chowder, Irish potato lech, spicy chili bean, minestrone lentil),   Fresh baked goods are refreshed every hour. Corn bread, blueberry muffins, pizza, french rolls.  They have a stir fry section, which changes daily depending on breakfast lunch or dinner. I personally like the cheesy macaroni. They have Baked potatoes with all the fixing's.   The usual dessert par includes: fresh fruit, jello, pudding, chocolate/ vanilla soft server.  bonus; on occasion a server will come by with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.  One thing I noticed though, is even though this place is suppose to be healthy. All you can eat doesn't help from gorging myself."}
{"text":"Looooove this place . All their soups are hand crafted and unique , not to mention delicious ! Whenever I feel like I need a pick-me-up in the middle of a stressful week , I tell my boyfriend to bring me here so we can unwind in their cozy atmosphere for a great cost ! With their salad bar filled with endless combination choices , warm soups , and classic pasta styles .. it really brings me back to life; Everything else is definitely a plus !!"}
{"text":"Let me start off saying as a vegetarian it's really hard to fine really good fresh food .so when I fine a place we  return a lot throughout the week ,that said , We love coming here a lot as a family or with friends from out of town , I'm the only vegetarian in my family ,but this place had enough choices for everyone that is not ..clean healthy food this is why we come here like twice a week . We have notice certain things have change , first egg are no longer available, discontinued them , today blue cheese crumbles , no longer going to serve blue cheese crumbles is what the worker said ,and the ranch dressing wasn't  up to par. Tasted really bland, not sure what was up with this .the potato green bean salad , the potatoes were under cooked , they tasted raw.i do understand that price go up on things , (eggs-cheese) I wouldn't mind if my price for my meal would go up as well to maybe keep some of these things around . Not for me but for my Husbsnd ..  With all the soups they have for  vegetarians today, only 1 black bean , I understand it's saturday but really would have liked maybe 1 more choice .like I said we come here a lot , this is why still the 3 star not 5 , . Same great service , still clean, the food what we had was really good ..  Will be back on Tuesday and Thursday, still can't be away to long ..  Maybe today was just a off day .. Still willing to return"}
{"text":"So so good. (: great for lunch dates with your best friend! If you love soup and said this is the place to go! Just be careful not to go to soon before dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice in the last year. I have gone both times as a choice of the other party.  I have also been to the ST location on Flamingo/215 and that is the ST to visit.  This location in Henderson seems to always be frazzled, out of food, dirty tables and floors.  The salads are the big reason why I go and both times the salad bowls were almost empty or a bit wilted looking. Even the seating,carpet, and lighting seem to be out of date.  The employees are trying there hardest. I say corporate should think about modernizing this location."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but recently its quality has been going down while its price has gone up. Luckily, they still have coupons every week for lunch and dinner thru Club Veg.  My favorite part are the featured baked desserts, but when I went today the chocolate lava cake was lacking flavor and sugar. And normally I love fruit, but the fruit selection at Sweet Tomatoes is not as good as it used to be. Now it's just whole apples and one other fruit, often grapes. At least the salad bar is still decent, and the service is still good!  Tip: The premade salads are tasty but very heavy in dressing, so I like to mix in plain leaves to make them healthier."}
{"text":"The food was great, as always for sweet tomatoes. I had soup plantation in Southern California which seemed to be bigger and have slightly more variation, but nevertheless, sweet tomatoes satisfied my salad craving needs."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want a salad.   There are a few places you can grab a salad, including fast food restaurants, but how many offer unlimited salad, soup, pasta, breads, and dessert?  Not many.  Sweet Tomatoes is a salad buffet, with all the toppings and sides you can think of.  It's cheap, it's convenient, and it's not that bad.    I like their soups, especially the Asian Ginger Brother, which tastes like arroz caldo from home.  I love their cornbread (with real corn) and blueberry muffins. Those are great points to the place.  Now, for the bad.  The other day I stopped by with my friend to eat lunch, since our breakfast was somewhat greasy.  We grabbed a plate, piled it on, and when it came to the red onions, which were just replaced in front of my face, they reeked.  Now, don't get me wrong--I know onions have a scent, but imagine that scent times 100.  I figured that, since it was just replaced, it was fresh.  WRONG.  That evening I contracted a nasty heartburn episode tasting nothing but red onion and I felt nauseous.  Apparently when onions smell really strong, they actually fermented.  BAD.  If it's not fresh at the salad bar, what's the point?  Not my cup o' soup."}
{"text":"Great place, customer service is excellent, every Thursday or Friday I believe a near by school comes and all the kids come and has lunch which made it really busy children were runny everywhere and they weren't being monitored around the food I saw little fingers everywhere it was very overwelming the bus boys couldnt keep up with them."}
{"text":"Good salad options. It is definitely tough to mess up lettuce and veggies.  As for the rest of the selection, we must have just come on a bad night. The pasta was overcooked and mushy, not even close to al dente.  Fresh fruit selection consisted of only 3 fruits, not exactly a vast selection.  If you want a good salad, definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"My first vegetarian restaurant...it's ok but I don't feel healthier....lol! Caused a # on the stomach! It can become quite dirty and cluttered as the night goes along."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food. Great service really clean and organized. Tons or toppings and great soups."}
{"text":"Hello it's been a long time since I was there they changed it some new stuff and no More old like watermelon  puddings well still Found things to eat"}
{"text":"I was just simply unimpressed. Limited selection of food. Extra charge for anything at a buffet is always a turn-off. An extra $2.49 for chicken on a salad at a buffet is downright ridiculous!  On a good note, the chili was pretty good and the cornbread was also."}
{"text":"When not in LA I go to this one with my family.   They almost blew it by changing the place to Field Kitchen.  Glad they didn't!  Food is top notch.  Huge variety of healthy options and everything is fresh.  wait staff is awesome.   I love this place."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomato location is alright. There are less food than the Stephanie location. At least the food is good and the staff here are ok."}
{"text":"I was craving some of my Aunt Martha's homemade chicken noodle soup. Since Aunt Martha passed away 10 years ago the closest version that came to mind is one that Sweet Tomatoes used to make (I was unsure if it was still available following the failed Field Kitchen format experiment). It has the fat noodles, mild broth and huge chunks of chicken. Mmmmmmmm.  I arrived at Sweet Tomatoes right at 11am. Loaded up on salad (I love that they have pickled beets). They now offer the option of a protein source to top your salad for a couple of bucks extra. I skipped that since I was looking forward to the chicken noodle soup. Once I set my tray down, I made a beeline for the soup. There it was. The holy grail--Aunt Martha's chicken noodle soup! It was the same as I remembered. I wolfed down my soup and salad. I went back for a bowl of Irish potato-leek soup and some pizza bread. I skipped the pasta bar, baked potato bar and the desserts. I was sated and for just $7.99 (adult $8.99 lunch with a dollar off coupon).   The decor is a little more upscale than it was before the format changes. I am a little puzzled by some picture/wall hangings that resemble forest moss gone wild. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food tasted fresh. The noise level was bearable (last visit it was deafening). If you don't mind cafeteria style service and have a serious hankering for soup and salad, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I allow my husband to drag me here. The salad selections are in full force here. However nothing ever looks appetizing. You start thinking to yourself, if there is so much of a salad selection, there must be more items to select on the hot stations. Sadly, not true. 3 pasta, some flat breads and a chili bar. Selections don't seem to change much. Seems like the same old crap that was here the last time I was drug here. I get disappointed because there are not healthier selections here. Booths look like they all need a good wipe down and the carpet could use a good cleaning as well."}
{"text":"Well, it's a salad bar...what can you really say about a salad bar.  I was kinda hoping that they would have clam chowder in the soup section that day but they didn't :( I also can't believe how much more they charge you to throw some meat on your salad! How do they sleep at night??? And they also charge another (almost) $3 to add a drink to your meal...sweet Jesus!!! The salad is good though...I mean nothing special for the price but it works..."}
{"text":"It was good! We went when it was close to closing so we felt a little rushed but all in all good my husband only ate the salad bar area I ate from everywhere haha"}
{"text":"I think Sweet Tomatoes is an excellent Salad Bar Buffet.  They have a great selection of ore-made salsa as well as making your own with whatever dressing and garnishes you'd like.  Also, with the wide selection of soups, pizza, pasta and desserts, you can't go wrong with such a selection of good food for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Recommendation #1, sign up for their email club and you will get frequent discount coupons.  They have a good selection of salad greens and toppings and also an area with bread, soup, baked potato, and pastas. Everything is all you can eat so it's a good place to fill up on salad and veggies.  They have a couple rotating soups and rotating breads and desserts, most of which are delicious.  If you get a bunch of salad and veggies you can get out of here with a very healthy meal, or go nuts on everything and have a delicious feast.  The service is friendly and even when it is packed there are people coming around all the time to clear your empty plates."}
{"text":"Love the selection. They didn't used to have meats, they now have a small selection of meats. I know it's called Sweet Tomatoes, but hey, I'm an omnivore. Love the clam chowder. They have Hi-C at the self-serve drink station. My husband loves to get his Hi-C when he has a chance. They've expanded on Mexican food. For ice cream, they only have a choice of vanilla and chocolate. I'm giving it 3 stars on account that whoever the bonehead CEO is decided to raise the prices recently when it could have been kept more affordable."}
{"text":"I used to love this place because of the large salad bar. But, the plates, utensils, cups, and bowls were dirty with hardened food when I went. I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and this visit resulted in a severe allergic reaction. They had lobster bisque and I had a vegetable soup that was 2 down from it. My lip had gotten swollen and I was breaking out in hives while my throat was closing during dinner. I went back to check the bowls and they seemed unwashed/unsanitary. I'll never come here again after this. A \"healthy\" restaurant should be clean and orderly. Especially for how much they charge."}
{"text":"Me and the beau were in the mood for a salad bar this weekend so we stopped at this place. I was very surprised how fresh and clean everything wash. The service from our bus person was very good. The casahier was very friendly and explained the process to us. She even gave us a couple of coupons for our next visit. In addition to having a wide variety of salad \"fixins\", they had a large selection of soup, pasta dishes and desert. We had more than our fill and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. All you can eat soup and salad, I just love it!  Been to other locations in Portland Oregon and almost always happy but the staff at the Flamingo and Fort Apache LV Sweet Tomatoes are extra cool cats. Professional and very nice, smiling and quick to help if needed.   Great overall value, costs about $10 and you can eat like a champ. Sign up for clubveg and get emailed coupons. Tipping the staff helps if you come often. Discount for kids and family meals.  Kept very clean and tidy. Tables bussed fast, plates removed often, always sweeping and wiping down the counters. Bathrooms been good each time.  Plenty of parking even though it can get packed in here on weekends, maybe a 10 minute wait at worst if crazy busy. May be easier to exit out the back to avoid a needed u-turn.   I'll be back for sure! Maybe I'll see ya there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually end up coming to Sweet Tomatoes with my family after traveling to Phoenix and no one feels like cooking.  They have a decent buffet and it is reasonably priced.  Very fresh ingredients, and hot food as well like soups, pasta and pizza.  They also have a dessert bar and wide selection of beverages.  Sweet Tomatoes is more family-oriented and attracts thw Snow Bird crowd, but never seems to be overly hectic with kids running wild.  It's a good place to come for a quick, cheap and healthy dinner."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot, but then not long ago had a very poor experience.  That, coupled with their ever increasing, already ridiculously high prices has made us not return.  So, the last time we were there, for 2 adults with beverages and tax, it was around $30.  Really?   I can go to a much nicer place, get just as full, and have decent table service for less.  The salad is ok, though the selection in good.  The soups are average and the bread is mediocre at best.  So on the night in question, my wife and 2 kids and me went for dinner, which came to $48.  A short while after I started eating, I began to not feel well.  NOT (let me be clear) in any way related to the food, but because of other issues.  I was not able to eat, and had eaten less than half of the salad on my plate.  I asked a server if I could take the rest with me, as I was not feeling well.  She said she didn't know and walked away.  A moment later, a new person came to the tabel, who I assumed was a manager, though she did not introduce herself.  She told me that I could not take my food home with me unless I paid for a \"to-go\" meal.  I got a bit annoyed and told her that was not acceptable.  She disappeared and a few minutes later, the store manager came out.  He explained that I would be charged a separate to-go charge if I took my food with me, which was about the same price as the meal.  I told him that I had already paid for this particular food, I didn't want anything else, and only wantedto take what was on my plate and have it later.  He again stated that it was store policy to charge me a to go charge.  I said \"so, what you're telling me is that it is ok for you to take the plate and dump it in the trash, but I can't take MY food that I have alreay PAID FOR home and eat it later?\"  What BS is this? I was a bit upset, and we ended up leaving without my uneaten salad.  What really was the final straw, was the manager saying \"Thank you come again\" when I was leaving in a very snotty tone.  I filed a complaint with corporate, which remains ignored.  I will instead go to Souper Salad across the street and have better food and service, and my wife and I can eat for $15 for both of us."}
{"text":"Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out."}
{"text":"This morning i woke up feeling refreshed and excited to do some jeeping in our new wrangler... Omg.. 1130am stop for An early healthy lunch.  I had a salad plate and a half a bowl of chowder and two slices of focaccia bread and a tiny baked potato with sour cream, green onions, a few bacon bits. After eating and while still there... Waiting for hubby to finish .. I was stuck on the toilet sick and had to have him bring me home and I am still stuck up the toilet now at 7pm :( ... All I ate today was that meal at sweet tomatoes.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh and healthy food and the 8 homemade soups they have everyday such as Kettle Chili, Split Pea, Vegetable, their stellar Chicken Noodle along with the soups of the month are so well done and are the main reason we come for dinner  Given the recent scare on Romaine lettuce, I built a veggie salad and it was great, so may just give up lettuce altogether in the future.  We  Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Excellent salad bar and customer service as usual and the soups are stellar and keep up the great job and Thanks!"}
{"text":"Very robust salad bar with lots of healthy choices and the daily soup choices are wonderful and something you just can't create daily at home and a real treat!"}
{"text":"3 stars that can easily turn into 2 stars. Sweet Tomatoes is consistently inconsistent.  3 stars-  Price with coupon: $20 can feed 2 adults. All you can eat healthy salad that is fresh and has a good variety of veggies. They allow you to get a cold and hot drink cup. Comfy booth seating. They always have a vegetarian/vegan option.  2 stars- Plenty of unhealthy options to bulk up your calorie count to make you feel like you are eating healthy when you really have consumed more calories than a super size fast food hamburger combo.  Too many creamy soup options. More calories.  Pizza. I get it, it's for the kids. Kids literally running around without parental supervision... there are other diners in the restaurant... it is not your home... control your kids or maybe teach then some manners. To the parent of the kid that crashed into my elderly father while he was carrying his tray of food - shame on you. Take your kid to the park to play.    The staff is sometimes friendly, sometimes not. They do, however,  always clear your dishes away in a timely manner.  Good luck and stay away from the ranch, high calorie muffins and pizza if you are looking to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Great place with healthy foods and a nice variety. I'm dieting so the buffet style options being healthy and delicious was a treat. This is my first visit and I will surely come back."}
{"text":"Mostly good. Clean, good food, employees are ok. Price is ok. Its loud which is great because i can bring my toddler and not worry about people getting upset if he is noisy. I would give four stars except sometimes the hot food area could be fresher. Sometimes the soups and bread items are old and gross. The bathrooms could be cleaner."}
{"text":"The salad is good but they have made a lot of topping premium.  Seriously, since when did fruit become a premium item?  They are charging extra for canned and dried fruit.  I would understand fresh fruit.  Outside of the premium sides, the salad buffet has a lot of items that you can add to your salad without extra charge.  The kettle chili is really good.  I tried the shrimp bisque and was very disappointed.  I didn't enjoy the taste or texture.  My husband had the chicken noodle and was very happy with the big chunks of white chicken and noodles.   The fresh pasta is becoming more flavorful and moving away from being completely bland.  We tried the penne garden tomato with basil and it was very good.  The cherry apple crisp was ok.  This dessert was overly sweet since it appears they used canned apples."}
{"text":"I missed this place so much! ST locations shut down in Chicago. I was thrilled to see that they've still maintained the standard with their freshness, variety and customer service. A great place for vegetarians and vegans because they make special items for people's dietary needs. I still had to make my own salad because I'm not a fan of creamy salad dressings."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner so this location is more convenient to me. However, I prefer the older location off of Shea or even the Bell Road location on the West side. I wouldn't say this one is bad and I've had no experiences that would stop me from coming back. After all, I still love my salad buffets after working at one in my teens. Ha! Who doesn't love vegging after a workout on somewhat healthy food and frozen yogurt?!? I know I do. I give four stars for the lack of supply today and the mess last time. The last time I was here people spilled food on the counters when getting it, not that big of a deal. I understand cleanliness can be difficult to maintain at every moment with a busy restaurant. Today we were not happy with 4 of the items being empty in the salad area. The employee did stock immediately when I requested and the customer service has been good. Overall, nice spot to come for high protein bite at slightly over the cost of a Nitro Cold Brew at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Yummyness! What can I say? Sometimes I just want to eat a huge salad and veg out. Well this is the place to do so! I always make a huge salad packed with fresh spinach, edamame, tofu, and fresh veggies. By the time I get to the hot foods they have I'm pretty full but always save a bit of room. They have food for a variety of diets. Fresh food to boot and for the price you can't beat it. If you were to go out and get a salad jam packed with all the super foods you find here you'd pay quite a bit more! Also, look for coupons. They regularly send out lunch and dinner specials so you'll save $5-$10! This location is nice, clean and they made renovations to feel more earthy and zen. All of the locations are nice though :-)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes has always been one of my favorite places to eat. There's a nice variety of salads, soups, pastas, and at the end deserts. This place is very casual and good for the whole family. This past experience was horrible. The plates were dirty and so were the silverware and bowls. They had ran out of cups so they gave us paper ones. There was no where to sit because of how many dirty tables there were. No one was cleaning up. Then at the soup and pasta part there were no soup bowls and everything was super dirty. One lady who worked there was going to get cones and I didn't wait long enough for her so she said \"or not\" in a super loud voice. Lastly, there was no ice in the ice machine or toilet paper in the restrooms. Overall poor experience and the company has really gone down hill. Definitely not worth almost $15 a person."}
{"text":"Best way to get a fast and delicious lunch, i like going there when i am are in a hurry."}
{"text":"The salad buffet was exactly what I was looking and hoping for.  The cashier noticed my Yelp coupon and had it entered before I even asked.  Great service, great food.  Definitely on my go-to list when I'm near one."}
{"text":"Love the food, tons of variety to pick from the staff is always helpful. Clears dishes quickly."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It was my first time being here and it was a nice atmosphere and one of the managers Paul was very attentive and welcoming."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place!! Food is clean, fresh, and abundant!!!!! Staff is great and helpful. There is a wide variety of foods that I can choose from. I like most of their prepared salads that I can add raw spinach to. Yum!! And their gluten free muffins are always good. Come hungry and don't forget to leave a tip on the table for those who clean up after us!!      Michelle D in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I went here expecting another Sweet Tomatoes in the 'usual' layout that I'm familiar with all the other Sweet Tomatoes I've been to in the Valley.   What surprised me was the completely different layout and atmosphere of the place. There was the industrial/warehouse/loft vibe to the place that I really enjoyed.   There was the usual two-sided salad bar when you walked in. But once you paid you entered a large dining room with high metal ceilings and lots of wood. High backed booths along the walls gave a sense of privacy while you ate.   The beverage, soup, and dessert bars were all parallel with each other in a corner of the dining room and the bread and pasta bars were perpendicular to those.   Very airy and open dining area.   The food was good as always. Love Mondays because it's Cream of Mushroom soup night.....that's the reason I went. Love their Cream of Mushroom soup.(What can I say?) Also had a Pork Posole that was pretty darn impressive.   This month (April '09) they are highlighting lemon-flavored items. Had a pretty tasty summer lemon salad and some lemon muffins (better than they sound.)   And their frozen yogurt is always a treat to top off the meal.   If you're hungry....and not quite sure what you want....check out Sweet Tomatoes. They have plenty of options available and you should find something to interest your taste buds.   And one more thing. They are touting some new 'green' initiatives such as using recycled paper napkins, newer lighting, and going with 'tankless' hot water heaters....all in the name of the environment.   Anytime a business at least makes an effort to help the environment I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Crowded...jammed....packed...?  Must have been in the good ole days.  Went on a Saturday at 12:45 and the place was 25% full.  Well, maybe that because the corporate recipe chef left out spices, herbs, butter, flavor buds, real food, salt and pepper, etc.  In nother words - no flavor folks!  Gave em a 2 since they serve Coke instead of Pepsi.  The cookie gal walked right by us...that almost got them a 1, but I figured the cookies were probably bland, too."}
{"text":"In January the quality of the food got better from last year (2016) but every week they started adding high-carbs, high-calorie ingredients in the soups, deli salads, and salad dressings.  It's starting to become a lot like Golden Corral with too many unhealthy choices for obese individuals.  The salad bar without the dressings is the only safe and healthy choice. I've been coming every other week hopefully they will start making healthy choices, not yet. So many overweight people, is that why you raised the prices? OMG, I saw a man having a heart attack outside the restaurant after eating there."}
{"text":"This place is an all-you-can-eat, reasonably-priced salad bar (and more).  It'sclean, their salad ingredients are fresh and good-looking, and the seating is big and comfy.    For me, this place is just ok.  Their ingredients lack some variety, as do their pre-made salad options.  There's nothing exotic (like asparagus or avocado), but they do offer a little bit of everything - a few pre-mixed salads, a few pasta salads, several soup choices, a few pastas (our visit: mac n cheese, spaghetti w/tomato sauce, penne with garlic sauce and veggies), some pizza/bread/muffins and dessert.    They clearly mark their vegetarian items and they have soft serve at all times.  Their fancy dessert choice (chocolate lava cake) was pretty yummy, and their pizza and cheese bread were pretty good, too.  Nothing spectacular in my opinion, but the husband really likes it, so I'm sure I'll have more check-ins."}
{"text":"Made our way here after after a bad experience at another restaurant in this center. Food is always fresh with tasty salads. We even got greeted by the salad preparer and the cashier!  For three of us it was about $40. Not bad considering it's all you can eat and I live with good eaters.   The pizza was tasty and the lasagne not bad!  The corn bread is delicious too. I wanted soup but I was full.  My favorites are the desserts because I love soft serve ice cream. I concocted dessert from crushed Oreos, chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice cream. The best!   The place is clean with great service. It's family friendly and you get a variety of food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. All you can eat healthy spot. I love the Yankee Clam chowder, but it's only offered in Friday's. . The staff is friendly, fresh lettuce and pre made specials. Some where my kids and I enjoy eating!!"}
{"text":"Great salad bar. I was disappointed that they don't have the chicken and salmon additions to the salad any more. The soups were good and so was the bread. The pasta selection was very bland and unappetizing."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is pretty cool especially for vegetarians and vegans. The vegetarian choices are plenty. Vegans can do fewer things. But it's a healthier option for even meat eaters. Caution yourselves on the ingredients...everything is not clean or natural in the restaurant. There are some things (like the French catalina dressing) that contain suspect chemicals. Been to this location a couple of times and it's cool for the most part. They had some issues with clean dishes and lipstick on the glasses....had a much better experience the first visit. Management seemed a little lack luster this go around. I will still give it another whirl because the first time everything was great. I would recommend that they do a few more vegan options like making one of the pastas vegan as well. Good job for a fast casual type of chain. I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here.. I was overwhelmed walking in the door and seeing the different selections.  The salad bar was so good looking!  I finally decided on my salad and toppings. We get to the register and the young kids at the counter greeted us.   What I didn't like was the fact the boy at the counter gave me an attitude.  He was ringing us up and asked me if I wanted something to drink and I said \"no thank you\". So he asked me yet again because we went off track trying while ringing us up. I said \"No, we're good.\"   He replies, \"OKAY, I was JUST asking..\" I looked at his confused as I thought I was more than polite about it, my rply was \".. and I'm just saying.\" with this smile on my face.  The girl next to him started laughing and they finally finished ringing us in.  We said thanks and seated ourselves.  I didn't expect anything great but if you want cheap eats it's great. On Monday kid's eat free.. I won't be heading back anytime soon I'm still all little irradiated how I was treated but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt and he might of been new to the working and customer service world.  Hopefully the cashier doesn't suck the next time.  I really did want to LOVE this place like everyone else does."}
{"text":"1st time visit to Sweet Tomatoes.  Got a coupon in the mail and decided to check it out.  I didn't realize what a treat was in store!  I love a good salad but have lots of allergies so getting a salad off any sit-down restaurant is tough.  1ST: BUFFET of wonderly fresh greens, veggies, eggs, nuts.  About 8-10 dressings and lots of fat free choices.  I had this Greek lemon dressing that was delicious.    2nd: MORE BUFFET!! 7-8 soups, 6-8 types of bread, ramen soup station, 5-6 types of hot pasta, fresh fruit, pudding and soft serve ice cream with a goodie station.  My husband and I were very impressed and will be returning again.  CLEAN as it could be.  Not fancy but why would you need that with a plateful of yummy greens that you just have to attack"}
{"text":"I love this place. Our waiter has been with this company for a long time, everybody loves and recognizes him."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying WOW! I completely underestimated this place! I've been procrastinating coming to eat here for like ever! Only because just the thought of a salad bar sounds beyond boring! However after being talked into coming with one of my co workers for lunch I left extremely satisfied! They have an incredible good selection of salads and toppings to put on! And don't forget about the wide variety of soups to pair with those salads! I also found that the little breadsticks and or pizza things they had were good as well! Lastly the tiny little ice cream cones are adorable! Ha! I will most definitely return.."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome find for family and friends. Excellent selection of fresh salad ingredients and other dishes like soup, pasta, and surprises every day. Try the cornbread with softserve over it...better than any dessert around."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I really enjoyed it. The restaurant was nice and clean and had plenty of seating.   They had good customer service in this restaurant and I think it's a nice place to stop at for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sweet tomato fan but sorry to say your breakfast is very bland. It's not worth 9.99 at all. The breakfast wasn't even ready when we arrived at 8:10am. Then to charge an extra $3.99 for an egg scrambler.  Not worth it at all I'm sorry to say. I'll always come for lunch but never for breakfast again. Sorry."}
{"text":"Nothing was restocked. Bland and unseasond. I used to love coming to this location but I'll continue  to go out of my way to the flamingo location. You guys are slipping."}
{"text":"To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this place. The thought of it didn't really appeal to me...boy was I wrong! I think you have to be in the right mood for this place, but when you are it really hits the spot. I love the self serve salad bar. There are tons of different toppings for your salad...basically anything and everything. The hot foods stations are great also. I love how they have multiple selections of soups(chili is great topped with some green onions and cheese!) muffins, and also pizza like breads. There really is something here for everyone. I also really love how they have quite a bit of dessert to choose from. The ice cream station is fantastic and they even have different toppings besides the standard sprinkles, such as cookie dough bits and chocolate and caramel syrup. You won't leave this place hungry!"}
{"text":"As far as salad bar buffets go, I find Sweet Tomatoes to be well above average.  My pet peeve at salad bars is wilted or brown-edged greens.  I've eaten at this location many times and the produce has always been fresh-even in the salads that are already prepared.  I also love the soup selection.  There are 6 or 8 to choose from-some staples, some new ones each time.  I've found every soup to be pretty good.  If you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes, there is also pasta and pizza, potato bar which includes baked SWEET POTATOES-yum, a variety of breads, and dessert of course.  Sometimes they bring warm cookies to your table.  Table service suffers during busy times, but never too bad.  I think this is a great place to go when it's either too hot to cook, you're not in the mood to cook, or your husband has to eat immediately or he turns into a lunatic without warning."}
{"text":"I love me a good Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation and this location didn't disappoint. We were there on a busy Sunday afternoon and the place was packed, and I noticed the employees were doing a great job keeping things moving... from the cashiers to the hostess who led us to our table to the person cleaning up our section, everyone working there seemed to be hustling, which is nice to see. The food was the usual for a Souplantation, which is to say it's mostly what you expect: fresh and no-frills (salad bar, chicken noodle soup, baked potatoes, soft serve, etc.), but there are also some flashes of brilliance on the menu (the special couscous was excellent, as was the creamy mushroom soup). Bottom line, if you want to stick to your budget but still eat healthy (ok, and maybe sneak in some cheesy bread and soft serve at the end of your meal!), this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"It's salad,  how fattening can it be?   Don't be fooled you can't get out of here for less than 2000 calories!   Bit our fun getting there even if you have to run it off later.   Really good salad,  lots of good carbs.  Decor is nothing to write yelp about. Women like this place more than men I think"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes! The food is always fresh - after all the main attraction is the salad, but the pastas, soups, breads, fruit, ice cream, etc are always fresh and taste great, too.  Sometimes the place can get a little crowded (like lunch time), but servers are quick to bring your drinks, take away dirty dishes, and very helpful when I'm trying to balance a child in one arm and a tray of food in the other. :)"}
{"text":"Back to the sweet tomatoes we know and love, but the updated dishware and decor remain for a classier feel. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I dont usually write reviews positive or negative, but this place was awful. The salads looked fresh but tasted as though they had been sitting there for hours. There were very limited options, the soups were watered down and the pasta was so sticky, the sauce was grainy and you could clearly tell the only reason it is somewhat warm is the warmers. Couldn't even take more than one bite. Definitely not worth almost $30 for 2 people.  The only thing that was good were the drinks and possibly the dessert but we didn't even try because everything else was so awful. I wish I could give negative stars"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a single protein. It's just salad, bread, potato, pasta and soup with a lot of deserts. It's a fat kids dream. Chicken? Nope. Beef? Nope. Diabetes? Yep!"}
{"text":"Okay when it come to salad bars Sweet Tomatoes by far tops the competition such as Soup or Salad or your run of the mill salad bar. I usually go here with a buddy or two for lunch about once a week what's really nice is if you sign up for their news letter, they send out coupons usually twice a month so someone is always eating in our group for free or 50% off.   And what is really nice is they have different specials every month at this place so you are always able to try new things.   The vegetables seem fresher here,  and maybe they use more organic veggies because they seem to have more taste too then at other salad bars, and they definitely have more of a selection then most places, so if your not a green freak about veggies and stuff they have a good mix of soups, baked potatoes, pizza and other such dishes to choose from.  The staff is really good here and this place is very clean and everyone does a great job in making sure you are getting everything you need. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is the fact that I feel it is a bit pricey for a salad bar."}
{"text":"If you want a great salad come here... since you make your own you are responsible for the greatness of the salad. The fact they charge you extra for chicken is a bit chinsey.. I mean it's expensive enough. The soups and chili are good. The pasta is meh. This is once week for us at work since some of the guys are on diets.. hahaha not sure how salads help dieting, with the tons of caloric add ins they put in the salad."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of buggets, but this place was pretty good!  Lots of options and a ton of fresh veggies!  I like that there are indicators for vegan and gluten free foods too.  I was able to build a big salad with dark greens, spinach and every veggie I could want, plus garbanzo beans. =) I wish there was a bit more on the vegan side for the hot foods, but I went ahead and tried one of the coconut muffins... Yum!!  I would definitely return to Sweet Tomatoes as it is a place that anyone can eat to their heart's content."}
{"text":"Closed?  Someone tell the Sweet Tomatoes Marketing department.  I got the flyer in the mail today 12/31/14, and that location is still listed.  Sad...."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh salad and a nice variety of soups and other buffet foods.  I have eaten at this Restuarant before while in town on business.  This time around I confined myself to the salad bar.  Great selection of fresh ingredients, toppings, and salad dressings.  This place has two things going for it as far as I am concerned.  #1 - Fresh food #2 - Clean  If your looking for gourmet fare, look elsewhere.  But if you want a quick lunch of decent to good quality, this Sweet Tomatoes is a good pick.  Something tasty for every palate.  The price is right too!"}
{"text":"Soup plantation, sweet tomatoes, they are the same exact thing. For some reason, I found the sweet tomatoes much more savory than the soup plantations I have tried. If you love soups and if you love salads, this place you will love. If you want meat and lots of it, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love sweet tomatoes! The location on Bell in the Arrowhead shopping plaza is our go-to spot. This location is always clean, well-staffed, and the food is hot and tastes good.   Grab a tray and try one of the several choices of pre-made salads or make your own! There are tons of topping choices (they have raisins AND sunflower seeds which makes any salad better) and at least 6 different salad dressings. However,  this place is cafeteria style - you carry your tray and find an open seat- the amount of choices for soups, pastas, breads, drinks, and desserts is sure to make this worth your while. Seriously. Even the picky eaters will find something yummy.   Each table has an endless supply of napkins (definitely needed with our family - usually something we eat ends up on our shirts) and be sure to use the small card table to let the wait staff know if you're done with your meal or just going back for seconds, thirds, fourths...."}
{"text":"i went to this place and all they have is salad and beans.  i asked the manager, don't you have any protein like turkey, chicken ,ham, anything.  and she told me beans.. i said to her that doesn't do me any good because i'm on a low carb diet.  the average your going to spend in this place is about $10.00 a person.  for that price they should offer some kind of protein.. i would not go back here. totally dissatisfied..........."}
{"text":"Wow! We used to love this place, it has really slipped. I don't know if they are trying to offset the minimum wage increase or what. But all of the soups and salad dressings are watered down and the place is filthy! This was my view at lunch : appetizing, right?  The booths are broken, restroom is filthy, floors and baseboards are full of scum.   I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"For a soup/salad place it is fine.  Clean and friendly service.  Food was ok.  Nothing special.  Typical salad toppings.  Didn't see much fruit if any.  Soup choices ok. Some pastas.  Liked the pumpernickel bread.  Not much for dessert but I don't eat it anyway.  Price a little high but you can go back for more.  I'm not a buffet person at all but I'd go back."}
{"text":"The soup here is really good.  The chunky chicken noodle taste like homemade soups like mom used to make them.  All the years I've eaten soups at various restaurants and whole foods markets, I can't recall soup that taste so wholesome, fresh, and delicious as it is here at Sweet Tomatoes.  The house chili had similar effects as well.    This is strange because two years ago, my coworkers in Fort Lauderdale used to take me to the Sweet Tomatoes often and the soups there taste bland and boring, nothing special.  I guess the location really matters or something has changed in the last 2 years.  It looks like I will be going here often for the nice warming soups.  The blueberry muffins were out of this world.  Never tasted blueberry muffins like that.  Add a little vanilla ice cream and caramel topping and it was Da Bomb."}
{"text":"Like any successful chain restaurant, once you've got the formula down, you just do it over and over again. I like coming here because there's good variety and I feel like I'm eating kinda healthy. I know what to expect with the flavors and the quality and it's super easy when you have kids or just want a very casual dining experience.  I'd go to Sweet Tomatoes over any other buffet in Las Vegas. It's less than $9/person and I leave perfectly satisfied. I don't need no stinkin' carved meats or bad desserts from other buffets. Sweet Tomatoes keeps it simple, fresh, affordable and satisfying."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is super friendly. I come quite often, and so far there's only about one server(or busser?) that I'm not too find of. I had Hayden today and he was GREAT.  The best I've had so far. Peach cobbler ice cream is really good and so is he barbecue focaccia. They didn't have my favorite soup today but I'll be back for it:) and Hayden came by with fresh baked lemon cookies which were SO FREAKING GOOD. The manager is always nice and says hi and welcome back.  Never had a bad experience here wish they had more hot options, but the salad bar is the best out of any place.  I'll always keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give this place 5 stars because Sweet Tomatoes has turned me into a salad person.  I have always said 'I don't like salads.'  Sweet Tomatoes, heretofore known as ST, has turned me onto the green leafy goodness that is so versatile!  I'm a fan of ST's Wonton Chicken Salad (I think that's the one).  I don't know what it is about this fixed salad that makes me crave it for days--weeks even--after I've last eaten there.  I'm convinced it's the seasoning.   I experienced said deliciousness by accident:  the first time I was taken to eat at ST, the guy in line ahead of me filled his entire plate, and left enough of a serving for me (he seemed to feel bad to empty the entire bowl on the bar).  Observing his pillage, I tried what remained of the Wonton Chicken Salad and have been hooked since!  In hindsight, that dude knew exactly what he was doing!    To back up a moment, you walk into ST and immediately sanitize your hands.  At least you should as two sanitization stations are located on each end of the salad bar line.  Cleanliness is part of ST's company culture and it's not going to kill you.  You get a tray and proceed down the salad bar line.  There's the usual salad fixing fare plus the fancier stuff so don't stop at just my suggestion.  You can always go back for more.  ST offers the usual iced or hot teas, sodas and coffee, but definitely try the strawberry lemonade.  Just do it; don't question.  It pairs quite nicely with my fixed salad of choice.  Two adults can eat dinner there for about $26.00.  For a healthy buffet plus soup bar and bakery, plus drink refills, you're getting a pretty good price.    As you pay and exit the salad bar, you choose where you sit.  The atmosphere is warm and family-friendly.  The decor is soft colors:  oranges, reds and greens.  I feel cozy in there.  There are servers who--bless them--bring around chocolate chip cookies for each patron.  You can buy those same cookies pre-packaged for two bucks or less at 13 cookies, but if you think about it, you can make your own for that same price if you pick up the ingredients at Wal-Mart.  Still, it's awfully cozy having someone bring you chocolate chip cookies.    The soup bar is in the back near the bakery and ice cream station.  I love the tomato basil bisque but to my disappointment, that item is only served in the fall.  There are 10 or so other options so there's not a lot of room for disappointment.  Currently, ST is serving this chocolate lava cake which is shockingly not too sweet or overly filling because it's more of a muffin than cake.  I seriously doubt its sugar-free but I believe some of ST's options are more in line with a diabetic's diet.  No matter how full I am, I always squeeze in a blueberry muffin.  They're warm no matter what time I go and perfectly blueberry-sweetened.  In addition to the sweeter items, there are soft bread sticks, wheat biscuits, and other bread & bakery fare choices.  I can't imagine anyone being entirely disappointed with the offerings even though the menu varies a little day to day and season by season.  Nothing wrong with spicing things up a bit, in my opinion.    Leave a tip for the server if you're so inclined or deserving of it (i.e.picked up your empty plates and dishes and brought you cookies).  If time is an issue, you can also take out from ST and I believe they serve family style take-out as well.  ST is a great place to eat healthy, stay in budget, and feel good about what you've eaten without walking away feeling unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Over priced. Under seasoned. Soup tastes like it came out of a can. Pasta had no taste. The Mac and cheese was ok. My roll was like a hockey puck. Only giving 2 stars because the manager on duty was very hospitable."}
{"text":"Love the food, friendly staff! Ask for Carlos as your server and you will be well taken care of! :)"}
{"text":"I come here and I receive the best customer service EVERY time. I really love the choices of food there. Everything always tastes spectacular! I've never been to a restaurant with such friendly managers. This is definitely a restaurant worth trying out especially with their coupon program that goes by the name of \"Club Veg\" where they offer countless useful coupons!"}
{"text":"If you are like me and enjoy veggies you will enjoy this place. Great variety of salads, soups some desserts. Kid friendly I saw quite a few children enjoying a healthy meal and eating with a smile. While I was there I noticed they had added gluten free pasta check ahead to make sure the location you are going to have it. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I am not that big of a buffet guy so take that at what it is worth.  The food was pretty good, I wish there would have been more options but the staple Tomato soup with their version of cheese pizza was a very good compliment.  Aside from the tomato soup not really any of the other soups tickled my palate.  The salads were pretty good with a lot of options.  I think it is a little overpriced but I guess America is all about gluttony and they get their money's worth, I choose not to stuff myself completely... well not all the time."}
{"text":"Beautiful salad bar but this location has NO MEAT.....great for vegetarians but if I'm eating a salad for a meal then give me some protein.....PLEASE....first and last time here!!"}
{"text":"There has been a hefty Price Increase on the Dinner Prices! It went from $10.69 to $11.29!  Ususally when their prices go up, it's like .10 or .20 cents, but .60 cents! ....Whoa!  We always use the coupons that we get in the mail!  ...PLEASE bring back the red bell peppers!!!  :("}
{"text":"This place used to be great but you can clearly see something has changed.  The salad bar has gotten quite messy and of late the lettuces are usually almost empty. The employees all look miserable. No one greets you anymore, they don't say hi or  thank you and forget about a smile.  Two of the pastas at the pasta station were COMPLETELY EMPTY and the mac and cheese was 1/4 filled with dried out pasta and nothing was replaced the entire time we were there. Really? At $25.00 for 2 salads, I don't think so! No manager on the floor eiither. This has happened 3 out of our 4 last visits so we won't be back."}
{"text":"I am spoiled because I live by a souplation and they have clam chowder every day.  At this location it is served only on Fridays.  But the salads are the same and the food is just as good as the location by my house.  And they have cream of mushroom soup the first 7 days or so of every month.  YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is great, don't get me wrong... but I visited this place on Saturday at 2:30pm and there was a line about half as long as the salad bar counter!  We waited about 10 minutes to hit the register and then when we did and paid... I was asked if we wanted to sit out in the 100+ weather!  They had ran out of seats!   So we had to stand around for 10 minutes with our food on our trays until there was an open spot.  Compared to their Rainbow location in Las Vegas, this place is pretty small and that's too bad because their food is very good... Just didn't like the wait. It would've been nice to have been warned by the person at the front door before we started down the salad bar.  That was my only gripe, everything else was just as good as last time.  We also had a coupon that we've gotten from the mail and lunch for two with drinks were under $22 after tax.  I will still be coming to Sweet Tomatoes, their fresh tossed, won ton chicken happiness is to die for."}
{"text":"after another 2 weekends of somewhat gluttonous living, we had to come here to get our greens fix.   i just love this place. the greens and fixins are so fresh. and they try to update every now and then so that you have squash or beets or jicama.   the soups for the november selection were delicious and tasty, but mostly non-vegetarian. the pumpkin dessert for november was so delicious.   of course we'll be back. but they do keep raising the prices...not long ago, it was only 7.99., then 9.99, now 10.99. one funny caveat, if you don't like kids or old people, then stay away. it's full of em."}
{"text":"Good spot if you are craving salads! Wish they had more low fat protein options though"}
{"text":"I had an Amazing dinner. Food was great, low price, staff is very friendly . They have fresh food, and verity of drinks."}
{"text":"I don't have a general complain aside from the fact that there are often dirty tables. The staff is always friendly and the food is satisfying."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes is a treat! All you can eat: soup, salad, muffins, pasta, pizza, ice cream, and more... This is a fun place for family and friends to eat a large, fast, easy, healthy meal. Approximate Lunch Prices: adults = $8.29 / 6-12 = $4.69 / 3-5 = $2.19 / 2 and under = free  Drinks cost extra...but are--all you can drink.  There is not a lot of meat here. You pay extra for chicken to add to your salad. There is some meat in the soups.   This is not gourmet.  It is good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today..ate a few salads. Not only did I get food poisoning but so did the people I went with. Not good."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite spots in Henderson. Sweet Tomatoes and Souplantation are both owned by Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp. They seem to have the same exact layout and menu.   If you check in on yelp, there is 15% off. This is actually a better deal than the military discount, which is only 10%.   The pastas here are somewhat bland except for Mike's Nacho Pasta. The soups are decently good, but the clam chowder is always my favorite. There is always more than enough toppings to satisfy my salad cravings."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, delicious and reasonably priced! Hard to go wrong with this restaurant and hard pressed to not find something to your liking. Soups are the bomb . . . homemade and authentic. We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"I am writing a review on Sweet Tomatoes' former glory. When I first came to this buffet, I was enthralled. I loved the salad variety, loved the strawberry lemonade, loved the pasta options, and loved the clam chowder. The quality was great and so was the service. Lately, however, the quality of the food has diminished. The salad leafs are not as fresh and crisp. The pasta is getting progressively watery. Sweet Tomatoes has much more business and the last time I went to Sweet Tomatoes was the first time I actually had to wait to be seated.   I still love the strawberry lemonade and I will still come back to Sweet Tomatoes despite the quality drop and the price increase."}
{"text":"I love coming to sweet tomatoes but it was slow when it came to the staff clearing our tables"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal! The strawberry lemonade and creamy cauliflower soup were great. Its exactly like a Fresh Choice for anyone from Northern CA."}
{"text":"This place is great and has lots of choices! It would be even better if you can eat $12 worth plus $2.50 for a beverage. It's a great deal if you know someone who can eat $12 worth of soup and salad. Since when, did buffet style eating get more expensive then going to a normal restaurant?? Also it costs at least $6 for my 9 year old. :-( the food is good and fresh and the device is always great!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but after this past week, it may be awhile before my husband and I return.  Once again, only 2 pre-made salads to choose from--same old Caesar and a Greek salad that were soggy and not impressive.   There was only one appetizing soup to select--broccoli and cheese--the others did nothing for us.  Our \"two for $20 coupon without beverages\" was a joke.  Our total still came to close to $28 once we added fountain drinks and coffees!!  And really, are we to bring bottled water from home?  Who goes to eat without a beverage with their meal?   The coconut muffins and chocolate chip bars for dessert were good--but we got two cups of coffee that were both cold!!!  I don't know if they changed management but quality has gone downhill while prices have gone up.   With all the dinner options in the area with a variety of restaurants, they are no longer standing out as value for our money.   Not to say we will never go back, but cant get excited about this place anymore--disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I like the new look but hate the confusing new set up. It's all, \"I'm a buffet, but nope no I'm not!\"  Ordered the 1/4 white chicken with mashed potatoes & bacon & onion Mac & cheese. Comes with complimentary bread. Chicken was good and moist. Mashed potatoes have no taste and Mac & cheese is dry without the slightest taste of cheese! Tried the cornbread which is so dry it literally leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. The focaccia bread is on the oily side and the batch we got was way overloaded with rosemary. Also got the fettuccine pomodoro which is cooked fresh to order and wasn't bad but definitely nothing I'd order again. I like the new look but definitely not the new food."}
{"text":"Food was great, not the freshest during peak dinner hours however. My husband and I aren't willing to go again but we didn't hate it either."}
{"text":"Extremely clean atmosphere.  For the money (9 bucks) you can eat unlimited salads, soups, pizzas, ice creams, etc.  Great buffet and extremely fresh.  Food was great!  Hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Being from California, I quickly recognized that Sweet Tomatoes is Souplantation renamed.  The service, food, and prices are all outstanding!"}
{"text":"DONT EVER CHANGE AGAIN!!! Dear lord Sweet Tomatoes.. I am here to protest my undying love for you and your delicious veggies. We went to you weekly before you turned into the \"Field Kitchen\" (we call those the dark days). Now that you are back to your old self, we are ever so gratefull! We hated traveling to phoenix just to get our veggies on. Thank you for returning and updating your salad bar. I am in love with your cherry tomatoes and red peppers. Also nice to have the meat skewers and avacado!!! Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"Warning: I'm not a buffet person, nor will I ever be. The concept of unlimited food disturbs me so read on with caution...    Kind of a scary place but if you want a salad and lots of it, I guess its a good choice. I love the name 'Sweet Tomatoes' which is why I came here in the first place but there really isn't much sweet about watching a slue of morbidly obese children return to the ice cream machine 5 times for refills."}
{"text":"I've heard several Sweet Tomatoes have changed their format to be more a la cart. I am not remotely interested in the new format. I'm giving this Sweet Tomatoes 5 stars because they're the traditional all you can eat soup, salad, potatoes, pasta, flat breads, muffins and ice cream deal. They really are an example of Sweet Tomatoes' best format!  The chili, chicken noodle and ginger soups are my favorite.  The muffins and flat breads are yummy.  I like to put the soft serve on a chocolate muffin with caramel topping and chopped nuts but when they have the healthier, fat-free chocolate mouse, it's so delish, I will actually get that instead!  The prize for the buffet is very reasonable. (Drinks are like $3 though!)"}
{"text":"This is basically a mid point salad bar that does have a lot of choices but nothing that is upper end like chicken or salmon. After the long salad bar set up like s buffet, they also have a large assortment of soups, all about average. The other food items are also nothing to get excited about. Very limited desert selection. Cost for everything is $10 plus tax and tip. Soft drinks are $2.50.  All in all, not that good and not that cheap. You are better off going to a place like Jason's."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! It is always clean and everyone is always friendly. The selections never disappoint. My twins love it and the mac and cheese and pizza!"}
{"text":"Blah. Since they raised their prices I do not go to Sweet Tomatos anymore. You now have to pay $2.50 for a drink plus the $10 for the meal. Its a rip off. The salads are good but anything else is nothing special."}
{"text":"Good variety of food and was very flavorful. Staff at the front register was unfriendly but the employee taking our plates away was nice."}
{"text":"This sweet tomatoes is pretty average, the salad bar is pretty clean and lots of veggies. Same food and soups. The people are friendly and kind, the glassware is clean. I wouldn't mind bigger glasses so you don't have to make so many trips for drinks. For the price I think they could spring for some meat on the menu. But that's all of them. This one could use some updating and elbow grease.definatly new decor , it's awful."}
{"text":"This place was so good, I ate 3 bowls of soup, 2 salads, a baked potato and pasta! It was all so delicious. My favorite soup is the mushroom, but it's not always there. The chili is on point also, especially if you get it with corn bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the place you go to indulge and leave with no regrets.  I mean really, for just a little under $10, you are thrown into an all you can eat salad, soup and starch bar!  Not to mention, its damn good!  You have your \"Classic items\" which are always going to be served... and then every month they have specials.  I noticed that with the specials, they like to theme them accoding to seasons. It's a great concept, it keeps you anticipating new items each month! My personal favorite is the summer specials! They like to incorporate a lot of fruit.  I especially love their strawberry butter and strawberry muffins. mmm! Their classic Chicken noodle soup and Chicken Thai Salad are also very good!  Its a fun place to bring your family and friends!"}
{"text":"So many healthy menu options. Great place for a family or just as a couple. Very clean and plenty of options."}
{"text":"When I want to gorge myself on salad, breads, and pizza, this is where I go. Delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and opted for Sweet Tomatoes because it was one of the healthier options in the area. The staff was friendly and had someone walking around with free cookies. The soft serve machine was broken, as it was when I was here six months ago, but they did have an employee scooping ice cream the good old fashioned way. Lunch for two with a beverage was north of twenty-five bucks , which seems to me to be more than it was last time. It was crowded and there were a few kids serving themselves who were much shorter than the sneeze guard. Gesundheit!! All in all, it was an average experience."}
{"text":"Well what else can you say about sweet tomatoes.....good food.....good service....clean establishment.....affordable prices.....especially for big families.....and they have added some great new items to their menu. So get on over there an enjoy healthy food at a not so healthy price....if you know what I mean....LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"OK. So it's exactly like Souplantation but it's called something different. Luckily and most importantly, you can use your Souplantation coupons here too. I had the 9.59 dinner coupon so the meal for two of us was around $21. So it's exactly the same as Souplantation with the salad first and then you have your bakery and soup stations. I must say though that the food tasted better. The salad was pretty decent but I think the biggest difference came from the soup and the pasta. The soup was very unique because of the holiday season but the staples like the Chicken Noodle Soup tasted better. I also enjoyed the unique soups like the posole. As for the pasta, I remember the days when Souplantation used to make your pasta to order but now that those days are over, it is good to see them actually cook the pasta dishes. I loved the mac and cheese with the overload of cheese flavor! It's more like a cheese soup with macaroni but I'm not complaining about that. Might be in my head but I honestly felt the food tasted better and the place was more organized. Also, there was not wait so we got to seat ourselves and not the deal with the crowds.  A general tip with Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes, remember to look at all your \"clean\" plates and bowls. I don't blame them with all the turnover but just check to see they are actually clean. Most of the time, I have to pick and choose the bowls I use to get soup. :\"}
{"text":"We used to come here when I was a kid-so recently on a visit to AZ we tried it out again. Not bad-it was weird that there was a special \"only if you pay extra\" section of the salad bar that had the good stuff like chicken and artichoke hearts for a few extra bucks, but it ended up not mattering because we went for the 2 meals for 20 dollars route. It was fine-and the Greek Lemon soup was actually good. We were there right before it closed and a person working there gave us each a bag of chocolate chip cookies for free at the end of the night. That was nice."}
{"text":"Quality and cleanliness has always been good at this location. They offer a large salad bar with  with a couple pre-made pasta salads and toppings before you pay.  After payment has been made, you pour your own beverage and pick a table. On busier days, they do have someone that helps you find a table as this location gets crowed at peak hours of the day.   Once seated you are directed to the hot food: soups, chili, muffins, pizza and a few hot pasta dishes.  This is an all you can eat so help yourself to seconds. Plates will be bused from your table."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Pro's - many soup options and all consistently goog - salad options good as well - staff have been there over time, friendly  Con's - would like red bell pepper from time to time - cookies on desert bar would be great  Good place.  Get on their eMail list and get weekly coupons"}
{"text":"Out of all the different locations of buffets like Sweet Tomatoes, Souper Salad, and Cici's, this is my favorite.  The food here is always fresh and tasty, while others can have a general theme of bland. I mean, we all know buffets are the best because when you don't know what you want, they have everything (salad with every topping imaginable, six different soups, pizza, pasta, mac and cheese, ica cream, and much more).  At about $10 for the food and $2 for a drink, the price is a little more than I would hope for. But as I said before, they have EVERYTHING and you can literally get as much of it as you would like.   While I usually hit up Sweet Tomatoes for a large amount of decent food, I imagine it would laso be great for students with home work (I don't think there's a time limit or anything) or friends/family with children."}
{"text":"Just got done with this great buffet, and I was satisfied. This buffet is so cheap and their selection is great. I really enjoy all the soups you can choose such as chunky chicken noodle, cream of mushroom, and a lot more. I honestly will come here again anytime, this is a favorite."}
{"text":"For a buffet the food was not too shabby. I would give the food 6/10. I came in with 3 other roomies around 1 PM for lunch and paid about 13 including a drink. It was pretty slow around that time and service was actually above average. I never go into buffets expecting good service but I was pretty surprised. Julia was the name of the girl who was tending our table. She made our stay a lot more fun and enjoyable.  Overall not a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get. The soups were very mediocre and the chili hardly had any evidence of meat??? The breads were good. The salad bar lacked protien and the chicken they sell you for $1.25 for 2 oz  is a joke. Supposed you want the chicken warm? The ones they sell you is in a plastic container and chills on ice. If you are really into healthy eating, chipolte is better or any of the other mexican types like that.  This palce has more non nutritious items than nutritious ones. Chances are I will never eat here again. It was my first time and I was disappointed.   Salad bar plus drink was almost $12 with tax. WASTE of MONEY."}
{"text":"I really like Sweet Tomatoes. It is a great place for a casual lunch with friends or family. It is a little loud during peak hours and often has a lot of kids so I wouldn't recommend it for intimate conversation.   The selection for their salad bar is huge. It is clean and you are always able to see staff cleaning and refreshing the items. For the hot food station, the selection is also pretty good. They have pizza, soups, muffins, etc.   I have only been here for lunch. I have never tried their dinner."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty! Their food is never frozen and has no preservatives, they have a huge salad bar with a lot of different toppings, like 5 soups everyday that're made from scratch, and an awesome bakery that dishes out healthy pizza (like pizza breads).  They are worth it if you're wanting something healthy and tasty as well."}
{"text":"HAIR IN THE MACARONI AND CHEESE!!!   I came here with a friend for lunch and walked in and the restaurant was dirty. We walked through the salad bar and the spinach and lettuce were old. The restaurant floors were dirty along with multiple tables not being cleaned. Once I visited the buffet area, the plates were dirty. I waited for the fresh batch of mac n cheese just to find a black hair mixed in with it. Which would make sense because no one wears hair nets in the kitchen. The ones handling the food are in management. Which you would think, they would know better. I immediately stopped eating. I informed someone of the hair, and they made a new batch and offered to get us a new plate. NO!!! I don't want a new plate. I wanted to get the hell out of there. I informed management that they should start enforcing hair nets. Needless to say, I left hungry and will not be returning to any Sweet tomato ever again."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Sweet Tomatoes since I first visited this location briefly after they opened back in high school! I must say, for the most part it has been consistently good. First off the staff is always very nice, quick to pick up trays, honor expired coupons. We once accidentally brought in a coupon that had expired four years prior and they still took it haha. Also one time a bug was in my sisters salad (must have just flown into the buffet!), and they apologized by giving us a free meal there plus cookies to go! Being a vegetarian, I love places like this, especially appreciate that they specifically label if a certain item is vegetarian or not. I always start off by building my own salad, there is a lot of variety, which is nice. Last week when I was there they also had this quinoa mix with corn and feta and stuff and it was delicious. Next I usually look at soups. This is one of my complaints, I have never been too impressed by their soups. They are good, but just not as good as I ever anticipate! My number one favorite thing to get here is the pizza foccacia. I eat so much of it, it is ridiculous. They always have vegetarian pasta dishes too which is nice. Another thing I have to get every time I go there is the macaroni and cheese. It is very good, not too rich! Next to the pizza foccacia, the best part is the dessert! I LOVE ice cream/froyo so it is awesome they have that available plus some simple toppings. It is the best when they have the chocolate lava cake in the dessert area too, YUM!"}
{"text":"Last Sweet Tomatoes I went to was the one in IL about 2-3 years ago. This location in Peoria was renovated and clean. Friendly and hard working staff. All the food was delicious. I was very pleased with my lunch here"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here... Well not for just under 10$ a person!   Salad bar, decently extensive... Pre mixed salads did look a little soggy.   Soups, decent as well.   Hot options, really not bad, Mac n cheese was good and the focaccia was a definite surprise (had 3 pieces myself).   Desert, decent. The place is clean, service was friendly... For just under 10$ a person you really can't go wrong here people!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to eat here!!!!  Their salad bar is always fresh, stocked with everything you could ever want for a super good salad. They also have premade type salads like potatoe salad, which change monthly. Soup!!!! I love soup and they have mulitple ones to choose from. The regulars are chicken noodle & a chilli. Each month they have 4 or 5 other soups to choose from. You can get on there website to see what they are serving. They also have bread sticks, baked potatoe, and other side type dishes. They also have cookiesand frozen yogurat. It is all you can eat so be careful.  The staff has always been friendly and the place is clean. To save some money join their club and monthly they will send you buy one get one coupons, coupons for lunch & breakfast.  The only thing I did  not really care for is there breakfast. The food tastes fine, it's just not what I am looking for when I go out for breakfast, but you might, so give breakfast a try. I believe they only serve breakfast on Sat.& Sun."}
{"text":"First time in and we were a little confused, but the manager, Mike, was very helpful and friendly! I always have very low expectations for buffets but they were definitely exceeded this time! The food was very good! The selections are decent for lunch, it's a little pricey but when compared for quality it is really not that bad.  I think we will definitely come back someday! AND, they have soft serve! Yay!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I love being able to make my own salad exactly how I like it. There is dThis is one of my favorite places to eat. I love being able to make my own salad exactly how I like it. There is definitely a lot of choices. The ingredients seem to be pretty fresh. I really like the Honey Mustard dressing and croutons. They standout. They have 4 different cheeses, which is awesome. (Regular shredded cheddar, blue cheese, feta, and another kind that I'm not sure what it is,  My favorite things are the chicken noodle soup. When I don't feel good I crave this stuff. (add fresh ground pepper) In November they have a delicious stuffing soup. It's soo good I can't get enough of it.. Mac and cheese (add grated cheese and fresh ground pepper) I don't eat pork, but my friends adds bacon to hers. I've also tried peas.   Baked potato.. Put it in a bowl, open it up and put cheese in it asap, so that it starts to melt.   I also like to get cauliflower and broccoli and dip it into Thousand Island dressing. Reminds me of my childhood.   Chocolate muffins are usually pretty good.   The best part is often during your meal someone will come around with freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Eat them while they are hot, so much better.   Sign up for the rewards program, they sound out a fair amount of coupons.    Pro tip: Get two plates; 1 for salad and 1 for other stuff. efinitely a lot of choices.    Staff is usually friendly and patient."}
{"text":"Over the past 12 to 18 months our favorite Sweet Tomatoes has slipped. The food is now bland and industrial tasting, like food at an assisted living center. And the service is just as nonexistent as the flavor.  I'm done. Time to find somewhere else to eat because I'm not paying $12 a head for slimy salad, bland soup, and DILLIGAF service..."}
{"text":"i'm a salad bar junkie, so come here any chance i get. i love all of the different toppings, and things are always fresh.  they also change out their soup selection pretty regularly, but keep the solid standbys.    the to-go option is not bad, either.  they give you plenty of containers to get soup, salad, and anything else you need.  lastly, if you join club veg and provide your email address, you get a 2 for 1 coupon nearly every month, which makes this place that much better!"}
{"text":"Staff is always very friendly and food is tasty.  Great for people who are health conscious.  The strawberry lemonade is excellent!  Cornbread muffins are tasty as well."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch. It's all you can eat healthy food. They have a nice salad bar with plenty of options. They always have 6 or so soup options and plenty of bread options. If you want a nice simple easy place to grab a lunch. This is the spot.   I go about 2-3 times a month now because I get tired of the burger and fry routine. I signed up for the souplplantation membership- it's free! And I get a discount every time I come. I mean for real. Who doesn't like saving money on food now a days. Right!  P.s. you get a free meal on your birthday :)"}
{"text":"Today I was fairly unimpressed with Sweet Tomatoes. I just recently went for my first time.  I walk in 11:45am Sunday and the salad bar was not stock what that with lunch starting.  The food was not that good, but it also seemed pretty basic. The salads, soups and desserts were far less than the outstanding dishes I thought they would be. The whole place seem dirty with many table not clean off for new customers. The staff was friendly but did not seem energize to keep the food stock and with cleaning the food areas. I will not be back even if the food was for \"free\""}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! The food was cold the time I went, except the pizza was room temperature, and nobody ever really helped us out. Prices are highway robbery and for that price, go to the buffet at the Wynn or even a station casino buffet! Very unsatisfied with this place and hopefully NEVER going back!"}
{"text":"Oh Sweet Tomatoes how I USED to love you... Seems like this location has gone way down hill. Went for dinner with my hubby on a Thursday night at 445pm to try and beat the crowd. So many veggie bins on the salad line were empty or looked less than appetizing since someone would spill other stuff into another bin. Yuck. There were tons of kids running amuck thru the line as well putting their hands on everything. One kid had an entire plate full of just boiled egg crumbles and was running up and down the line with no parents in sight. Where are the parents or management/staff to control this kind of stuff? Putting hands on everything is so unsanitary, which is why I usually stray from buffets... When paying, I was shocked at the prices now. I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in about a year or so, but $28 for 2 dinners and 2 drinks at a salad bar seems way ridiculous. Another $10 or less and I could have gone to Outback and we could had some steak with our salad! After seating we went to get drinks and I was so disappointed that their tea was empty and they dont have apple juice anymore since I am not a big soda drinker. We then ventured to get some bread and soup to go with our salad. Almost all of the soups had that crusty layer on top from sitting so long. There was no butter for potatoes or bread. The foccacia and pizza bread was just the crusty outter layer that no one ever seems to take. The pastas were crusty and dry looking. So much for my appetite. After eating our salad and little bread/muffins that weren't old looking we went in for some of their gooey chocolate cake. Again only the outside rim of it was left and it was rock hard. The guy behind the counter said it would be a while before a new one was out. He just stared at the kid who was digging around the cake and using his finger to scrape the cake off the self serve spoon. Gross. We then just settled for a dry brownie muffin and ice cream. We never did take anything from the fruit/pudding bar since that was covered in kids as well and all the bins were almost empty.  Knowing that I am pregnant and hormones are raging, I decided not to complain since it would probably turn out ugly with me either screaming or in tears. Just left hungry and disgusted. I will not be back to this location. Too bad the express location is closed now since I did frequent it all the time. Guess I will head back to the 215/Flamingo location with higher hopes. That one always seemed to hit the mark."}
{"text":"I love a good salad bar and this is it. While some complain that they would prefer a buffet, not me. I like the fresh salads over dry food sitting under heat lamps all-day. I do wish there were more protein choices but this would make the price go up. I enjoy the fresh tea and lemonade choices.   What I do not like however is the dirty dishes that a few have already mentioned. Yes,  it will take time to go through all the cutlery and dishes before they are put out but this beats having the health department get involved. Get. It together."}
{"text":"Decent.    No complaints.  No eggs still. But hopefully they will figure it out soon.   Can't give sweet tomatoes 5 stars but it's not bad for a salad bar."}
{"text":"I come I this location a lot. I like that it's so close, but I hate that it gets so crowded on the weekend. Can't complain about that though since it is in a prime location. They always keep the salad bar nice and clean! The bus staff is always on top of cleaning stuff off of the tables,sometimes they even refill your drink. My only complaint is that it's so expensive! $27 for 2 people for dinner with drinks and that's with 15% off! That won't keep us away though."}
{"text":"I visit the city of Henderson at least twice a month for business, and every time I do I always make sure I stop by sweet tomatoes on Stephanie st. The staff is always so pleasant and eager to make sure my visit is exceptional. This particular location always seems to be \"on point\" with customer service, cleanliness, fresh food and great atmosphere. If you are ever in the city of Henderson Nevada, make sure to stop by this establishment if you are in the mood for great service and healthy, fresh food! You don't find that combination a lot these days!"}
{"text":"I think their prices increased a bit since the last time I've been here - probably because they've renovated and the quality of their food has gone up. They have posole now! This location is much cleaner looking and they have better choices as far as salads and soups :) The holiday/seasonal dishes are yummy. I really enjoyed the curry lobster bisque."}
{"text":"There are days when I'm the pickiest eater, and others when ANYTHING sounds good.  But, Sweet Tomatoes is always a good idea. Endless soup, salad, bread, and little selections of pasta... MM..  I have to admit, when I heard \"Soup & Salad Buffet\" i was like, uh... wtf? BUT, i was wrong. Little did i know i'd end up loving this place.   I appreciate the fact that they have different flavors every month, so it's not the same ol' same ol'. Also, i get tired of tastes quickly, so I like that I can get a small plate or bowl and go get something different.   OH and btw, they are CHEAP! For only $7-$8 a person, i have to say, that's the best priced buffet to fill up on!   And whenever my BF & i eat there, I always hope that they bring out cookies... because I loooooove cookies and they have some of the best!"}
{"text":"I recently chose to dine at Sweet Tomatoes for the first time in over a year because I changed to a plant based diet in June 2014 and was craving salad. So armed with a great coupon I dove in and enjoyed their all you can eat fare. There are signs to advise which options are Vegan so I could stick with my plan. It's funny when I was eating meat in the past I felt like there were not enough meat options available here now I was like hmmm there should be more vegan dressings, soups and breads. The Strawberry lemonade is always delicious so don't miss out on it. And for the price for a meal and a drink using a coupon it is pretty great so I will definitely add this location to my playlist again."}
{"text":"Apple cobbler a la mode , deliciousnessss.  It's always yummy to come here and binge on salads per your liking. Everything is fresh and everything is also warm.  The staff is polite and welcoming."}
{"text":"I usually decide to go to sweet tomatoes for a salad at first. However, I find myself eating their soup more than a salad.. I just wish they serve clam chowder more often which is my favorite. Their service is not bad."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat if your going for healthy great salad bar and soup bar"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes ! Great place to eat, fresh food, salads, great variety and vegan friendly.  Service is good and it's serve yourself.  The best thing recently is they brought back the colored Sprinkles for their soft serve ice cream ... OMG thank you #sweetTomatoes !!!  You guys are the best !"}
{"text":"Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite chain restaurants, and there are none in Virginia so I'm excited that there are three locations in Las Vegas! Decided to check out one of the Sweet Tomatoes while I was in Las Vegas looking for housing.  This location is one of the smaller ones I've been to, but still has all the expected foods. It is a simple square dining area, with high ceilings, and is bright and clean. The salad bar was organized a bit differently than I am used to; it was a more condensed layout with small square bins in a three-rowed grid, instead of the linear, one or two-level bins at other locations. The drink cups (both beverage and water cups) were also laid out for you to take on your own instead of being behind the counter.   As for the hot food area, it was also a bit smaller than I was used to, with fewer muffin selections but the standard variety of breads, pasta, and soups. It's \"May Flavor Fiesta\" month, so I noticed that there was horchata as a beverage option and even horchata muffins! I was pretty excited about those.  I did notice that there weren't that many soup bowls and they ran out twice during my meal. Also, there has always been clam chowder (one of their signature soups) at all the Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes locations that I have dined at, but there was no clam chowder here! It's okay, they still had my all-time favorite chicken noodle soup.  As a whole, this is a solid Sweet Tomatoes location, but the portions are just smaller than I am used to (probably this store just doesn't have the volume of diners that I'm used to). Employees that I interacted with at the cash register and collecting used plates were all very friendly though, and they were pretty good about regularly wiping down the counters.  In the end, after having dined at Sweet Tomatoes and Souplantation in various cities and states around the country, I have yet to find one as good as the one in my hometown of Tustin, but I still recommend coming to this Las Vegas location for a satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try one of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations in Las Vegas. Like all locations, this one is clean and has simple yet thoughtful decor. I enjoyed using the new frosted glasses for my beverage as well.  I came with a coupon advertising chicken wraps but I guess they aren't offered at this location (it was a Souplantation coupon, the name for this restaurant chain in Southern California). Unlike Souplantation, I hear they only offer clam chowder on Fridays at Sweet Tomatoes too. The more Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes I go to, the more I realize that nothing can compare to the gold standard location in my hometown of Tustin.  Nonetheless, the food at this Sweet Tomatoes location is fresh and tasty. The value is also great and meals here are very affordable.  I recommend this location and this restaurant! Parking is ample and it's also a great place for your vegetarian friends since there isn't a lot of meat served here."}
{"text":"So I have actually visited this location quite a bit lately and for the most part it's been decent, but this last time was pretty unfortunate. I came in to eat at dinner time, which is always pricey (lunch is too but they attempt to cover people who stay longer) nonetheless I appreciate healthy and it's convenient. I came in to get my meal, and stopped to grab a drink, after getting it and taking a drink it appeared someone had dumped peach tea in the regular tea awful as I cannot stand the taste of that. I asked someone working to fix it, and it took about 40 minutes for them to change the tea. Mind you, I was waited to eat because who wants to eat with nothing to wash it down. There was no apologies no nothing. I saw a staff member taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy ? Clearly I wasn't and then left to fix it. They finally got it done so I could eat, I had a salad and bit in to a nasty cucumber idk how you get a bad one but I surely did. The service wasn't up to par and no one bothered to care. Typically I like this place and wouldn't have written this, but I gave it a second chance, mentioned the problem to the manager from the last time and he didn't even acknowledge it, he just said it should be right now. So hopefully it was a bad day, but I figured at the very least they could've apologized or took care of my drink, I never got it again where it didn't still taste like the peach tea. Unfortunate. I should add that both my first two plates were dirty, and my favorite the Tuna tarazon was also very watery."}
{"text":"This particular location I have been 5x and not once been  impressed since the food is not restocked-empty containers,  food doesn't have rich  flavors - salads,  pasta,  no eggs,  and the staff didn't pick up our plates much during the meal.   The branch in Ahwatukee is well run.   This site needs help.  The ginger soup,  pizza,  and muffins were good."}
{"text":"It always makes me feel good to come here -- like a reset button for all of the junk and/or highly caloric food I eat during the week. There's absolutely no guilt involved in eating endless salad. None! And the employees are always so friendly and on it with the table-bussing, I just had to send my compliments.  A few months ago, this location finally did away with its Fisher Price red plasticware and upgraded to grown-up china/glasses. The whole restaurant's completely revamped to the tune of decorative mason jars and a wall full of potted plants. Also, the early 90s-patterned carpet has been ripped out for a more modern wood. Everybody changes, it's life. Like aunts and uncles who try to stay hip with the times.  Unlimited basics: salad bar (do-it-yourself or specialty, I love their Caesar Asiago and Won Ton Happiness), soups (about 6 or 7 varieties on any given day), pasta (but nothing noteworthy), breads/baked goods (cornbread!), and frozen yogurt (mediocre, but fulfills dessert needs). There's also apples, oranges, and tapioca pudding, but I never touch that station. Also, they switch out a few of their menu items quite frequently. For example, March is Festa Italiana month.  Join their Club Veg and receive coupons. It'll save you a few bucks each trip. Oh, and the drink bar is phenomenal. Strawberry lemonade is their token star."}
{"text":"Has been closed, unknown when, maybe last moth. Had to go to Boston Market around the corner. Good Egg is closed too."}
{"text":"A long time since we've been here. A long time before we go back. 1st, the staff was great, friendly and attentive. The food not so good. The salad bar lacked much to offer in the way of taste. Even the chile which you would expect to have some spice to it lacked anything you could get out of a can. For people who think this is healthy think again. One walk down the salad bar and your calories outdo a big mack and fries. $12.35 was outrages for something I could make at home (and taste better) for $2 a serving. To many places to eat for the same or less with great food."}
{"text":"Mediocre, too much sugar, not enough protein (though you can pay extra for chicken) and not a great value for the money. But I still enjoy it once in awhile for reasons I can't even explain."}
{"text":"I like the concept of endless soup and salad. Not badly priced. Great selections and alternatives if you don't want just Greens and soup.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The girls at work love this place and since I love them,I go to Sweet Tomatoes with them for lunch. The location on Flamingo is new and so the restaurant is clean, well organized and spiffy. Sweet Tomatoes is supposed to be a salad bar experience. The moment you walk in, there is a long line of salad fixings: prepared salads, greens, veggies (beets, corn etc), beans, pasta, croutons, dressings. After you fill up your plate, you pay for the meal: almost 9 bucks for lunch. Not too bad considering you can have unlimited goes at all the food. Towards the back of the restaurant there is the prepared foods sections: soups (about 5/6 daily), pastas, breads, baked potatoes, drinks, muffins and dessert.   Although Sweet Tomatoes is always referred to as a \"salad place\" it's really not somewhere you want to go if you're in any sort of a diet. There is just way too many carby, cheese laden foods that unless you have self control (I have none), you're going to have a calorie fest.   Having said that, these are the things I like about Sweet Tomatoes at W. Flamingo (besides the above-mentioned spiffiness of the restaurant:  1. Service - friendly wait staff, staff that clear the empty plates in a jiffy, general efficiency of the people who work there 2. Labeling - They label their prepared dishes as \"vegetarian\" and sometimes even \"vegan.\" The website does an amazing job of letting you know what type of prepared foods each location has. Visit the site before going down to your Sweet Tomato experience 3. Creativity - Props to them for trying. They had Asian Week this week and they've tried to have Asian inspired soups, noodles etc. Ummm...they had tofu available for \"Asian Week.\" I nearly went to heaven (until I saw a piece of what looked like ham in the tofu container - see my statement on separation) 4. Soups - They have 6 soups and 2/3 of them are always veg/vegan 5. The Garlic Focaccia Bread and Cornbread with Whipped Butter - Mmmmmm.   Cons: 1. Taste - Honestly, nothing blew me away. The garlic focaccia and cornbread were the only things that came close to it. The soups were quite bland, the prepared salads were tasteless and the brownies were dry and tasted like diet food. With a menu of about 30 items, it's pretty incredible that there was only 2 items I liked 2. Separation - Not sure how they could get around it, but they have meaty items with vege items in the same area and you do see some cross-contamination 3. Crowd - This location was packed. Took me about 15 min to get from lettuce to spinach due to the 2 perfectly coiffed women in front of me deciding which green to eat 4. Marketing - For a restaurant to claim that it's healthy and promoting veggies there is a lot of artery clogging options available. Tell it as it is. Salad here but lots of comfort food too  All in all, Sweet Tomatoes is a decent option for lunch and probably would make everyone in your group happy. But don't be fooled into thinking that eating here will make you the next Twiggy."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week. Had not been in several months. Reviews are correct the quality has fallen into the cellar. The vegetable soup had a off flavor similar to dirty socks. Salad bar was a mess. The salad dressings were cross contaminated. Not a fan of thousand island mixed into watery blue cheese dressing. Soup base was not clear or red but a musty yellow color. Yuk. Tried to get taste out of my mouth with a corn bread muffin. The corn bread tasted like blue berry's. Tried another corn bread muffin same deal tasted like blue berry's. Resigned to being ripped off paying top dollar for a sub standard meal, decided to try a blue berry muffin. Very little flavor and was no where near the flavor of blue berries as the corn bread muffin. Very disappointing and was my last meal at this clip joint. Unsubscribed from their email list, sworn off for ever. They should be closing this sorry excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"First of all I have to give a shout out to the manager \"Russ\". My friend left her Iphone at dinner the night we were there. We are from out of town and we had to be on the road at 6 AM that next morning, so my friend was going to call Sweet Tomatoes and ask about her phone.  Around 8 AM my phone rings- you see I had tried to call my Friends phone in case she had dropped it in my car- and its my friends number calling.  I answer the phone and its Russ from Sweet Tomatoes.   Obviously he is trying to track down the owner of the phone and logically called the last number that tried it.    Thank you Russ and your workers for your honesty and integrity in getting the phone back to its owner.  Now on to my review.  First let me start out that I had been a huge fan of the \"sister\" company- Soup Plantation, and in fact I think I had something like 60 check ins at one of them. However upon having a not so good experience at Soup Plantation I stopped going.  My friends and I were in Scottsdale for business. We had a long weekend and were whooped on Sunday night.  We did not feel like going to a traditional sit down place and one person said they really craved a great salad.  So I turned to my trusty YELP AP and found Sweet Tomatoes.  It was about 8 PM on a Sunday night and what really impressed me at first was that even after closing at 9  (and we left at 9:30) they were still making sure all the food stations were full and fresh looking.  So many buffets at the end of the day just let things peter out.  Not so here.   So I was already feeling like this was a really well run place.  It was a perfect place for us to dine, we all had what we wanted in varying amounts.   The milk dispenser was broken and the manager that night just gave some bottles of milk.  That was really nice. Again above and beyond. Our bus boy was also very nice and kept coming by our table.  They make really good blueberry muffins here and the oat/apple muffins are very good also.  FIVE STAR SERVICE- the employees here are the best."}
{"text":"We've patronized this chain since living in the mainland and it is one of our favorite buffets.  Since we were visiting Arizona we thought stopping in and having some fresh salads, hot soups, freshly baked muffins and foccacia bread, with a little of pasta, baked potatoes and yams would be great way to celebrate the end of a nice visit to the desert.  :)  This particular establishment is new and has taken on more of a industrial decor than the other Sweet Tomatoes we've been to.  Never the less it is still a fabulous place to go for a whole lot of variety.  My personal favorite is the soft serve yogurt machine!  Add your own toppings of nuts, cookie chunks, maraschino cherries, and chocolate or caramel.  It's delicious and the sweet ending to a yummy meal.  The manager, Tammy O'Guinn is terrific.  She is pleasant (as is her team), she keeps a clean restaurant, and she is willing to go above and beyond to satisfy the customers.  You can often see her milling about the tables asking patrons whether they are enjoying their food, etc.    This is a great Sweet Tomatoes and we'll be visiting them again the next time we get over to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"You'd think Sweet Tomatoes would cater to vegans... But they don't.   Me and my family come here at least once a week. They offer healthy food... Great salad bar and yummy soups. We were very happy until they changed their selection of soups... At first they dropped to one vegan option, out of eight... And now we were told they won't have any for the next month.  We won't be back... Jason's Deli has an organic salad bar... And organic vegetable soup."}
{"text":"It's a great concept but the only vegan options offered were some salads, sliced sourdough bread and baked potatoes. There weren't any vegan soups offered. The coffee and tea bar was good.  I thought that it was overpriced and a better deal would be going to a casino buffet. Drinks ARE NOT included in the salad bar price. Sweet Tomatoes is an expensive version of Souper Salads."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sweet Tomatoes for many years and things haven't changed much. You still get the basic salads which are always fresh and tasty.  I think their soup bar has expanded with a wide variety of soups to choose from. This is the first time I have been to this location and am quite impressed by their soup selection.  Their soups, pizza, pasta, blueberry muffins, cornbread, etc are all very fresh and tasty.  I would prefer to have bigger plates so that you don't have to go up so many times to get the hot food items.  I like the bottomless drinks and the have a good selection of teas too.   Make sure to join their club to get their weekly special emailed to you."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday at 2:00pm and this place was packed!!!! Not only did we still have access to fresh made foods constantly, but the service here was impeccable! Truly. Smiles on the employees faces and Maria was constantly hard at work...con smile!!! I would definitely return even if the wait was long. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great selections that are well rounded and the majority of them are healthy. It's always clean. Never a long line.   My favorite parts are the salads that are premade. They change the selections on a regular seasonal basis so I love the creations they surprise you! The soup collection is always yummy and plenty to choose. I have a love/hate relationship here because once again the soup options change. Don't get attached because they will change more often than the salads. The best part of my visit will always include two things.  The blueberry mini muffins with whipped honey butter and the homemade fresh strawberry lemonade.  Even if I have no more room to eat. I MAKE THE ROOM!   They even offer Senior discount days and a Military discount! Great place because it has something for everyone at any age."}
{"text":"My wife and I are frequent visitors for the last 14 years (since they opened) and saw the ups and downs of this salad bar.  Now (for the last three months) it has been more downs.  Initially, parking, if you do not show up at 10:30, parking is limited until the afternoon lull.  We have noticed the employees are taking the \"premium\" front spots.  Today and our last visit, two front spots were taken by employees (we know this since we saw the manager let them in the building).  Today, the doors opened promptly at 11:00,only to be delayed at the counter since none of the salads were not prepared.  We waited and decided to press on after only the Won Ton Happiness was prepared.  After paying, the cashier apologized since she did not receive a scoop for the ice and told us to go the soda dispenser.  I went to the drink station and  discovered the drip tray under the drink dispenser was already full of liquid (minutes after opening?).  We had to wait for the employees to put ladles in the soup since they were still measuring the temperature.  After dining, we decided to have some ice cream only to the machine \"burb out\" a large amount of ice cream.  Obviously, the machine was not tested prior to opening.   This could have made a horrible mess on someone.    Summing up 1.  Employees should not take front spots. 2.  Everything should be ready, cleaned, and tested prior to opening.  Las Vegas has plenty of buffets (for a lot less money) and get protein (aka meat) for a lot less money.  To be competitive, you need to outshine the competition."}
{"text":"Lots of choices on the salad bar. The wonton salad was good, the Dijon potatoes salad was good and the broccoli salad was real good. The soups are what I think stole the show. Tried the sirachi-carrot, mushroom, basil pesto....all delicious. Not too bad on the price, good spot for kids that like that kind of stuff. The also have 3 pasta dishes, including mac and cheese. Big chunk chicken noodle soup and bread/desserts kept the kids happy as well. The set up is a bit weird, when you enter it's right to the salad bar, paying at the end of the line. It's all you can eat so for 11 bucks adult and 5 bucks a kid, not a bad deal. I'm sure we'll visit again"}
{"text":"loved this place so much I had to see if there is one closer to home (there isn't in Mpls, but in Chicago....)  went there based on the previous review; we didn't realize that there's so much more than the initial salad bar -- we filled our plate there and then realized all the stuff behind the line.   All the food was good (we love salads, too) and had our fill and then some.  five soups and chili, baked potatoes (and sweet potatoes) -- great selection.  Although it is all you can eat, I wouldn't compare it to Old Country Buffet, maybe another place that has soup and salad -- maybe \"on a diet plan\" is right.  This is more of a 'lunch' place whereas OCB is a 'dinner' place (or 'supper' if you prefer). great meal for eight bucks, relaxed atmosphere (be sure to put the marker on your table to indicate you'll be back, or they'll take your plate and tray away :-) Recommended."}
{"text":"This place is so busy and the staff is very very nice! They have like 6 options of soup and obviously a lot of salad options. You can find coupons easy too"}
{"text":"I never been to Sweet Tomatoes despite being extremely close to our house. Every time I drive by , it looks packed. Today I went with a friend and my son for lunch. I had a coupon, it was 20 something including drinks for both of us.  The drinks are definitely overpriced, the buffet at less than $8.00 was a decent value. I agree with a previous reviewer, the toppings for the salad were very basic, kind of disappointing. To their credit, everything looked and tasted fresh. The prepared salads were good, I'm pretty sure very high in calories as well. I had the potato leek soup, which was nothing to write home about. But.... this month they have chicken pot pie stew, you pour this on top of a biscuit and that was sooooo gooood. I'm surprised I liked it since I don't even like chicken pot pie, but the stew was nicely seasoned, the veggies were good and the biscuits were light and fluffy. Comfort food at it's best.  The breads were OK, and the muffins were tasty. The pasta didn't looked appetizing to me at all, except the mac & cheese that my toddler devoured. Granted, at this age I don't think they're the best judges of good food, not to mention mac & cheese is a group food on its own for them. The fruit section was very sparse, only whole apples and pineapples slices.  In general, unless you eat a lot, buffets are not a great value but a $10 lunch here will leave you satisfied, if you're not big into meat that is. I know that I need to come back for more chicken stew and biscuits."}
{"text":"I love that they have great gluten free and dairy free options! It's a wonderful family friendly place, and my kids beg to go back and eat salads. Win win!!!!"}
{"text":"in california, sweet tomatoes are souplantations.  i wanted to eat here just because i've only eaten at souplanations, and i love them.   the location is in a good area.  plenty of parking and seating.  the two lines of the salad bar were well stocked, fresh mixed salads.  the iceburg was crisp, very little brown bits.  the other veggies looked fresh, though i don't like most of them.   there was an abundance of most everything.  they kept everything well stocked for being lunch time. during april, they have a bunch of lemon stuff.  the lemon cream pasta is so good.  so refreshing and simple.  the major disappointment was their sourdough bread.  had the consistency and taste of dense french bread.  not the normal sourdough bread they usually have.  they were also stored on the side of the buffet line, not kept warm.  so it was just a complete let down.  great customer service.  they stopped by more often than the ones i am used to and they ask how you are doing.  it was nice."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. The salad bar is really good and they have a great selection of soups. Also have pasta and breads that are very good and of course top it off with a couple servings of ice cream. Stuffed"}
{"text":"I have seen cleaner bathrooms in gas stations in the middle of nowhere in South Dakota!  It was gross.  The food is not good but it is better than a lot of plastic food places. I would go back if needed but man clean that bathroom!"}
{"text":"I give them 3stars. They have 5different soups Pizza slices lots baked bread Salads potatoes and sweet potatoes Most raw Wish they had more slices of meat cooked and fresh fruits and less additives to thicken their soups"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it really has gone down the tubes!!! I went there for lunch today and it was definitely the last time. Food quality was poor, poor selection of soups and the two I tried were gross."}
{"text":"I love this place and go there often. The facility is always spotlessly clean and the food is fresh. You walk in and grab a tray and plate and walk along the long salad bar which offers a ton of choices for salad makings as well as various salads. You make your own salad and top it off with a variety of dressing choices. They have a tremendous beverage selection, several different soups that change daily, baked and sweet potatoes with topping choices, assorted breads, muffins, pizza, pasta, and soft serve ice cream. Everything is made and kept very fresh. The staff whisk away plates and bowls to keep your table uncluttered, so be sure to leave a tip when you leave.  They have something for everyone, and you'll see people of all ages there enjoying the bountiful selections. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I should start this review with a disclaimer. I had never been to a Sweet Tomatoes before. They don't exist where I used to live. I felt adventurous, and wanted to try something new. I didn't really know what to expect. I wouldn't say either that my palate is expansive. In general though, I like salad bars, so I thought I would give this place a try. I'm not even sure this review will be helpful to anyone, but maybe it will.   Basically, you walk in, grab a tray and a plate, make a salad from the salad bar, pay for your order, and then sit down. From there, you get your drinks and then soup, bread, and everything else they have there.   I'll start with the positives. The staff was super friendly and helpful in explaining a newbie how everything works. The food was replenished in a timely manner. The restaurant was very clean. They serve Coke products, which is always worth a star.   Now, if you like meat, don't come here. They have none. I didn't see any salt or pepper, either. Even the chicken noodle soup has no chicken. I'm not a vegetarian, and I don't mind too much that there isn't any meat, but I thought that the price was a little high considering that meat is usually what drives prices up at buffet type places.   In Vegas, there are plenty of other options where you can get pretty much everything Sweet Tomatoes has to offer (and a lot more) for the same price, or a little more money. I didn't see the value for the price.   The food itself, in my opinion, was average. It's completely subjective, but I wasn't blown away. The soup was cold. The chili was cold. The bread was cold. The corn was cold. The chicken noodle soup was pretty much water and noodles, and lacked flavor. Chili is hit or miss for me, and I didn't really care for it. The salad was fine, and the food was fresh, just really cold. It was all very healthy, I'm sure, and well prepared, but I just wasn't blown away.   If you're already a big fan of Sweet Tomatoes, or you're very health conscious with your food and you love salads and soups, you'll probably like this location, which is in a family friendly, safe area. If you're a meat lover, your options will be severely limited and you'll want to stick to a buffet or a Golden Corral or something. I'm somewhere in the middle, hence the 3 star review. With so many other alternatives in Las Vegas, I don't see myself coming back a second time, purely for subjective reasons and not because of Sweet Tomatoes or the location itself. To each their own."}
{"text":"I've been to sweet tomatoes for many many times and still love it very much. First, when I feel I need high-fiber dinner, I go! There are basically two zones of food (Salad vs. soup, desert, pasta). Everyone can take two plates on a tray every time (kinda hard to put everything I want in a plate :P). It's also a ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT restaurant. I love every vegetable&fruit there.   Second, when the weather is cold and I just want a bowl of hot soup, I go! More than 7 kinds of soups. The Big Chunk Chicken Noodle is the best, even though sometimes it might be too salty. chocolate/blueberry/coconut Muffins are all good. Baked sweet potato is bomb. Pizza and pasta are ok. I'm not a big fan of these choices.     Third, when you wanna SAVE $$, please go. There is no place healthier and cheaper than sweet tomatoes. I can have all nutrients I need in a day but absolutely yummy and healthy."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat at after a long day on the road from the Grand Canyon into Nevada. I recommend it to anyone, even vegans like myself. It is always so hard to find a decent buffet with a lot of options for those who don't eat meat. Big thanks to Paul for his charisma and hospitable attitude. The black bean chili soup wAs great ! My favorite."}
{"text":"Will not be back.  I was here the first part of January and was told by the manager that the first half of each month they would have new Gluten Free items such as salads and rolls or muffins.  Came back tonight looking forward to have a few items I can't normally have due to my Gluten allergy and am extremely disappointed.  Absolutely nothing Gluten Free.  I spoke to the manager and he has no idea why they don't have anything this month and no idea if they will again.  I paid $12.00 to have a small plate of iceberg lettuce.  We will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Just went here yesterday with a friend for dinner! I like going here when I'm not sure what I want to eat since it is AYCE, nearby, and they have salads which makes me feel healthier since I'm eating my veggies haha.   They usually have 3 different types of premade salads (Caesar Asiago, Wonton Happiness, and some seasonal salad that changes often). You can also build your own salad with various ingredients if you don't like any of the premade options. After getting your salad you pay and pick a table to eat at. You can get muffins, cookies, soups, pasta, and ice cream as well! As for drinks, I highly recommend trying a blend of sprite and the strawberry lemonade over ice for a refreshing, fizzy drink.   I'd recommend checking this place out if you've never been to a Sweet Tomatoes (aka Souplantation) and are in the mood for salads, soups, and various baked goods. Be sure to sign up for their newsletter for the seasonal themes for the food and for coupons! I've never been here without a coupon xD."}
{"text":"I like to think of Sweet Tomatoes as my guilt-free buffet. For less than ten bucks for lunch, I get the freshest salad ingredients, good soup and pizza. I love all of their pre-mixed salads and always make it a point to try them all. The macaroni and cheese and pizzas are legit too. I love eating here because I don't hate myself after like I usually do after I gorge at buffets."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and excellent selection of make your own salads, soups, pizza, muffins and even a bunch of desserts to choose from when ready"}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place. The people have before like family to us! Food is always fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato was great!!  friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Excellent place when you are craving a salad...not that the salads I built end up being healthy after I'm done loading them up!  At $9.59 per person, it's not the cheapest lunch option and they ding you $2.49 for a drink...so I can think of a lot of other lunch spots that you can get out of for less...but the 'build your plate with exactly what you want' kind of sucks me in.  The creamy tomato basil soup was outstanding...yeah, this is that 'not so healthy' bit!!"}
{"text":"I love this salad bar. Best in town. Their Coke is exceptionally excellent as well. The corn bread and honey butter is a total classic as well as the cheese pizza. My 4 year old loves the self serve ice cream bar as well and the kid options. So sad they closed down in Salt Lake City but ecstatic Arizona has locations since we're moving there end of the summer."}
{"text":"I have a coupon for Sweet Tomatoes 2 for breakfast $18.99 valid 01/03/16, 9:00am to 11:00am.  We went to the Sweet Tomatoes on Rainbow at 10:30am and it was closed.  We thought it odd as we did not know Sweet Tomatoes served breakfast.  Does certain Sweet Tomatoes serve breakfast?  The lunch and dinner is excellent here."}
{"text":"Great for Salads only  soup meh  dessert meh  fresh vegetables ,variety of greens perfect"}
{"text":"I think this place has a cool concept. A healthier, fresh take on a buffet. The salad and soup was delicious. They have a great selection. The corn bread with honey whip spread was awesome. My daughter loved the Mac n cheese. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Sweet Tomatoes barn location.  This location is not like the other locations in the Valley.  This one has high ceilings (open to the high natural roof) which makes it louder inside than the other locations.  We went on a saturday night at primetime so we had to wait a bit for a table.  The food is always great and fresh.  Sign up for their email discounts so that you have a coupon to bring with to help soften the bill."}
{"text":"I'm with Norma on the to-go option at Sweet Tomatoes.  I stopped by after Yelp Office Hours today and picked up a salad to go.  (I had planned on eating at Pane Bianco but they are closed on Monday - bummer!)  Actually, for $8.22, it was a great deal!  I left with a huge salad, a side of steamed veggies, a cup of soup, a sweet potato, and an apple.  Now that is getting a bang for your buck!  I've also eaten at other locations in the past and left feeling way too full because when you eat there, you have to take advantage of everything including the fro yo, bakery items, and more...   I was impressed that the entire salad bar was kept clean and had many options to choose from.  I noticed for an additional fee, you can also get a side of grilled chicken now.  I didn't need that though with so many other options.    I will not be a regular at Sweet Tomatoes, anytime soon, but for the right occasion, especially when picking up 'to-go' lunch, it works.  Good thing I didn't read the other reviews on this location before I went, or I probably would've spent double the $$ at AJ's around the corner!"}
{"text":"I knew Sweet Tomatoes was a pretty major chain, and I've visited other locations before, but I just learned that there are 112 restaurant locations in 15 states... that's pretty huge!    This location happens to be a lunchtime favorite for my friend Kathy L, since it's close to our office, so we headed over here recently for a filling, somewhat healthy, affordable lunch... bonus: Kathy brought coupons that she found online which discounted each of our meals to just $6.99!  We both stuck primarily to the salad bar although I have to admit, the soups, potatoes, pasta, pizzas, breads, muffins, and ice cream were pretty appealing as well.  So, the lettuce is a tad bit watery, but the buffet has plenty to choose from and everything is fresh, chilled, and kept clean.  Staff is friendly as well...  This place is not for anyone looking for a classy place to dine, but if you're hungry and looking to eat on the cheap in a casual environment, Sweet Tomatoes to the rescue!"}
{"text":"It is what you would expect from a salad bar/buffet, nothing special and nothing terrible. I feel like you are getting a little bit overcharged considering nothing is good except the salad. It has always been clean and never too busy, but not somewhere I would recommend for anything but a salad. I do however, like that is is big and open and that they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I would probably eat more vegetables if someone else was able to identify the ripe ones, bought them, cleaned them, cut them, and served them. Fortunately, a heavenly place like that exists....it's called Sweet Tomatoes.  It's all of the veggie salad fixings without the hassle!  Grab a tray and 2 plates upon entering, then slide along either side of the cafeteria trough stopping every few inches to load up on greens, beans, and whatever herbacious plants and toppings float your boat. At the end of the line, there is a cash register that will take your $20. It's not quite that much, but almost. Be sure to bring coupons or get in on that senior citizen discount during certain hours.  The booths are tight and the seat cushions are lacking. I speculate that they've arranged it that way on purpose. It's an all-you-can-eat buffet, but if your butt falls asleep sitting there for too long, or you have trouble squeezing into the seat because the table is pushing against your belly, you'll know you've over stayed your welcome.  Although allowed, most people don't go back for vegetables. Instead, everyone opts for the pasta/pizza, soups, bakery muffins or soft serve with sweet toppings. You can make multiple trips here too. It's great fun if you are undecided on what to eat and want to try a little bit of everything.  I have 2 wishes: Why can't there be one where I live, and why can't I be rich enough to eat here daily?"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!  This is my new favorite place.  Not only can you build your own salad, but the premade ones they prepare are excellent too!  The broccoli salad is a must try, and the won ton chicken happiness salad.  I've already been 3 times since I first went a week and a half ago and still haven't made it to the soups, but the selection is great and they all look amazing!  I will try next time and report back.  Also, the lemonade mixed with the strawberry lemonade is soooo good!  I could go on forever... eat at Sweet Tomatoes!!!"}
{"text":"I been coming to this location a looooong time!  Have always been happy up until about a year ago.  Ever since the bankruptcy and new owners I feel the quality has gone way down. The chicken always tastes strange and is over boiled.   The soups have gone down hill too. Theyre basically all broths/purees.   Salad toppings/veggies keep disappearing and most never come back.   The prices keep going up and up too.   We used to go hear twice a week sometimes. Lately its twice a month.   Sucks.    Update 6/15/17 Gave it another shot, went to dinner with the folks.   Missing dressings and horrible soup selection.  Done."}
{"text":"Of all the soups they had, didn't care for 1 soup. Came on a Sunday after church with my mom. There were 2 different kinds of broth......just broth. 2 different kinds of chicken noodle, rest of soups actually all of the soups were horrible!!  I love salads but I can not eat them do to my Crones disease."}
{"text":"Came here after a baseball game cause I don't think I'd ever been more hungry in my lifetime. Huge expanse of food with a wide range of choices. Had a little bit of everything, but the highlight for me were the soups. Chowder and Chicken Noodle were great, almost licked out the bottom of the bowl. Only complaint I have is was a little spendy for salads and such, but food justified the price. (almost)"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see they didn't have any sourdough bread at this location. I've had it before at a different Sweet Tomatoes, and I'm not sure if it was a seasonal item or what, but I was very disappointed I couldn't have it here, cause I was craving it!   I had to settle for lots of soup (that's fine cause I like soup more then I should) and gallons of strawberry lemonade. A satisfying meal after watching a ball game, but I needed my sourdough!"}
{"text":"I was staying in Mesa, Arizona on a temporary basis and decided to give the Sweet Tomatoes a try. It was very clean, and everyone made me feel welcome. The food was great and it was a very nice experience over all."}
{"text":"Great food and selection. Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  Staff were very friendly and the restaurant itself was decorated lovely and was very clean.  It is a little more pricier that I would have thought... but I noticed it is cheaper during lunch than dinner."}
{"text":"As far as salad bar buffets go, Sweet Tomatoes is king and this location's buffet is good enough. It's hard to get wowed by a salad bar buffet, but besides the age-showing decor and hit or miss service, this location works.  The food is usually fresh and items are almost always available. If they bring in a Coke Freestyle like they have at another location it would be great.  I love the chili."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I just realized that I may have to cut back on starting my reviews with 'Ok, so let me start by saying...'...that being said...  Ok, so let me start by saying that this review is slightly tainted...*tee hee hee*  I have been feeling under the weather for a little over a week, so after I wandered listlessly into work on Tuesday my friend suggested we go to Sweet Tomatoes for lunch so I could get some soup. Sounded like a good plan to me.   So we go through the salad bar then up to the register to pay (weird set-up, why not pay first or pay last? Why pay in the middle? I don't get it. Why are you trying to confuse the sicky girl? It's just mean!) My lunch was about $12 (did I just get charged like $4 for a drink? I dunno, maybe I missed something). That's a little high for just going to get some soup and a beverage, but we were already there, so I decided to go for it because she said they were serving albondigas soup which pretty much always throws me into a good mood.   Then we were able to venture into the section of warm food. I search and search and search...NO ALBONDIGAS! :( Sad Tyger. *sigh* Shame on your website.   Anywho, So I got a broth soup with a bunch of veggies...(I can't tell if it was good or not, my tastebuds died sometime on Monday) but it was hot-ish so its purpose was served. The food looked tasty, the salads looked pretty and green (except when they weren't supposed to be green ie. macaroni salad, potato salad, etc.) so I will probably give this place another chance after my taste buds recover from being fever-burnt."}
{"text":"My first time trying here and I'm impressed with  the options and quality of food  I would recommend coming for lunch and trying the broccoli cheddar soup"}
{"text":"Low quality salad. Bland tasteless flavors. The restaurant is disorganized. Not enough options. This is suppose to be a buffet; its not. The place is overpriced as well. They only safe heaven are the waiters."}
{"text":"So I would be lying if I said I was excited the first time my friend suggested eating here. My thought process is, why spend money on just a salad bar but boy was my mind quickly changed. There is something for everyone. The health conscious can fill up on the salad bar while others, like myself will hit the soup line as well. Their chili is amazing especially with sour cream and cheese. I always say I will try \"that\" the next time through but I never get to the next time through. They did lose a star for the price. 2 bucks and some change for a drink? I quickly forget about that once I start eating because it tastes so good. I never thought I would consider eating here a reward for good deeds but it definitely is."}
{"text":"This was plan B after Café Zupas was closed(Yes, it was on a Sunday)   Pretty much the same set up like Fresh Choice and all those other \"soup and salad\" joints...I like that this time we went, they were featuring \"Tastes of the World\" items featuring the Mediterranean regions. Keeps the food selection a little exciting and new.  Lots of drink choices to chose from as well, but I always go for the Strawberry Lemonade and flavored iced teas whenever we dine here. Service  is pretty awesome here, they're always bussing plates quickly, and even a manager was going around to each table offering freshly baked chocolate chip cookies!   I love their selection of muffins and flatbreads too, but their pasta section could use some improvement. The dessert section is pretty minimal, but for the price, the overall spread at Sweet Tomatoes ain't bad at all.... 3.5 stars...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. I love the remodeled look. But my fav is how they always come up with new menu items. Everything is so fresh and delicious. We love it here!"}
{"text":"When it comes to AYCE soup and salad, this place has the winning recipe, the best thing about Sweet Tomatoes is that they stick to what they know. I think it's the ideal restaurant for lunch, and for families. I'm a soup lover so this place is good in my book. Oh and how do you NOT eat more than one blueberry muffin???  If your not allergic of course."}
{"text":"Middle quality. Choices for buffets salads, soups. You can custom your salad but choice is limited for me. Is not very delicate but it's ok for family dinner. Price ok for quality but drink a little bit overpriced."}
{"text":"had lunch here yesterday for the first time. loved it. for $10 i had so many healthy, fresh items. their soups and chili are fantastic. and i loved the sweet potato and baked potato \"bar\". they also had self serve ice cream with alot of topping selections. the cones were tiny and adorable. wonder where they get them. and the salad, of course, is wonderful. all fresh and so many salad dressing choices. the staff is friendly and helpful. love the concept of this place. will go back for sure. great place for kids too. they seemed to love the mac and cheese, and of course, the ice cream."}
{"text":"I just had the absolute worst experience at Sweet Tomatoes on Bell Road. First and foremost I am not a yelper at all but I felt this needed to be said. I sat down to eat my salad and as embarrassing as this is, felt something moving in my mouth! I instantly spit it out and it was a huge black beetle!! Of course I reacted and immediately told the girl at the register. There was absolutely no concern or regard for what had just happened to me. No apology, nothing. In fact, the manager made it seem like we were the ones in the wrong for over reacting. He told my husband he was \"causing a scene\" because we asked for a full refund. I am so disturbed at not just the fact that there were bugs in my food, but the disregard or concern for the customer. Customer service gets a big fat thumbs down and I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Worst ever. They let pet owners bring dogs to the buffet and the owner can carry the dog wile eating from their plate and still grabbing from the salad bar. Manager has no manager about them. Get a spine and say u also think that is just wrong and discussing. NASTYYYY"}
{"text":"People omnivores, those whom devour meat and veggies, but sometimes my carnivorous side takes over and to make up for it.. cheapo salad fix at Sweet Tomatoes. Veggies make regular bowel movements happen.  Went online and found a coupon, it was a special of $6.99 for up to four people during lunch. Four people and two drinks for 32 something, not bad.  What I like:  - Get your salad first then pay.   - Pretty decent variety of vegetables, dressings, and toppings, nothing \"premium\", but it was only 6.99 ($8.50 normally).  - A variety of soup selection, different strokes for different folks yo.  - Friendly staff. The cashier told me to go have a seat and he'll bring me my receipt. Never brought me my receipt, so when I questioned it, he gave me a meal voucher. Problem solved with no headache!  - Patio dining! I have not seen this at the other locations that I have been to. I didn't take advantage of it today because it was hot, but when the weather cools down, it would be pretty cool to watch traffic pass by while munching on my croutons.  - WARM brownies and frozen yogurt were available. Great for ghetto pizookies.    What I didn't like:   - It took a bit for the plates to clear.  -  Drinks are a bit pricey ($2.50?), at least its all you can drink.  - Dessert selection was pretty weak.    \"See you next thyme!\""}
{"text":"Great people great food!! Very clean atmosphere-., oh, and if you suggest mini chocolate chip cookies ..... they will make it for you!! :)"}
{"text":"I thought this Sweet Tomatoes was brand new when I walked it.  Very Clean and everyone was friendly and attentive.  The staff at this location are a class act!    The salad bar and it's topping were well maintained and fresh.  I especially liked their array of pasta salads.  The Tarragon and Tuna and the Asian Peanut were my favorites!  I am a soup lover and could spend my entire meal there alone.  I got a second ok a third helping of the Spicy Sausage with Pasta and beans.  Pizza was good as was the hot pasta selection.  I definitely plan on coming back here again and again...even though it's not the closest Sweet Tomatoes to me it is by far the best I've been to in the Valley...kudos!!!"}
{"text":"Fight to park you get in and there is no salad mixed.  You have to ask yourself, this is a salad place right?  Walked out.  I have been a regular customer for years but the place is out of control.  The chicken soup, that used to be good, is now shredded chicken soup, I liked the last 30 iterations but the have finally found a chick soup that is not edible.  They dropped eggs from the salad add-in choices when the eggs got expensive and never put them back.  So busy that they really don't care about customers, starting to get more and more like a food factory but they can't even get the food out."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have ever eaten.  They have no meat or protein of any kind! Their soup is watery, their mac and cheese bland and what the opposite of cheesy is. There must be people who go back to Sweet Tomato as they are still open, but I'm not one of them. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"Food seems fresh. Lettuce is crunchy and had many different variety of salads. I didn't know there was so much! First time I've actually been here. Love the different options of soup. Tried only the vegetable soup, though, but that was yummy. There breads were delicious and full of flavor. Just tidy up the service, please. It's hard to communicate when I don't speak Spanish and they don't really speak English. It was an okay experience. The ONLY thing that was off was the oranges. They were far from ripe."}
{"text":"My husband and I both agreed 5 stars for this place. I'm vegan and he is not. But, there are plenty of options for vegans as well as non vegans! Plenty of salad toppings!!!  A cold linguine salad was yummy! Tonight there was 2 kinds of vegan soups. I had to try some of each...was glad I did as they were both delicious! Since my husband is not vegan, he had many, many items to choose from and enjoyed the chicken soup which is standard at Sweet Tomatoes and is his favorite. He was not disappointed! He also tried the vegetarian carrot soup which he said was very good! He had a couple pieces of focaccia bread, which he liked a lot. He had room for dessert, I didn't. He likes their vanilla soft serve with chocolate syrup on it tonight. This restaurant has lots of desserts to choose from which changes monthly in addition to a variety of fresh fruit choices. If you join their VegClub, there are discounts available to you for lunch or dinner for up to 4 people with one coupon! Sweet Tomatoes rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously underwhelming. The pizza was cold. The chicken noodle soup was tasteless noodles in the weakest broth I've ever tasted. The ice cream was icy and gross, not creamy at all. Overall, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I won a gift card for here at work so obviously I came to give it a try. Once you walk in there's a salad bar where you can build a brilliant salad. Everything is clearly labeled as either vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free which I think is great. After you build your salad, you pay and seat yourself.   Looking at all of the other items in here, you realize that the whole idea of mixing healthy food into a buffet is brilliant! Then you taste it and pretty much everything lacks depth. I'd love it if this place put a little more passion into their food. Spice it up. Like seriously, use some spices please.   For what the place is, an extremely cheap all you can eat (it was $21 for two people to eat as much food as humanly possible, and that right there is a damn deal) it's great. The facility is super clean, staff is friendly, and there's lots of options. On the other hand, if you're looking for some flavorful dishes this probably isn't the place to go."}
{"text":"I was talking with Rand about having eaten at Souper Salad the previous week and he suggested we meet up here, right across the highway, to compare the two.  Yesterday we did so.  The foods were all fresh.  We agreed most of the hot items lacked much in the way of flavor.  I don't think I cared much for having the salad bar between the front door and the cash register.  Another thing I thought odd was a section of the salad bar that had extra cost items to add to your salad.  One question I have is why  they are very busy when Souper Salad across the way with a very similar menu and execution for less money has hardly anybody in it."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in my email for a free birthday dinner. The food was ok. Pretty fresh. Unless you have been here before it is hard to find where everything is laid out. The place was packed, which didn't help finding stuff. Just like the other one I had gone to the entrance door dumps you right in to the salad line."}
{"text":"Had to come back again before the end of my trip.  Was just as good as the first time.   I will miss you sweet tomatoes and I still beg of you to come to NYC!"}
{"text":"We went here the other night with the padres.  My mom has been wanted to try this place.  It is like other all you can eat salad buffet type places.  The employees were friendly, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  It cost $50 for 4 adults.  Guess I will be looking for the buy one get one free coupons.  The salad items looked fresh, and there was a really good variety of \"good for you\" items and the indulgence items like pastas.  There was also a nice choice of dressings, both regular and light.   Once you get your salad (people were getting 2 plates, so we copied them, but only filled one) you pay for your meal and can find a place to sit.  That is when you hit the big time.  There must have been 7-9 different types of soups, baked potatos, various types of bread and muffins, and of course dessert.  They also serve a breakfast buffet on Sundays."}
{"text":"I am a big salad eater so this place is perfect! They have a great salad bar and their buffet includes a variety of different soups and pastas. The only thing that I have a problem with is paying around 13 dollars for going and paying extra for premium topping that they have for salads like grilled chicken. For desert that have nonfat yogurt and a mini fruit bar, it's not the best but they also go around giving their guest chocolate chip cookies straight out of the oven. This place is  a great place for both vegetarians as meat eaters."}
{"text":"I came with my brother and his gf later in the night.  There was still a tons of food out.  I have to admit I am not a salad eater!  I tagged along and go the soup, pasta, and baked goods.  The chicken noodle is GOOD, got seconds!  I tried some chicken/beef meatball soup, no thanks.  The mac and cheese was not too shabby.  The baked muffins, cornbread, etc. was good.  And of course the soft serve!  :)  The experience was topped off by the service.  The server keep checking on us and gave is pointers on what to try."}
{"text":"Food isn't good salad is old oh yeah and there was a MOTH in my baked potato !!!! First and last time I come here! I threw up thanks for the horrible experience!"}
{"text":"We arrived 45 minutes before close, our last stop before heading back to Yuma. After a quick coupon look up (which brought it down $51 to $39; 2 adults/3 kids), we went in and \"raised hell\" (respectfully, of course) on the buffet of salads, sides and such...mostly a delicious carb-city! It was a pleasant time; only the woman behind the salad bar had a pissy look on her face...listen, I don't expect smiles and giggles but pretend like things are okay, even if you're about to close shop... we've all been there, just saying. Otherwise, a good time."}
{"text":"I love this place,so fresh!I always use a coupon when I go though.You can get them online.The serving areas are always full and there's always plenty of everything.I wish dinner and lunch we're the same price since it seems there is no difference but I'm not mad about it."}
{"text":"Brought my daughter here for lunch today. Loved it! Such a variety of things to choose from and everything taste delicious. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Salad bar was okay. I wish they had more of the iceberg lettuce. It looked a little sad. The broccoli sweet salad is probably the best thing they offer. This location is busy so it's hard to find a clean table. I would only come if you have a coupon. It's a little pricey for a salad bar. There isn't a large selection for their hot food selection either."}
{"text":"What the effff, why haven't I been here earlier?  BUFFET OF SALAD AND PASTA IS LIKE HEAVEN TO ME!  And it's only $8. Hellloooooooooooooooo, I think I want to eat at Sweet Tomatoes for my last meal on earth.  They have all kinds of salads..specialty kinds and the regular ones with allllllllll the toppings you could think of. They have jello...and I don't know why jello goes well at salad bars but, whatevs, I love! They had dark chocolate yogurt, love love LOVE!"}
{"text":"Can't say I've ever had a bad experience with Sweet Tomatoes but this time I really felt like they went above and beyond. First we went with a party of 9, as soon as we walked in the door they made sure to reserve a table for us. Then one of the employees cooked up a special pasta for us which was delicious. And our waiter, Oscar, was very quick to clear the table and he helped the kids make special deserts. One of the things I like most about Sweet Tomatoes is that you make your own plate and it's quick, but that usually means very little interaction with staff and not much opportunity to impact the experience but in this case, the staff made a great impression."}
{"text":"After grueling day of work, I needed food fast. I didn't have time to wait and so my goal was to find a nearby buffet with moderately healthy food? What's healthier than raw salad? I can't think of anything...  So after convincing my husband, we arrive at the Sweet Tomatoes confused as can be. I see a check-in special offering 15% off, which was an added bonus to attending a nearly meatless restaurant. I walk in on the entrance by the salad bar, unsure of what to do next. A few minutes later an employee says I can just grab a plate and create a salad and then I can go pay at the cash register at the end of the salad bar.  After the employee gives his spiel, a customer helping himself to buffet seconds chimes in. He said \"Oh this place is great; you can keep coming back as much as you want. There is even pizza, soups, and desert in the back.\" By pizza, he meant focaccia bread, but it's all the same to me.    After the introduction, I grab a plate. Actually I grab about 5 plates before I find one clean enough for me to feel comfortable eating off of. My husband got lucky and got a clean one his first try.  We each grab one plate and fill it to our hearts content. Beats, broccoli, corn, quinoa, premade salads, nuts, and cheese all make a place on my plate. The ingredients looked fresh and this was one of the first times I was excited to eat a salad. I get to the cash register to pay and tell the cashier about the check-in special. To my disappointment, she reveals that the coupon is fake and unauthorized by the company. However, she gave me a 10% senior's discount, which was way cool.  After munching down my first incredible customized salad, I needed to go explore the other options. That's when I got 3 soups, 3 amazing soups jam packed with flavor. Sirracha Carrot was tasty pureed carrots with the right amount of heat. Potato and Leak was kept simple, just like it was meant to be. My favorite soup, Albondigas Locas, has got me committed to coming back. This soup was tangy as if it has lemon in it, with rice and chicken meatballs.   As I write this review, I cannot help but salivate. After completing my soup sampling, I was full. I didn't feel like I needed to keep going back for more to get my money's worth because dinner was only $11.99 + tax (minus my discount).  So I passed on their cookie bar dessert and self-serve ice-cream.   The next day, I decided to hop online and join Club Veg (their official rewards program). Next time I use a discount, it will be the correct one. FYI valid discount codes will all begin with a W."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite soup and salad restaurants. The vegetables are always fresh as are the fruits. The soups, muffins and baked potatoes are hot and delicious.  We came for the dinner because I received a free lunch or dinner buffet for my birthday. I love it here The employees are friendly and personable. The service is outstanding. It was a lovely dinner for a Monday evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I used a coupon for 38% off for Sweet Tomatoes Anniversary.  We arrived during the lunch rush. Fortunately for us we were there before the arrival of the lunch crowd.  The salads were crisp and fresh as they had many different salads to choose from. The toppings were fresh as if they had just came out of the garden. There is a variety of veggies to select from for the salads. We moved along the line filling our plates. The cashier was friendly and helpful. We ate our salads and then went to peruse the hot soups, breads and pizza. I selected the Mexican Vegetable Stew. There were mushrooms, cheese, tofu and other items next to the soups. I added mushrooms to mine. The food was hot and delicious.  For dessert they had yogurt ice cream--vanilla and chocolate or you can have both in a mixture. They have fresh fruit and muffins, jello, chocolate and vanilla pudding. There is a potato bar with toppings, they offer both russet and sweet potato. There is a wide selection of beverages to choose from. My husband and I drank ice water with lemon. We  had  a friendly woman who kept our table clean by coming by frequently and removing the dishes. This location of Sweet Tomatoes is convenient for us to visit. We always have good service, with fresh food, and reasonable prices. The coupons I receive by text or email help to make it affordable."}
{"text":"My husband, my two son's and myself went to this location on Southern to use my buy one with a beverage, get one free for my birthday (which was yesterday, the day we visited this location).  The restaurant was busy but with two sides to go through the salad buffet; we went through it rather quickly. The cashier was nice and helpful. We found a booth and as we were hungry, we turned our attention to devouring our fresh salads. After consuming our salads, we went to peruse the hot foods--they had a nice selection of soups, pastas, baked russets and sweet potatoes, breads, muffins and for dessert, soft serve ice cream, molten chocolate cake, etc.,  Everything was fresh, delicious and tasty.  The employees are friendly and our waiter kept our table cleared. He was quick and personable and he was kept very busy by the amount of people in our seating section of the restaurant. This is a great place to go for a satisfying lighter fare meal. I love Sweet Tomatoes! We will be back."}
{"text":"Some days I'm just craving for a super tasty salad.  Naturally enough, this is my go-to place (besides my kitchen) to get a grubbin salad. They also have pretty tasty soups and a little bit of pasta to munch on as well.  I would definitely recommend you hit up each and every one of the bread sticks b/c they are THE BOMB.  Plus, they switch their menu seasonally to keep their tastes fresh and appealing to us customers.  Sweet Tomatoes is convenient, fresh, and the staff is always very friendly.  The only downside is the price (I think it was $9.89 the last time I went for lunch) so be prepared to shell out some money for a nice salad lunch.  But, if you get on the email list, they give out coupons regularly so that's a +1."}
{"text":"It compared to a Golden Corral.....no better, no worse.....I was expecting more selection of 'fresh and  homemade\" as advertised.......but you could tell it all came from a can.  Would be nice to have larger plates in the soup/bread area so you don't have to leave your food at your table and go back for extras.    I must agree with the other poster that it REALLY could use a good cleaning.....I was there on 8/2/17.......around 2pm.  I too, found dirty, crusty silverware......and the floors were in need of a good sweeping."}
{"text":"If you've never to this Sweet Tomato before, I will tell you that the interior is vast. You can go roller skating from one end to the other without any issues. Tonight per usual, we went down the line, paid, and was getting ready to look for a table to sit down to eat our dinner when the cashier said, \"wait. You have to wait to be seated.\" At first, I thought she was uttering in foreign tongue cause I've been coming to this location for YEARS and we've never had to wait to be seated! Turns out, the place was fully booked. Full capacity- every booth and seat taken in the vast interior.  Very impressive. Easily I want to say over 250 people dining at the same time??? Way to go Sweet Tomato- you're doing something right!   I'm glad too- as I do enjoy the freshness and flavor of your soups and salads.  And I can't wait until when you bring your French Onion soup back again!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and i love sweet tomatoes.  This is the first time we've been to sweet tomatoes since moving to AZ.  I was impressed until i look up and saw the accumulation of dust and grease on all the rafters and watching it float down, knowing that it could get into mine or others food.   I get past that only to look in the kitchen and see two workers with long hair (1dark hair, 1blond) ladling soup from one urn to another. The blond kept shaking her hair back over her shoulder.  If you are going to be serving food or cooking the food you NEED to have your hair pulled back, by LAW!!! I will not eat here again, i don't want to eat somewhere that cares so little about health codes."}
{"text":"Went here last week for lunch and the manager was extremely rude. I couldn't find my coupons in my email and he kept repeating himself that they had been sent out 5 hours earlier. I showed him my email and he looked at me and huffed and said 'They were sent 5 hours ago!' I just looked at him and told him I haven't received them yet. He rolled his eyes and walked away. My husband loves this place but I hope we never go back here"}
{"text":"So the food is good. The price is ok even though it's on the rise. Tonight we come in get our food and half the tables are full and the other half are full of dirty plates. We had to clear our own table. Then the lady that was suppose to be cleaning is sitting at a table with I'm guessing her family. She sat there for a long time while people were looking for a place to sit. This place is really going down hill."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes is very good. I haven't eaten at a Sweet Tomatoes in years due to a bad experience with a different location. Surprisingly, this one is the best one from the management, kitchen staff and down to the food. Everything was fresh and delicious tasting. A well made salad truly does fill you up. I leave here very satisfied and hope to return again some day when I pass through Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place to have salad and soup.  Inexpensive and have got all regular veggies you want. No exotic vegetables.  Soups are generally good.  They also have some pasta, baked potatoes, muffins,  corn breads.  There is a small area for desserts.  Small but got all the right desserts.  I come here when I feel healthy under 10 bucks I get all the veggies I want."}
{"text":"I don't have much $ until pay day so I thought I would take my daughter here. I'm sorry I did.  The only thing that was decent was the pizza. And I said decent not good.  The soup selections were potato leak, chicken noodle, vegetable, and onion. Really bad choices. They use to have corn chowder, clam chowder, potato & chili. They really cut back. There was only one dry pasta. They use to have Alfredo & Marinara. The mac n cheese tasted like card board. The crotons weren't labeled and I took some on my salad. I decided to eat one off the top of my salad before eating it. It was loaded with garlic. Strong garlic. It somehow crossed through by nasal passages and I started tasting it through my nose it began burning and I started choking. I almost vomited before I began eating. The waiter didn't pick up the dirty plates right away either. I should've gotten fast food."}
{"text":"Thank God they decided to drop the idiotic Field kitchen concept and return to good ol' Sweet tomatoes. Good thing is that the new fancy remodel stayed, so it is very nice looking and enjoyable place to eat at. I am a fan of ST and finally enjoying this location again. However if you are planning to eat here, arm yourself with patience for restaurant filled with screaming kids and seniors at any given time."}
{"text":"Great place to fill your self with veggies and soups and so much more. Yummy! For me its a little pricey, so I always come prepared with a coupon on hand. They come once a month in your mailbox. Else sign up and get your coupons electronically and you are set. You basically save on cost of the beverage, but every dollar counts."}
{"text":"The summer favorites are great, I really enjoyed the strawberry salad & my friend liked the Sante fe. Lots of fresh options! I like to make a ice cream dessert with ice cream & chocolate muffin."}
{"text":"Vegas is KING of buffets and is known for its endless options. For locals..Sweet Tomatoes is a nice option for a 'salad bar' buffet off the strip.  It is reasonably priced and (generally) well-stocked (see my pics) . It is an exceptional choice for all the 'veggie nuts' out there and for those who are craving a heaping plate of refreshing greens. They also offer fresh fruit, a baked potato bar, homemade soup options, and your favorite drinks. It is A-OK for a cafeteria style eatery. Make sure you go online and get a coupon before you go- It makes the trip worthwhile and you'll have more cash for other things."}
{"text":"My standby for a hot summer day meal. Great build your own salad bar, so many veggies to choose from  & dressings. Good ice tea, lemonade also for those hot days. They also have a great selection of soups(I usually stay away from during the summer already hot outside) pastas, potatoes & muffins fruit & desserts with a healthy twist."}
{"text":"Hold the bloat!  Control what you eat along with sweet treats to achieve a vibrant VEGAN meal.  Wish they provided vegan soups as well.  The salad bar is fresh and crisp... the price for seniors from Monday through Thursday is $6.95 between 2 and 5 PM, and that includes a drink.."}
{"text":"I am not big on buffets but thought I'd have soup and salad this evening. If you are a big eater and don't care that much about taste then you may enjoy the food; however, I thought the chili was just so so- Wendy's chili is better. The salad was also meh-not impressed. I tried a few pasta noodles and they were well overcooked-mush-yuck. They had no lemon for my drink. The blueberry muffin was the best thing on the menu. Overall, I will not return. I'd much rather have soup and salad at Panera Bread. Hope this is helpful."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up salad. You know what you are getting when you come here.  I've had good customer service here.  I know that this posting isn't much use...but it's sweet tomatoes.  Grab a plate. Grab some salad. Have some soup and cookies. Then leave."}
{"text":"This place went downhill fast. You cant remodel the inside and downgrade the quality of food at the same time. The brownie was hard and was probably from lunch. All of our glasses were dirty. The pasta sauce was watery and the soups were bland."}
{"text":"This Is one of those places you go with the family after watching a PG movie or the usual spot you go to for lunch with the bff to catch on current events, gossip, the weather... I really enjoy coming here with my bff, he always gets the noodle soup without the noodles and I always dress up my baked potatoes with \"The Works\"..Great times are spent here."}
{"text":"2/27/2018  I stopped in with a guest for lunch. (We arrived right at noon and the place was filling pretty rapidly)  The parking was tight and several people seemed to be looking for a place to park.  This was my first visit to Sweet Tomatoes.  As you enter, there are trays and plates to grab and to go cups for soup (to go).  There was a counter with 2 isles with a variety of lettuce and salads  and a large variety of toppings to choose from.  After you pay, there is also a soup station with several different soups, muffins, (my guest commented several times how good the blue berry muffins were), brownies, pasta, and there was a lady cooking what looked like sauces (which I did not try).  There is a self serve fountain drink station and a self serve ice cream station.  I had bottled water to drink and my guest had coffee.  The bill was $27.00.  (The amount was paid after my salad choices were made and before any soup or dessert choices were made)  I thought this was a little high as most reviews were in the $10 range (per person), but you can have all you want of what is offered, so if you're really hungry, I guess it's worth it.  I was just thinking that $18 to $20 would be more in the price range. I would recommend giving this place a try as we enjoyed the eating experience."}
{"text":"Flipped a coin in my head and decided on Sweet Tomatoes instead of Jason's Delli, mistake! Prices are up, and quality down, and buss help must be at a premium. Lots and lots of empty tables and booths with empty plates and trays not picked up, and dirty tables. Salad was O.K. soup's were watered down. I selected split pea, not fully cooked through, the pea's were still crunchy. Next time in the area it will be something else...."}
{"text":"Excellent salad bar as always. I prefer this location over the other Sweet Tomato at Lake Mead because of the better seating  arrangement ( the other location tries to cram everybody into a smaller space).  The soup selection was good as always. The service was fast and friendly.  Will definitely come back again if in need of a salad fix."}
{"text":"I want to like Sweet Tomatoes more than I do.  I'm stuck at 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down instead of up.  Walk in, get your tray and plate(s), and go through the salad line.  Choose between pre-made salads (which are actually really good) and/or making your own with the ingredients down the bar.  Pay at the end of the bar, find a place to sit, then also help yourself to soup, pasta and the bakery.  As many trips as you'd like, as this is a buffet.    I really liked the pre-made spinach salad.  The apple walnut salad was okay.  Apple chunks were way too big.  And no berry vinaigrette dressing?  What up with that?  Where's the pistachios for salad topping?  Walnuts?  Pear or other fruit?  Cranberries?  The soup options were good.  I really liked the split pea and barley soup.  I wanted to try some of the others, but I ended up not having any room for more.  The two pasta options were really sad.  Dried up and not at all appetizing.    I struggle with the brownies, cookies and other sweet treats at an all-you-can-eat salad bar.  Does not compute.  People pick this place because they're trying to make healthy choices, right?  If they upgraded some of the toppings (included a variety of nuts and fresh fruit) and offered more healthy dessert options, I'd probably like this place better.  Oh, and the price is on the steep side.  $27 for two.  I can get a perfect portion of soup, salad and side of bread for $7 and change at Saladworks.  I understand the buffet has to pay for itself, but it is salad, afterall.  No expensive meats or seafood being served here."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes location was just fine. The service was great, and the food was decent. Nothing stand out about it, but it wasn't bad either. I would stop here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Not the place to go when you're on a diet! They have way more than just salad (which is fresh and tasty). I LOVE the blueberry muffins and the garlic bread. There are so many options here from soups to mac n cheese to baked potatoes, even ice cream and cobbler. Never been disappointed here, only negative I noticed is you gotta watch where you step. The floors are a little messy around the tables but everywhere else is clean."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say. I love Sweet Tomatoes and I always will.  I've been coming to this location since it opened at the Pavillions several years ago, and every time I'm out in AZ to visit my grammy, Sweet Tomatoes is a mandatory stop on the tourist to-do list.  The salad bar is extensive--anything you think you'd want to put on a salad, they've got it. How can you go wrong? In addition to salad, they have 8 different soups daily (which, I will admit, vary in their tastiness, but are altogether better than decent) and they've got their various pastas and breads, etc. I like the cheesy focaccia bread (sp?) that tastes a little garlicky.   There is more than enough good food here to fill you up to your own personal happy point, and they don't promise you gourmet food. This is a cafeteria/buffet type place, people. What's with all the expectations? You get what you pay for, they don't pretend to be something they're not--I love places that are what they are and don't apologize for it. Plus, they put out regular coupons, so automatically take 15% off that \"pricey\" price.  I don't think you can go wrong here. I'll be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place for the quality of their food and the all-you-can-eat atmosphere, but the place is a bit run down and feel like a really old restaurant. When we lived in California, this was the same thing as the Soup Plantation: all-you-can-eat salad bar, bakery, soups, and desserts for stuffing your face until you can't move anymore.  I usually pig out on the salad bar since their topping are stupendous and they even have my favorite for dessert: tapioca pudding!  If your'e looking for an inexpensive way to stuff your face with a healthy choice of foods, this is the place to go (just remember: a great salad with a ton of dressing isn't that healthy - haha)!"}
{"text":"Sometimes they have delicious soup and other times it's just alright. Luckily they always have some sort of chilli which I can never go wrong with.   There's a nice selection of salad and lots of different toppings and salad dressings. I also like that every month they have a certain theme for the food - one month it was lemon, and they had this really tasty cold lemon linguine pasta and some lemon flavored desserts. There's also a fair amount of soup to choose from. And I really like that they don't just serve the same food all the time. They always have new soup choices each week.   The place is clean and the food is pretty good if you're trying to be healthy. It's really sort of a hit or miss but I do find myself coming back here a lot. Mostly cuz they have chilli. Did I mention you can also make a baked potato?"}
{"text":"The time I went it was so gross. The food was stale and flavorless. I don't like leaving bad reviews but I honestly left feeling like I wasted money. I liked the salad bar but Sweet Tomatoes is meant to be more than just salad."}
{"text":"A healthy and affordable place.  They have some great salads because the greens are nice and crisp.  The premade salads are fairly better than average.  I like making my own.  The corn bread and other bakeries are the \"bomb-diggity\" meaning it's very good.  The soups weren't too great the last time I went.  A bit too salty.  The only other gripe I have is that the last time I went, it wasn't busy at all, but they didn't take away the plates on our table until we were nearly finished eating there, but usually they're good about it."}
{"text":"They seem to have worked out their kinks and are back on their game. Glad they're paying attention to the feedback. It's really a vital resturant in our community for  newly veggiesaurus's like myself."}
{"text":"Good place for salad bar. In addition, there are other options for non-salad lovers.  Large variety of soups and dessert options for all tastes."}
{"text":"Food is good but I have to say the place is filthy. Food debris all over clean dishes, buffet line un-maintained , cold soups and potatoes. I have been coming here for years and it seems like management has let this place go downhill. I hope they get back on track."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is pretty bomb, I'm not gonna lie. And you can find some great coupons online or in the paper.   There really isn't anything spectacular about Sweet Tomato. You'll find your average old people, families, etc. It's all very average. But still, very good when you're craving a huge salad and a bunch of salad-y stuff."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this chain in Clearwater, never upsets. Always fresh, delicious and accommodates even the smallest budgets.  Scottsdale Arizona location is a 5"}
{"text":"The salad bar lacked all kinds of meat for the salads.  When I asked where the basic meats were (ham, chicken, bacon, ANYTHING) the cashier said that too many people would get too much meat, so they stopped serving the meat....uhhh okay? Isn't it a buffet? Because that's kind of the point. That obviously wasn't the only place where they were cutting corners in regards to cost; the ice cream cones were the smallest I've ever seen in my life, as well as their ice cream bowls.  So, I got a basic soup bowl, and filled it with ice cream, and was able to fit almost ten cones around my ice cream, they were THAT small.  For the price they charge for consumers to eat only lettuce and soup, they should at least have some salad meat and ice cream cones bigger than my pinky nail."}
{"text":"I love this place and the variety of food they offer. I took a friend from out of town and she enjoyed it too. It's not expensive at lunch time and we definitely ate our money's worth. My only reason for not giving five stars is that perhaps there could be a segregated area for families with children. It was just a little bit hectic and I nearly got knocked off my feet several times by children running loose. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"This location is great.  The staff is always friendly, the food is fresh, and the place is clean every time we go.  We headed here last night and had another good experience. Instant food is always a plus when you just want to have dinner and go home without too much fuss.   The cornbread is one of my favorite things, especially with the honey whip butter.  Get some chocolate lava cake and put a bit of vanilla soft serve on it - you won't regret it!  Overall: A Quick and easy place to eat with fresh food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Lots of food. Mostly edible weird Taste in the potatoes. But the people who work there are hard working sweet people."}
{"text":"Friendliest, happiest staff ever. So friendly that it rubs off on the other customers. I love it here and my experience is great every time.  The food is fresh. A pretty healthy option if you're in Tempe.  Soups are"}
{"text":"Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so, when we were looking around for a place to grab some lunch a friend suggested we stop by Sweet Tomatoes.  It has been over 10 yrs since I've been to one, so I thought why not.  We arrived just before the lunch rush at 11:30 am.  There was a short line, but nothing crazy.  I piled a bunch of Salad and Pasta Salad on my plate and then made the rounds over to the Bread section. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=jRysLhaB-0yg5Wa2EYYQsw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NZAxQxXH0YkSzPOKd_Nv-w?select=L3xqRAzbnoT7e2khkOUW6w The food was very good, tasty and satisfying.  I went back to grab a small bowl of Mac n Cheese too, which was ok.  I had a coupon for 2 for $9.99, so it was a great deal.  Overall, the meal was perfect and I left full.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"I've become a fan of Sweet Tomatoes.  This location is the 2nd location I've dined at within the past 2 months.  I love the huge Salad Bar and the Bread station.  However, the discovery of the Froyo station was the find of the day!  AYCE Salad, Bread, and Froyo?!  I can deal with that!  **Hint** - Google \"Sweet Tomatoes Coupons\" and you'll find a ton of coupons on the web to use for discounted prices.  I took the family here for dinner and we only paid $7.99 each with the coupon....awesome!  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I love sweet tomatoes! I normally go to the one on Rainbow but this was closer to my boyfriends' place so we decided to try this location out instead.   The salad bar was great as usual. I seen a sign for garlic dressing so I put a little bit of what I thought was that on my plate. I tried it out and it tasted like Caesar dressing. They might need to change the sign for that.   My boyfriend and I thought the breads were kinda dry and a bit stale. Not as great compared to the Rainbow location. My favorite soup is the ginger soup because I like to add chicken from the noodle soup and put green onions in it with a bit of salt and pepper. Simple but I really like it that way. It's pretty much like the Hawaiian dish chicken long rice but, not lol. They had the sign for ginger soup up but below was this vegetable soup with small meatballs in it. Kinda disappointing. I didn't bother to try it. There was a new soup that I've never seen before called, Sriracha Udon. It was ok, kinda salty and the noodles were overcooked.   Dessert was ok. The ice cream was really light which I liked. The brownies didn't look very good. I didn't see a whole brownie in sight. And there was a sign for lava cake but I didn't see any. They should think about refilling the food a bit faster.   Overall, this trip was just ok and kinda disappointing. At least the service was good. The employees always came by to pick up the dishes. My boyfriend wanted to go to Buffet at Asia cuz he loves a buffet with a lot to eat. He chose the place last time so I chose this place. He seemed to enjoy this place more than I did lol"}
{"text":"Stopped by this location for lunch before a road trip to Los Angeles.   The family loves Sweet Tomatoes.  We arrived right in the middle of lunch time, so the place was packed.  Despite being busy, there was plenty of food on the line and it tasted good!  I had a huge plate of Salad, Cheesy Bread, Macaroni & Cheese, Soup, and a little Chocolate/Vanilla Swirl Froyo....yum!  One of the servers brought fresh Chocolate Chip Cookies to our table right out of the oven....although we were stuffed, we couldn't resist!  I'm sure we'll be back soon.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"We come here so frequently due to the simple fact that it's delicious and inexpensive. They recently had a huge remodel, providing a cleaner and more professional atmosphere to clientele.   I've never encountered old food (everything is usually fresh), and very rarely do I not like what I try. It's always pretty loud, but, then again, what can you expect from a quick buffet like this?   We once encountered an issue with the food, but the manager was on top of it. My fiancé took a bite of his salad and found a literal screw in the bowl (I assume that it was from a very rushed remodel). He wasn't hurt, wasn't offended, and calmly called over a waiter to find the manager. To me, the whole screw incident is an anomaly. The possibility of some idiot contractor leaving screws on a kitchen shelf where it could fall into a bowl is high. Immediately, before anything else, the manager pulled the salads and had them replaced. He apologized to us profusely and gave us several coupons for free meals with drinks. Awesome.  Honesty, I won't hold the whole screw thing against them. It was only a couple days after the remodel. Shit happens.   Either way, we're still happy to come in an devour all the cornbread. Because if I sit down at a restaurant with my fiancé, or I drive up for fast food, it will cost about $20.00+. Sweet Tomatoes is about $22 for two people with a coupon (which are constantly available). Might as well put in the extra two bucks for great food."}
{"text":"All the vegetables here come direct from a farm. I love that! They have a consistent, fresh supply of veggies and have great soups and muffins. The staff are delightful, and will go out of their way to help. Today one of the managers heated up muffins for me because I wanted them piping hot so I could indulge. (They are kept warm, not hot.) I really enjoy coming here. Every time."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. We are here once a month at least. I feel that this location offers more options on the salad bar then the one on Bell Rd. The muffins with the sweet cream butter are always delicious and one of our new favorites is the clam chowder with bacon."}
{"text":"\"It's good but idk its missing something. Don't get me wrong it has a lot of choices but ... idk\"    - My wife, A picky eater."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I ate at after moving to Las Vegas. Clean facilities, large variety menu with favorites and seasonal changes. Friendly staff. Military discount and many mail coupons very fair pricing. Desert options are a bit poor but they have soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Fresh, with great soups and breads at an excellent price. If you need to have a quick lunch, this is the place. Lots of healthy options here."}
{"text":"I do wish they'd veganize some of the pastas and breads and add tofu to the salad bar but I love coming here to get 4 humungous plates of salad. I've only been for lunch or dinner. It's not exactly cheap, either, but it's a pretty good deal for all that food. Employees are friendly, facility is clean."}
{"text":"Wow this place is fabulous.  Everything is so fresh and tasty that you can enjoy a healthy and yummy meal without breaking the bank.  The salad bar is huge and they have a fresh soup bar where you can choose numerous varieties of homemade soups.  Great tasting desserts and frozen yogurt machine.  Best Strawberry Lemonade I have ever tasted.  You have to try this place you will not be disappointed.  They need to open locations in the Midwest.  Also, I want to give a shout out to the server at the restaurant.  His name is Oscar and he is so wonderful and funny.  He made us all laugh and smile and Oscar is such a hard worker and everyone that visits this location has to say hello to Oscar because he is the nicest man ever!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first but once I went it was amazing. The food is oh so good and the staff is super nice and friendly. The restaurant was very clean and organized as well. would definitely recommend for green lovers as well as people looking for a healthy place to eat :))))!!"}
{"text":"The best buffet ever in Las Vegas or should I say the healthiest buffet in Las Vegas lol  I love the whole concept of all you can eat healthy food. It doesn't make you feel bad at the end Lol  I suggest this place as a first date. You can always judge a person by what they put on their salad. You should try it.   No like, the honey butter is amazing and my all time favorite!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I can eat so much and not feel bad about myself lol chocolate muffins are a favorite. Great choices on salads."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch date at this location, and found my food to be delicious. I loved my salad and soup, in which I was highly impressed with the calories listed on all the entries. The food also listed serving sizes on all the options. It was clean, and the staff were very friendly. Many options to choose from, and very friendly options if you are on a diet. You grab your tray, and start at the salads, then pay for your meal. They also honor seniors citizens discounts. Then, you are free to wonder and choose to eat more delicious foods presented in different categories."}
{"text":"My family and I usually go to the Sweet Tomatoes down off of Stephanie, so we were shocked to see how different this one was! It seems to have a better selection of food, drinks and even desserts. It's also set up better so that it's easier to get food going down the salad line and the seating is much more open. If I lived on this side of town I would definitely visit this location a lot more!"}
{"text":"will be trying ths place again next  week.  look for coupons and then the prce is more than reasonable.  i have a coupon for $29.99 for 2 adults and 2 children (under 12).....that's a deal.  i'm glad someone reviewed the rest rooms.. ugh.   sam s. complained about too many slow elderly people, she should hope she reaches that stage in life.  nasty person!  next time she goes to a restaurant   call ahead to find out what the age group is that day."}
{"text":"The Sweet Tomatoes concept works.  It works for the same sense it went with the new age of food awareness and adapted to where Sizzler fell off the edge of the world.  I like the fact you can come in, immediately serve yourself a very large variety of salads and the dressings, it's not too expensive, you can get a wide range of soups, and have a little dessert afterwards.  Oh, did I mention it's all you can eat?  I'm really wondering why I don't come here more often.  Will definitely be back again.  Parking is an issue however...always packed full of clog-gage."}
{"text":"It's not fine dining or whatever, it's just a family salad bar and sometimes you just want a salad. Sign up for the coupons and use them for better value and drink water. Expect what you pay for.  I am a vegetarian and I love eating here. They do charge extra for meat, but I think that is fair since I don't want to pay for something I will never, ever be indulging in. I appreciate their vegetarian options, however I wish they had more vegetarian soups on any given day. I always feel very disappointed when I pay and then end up with one soup choice that I don't care for. Lord knows they always have 8 different varieties of chicken soup. That is my only complaint, I love the vegetarian broccoli soup.  If you are shopping in Best of the West and need a quick, light meal then this place is for you. People bring babies though, so if you are looking for a candlelit luxury meal experience then you aren't going to find Gordon Ramsey in here...."}
{"text":"This place is so mediocre that I am surprised I find myself back there every few months.  I used to go to Souplantation in California, and this is the same restaurant with a different name.  Decent salads, but nothing fancy.  Above average soups and a couple other hot items.  It used to be super cheap, but it's pushing towards $10 now, which makes it not a great deal.  But sometimes I just want a quick meal and not deal with the wait of a Chili's, for example, and this place fills that niche."}
{"text":"Line stopped and wasn't moving for ten to fifteen minutes. With 3 kids trying to keep them from touching stuff, etc. not cool. Pasta salads were gross. Only thing good was chicken noodle soup, which was unfortunately just chicken and noodles, and ice cream. Then when we finally paid we had to wait again to be seated..this place is too busy for its own good..I stopped going up to the salad bar cuz there was so many people everywhere. Bus girl was great though."}
{"text":"Since my girlfriend and I could not find one decent establishment on the Vegas strip to get some good eats, we decided to look for Soup Plantation and we found its cousin Sweet Tomatoes. Like Soup Plantation we had a good happy stomach experience. Thats what I love about this place, it leaves your stomach happy. Salads are awsome especially when yo customize your perfect salad dream. From now on I will come here everytime I go to Vegas... At least I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Poor quality food even for a buffet style. Maybe it was just this location. But I don't see ever going to another one."}
{"text":"I frequently go to this location and love the experience here. The staff now knows my name and they are very friendly. The salad options are endless and they also have great cornbread. I love the variety in the soups as well."}
{"text":"Went there today for dinner.. the mens restroom was very dirty. Someone vomited all over the floor. After that my son found a fly in his salad. We left the place without eating. Never returning to this disgusting place."}
{"text":"Best salad bar anywhere. Healthy. Eight different  homemade soups. Pasta, bread, soft serve ice cream. Quality food at a good price. Lunch $10 pp. sign up for the mailer and get $2 off."}
{"text":"Personally, Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite places to eat. When i'm in a salad mood it can't be beat. (OMG that rhymed!!) But seriously...They have almost every salad topping that you could  want and the price is right.  Throw in some kick ass foccacia bread and those blueberry muffins and im in salad/carb heaven.   The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because the noise level can often be deafning b/c it is a family establishment. Seeing as  I dont have kids im not immune to the noise yet :)"}
{"text":"I think this location has slightly better prepared food. Then the one at rainbow and lake mead. You won't find wilted lettuce here! Please bring back the roasted garlic dressing...."}
{"text":"Yet another update. Cleanliness seems to be much better yay. Food is good,  wish they would offer more vegetarian and or gluten free soups however.  Service is always great. Manager is great as well,  nice to see a manager in front of house and interacting with customers/helping staff, props to him!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I take a book, and read while I munch a wonderfully fresh hand prepared salad, with all my favorites, and that Ranch dressing is to die for.   Don't get me started on the soups!! I live for their cream of celery soup, Campbells should be ashamed of themselves. This has wonderful big pieces of shroom, and celery. And the French Onion (cheese is available to put at the bottom of your bowl to make a goopy mess!), and the Clam Chowder, and the rest. I usually skip dessert in favor of more soup!!"}
{"text":"Terrible hardly any food re-filled. The ice cream machine is not keeping the ice cream cold it melts coming out. Just put some pizza out the crust is raw looks like another 5-10 mins to cook the dough crust.. Potatoe salad ugggg terrible. Pasta salad tasted like water. Been here many times this is the worst I have ever seen this place. Owed us a refund that is how bad it was"}
{"text":"@soupplantation has continued downward the last few years. This location - no cottage cheese; district manager doesn't think it looked professional? Yet, the utensils are dirty, pastas are cold and old, hot water for tea hasn't worked in months,etc.  I would not waste your time or money any longer with Sweet Tomatoes. Not until they kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch during the week. Just after 2:00 so not very crowded. Many tables dirty with floor staff chatting it up with friends. Several standard salad bar items were missing. I inquired about the cottage cheese. I was told they only have this on Saturday and Sunday. There were several items missing. Not sure if this is driven by local management to save $$$ or if it is franchise driven. If you are looking for a full salad bar during the week Sweet Tomatoes is no longer the \"full\" salad option."}
{"text":"Not where you want to head for lunch or dinner if you're looking for flavor or substantive food of any kind.  If you're like me, you may find occasion to steer yourself away from greasy burgers or deep fried things, and may end up here from time to time. You won't feel sick afterwards, or anything at all really, because it's just sort of like that.   The price goes up at dinner for the same non-descript mass that they serve on the buffet lines, so if you do go, save a couple bucks and hit it up at lunch time."}
{"text":"I went in here for my first time today, the front of the house staff was nice to everyone but me. They went from table to table checking on everyone except they skipped my table and I am sitting right here waiting to get acknowledged. The kitchen staff was very rude, they expect me to know where everything was in the restaurant so I had to find everything myself....  The food here is really good and healthy, their salads are fresh and constantly attended to. The kitchen staff at the hot bar was not as attending to the food, the pastas were dried out and I was waiting for them to attend to it but I guess that was acceptable. The food at the hot bar was decent.  Overall I would come back again and I know what to expect."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is one our favorite places to go.  This is the first time we've been to this location.  It was the worst experience ever.  We went this past Monday for dinner.  We both love Mexican food and welcome the variety at Sweet Tomatoes.  If we were in the mood for just Mexican, we would have gone to a Mexican Restaurant.  There was lime, cilantro and sugar in almost everything.  Soup: Chicken Tortilla, Mexican Stew, Posole.  Pizza: Quesadilla PIzza.  Baked Potatato station: Pico de gallo, cilantro (no chive available) --we asked.  Pasta:  Cilantro Lime Penne Pasta (the sauce was separated, greasy and sweet) it was the worst pasta I ever had.  BTW all three pasta choices were penne pasta, even the \"macaroni\" and cheese.  Dessert:  Margarita Muffin-- my husband literally spit it out and asked me to taste it. I of course didn't.  Don't me wrong we love Mexican food.  It may have even been ok if it tasted good but it didn't.  There was only vanilla soft serve available but there was still chocolate dripping down the machine and in the receptor.  My husband is a Chef and I am a pastry chef.  We go to Sweet Tomatoes due to the consistency of quality, product and service.  We will never go to this location again.  We may try the Summerlin location or another in Las Vegas one more time to give it one more chance.  I am hoping it isn't a company or regional decline.  The only reason I gave one star is because the one busser that was working the rush alone was extremely friendly,  cleared everyone's dishes and sanitized tables promptly with such a positive and cheerful disposition."}
{"text":"Very fresh food! I love the variety of items to make your own salad! Also nice that they had a bunch of hot items to choose from! Only 4 stars, because the counters and floors could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Loved the caesar salad and choco mini cupcakes. Everything so fresh and diming area spotless. Staff v friendly!  Wish we had this restaurant where i live in MA"}
{"text":"I love the idea and the value of Sweet Tomatoes.  I wished they could open shop in Hawaii because that is something my state lacks.  The salad bar is fresh and there is a lot of different toppings for all tastes.  Lots of beverage options as well.  The soups are my favorite.  There will always have their classics but some of their rotations are delicious.  I always look forward to seeing what they have.    It is simple, affordable, and no fuss.  You can make it as healthy or not as you want.  Sweet Tomatoes is one of my favorite restaurants in the area.   PS: 15% off your bill with Yelp check in!!!"}
{"text":"World class service and a great healthier selection of food is what always brings me back to this location, time and time again!!! Thank you guys for providing the type of experience you rarely find in the service industry any more. See ya tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"A staple for my wife and I.  We left church late one day and needed a place to eat.  Sweet Tomatoes here we come!  There have been some changes lately at sweet tomatoes.  Some of them have been changed to a different format with a new name.  The food at the new place is not bad but when we're in the mood for a nice quality salad buffet it's nice to know there are still some sweet tomatoes with the old format.  The new place makes you pick what you want to eat and have a very limited all you can eat selection.  The service at this particular sweet tomatoes was awesome also.  We showed up late and before we left, the manager approached us with paper bags and told us to fill it up with all the baked goods we could take since they were just going to throw it away at the end of the night anyway!  We thought that was really nice."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of my favorite places to eat for a few reasons.  1. I don't have to wait to eat.  2. The buffet is always stocked and fresh.  3. Health, health, health.  I look forward to it when I have the chance especially if I'm feeling guilty about eating pizza and hot wings with extra ranch dressing the night before.  The parking at this one is great and there is also patio seating."}
{"text":"So we went out to stress eat - ok - I convinced my husband to take me so I could stress eat - cause why not!?!?  Ok. First it's fiesta month and there are sooooooooo many GLUTEN FREE options right now. I completed fell in love with about five GF Horchata muffins, yes, I'm a foodie who knows what's good and over enjoys.   Anyway, what made my night where the two gentlemen on the way out. One had cleared our table and the other appeared to be a shift manager perhaps? Ok, they made my night!!! Our server guy must of said something because they were about to close and all these lonely looking horchata muffins must of been in need of someone to go home with. So, they gave me a little white paper bag and I loaded one, two, three - ok 5 muffins - into the bag.   Made my night boys, made MY night.  Thank you Sweet Tomatoes and your always amazing staff!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Feeling grateful and appreciated. I am a vet who served 21 years in the Navy. I took my family of 5 to this restaurant on Veterans day. I showed my military ID and the lady at the register gave us a 50% discount of the total bill. A co-worker behind her, probably her manager must have said something to her because she pointed at me. It's a small amount but it's the little things like this that make a difference. It made our day and I think we're going to be regular customers here. Btw, the food and service was and is always great."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch for salad/soup/pasta. It also has a dessert line so save room! Staff keeps the inside clean and we were offered 10% off our meals for signing up for coupons. The only thing my husband mentioned was to add breadsticks for the soups and to have marinara sauce for dipping. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so healthy, but it tastes amazing! It's great for kids and their desserts are the bomb! Words can't describe how much I love this place."}
{"text":"TIP: Check in on Yelp for a discount!  PROS:  Cheap - 10 bucks for all you can eat lunch. Sold!   Options - Salad bar. Soup bar. Baked potato bar. Focaccia bar. Dessert bar. Ice cream. Fruit. Tea. [I had a salad and sampled two of the soups - nothing extraordinary but no complaints as to taste/quality]  Healthy - If you avoid certain dressings and foods here, you can eat a very healthy meal.  CONS:  Dirty dishes! Almost every plate I picked up was poorly washed. The first fork I grabbed had lettuce stuck on it.   Expensive bottled water - 2.99."}
{"text":"When I think of buffet-type establishments, I have horrifying flashbacks of being drug into Old Country Buffet by my Grammy, who clearly lacks taste buds.. From the clientele to the cold mashed potatoes, I get really grossed out & am anti buffet. *With one exception, - Sweet Tomatoes.  I generally have a hard time finding places to eat with family & friends, since I'm so picky when it comes to dining. I like to think of myself as an \"Educated Eater,\" but, my family calls it being a \"Food Snob.\" With Sweet Tomatoes, we are able to accommodate both appetites. My friends get their pasta/bread/desserts, & I get my greens, win/win! From what I've been told, everything is Organic & also Gluten Free(by the way, I think all the Gluten Free hype is bs).  - The salad portion of the restaurant is made up of the freshest greens & toppings, you will find. The dressings are made from scratch, in-house as well. At the potato station, you can choose between Russet or Sweet & load accordingly. The bread is baked in-house, and rotates flavors each week. All soups are original Sweet Tomatoes recipes, and rotate weekly(*their vegetable soup is awesome). There's a dessert station complete with a soft serve ice cream machine.  The only thing Sweet Tomatoes doesn't have, is meat. Which has made it impossible for me to get my, vegetable loathing, boyfriend to go there with me."}
{"text":"Good service and friendly employees. Great place to stop for lunch. Price is reasonable. Food is fresh. Facility is clean. Several different foods to choose so everyone is happy. Salads, Soups, pizzas, pastas and desserts"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy coming here when we feel like we have been eating too much meat or excessively greasy foods.   Sweet Tomatoes has everything you could possibly want to make the salad of your dreams. Personally, I like having some of their already made Caesar salad, as well as making my own salad on a separate plate. They also have at least 4 or 5 soups, two different types of pizza, pasta,macaroni and cheese, a build your own baked potato station, two different types of muffins, and a self-serve ice cream machine (possibly yogurt, I'm not sure now that I think about it).   The soups, pasta, and muffins change every now and again. My guess is that it changes based on the season. The staff is usually friendly, although I remember having an issue once and the lady behind the counter pretty much blamed me for it. Also, the ice cream machine ends up out of service every few times I go. Other than those two things, this place is great to get your greens and be full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (40 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!  Sweet Tomatoes is my go to spot when I want to eat healthy after a work out.  I love their salad display.  They have everything you need to make your salad nice and hearty the way you like.  They also offer extra options at a small price such as tofu, chicken pieces, and edamame.  I think those items shoule be free though because it's already quite pricey here in the first place.  But then again, it is a buffet so I can't complain.  1 star = for their salad display as described.  2 stars = for the honey whipped butter; it's so good!  3 stars = corn bread muffins they always have.  And their limited offered Chocolate Chip muffins are soooooo good, I can eat like 7 in one sitting.  Their Banana Crunch muffin tops are super good too!  4 stars = for having different items; it's never the same except for their regulars but it's nice to have some twists every now and then.  5 stars is lacking because of the price, but they do have coupons every now and then so that's good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to come after working out at the LVAC down the street.  It's dumb for me to come here because I have all the greens and chicken or tuna at home but everything is ready for me here to put on a plate and eat!  I probably waste $10 every time but I don't care.  I usually stuff myself with 4 plates of salad and cheat with their bread sides, potato, or corn bread.  The items are always replenished when running low, and tables are always clean.  People always come in with coupons, where the heck do you get those?  :P  It's always packed in there but there's always room to sit, very nice.  When I think about it, I drop $40 a week here after my gym sessions.  Yikes.  But I keep coming back!  Yelp Pro-Tip:  Their premium section is a one time through fee, so I like to grab a second plate and stack chicken and whatever toppings I'll need for the rest of my sitting."}
{"text":"I usually end up here once a month or so for some reason because I find myself craving some veggies.  Lunch is pretty reasonable for around the $7 range per person, but I think dinner is a bit pricey at about $9 a pop.  Damn the stinking economy even makes getting a salad harder to do.  But this place is considered vegetarian heaven.  When you first walk in, you see trays to the left or right of you.  The place is kind of like a cafeteria in the sense that you take a tray, a plate, and concoct your own salad with the fixins'.  They have a TON of stuff to choose from like spinach, romaine lettuce, pickles, peppers, cheese, croutons, even my fav alfalfa sprouts, and lots of other fresh things.  They have a few special or house recipe salads at the beginning of the line.  My fav is the Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad, I get it every time and it usually fits the bill.   I do get a little greedy sometimes though and take as much of the chicken as I can find because as you can tell, meat is sparce in this place.  But you can buy a little container of extra chicken for $1.25.  To me it's not worth it.  I just go and jack extra chicken form the Chicken Noodle Soup and cut it up to throw on my salad...ha ha.  They also usually have a decent house Caesar salad and a special salad that changes monthly according to one of their themes.  After you go down the line you and choose what you want, you get to the end and pay for your drinks and meal.  Then you get seated, or if it's not busy you can seat yourself.    They also have a soup area with at least 5 or 6 different soups daily, with staples like Chicken Noodle, and Chile Con Carne.  Their Cream of Mushroom soup is great (I think it's only on certain days..Tuesday?) because it's got lots of fresh mushroom in it.  You can also make yourself a baked potato with butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, green onions, and onions.  Not to mention they also have a bakery section that features breads, muffins, pizza bread (great with their killer Ranch), garlic bread, and even gooey chocolate cake or cobbler (dinner only).  They also got a fresh fruit bar, build your own sundae bar, and a pasta station with 3 diffferent selections to choose from.  The food here is pretty fresh and not bad at all.  If you enjoy a salad and soup you will like this place.  I usually find myself craving for a steak or a rotisserie chicken however after I eat here.  For some reason, not having a hunk of protein on my plate leaves me hungry.  Good thing all their food is fresh, otherwise this probably wouldn't be a great place to eat.  I can eat at least 2 plates though of their Won Ton Chicken Happiness salad.  AND at least 6-8 pieces of their pizza bread (only from the MIDDLE part...ha ha) with Ranch.  They got good Strawberry Lemonade too.   Their sundae bar ain't too bad even though it's standard fare from a soft serve machine.  You can make one with vanilla or chocolate ice cream, Oreo crumbles, sprinkles, chocolate, caramel, pineapple, and cherries.  They have these little, itty, bitty baby cones to put ice cream in (I guess this is to cater to the little ones).  I ALWAYS, ALWAYS try to fill one of these little cones up and it overflows, causing ice cream on my hand.  Never fails.  Maybe they can install something to make the ice cream come out a little slower?  I don't know.    Eat here if you're craving a salad (a lot of us don't), enjoy freshness (at a bit of a price), and are vegan or vegetarian.  Actually, we all should enjoy freshness at a salad buffet.  Me, I like my salad with a hunk a meat on the side."}
{"text":"Always fresh and good.  I only go there for the muffins and salads.  Their pastas and soups are bland and tasteless.  Plus it seems like the price goes up every time I go there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Sweet Tomatoes on the planet.  The food is delicious %90 of the time.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is in great shape considering it's age and the volume of customers."}
{"text":"We go to Sweet Tomatoes around once a month. It's very family friendly, as I have a 19-month old, and she seems to love eatting all the fresh veggies. It's a bonus that we do not have to pay for her yet.   Today was the first time I can remember going to Sweet Tomatoes without a coupon so we were a little surpirsed to be dropping $27 for soup, salad, and bread. Typically there is a coupon in the paper every week so take advantage of looking there first if you like to save a buck like I do."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, and this place is kinda like cafeteria style where you get your salad and then you pay. It was really crowded on a Friday afternoon. They have a few selections of soup and about three different styles of pasta and some bread, and potatoes. The salad tasted decent. There wasn't any meat in any of the pasta (tiny meatballs in one of the pasta that was all scooped up by others). I tried the clam chowder soup and it was good. The chicken noodles soup was bland and the noodle was kinda too al dente, don't see what is the hype about the chicken noodles soup. The chili was just thick and not that tasty, I feel that the chili from Wendy's is better. There are a bunch of different toppings for the salad and a variety of salads. I got the blu cheese dressing and it is too tart. I am not that impressed with sweet tomato.  Also, when I went back to get a little more salad the cashier told me that she would ring me up, I thought it's a buffet. Fail"}
{"text":"Ate dinner tonight at this location and it will be the last time.  The offerings don't seem to be as fresh or maintained as the Best of the West location.  The salad bar was kind of messy ( the restaurant was mildly busy but not at full capacity) although the premixed salads were good. The bread offerings were slim.  The Lemon Cream Pasta with capers sounded good but it was odd tasting- maybe too much lemon?  The desserts were in shambles which was likely due to the many young children serving themselves without adult supervision.  I noticed that the staff clearing the tables of dishes were busy and efficient.  Maybe it was a an off night although I have been here a small handful of times and each time I leave feeling disappointed.  It is definitely not run as well at the Lake Mead/Rainbow location."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened but Sweet Tomatoes is quickly turning into a whole other kind of tomatoes!   I have been going here since they first opened 10-11 year ago...Back in the day I would have easily given this place 4-5 stars!   Did not recognize one employee here which is UNUSUAL-one thing that I liked about ST is that they seemed to have a very low turnover rate which usually is a good sign for a restaurant.  There was a warning sign posted on the front door stating that due to the recent bouts of weather they were out of several vegetable items...Totally understand- But the \"Wonton Chicken Happiness\" salad was minus the happy chicken as was the tossed chicken Tarragon salad sans the chicken...Would have appreciated the \"chicken shortage\" sign as well... The veggies did look fresh-never a complaint about that.  ST is pretty vigilant in keeping their salad bar clean.  The soups were good except for the pumpkin soup-it couldn't make it's mind up between being a sweet or savory-pick a side & stay there!    There was plenty of pickings from baked sweet potatoes & regular baked potatoes to the many breads & muffins...  And then we got to the pasta bar...The Garlic Alfredo was watery and about as tasty as milk soup.  They were also serving scalloped potatoes-the spuds did not seem thouroughly cooked and the cheese sauce was watery.  Blecch...   The apple cranberry cobbler looked like it had been sitting out since lunch and what was left would not be anough to put in one of the paper dressing cups.  (It was 6pm-Prime dinner rush-I noticed that same pan out for at least 20 minutes before my husband asked the nearest server if there was fresh pan) There was & it was served.  No one offered us refills of water (never had to ask before).  In the past , you could barely bat an eyelash before your dirty plates were removed by attentive staff.  Ours actually piled up a bit and one server actually left the swampy looking potatoes behind which made me relive that disgusting moment.   I'm going to have to see some awesome Yelper reviews before going back..."}
{"text":"Always super busy but good if you want a quick sit down lunch. They are fast to bus the tables and if you are lucky they are handing out warm cookies which I love.  The kids like to eat here too.... Mostly for the ice cream and sweets."}
{"text":"In a soup and salad mood? Go to sweet tomatoes!! It's AYCE salad and soup..  but they also have some other goodies, such as garlic bread, cheese pizza, baked potatoes, muffins, and ice cream.. and this is all also AYCE! The price is absolutely worth it. It's vegan and gluten friendly. Service is always friendly. I love this place"}
{"text":"This used to be a fav spot of mine. But the constant choices of soups: bloated chicken noodle , tasteless chili and the rest of the salty broths... When u scoop the chicken noodle from the bottom, it's like a dead fish coming to the surface lol....* I've been looking for CLAM CHOWDER FOR MONTHS. Salad bar is nice except for the awful salad dressing DRENCHED  pre- made mixes...but they also removed any eggs (protein) mistake.If u have a coupon during lunch then it's worth it I suppose. Hope they improve the soups. Staff however is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"I love coming to Sweet Tomato . But this time was a little different. As soon as I walk in I make eye contact w/ one of the employees and she is putting food in her mouth while stocking up the salad bar. I know working in the food industry your a temped to have quick sample. But do not do it while working!! It's unsanitary to watch someone stock a salad bar and putting pickles in her mouth at the same time. Not once but twice. You are using the same gloves that you put that pickle in your mouth with, to touch other food with that same glove is not okay. Hopefully next time that is not the first thing I see when I walk in my favorite salad bar."}
{"text":"Have been going to Sweet Tomatoes for years, both at this location and the location on 75th Ave and Bell Road.   You can't go wrong at either place but this location has such a friendly, welcoming staff and the food is so fresh.  There is something for everyone at Sweet Tomatoes.   Huge salad bar with a variety of prepared salads and build your own.   Also, homemade soups and hot pastas.   Muffins, focaccia pizzas, sweet and baked potatoes, cornbread.    Puddings, jellos, fruits and frozen yogurt with various toppings for dessert.   They keep the salad bar spotless.   If so much as a crumb falls on the counter they are there quickly to remove it.  If you haven't already, give Sweet Tomatoes a chance.   Sign up for their \"Club Veg\" and they will send you weekly coupons via e-mail.   Also, they usually have coupons in the Sunday Arizona Republic."}
{"text":"I tried so hard to like you, Sweet Tomatoes. But you just broke my heart.    Coming from Southern California, we have Souplantion rather than Sweet Tomatoes but they're both pretty much the same thing. So I expected it to be the same as its SoCal counterpart in terms of service and quality.   Granted, my mother and I came at the end of lunch rush and as expected it was a bit busy. So I understand if the buffet lines weren't cleared up. There's a constant inflow of people and it's hard to keep wiping after them. But the thing is that half the trays and plates were wet. The damp trays didn't bother us as much but the plates were a tad bit gross. We shifted through a couple plates to find a dryer ones and even then, our food had an after scent/taste of dish washer water.   The service and food were fine. Our busser occasionally checked up on us to take away our empty plates. The food was fresh, of course. The blueberry muffins were perfect today! The muffin top had the right amount of crisp while the inside was very warm and fluffy! If only they had Clam Chowder :'(  The trays and plates were a turn off. But I might try the other Sweet Tomatoes in town! We shall see then~"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Sweet Tomatoes but I usually go to the Henderson location since it is closer to my house. A couple co-workers wanted to go to a salad bar for lunch last week, and after less-then-stellar service at the place we had been going for our rabbit food fix, we decided to drive a little further and give this Sweet Tomatoes a try. As usual, I had a coupon thanks to the Sweet Tomato email club.   We arrived right before noon on a Friday and there was only one group of customers ahead of us, and numerous tables open, so no waiting. All of the food bins on the salad section were well stocked. In the prepared food sections they had fresh corn bread muffins and cheese bread sticks to go along with the homemade tomato soup that was the special for the month. There was also some pasta but it didn't look that appealing.   Staff was exceptionally friendly, even when were walking out every employee we passed said goodbye and wished us a good afternoon."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes on Sunday mornings. I get coupons for Sweet Tomatoes emailed to me each month, that makes the price pretty reasonable.   Sweet Tomatoes is a good salad bar during the week but on Sunday they open early (9 am I believe) and serve breakfast items. We went this morning and in addition to our salads we had a waffle (me), french toast, scrambled eggs (husband) and home fries (both) as well as the very yummy blueberry muffins. Plus coffee and juice for $20 total.  For lunch and dinner, they do serve more then just salad... Baked potatoes, soups and pasta dishes are also included in the price. It's all on the healthier side, but nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! We were greeted as soon as we started our salad plates. The cashier was very friendly  and thanking people for dining with them. The food was so yummy and fresh. I really enjoyed the Blue Cheese & Spiced Pecan Lemon Tossed salad and broccoli salad. The split pea and cream of mushroom soup was top notch. Definitely looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We have always loved this place and this is our favorite location unless we meet  friends who live further south of us and then we go to Tempe location. The food has always been excellent and fresh and about the only place we go out to eat  Please do not change this great place to a Soup Nazi Field Kitchen or we will not return since we went to the one in Tempe and it was horrible and like some alternate universe ST and these good ratings will be dropping like a rock as have all the other locations that changed.. ."}
{"text":"Please stay this way. I live by Arrowhead and have to drive to this location now. I love Sweet Tomatoes. I always bring a coupon, and we eat for a reasonable price. I am able to get a variety of foods that my baby and I can try.  Its great. It doesn't need to change to a Field Kitchen.   I love the salad bar and all the premade salads. My baby loves the mac and cheese. She will cut you for it! She is that crazy about it. I am not a terrible mom, though, and only giving her mac and cheese, she gets salad and different veggies, she eats all the soups, and tons of fruits. Mac and cheese is her little bonus.   Ugh the only thing is that I eat waaay too much here. I have to learn some self control. I am not trying to fill up on the delicious salads. They are so good.   Anyways, check them out. Its fast, fun, and kids love it."}
{"text":"Thank goodness Sweet Tomatoes is back. I have missed you! I hated driving down to the Phoenix location to get my fix. I was back here the day it re-opened. There are still remnants of the Field kitchen, but thats ok, as long as most of my Sweet Tomatoes is back. They kept the beer and wine so that should make my dad happy!  I don't really have much to add except that it was just like I remembered. The coupons are back so I can feed me, my husband, and baby for less than 20 and give them healthy options. There are not a lot of places like that in Arrowhead. So I am very happy."}
{"text":"I am NOT a fan of Sweet Tomatoes. This location is always packed with soccer moms and their kids and I don't get why. The salad bar is fine but it's overpriced and has cheap ingredients. My biggest pet peeve is that even though the restaurant's name is Sweet Tomatoes, they don't even have sweet cherry tomatoes on their salad bar! What the heck? I know cherry tomatoes are pricey but c'mon, that's your namesake for crying out loud!  This place tries to lure you in by claiming to be \"healthy\" but it's really carb central in disguise. While it's true you can eat reasonably well at the salad bar, the food bars are a different story. Bread, pizza, macaroni and cheese, pasta, sugar and starch laden soups, baked potatoes....not a lot of options for the healthy eater. How about adding some steamed vegetables or something? Although it's an all you can eat restaurant, I often leave here hungry because there's hardly any protein!  This place is overpriced and low quality. You can do better. And I don't know if it's some sort of additive they put on the salad bar but every single time I eat here, I get tummy troubles. No kidding."}
{"text":"We enjoy sweet tomatoes mainly because the menu keeps changing. You also eat til you can't eat amymore."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to Sweet Tomatoes- had actually been bugging my boyfriend to go with me for a few weeks. Finally, we went on a Saturday for dinner and it was insanely crowded. It took us about 15 minutes to get through the salad bar and pay, before we waited another 10 minutes (while staring at our salads) for a table to open up to sit down. So, we sat down, I enjoyed my salad, went up for some soup (ick... not again). I was still hungry, but the thought of standing in the salad line again was unbearable.   There were many good options on the salad bar, but almost everything up there, aside from the lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, etc, (think pasta salads, potato salads, veggie mixes) was coated in a thick sauce, which takes away from the \"eating healthy at the salad buffet\" idea.    I've learned my lesson. I'd rather get a big salad from a sit-down restaurant for the same price"}
{"text":"I like this place.  There are a lot of food options and it is wonderful for a large group.  My fav part is MILK is a part of the beverage options.  I love bag milk, reminds me of college dorms.  It's very yummy.  Avoid the pre-made salads, they are pretty soggy.      Quick Tip: They always have coupons when you sign up for their email list."}
{"text":"Ewww!! Totally grossed out. I can't believe what I saw! Never eat here again. I noticed as I was going up to get more food employees eating behind the food bars and you won't believe this by also spotted a RAT underneath a booth bench. Scared the living day lights out of me. Ran out of the restaurant as fast as I could. Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and food is always fresh. Great experience each time I come in. Can be a bit pricey if you're not very hungry. Come hungry and get your monies worth."}
{"text":"If you've never been to this chain, here's my basic buffet-exploration strategy: get one plate of stuff in the salad line, take small amounts of anything you want to try, then sample any soups, bread items, or pastas that you think you'd like. Only after that should you go back for seconds. I think I ignored the perhaps underrated soups too much in my early days, but I'm making up for it these days, and the classic shrimp bisque (seasonal item) was quite good, as was the chili. Throw in your choice of toppings such as oyster crackers and cheese and you've got quite a treat. Watch out for the chicken pot pie stew next week or in the future too, and if they ever bring back that golden yam bisque, mm mm!  Don't forget dessert. They have pretty good fruit, but I always flock to the fro-yo. Dreyer's/Edy's is the best frozen yogurt that I've ever had at any sort of buffet, and there's some decent toppings available (although I still mourn the loss of toffee bits).  I've been to this location 3 or 4 times, but I haven't bothered to write a review before for some reason. On one of those visits, I remember being fairly impressed that the employees sang happy birthday to someone here, so that was nice. The big plus side of this location is the granola breakfast cereal that they serve on Sunday mornings (along with the rest of their breakfast menu, which I highly recommend). I haven't seen the granola anywhere else. The big minus is that it's the least spacious of all the locations that I've been to, even to the point that they didn't have tuna tarragon for some reason this morning. I thought that they'd always carry this classic, which is one of my favorites pre-mixed salads, but nooo.... Also, they were out of tortillas for some reason when we first got here and wanted breakfast burritos, but they brought them out later.  In spite of not feeling good enough about this location to bestow upon it all 5 stars, I'm always very happy to eat here and I hope that I'll introduce a lot of friends soon.  P.S. Has anybody bothered to stack a plate or two with premium toppings? I'm thinking of doing that some day if I wanna splurge..."}
{"text":"We stopped at this location a few days ago. We do enjoy the salad bar and baked potatoes. The absolute best part of the visit was creating my own root beer float, yummm!"}
{"text":"All you can eat fresh produce. Pile it high as you like with amazing variety.  For those inclined, there are a variety of soups, pastas, breads and cookies as well as soft serve ice cream, fruit and pudding.   Really, you can be as healthy . . . or not . . . as you like.  A variety of soft drinks, beer and wine.  The price is incredibly reasonable. One could not produce this meal at home for what Sweet Tomatoes charges.  The only risk in coming here is eating too much . . . and taking in too much roughage.     Its a terrific place to grab a bite if you're hungry.   Long on vegetables, short on meat, worth coming in and taking a seat!  Soups are many and taste very good, pizza is there as you know it should, baked potatoes, loaded as you like, a fine way to spend dinner tonight."}
{"text":"I used to come here and enjoy a nice salad bar I can make myself with some other bakery, soup and desert options on the side. But this last visit I had last night with my friend was one of the worst. The spinach I had to choose from was not fresh. The chocolate mouse that I used to love, tasted just awful ! it tasted like it had some sort of chemicals in it...disgusting. And when I tried to get a chocolate vanilla swirl ice cream it was ALL LEMON! No sign on it or anything to indicate that it wasn't what it portrayed itself to be. I will not be coming back to this over expensive establishment they call Sweet Tomatoes....more like Rotten Tomatoes."}
{"text":"While I am a regular at your various locations, this was the first time I ever tried this one on Ray Rd.  We arrived after shopping, so it was later in the evening.  But, we were not greeted by the cashier in a friendly manner; in fact, she was borderline rude with an attitude.  She acted as if we were a burden.  The food, naturally was good and fresh.  Once we sat down though, the waitress was very friendly and was very accommodating.  I don't think we had a dirty dish on our table for more than 5 mins and the place was packed.  So she really saved the image of this particular establishment/location."}
{"text":"This location appears to be the former retrofit of \"test kitchen.\" The selection of veggie selections is less than the original Sweet Tomatoes.  But still a great place to get your salad on.  I was ecstatic to see they had cream of mushroom soup too.  The service overall is good, but not as friendly as other locations I go to.  If I am in the area, I would definitely stop; but wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this location for over 20 years. We got hooked on it while in college and now it's a favorite with our kids. Salad bar is great and you can create your own huge salad just the way you like it. Soup and pasta bars are great too.  Can be busy depending on when you come. We usually try to arrive on the off times and can get a quiet clean table. If you go when it's busy, it's hit or miss."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday after Church with some friends. Holy Toledo the place was packed! I know this os winter in the Valley of the Sun, so the snowbirds are here, AND it was a Sunday, but the line was almost out the door. Anyways, they advertise their 47' salad bar, snd they are not kidding! There are several types of lettuces and mixes to start your creation. Then the topping options are endless. The veggies were crisp and fresh. What I liked the most is they have things that could be potential food allergy triggers clearly labeled so there is no question. I fixed my salad, paid for our order( which was 15% off due to a check on offer!!) and we all found a seat. Besides the salad bar they also have a 'hot' bar with pastas, breads. Soups, and baked regular and sweet potatoes with all the fixings. There is also a generous dessert bar.  I felt the restaurant was a tad dirty for my liking, but I understand with the mass volume or people, it was hard to keep up. My husband and I will be back to Sweet Tomatoes, to indulge in another yummy salad creation!"}
{"text":"I've signed up for their emails and always come with a coupon that takes anywhere from 15-30% off the meals! I love sweet tomatoes cause it's slightly healthier than the standard all you can eat since you can take advantage of all the great dishes they have on their salad bar including their Caesar salad/chicken wonton happiness salad, Joan's broccoli salad, and there's a medley of vegetables/toppings/dressings if you want to make your own salad! They also have about 8 soup options everyday as well as a host of Focaccia breads, pastas, muffins/corn bread, and a sweet potato/baked potato bar as well.   This location has a touch screen soda fountain as well which is pretty nifty. And you can end every meal with some frozen yogurt (chocolate, vanilla, or mixed). This is my goto when in craving some greens!"}
{"text":"Did I really just pay twenty eight bucks for two small plates of lettuce and two small sodas? Yes I did. And I feel mighty ashamed. Throw in terrible, bleak, sick looking decorations while I eat my thirteen dollar salad and I feel even worse. And add another two dollars if you want chicken on that already pricey salad. I don't know, maybe if you're a slob who takes a dozen trips to the buffet it could be worth it, but I just wanted a salad. I am not a fan."}
{"text":"Pros: Close location to campus Serves alcohol Good muffins Variety of soups, so if you're picky there'll be at least one that you'll like Usually the salad is fresh Casual Has pasta and pizza and baked potatoes  Cons: The bathrooms are ALWAYS dirty (not just this location, seems like every) Not enough fruit at this particular location, and when they do there's a chance it's not fresh Kinda pricy if you add beverages and don't have a coupon and aren't prepared to eat your money's worth Not enough Asian dishes, and when they do it's for way too short of a time (please continue lobster curry or any type of other Asian soups and pastas!)  BUT overall, my go to place for a less guilty buffet experience."}
{"text":"If you're ever tired of deciding where to eat, you can always follow senior citizens that are leaving the mall.   I was pretty hungry and the mall food looked a little too Metrocenter so I headed outside to find food. I scanned the horizon and found exactly what I was looking for - a wild pack of sweet golden girls laughing all the way to a minivan.   I kept an eye on these beautiful, silver-haired sherpas because you and I both know they love a deal. Their cost-effective whip turned a careful right into Sweet Tomatoes and piqued my interest immediately.   The line going in was ridiculous - they make you get a salad before you pay, so you stand in line forever to make a salad while they hide the macaroni and cheese from you around the corner on purpose.  They have pretty good quality hot food, like soups and other inferior and less cheesy pastas. They thought they were pretty smart putting that salad up front to get you to fill up on green leaves, but you don't have to play their game. Just wait in line and make hard eye contact with everyone holding a salad plate so they recognize you as true brunch alpha and let you through to the bacon mac and cheese.   price: 6/10 (pretty cheap @ $12/person) salad: 5/10 (very little meat choices, premixed salad) soup: 7/10 (spice it up by stealing toppings you already paid for from the salad bar) bread: 9/10 (it's bread come on) pasta: 6/10 (add toppings, if you don't you'll be in bland city) drinks: 7/10 (lemonade and hibiscus tea are great) dessert: 5/10 (ice cream machine with toppings, tapioca, jello)  If you're looking for a good deal, they cater to a coupon demographic and most always are a google away from a buy one get one free deal. go during lunch for fresh food and avoid Sundays unless you love hearing hot takes from the Sunday service."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place since it seemed pretty delicious to me from the ads they sent me through the mail. I went one time with my husband and we'll never go back. The customer service was good and that's the reason why they'd be getting a star from me, but food wise, if I could I would give them 0 stars. The food seemed old and tasted old, it was just a terrible lunch time for us."}
{"text":"I am torn on what I want to rate Sweet Tomatoes as today.  I went last night for dinner and I enjoyed it but not really enough to give 4 stars.  However, I feel 3 stars is too low.  How about I break it down and let you all decide.  I start by parking in what appeared to be a mostly empty section on parking lot.  I walk to one door.  No go.  It is an exit only.  So I walk to the next door.  Same thing.  Exit only.  Before I knew it I was on the other side of the building.  No matter though.  It just means that I have an easy exit back to my car when I am done eating.    Having not been to a Sweet Tomatoes or Souplantaion style restaurant in a very long time I did not remember that you start by grabbing a tray and plate and filling up with salad before you pay.  It was confusing to me at first.  So I just followed the lead of those in front of me.  The line moved a bit slowly but it gave me time to put what I wanted on my plate without feeling rushed.  I had Ceasar salad, spinach, mixed greens, olives, beats, shredded squash, feta cheese, sun flower seeds, cauliflower, cucumber, and mushrooms all topped with balsamic dressing.  When I got to the register I gave the cahsier the coupon I had for 20%.  She scanned it and I paid $11.19.  I then sought out an open table where I could eat without feeling like I was taking up space as a single diner in a place that is set up more for groups.  I settled in an open area near the soda fountain.  Before I started on my salad I went up to the soup bar and filled a bowl with cream of mushroom soup.  It was a toss up between that and the creamy tomato basil.  I feel I made a wise choice.  The mushrooms I could tell were fresh.  Not canned.  Delicious.  I also grabbed a piece of sour dough bread and some creamy butter before heading back to my seat.    As a speedy eater I did not feel like I was in the way at all.  I ate my one plate of salad, one bowl of soup, and one piece of bread before people near me in line were even half way done with their food.  I was out of there quickly.    During the time I was in there I was greeted by a friendly cashier and a lady picking up trays and asking if I needed anything else.  There is not much expected in a buffet style restaurant but the service here was good.  The major issue I have is the price.  $10.29 plus the price of a drink and tax seems high for a salad bar.  Perhaps if I had gone for seconds it would have seemed more worth it.  So, what do you think?  3.5 stars?  Seems fair to me."}
{"text":"Considering how  expensive simple lunches like a sandwich or a burrito are getting, this place has great value. The staff are also always very nice. I go once a week to get my salad on, and it has always been a good experience. Personally I think the premade salads have too much dressing (isn't a salad supposed to be low cal?) so I dilute it with the raw lettuce/spinach. The soups are really good there is usually a great variety too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sweet Tomatoes, and this location is right down the street from me!  The strawberry lemonade is delicious and has real strawberry seeds in it.  The staff here is always friendly and nice, and the food is restocked often & kept fresh.  This location is very popular and can get crowded on the weekends, but it is definitely worth a visit (or two!)."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a more vegetarian/vegan restaurant...I finally found it. It was amazing! I loved the different variations of food...and not to mention the decor...felt like home!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Sweet Tomatoes a couple of days ago. Great customer service from start to finish. For $14 you get all you can eat salad bar, soup and an assortment of pastas and breads as well as a dessert bar. You start at the salad assembly line and build your salad as you go. Everything looked very fresh and they had someone constantly replacing the salad components which I thought was nice.  We seated ourselves at a booth and after our first round of soup and salad we had someone come over right away and ask if we needed our table cleared. I had a question about one of the tea's that they had available and someone came right over to help me out. The food was not the best I have had but it was fresh and I enjoyed my dinner. The customer service here is great and they have many healthy options. I would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend. The food and service is always amazing! This place has been a tradition in our family for years. We started going here after our local Souper Salad closed. They're very similar. Many healthy foods to choose from! And there is pizza and Mac & cheese for kids. Great place."}
{"text":"If I'm supposed to have a salad as a meal, why is there not some protein as an option for the salad?  Chicken?? Even asked and was told they didn't have any and other locations were phasing it out.  Tried to get some chicken out of the soups, but it was so light on the meat it wasn't worth fishing much out.  Disappointed, a side salad is not a meal, it's a side.  Not worth nearly $30 for two lunches."}
{"text":"Decent stop for a quick AYCE total self-serve salad bar meal, but go only if you're craving some greens.  Atmosphere - Lots of families with young kids. Workers try to keep the place clean, but sprinkles from the ice cream bar were all over the floor, along with an ice cream machine that was dripping wet with residual ice cream.   Food - Pretty fresh salad bar with good amount of offerings. Worth going for just for the salad bar, but would probably pass on all else. Liked the super mini ice cream cones though, with the peppermint sprinkles (it tasted like Christmas peppermint ice cream in February)!  Service - a total self-serve establishment.  Tip -. Play soda jerk and make yourself an old fashioned root beer float by adding root beer to the soft serve vanilla ice cream. Heck, go all out and sprinkle broken chocolate cookie bits on top too."}
{"text":"When we first came here back in 2013 we were very disappointed. It was run down and unkempt. Fast forward a couple of years after a much needed renovation this became our favorite location. So much nicer & cleaner.   Vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options are available here - check their website.  They have a nice selection of fresh veggies at the salad bar. No meat for protein but they do have hard boiled eggs, grains, beans and sometimes tofu (at the condiments section near the soups). They also have a potato bar, soups, pasta, breads, focaccia, muffins, cornbread, fresh fruits & desserts, a soft serve bar, etc...  Don't forget to grab a bag of their delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies at the registers for only $1.99 a bag :)  Sign up for Club Veg to get coupons & discounts via email & text. You also get a free meal on your birthday :) Each month they have different offerings so be sure to sign up to learn what's new on the menu.    Sweet Tomatoes is a great place to eat your days worth of veggies & fruits."}
{"text":"If you like custom salads (you get to pick what goes on it) then this place is for you! The salads seem fresh, and other ingredients are plenty. The soups are pretty good, hot, and there are plenty of choices, so I like to mix and create my own.  Some comfort food pastas are ready to go, and the standard baked potato can be doctored to however you like it, including with bacon (the magic ingredient) chives, and more. Then add the muffins (blueberry, corn, chocolate, more) plus bread and pizza squares, if you leave hungry, it's your own fault! Finally, the ice cream or yogurt bar is just the final topping to having a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Food sucked. Strawberry's were kinda fresh. prices way too high. no more chicken up grade available. prices too high"}
{"text":"I love the quality of ingredients, and it is a healthier alternative to a lot of other buffets and restaurants in general. This might be difficult for some people, you have to eat your vegetables! Sorry but there are limited meat options available. I'm not complaining, I think more places that offer healthier fresh food choices should be available! My only little peeve is what's up with the pricey charge for the premium toppings? Kind of strange but oh well I don't really mess with that anyway, to each their own. The staff is always super friendly, and every time I come there they offer suggestions for new items. I just recently found out that if you order a drink you can get both a hot and cold beverage for the same price. I know that might seem obvious but I didn't know! I like to start off my salad with a refreshing tea/pink lemonade and end my dinner with a cup of one of their herbal teas (they have a great selection of hot and cold beverages)."}
{"text":"Myself and my coworkers are from here and we all got sick. We only had salads, soups, and baked potatoes. They keep the potatoes wrapped in tin foil under a heat lamp, hopefully we don't contract BOTULISM. I won't eat here again. Not trying to die by some salad buffet."}
{"text":"Not bad, salads were cold and soup, Mac, pizza etc. were hot.  Had a wonderful dinner and bus people were nice."}
{"text":"First time! Can't believe it's taken me so long to come here. I really liked it. Make your own salad and a variety of soups and pastas. I liked that the items were marked as vegetarian and vegan, especially the soups. They even had pizza and dessert. Loved the broccoli cheddar soup and the ice cream was tasty. I'll be back. Bonus: you can normally find coupons in your mailer or online to save you some money."}
{"text":"I've only been to Sweet Tomatoes once and it was years ago. I visited last week for lunch and it was fairly busy. We walked in and grabbed a tray and two plates (though I'd recommend one of these large plates as two does not fit on the tray side by side, learned that the hard way folks). The first part of the restaurant is the salad bar where you can choose from several pre-made salads or create your own. I went for a mix of the two and tried some of the pasta salads but wouldn't get those again. At the register, you can get a drink (cup or bottled water) and I'm not sure if the bottle is a separate price. Cost for lunch is $10 but checking in with the Yelp app saves you 15% on lunch and dinner, very nice.  I decided to do one trip and I got my drink and hot foods before I sat down. There's pizza and bread, soups, pastas and desserts. I liked the cream of mushroom soup and the wonton salad, but many of the dishes tasted bland and needed some spice/hot sauce. Didn't look to see if they offered that. I really like how they label everything as being GF, vegetarian, and vegan, it's super helpful!  This place is an affordable lunch/dinner spot and seems to be fairly healthy, depending on what you choose. I wouldn't go on a regular basis but I'd come back for a filling, quick meal."}
{"text":"As salad bars go, Sweet Tomatoes is probably one of the better chain stores in the area.    A good selection of pre-made specialty salads, such as traditional and Asiago Ceasar, as well as all the fixings to make your own as you like. All items were fresh and well-stocked.  In addition to the salad items, also offered are hot soups, breads and desserts.  A good alternative to fast food; quick and relatively healthy."}
{"text":"I went there on a Saturday around 4:30. The food was good I just ended up eating way to much. My own fault but I guess I'm not that big of fan of salad bars"}
{"text":"Food was great, clean all around the food area. But most of the chairs and booths are terrible on seat area,all most every chair is splitting or cracked vinyl, snagged my pants on the vinyl. Corporate office should know about this. Should have more specials on different foods. Have not tried the breakfast yet."}
{"text":"This is just like Soup Plantation back in LA.  The staff is great and everything was good except for the drinks . Seemed watered down . We all left satisfied and we all felt good . After 5 days of vacation eating all Kinds of vacation food it was good to eat a clean healthy salad ."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes might be my newest craving! I've been to Sweet Tomatoes before for lunch, but never for dinner until the past couple of weeks. At $9.99 per an adult for dinner, its hard to beat and if you sign up for their membership you get coupons that make it 7.99 per an adult. Definitely more bang for your buck and its AYCE! Lately, Friday's have been Sweet Tomatoes night. Their clam chowder is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!! I am in love with it! I probably have two cups of clam chowder which totally defeats the purpose of eating yummy salad with any kind of toppings you want.  I also have to add that their blueberry muffins are pretty dang fantastic too! You know where to find me on Friday nights from now on. =)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Very nice food and fresh selections. Way better than the other salad place. Had a huge salad and some bread. A little pricey, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This is the second ST location I've visited since moving to the valley and all I can say is Yuck.  The concept is great.  Soup and salad with a few extras, but in reality, it tastes like eating in a hospital cafeteria.  ALL the food is extremely bland with no flavor.  I LOVE soup and there's honestly nothing special about any of the soups offered here.  And I did sample every single one.  All I can say is that the entire family was disappointed when leaving and we all agreed that was most likely our last visit."}
{"text":"So, for those from California, this is Soup Plantation...owned by the same company and all.  This is a great place if you're looking for a buffet type restaurant with a little variety.  The food isn't exceptional but it'll do in a pinch.  For the salad, I would suggest making your own.  The premade salads at the beginning of the salad bar have way too much dressing and that's unfortunate...I really enjoy a good Caesar salad.  The soups are pretty much hit or miss; although, sometimes they actually do have a delicious soup hidden in there.  They also have a variety of pastas and breads to choose from, so not a bad place to try if you're unsure of what you have a taste for."}
{"text":"I happen to like sweet tomatoes... everything always seems fresh. I always take two plates with me on the initial pass through the salad bar before you pay! might as well fill 'er up while you're there! right??   I haven't had a bad experience here. The salads are very fresh and the ingredients are always fresh and they do a good job keeping the line looking clean.  the staff is friendly and they do a good job making sure that your plates are taken care of.   The variety of soups that they have and the fresh made bread and pastas are always great to try as well...  To top off the meal I usually go for the vanilla Ice Cream, however I top it off with some of their butterscotch caramel and then finish that off with some honey that they keep where the drink area is at... it's simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It is salad, lots of unhealthy options to ruin any benefits of going. Nothing spectacular and tray service. I think if you have kids or get a senior discount you can score. Otherwise ends up being retty expensive and there are just better coices nearby. Even the casino up the road as some good options."}
{"text":"I went to Sweet Tomatoes last night at the Scottsdale location.  And it's not even worth reviewing that location because it is so normal.  There is nothing particularly good about it, nor bad about it.    But THIS location, THIS location has things worth mentioning. And so here I  go:  1) They have a super soda machine that makes 100 flavors. I always do the diet mellow yellow grape. 2) They have abnormally fancy plates. 3) They have cottage cheese at the salad bar. I like cottage cheese. 4) They have chocolate (or sometimes strawberry) mousse at the salad bar. Other Sweet Tomatoes have this as well, but they put it by the ice cream, alluding that it is a dessert.  Moving the mousse to the salad bar implies that it is meant to be eaten with your salad.  CHOCOLATE MOUSSE FOR DINNER. I should just end this review right here. 5) They serve beer. 6) They serve meat on wooden sticks (but you have to pay more). 7) They changed their corn muffins into delicate little corn cakes. 8) It is by a very interesting pond that has an abundance of turtles. One day, they make take over the world."}
{"text":"It's not bad but for the price is too much just for salads. Kids should be cheaper than $5 since they really don't eat much, especially the salad bars! If your Able to do 2 rounds of salad bar do it to get your money worth. But man I get full after one plate and I'm done! The pizza is oka not enough flavor super bland. Soup is tasty but if it has noodles in them... I wouldn't recommend it because the noodles just sit in the pit and gets over cooked.  Overall I would come back just because its healthy. It's good place to go after a good work out. That's only if you don't get the cheese or stuff with mayos lol"}
{"text":"So I recently came here with a friend on Ober's night out ( hey someone has to help with these kid's education) where a portion of the proceeds go to the school.   I am not a buffet person. Particularly if the buffet is for salads. Salad for me is lettuce and dressing. At home I have this great vinaigrette with 50 cloves of garlic in it that I love. I won't ever find a dressing that will top it. Nonetheless I was there to help our youth.   I did try the turkey chili, which was really good. In retrospect, I should've just had 3 bowls of that. I also had a baked potato. When dessert time came around I figured I'd get my money's worth and try some ice cream. Unbeknownst to me, the machine wasn't working and proceeded to throw ( I felt an explosion) the ice cream at me! Needless to say, I took it as a sign that I wasn't meant to have dessert that day.  All in all, this is not the place for me but I realize that I am a minority and people, particularly families, get the most out of the experience."}
{"text":"I love coming here for soup and salad! The variety is good and the flavors are tasty. They always have two or three vegetarian soups for me to try. I also love their Mac and cheese so so much!!   My only gripe is the long wait times when it's busy. People take FOREVER figuring out what to get in their salad. Come on people, you should know by now! Same thing with the hot food buffet, they stare at it like there were millions of choices. Just get a small amount, take it back to your table, try it out, if you like it get more if not you didn't cause a thirty minute back up.  I'm only saying this because I got stuck behind an indecisive Sally and I was STARVING. I was ready to push her old ass out of the way.   Sorry for what I said when I was hangry."}
{"text":"Best soup and salad bar in town.  The wife and I come here at least once a month.  We like to try the different soups and other items they change each month.    The salad bar has so much to offer.  There are so many different toppings, all so fresh.  The composed salads change each month,  I think 1 or 2 stay the same.  I love to build my perfect salad.   The foccacia cheese bread is so yummy.  It is a mainstay as well as corn muffins and blueberry muffins.  The honey butter with the cornbread is my favorite.  There are different breads each month also.   Soups are hit and miss.  Most of them just need some salt and them some are just not good.  Then there are some that have some great flavor, like the rosemary potato soup.   The dessert is soft serve ice cream with toppings, but the soft serve is always good.  A wonderful end to a great soup and salad bar."}
{"text":"Outstanding food at a great price and service!  You can always expect a nice clean area and wonderful people and food. Always a strong recommendation"}
{"text":"I recently joined the email club (*my offer was expiring soon) because I was wanting to try restaurants near home. This one's in a shopping center filled with other area restaurants, but it's a small ST location, compared to the Henderson one and the Rainbow/Best In The West one. (Parking was ample.) We visited yesterday for lunch, and it was crowded; there was a 5-10 minute wait for seating. (One diner decided to get her salad to-go, which was a couple bucks cheaper than dining in.) There is lots of outdoor seating, but noone was out there in the middle of summer.   You start off with a tray and plate, gathering your salad and grab-and-go drinks, before you pay. Some seasonal items (different offering for lunch and dinner) were the BBQ Chicken Salad, which was excellent. Our son's was $3.99, and it came with a drink, so we got him the apple juice box. Once we got our table, Hubby got more items at the soup side (chicken noodle- thick noodles!, sweet potato---so yummy, & shrimp bisque) and I got some bread sides (lemon muffin---I had two, bread slices (two kinds, cheesy garlic), cornbread- tastes like jiffy) and red grapes- sweet, for the most part. I saw the baked potatoes with all the fixings, but I skipped it (maybe next time?). Our son's a picky eater, but he loved the chicken noodle soup, croutons, pickles, grapes, cheesy bread, and pasta salad. He ate pretty good. He even had a mini ice cream cone and nearly finished it. Ice cream choices are vanilla, chocolate, or swirl. Toppings are caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies pieces, and sprinkles.   TIP: get a little bit at a time, to taste test the item, then, go back for more, if they are your favorites.   The staff was nice, though, they were very busy. It was nice to get our used plates and bowls removed, while they came around with smiles on their faces. As soon as tables were empty,  the staff was there to quickly clean up the tables. (And the food stations were getting attention, too, once the line shortened.) We were seated next to the bathroom, which was a very popular spot, second to the food stations. The rest of the restaurant looked clean.   Back to the seating and main dining room of the restaurant. It's kind of a tight squeeze, people passing through the aisles had to wait for others to pass, as it was basically a highway on foot. Hubby said they messed up with the overall design of the seating. I agree. Maybe it was just super busy because it was sunday lunch time, and we kind of got here a little later than our usual stint for lunch. The customer base was mostly families (about 90%). Maybe next time, we'll get here earlier than yesterday's visit.    If you use the promotional coupons it can be pretty reasonable for your family to eat here (at Stations casinos, our toddler son is full price; it's not worth it to bring him there because he's a picky eater). I'd say that this is better than a typical casino buffet and better than Golden Corral, in terms of quality, but you should like eating salads. (Of course, this is not a meat-based buffet. For meat, you cannot beat Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao.) So, like any buffet, there are good items and bad items, you just gotta taste it for yourself to judge if you like places like this. Years ago, there was a couple Souper Salad restaurants and Furr's, but those are long gone."}
{"text":"It's a popular restaurant located in the Best in the West shopping center/strip mall (Lake Mead/Rainbow).   This is a good salad buffet place complete with yummy breads (muffins) and soups. Coupons are in the weekly circulars BTW. Back when this place didn't exist, we went to Souper Salad a lot, but the quality has gone down quite a bit. The quality here is much better. There are so many different dishes to choose from- it's almost hard to decide. Since I have learned how to eat at a buffet (ie. don't overdo it or I will be sick), I am picky with my selections.   We've been here several times. Good place- just try to get there early for lunch because it fills up fast. Or else you will be lost in the crowd and stuck in long lines."}
{"text":"Bomb.. delicious.. on point with a clean and fresh salad bar. Other options for other people. I enjoyed my self and we be returning"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Treated very poorly.  The salad bar area was a mess, and food slopped all over. It looked like it had not been cleaned for a long time. There was only one gal working the salad area and both registers. She was doing her best, but no one seamed to care she was struggling to keep up. After getting our food and taking a bite or two we were told the restaurant was now closed and we would have to take our food to go. I was with friends from out of town and where did they think we were going to go to eat out food? in one of our cars? I would have went to a drive through if I wanted to eat in my car. Plus the manager whimped out and had a bus boy tell the people they had to leave.  He couldn't even do it himself. The busboys english was very poor and we were not quite sure what he was trying to tell us. Another very nice customer explained what was going on. We were told there was a water main break some where in the neighborhood and the place could not stay open without water. We understood but the manager should have told us and should have comped our meal or offered us some kind of coupon for a future visit. It was handled very poorly. Don't suggest you visit this location. Dirty and poorly managed."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of places that are always uber packed purely because there's always a wait and I hate waits, I want the yummies in my tummy ASAP!!! But what can you do if the place is popular bc the eats are good? Deal with it and know that the wait will pay off...  I really thought that since this is the closest Sweet Tomato to us in the Southwest coupled with the fact that it's across LVAC that they would've made the restaurant bigger, which, they did not. It seems smaller and a bit cramped, even the entrance way was a lot smaller than the other locations. Who knows, my perception of the place could've been affected by the fact that it was super-D-duper packed with human beings.  Food is consistent as other locations. I love Sweet Tomato, it's the closest thing that we have to Souplantation, like in SD, which is basically the same company.  Bussers are super nice. Our server was really good about picking up the trays and even offered to get us refills."}
{"text":"Although this is a chain restaurant I really like going here. They have a salad bar, soups, variety of entrees (pasta, baked potato, pizza, cornbread, etc) and a dessert bar with a ton of varieties. The Cesar salad is a must here!   They used to have mushroom soup every Monday but sadly they don't do that anymore which is one of the reasons that I don't go there as much as I used to. Restrooms are clean and staff is always available to take your used dishes as they walk by. No matter how busy it is or seems, I can always find a booth to eat in. Go here! It's good stuff :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times.  3 times I've given one of these places a shot, but today is the last time.  If you're into bland, no spices whatsoever, no taste whatsoever, prepared food, lots of preservatives in your prepared food...mmmmm, this be the place! Everything here is horrible except for the salad and an occasional soup.   Never again.  I'd rather wait till I get home than eat at this dull place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Yes I know, I can chop up my own vegetables at home for a lot cheaper. But honestly, who wants to do that after a long day at work?  Here's the run down. You pile your salad with all the accoutrement. You pay for your food. Then you head towards all the hot food. All of which is delicious.   They have tons of options when it comes to customizing your salad. Along with all the toppings, they have every dressing under the sun. I personally love the ranch, but I just limit myself to one little paper cup instead of drenching my whole salad so I can control my calorie intake. Because what's the point of salad if you're just going to drench it in cheese, dressing and croutons?   As for the hot food, they have a large variety of soups including your basic chicken noodle. They also have baked potatoes, focaccia breads and pastas. And if you're not already full, they have dessert! For the health nuts, there's fruit and jello. If you want something more indulgent, there is frozen yogurt with the option of sprinkles, nuts and various sauces.   This place is all about options! Something to keep in mind though, just because you're eating a salad, doesn't mean you're eating healthy. Watch what you put on it. And that's my public announcement for the day."}
{"text":"I would have rated it higher, had i not had a problem with one of their soups. We went on monday night to this location since we happened to be in that part of the valley and it was past dinner time. So we used one of our coupons, making it 2 dinners for $23 total which included the overpriced drinks. I think they should make the drinks part of the meal price.   What I hate about this new one, the way the salad bar is designed, it's almost impossible to get the middle items without crashing into the glass. This would work great for neanderthals, since they had super long arms. Or monkeys, since they can reach further than some of us humans. So to get some olives, you have to bend down and reach as far as you can, meanwhile your face is almost in your salad, and your hair probably is too.  Bad concept.  The restaurant is smaller, and I much prefer the Rainbow location or the Stephanie street one.   I have never had a problem with any of the food exacting revenge on me before until the mushroom soup on monday night. My husband and I both had the same salad, side salads, side dishes, except we both had different soups. He hates mushrooms, but I love them. The soup pot was full, and I couldn't figure out why no one was eating it, and I got a cup.  Everything was great,we enjoyed our meal, and 5 minutes after leaving the restaurant, I felt uncomfortably too full, bloated and felt like I'd better get to a restroom pronto. So stopped at a fast food place, and made it in the nick of time. Let's just say it was a rather gross unpleasant experience, one that I do not wish to relive in any way, ever!!!!!!!  And I will never ever eat at that location ever again for any reason. I will stick to the Rainbow location or the Henderson one if I ever go there again. Right now, I am afraid to."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times. Never a problem. Even though it is an older location, the food is usually fresh and tasty. The workers seem to appear out of nowhere and take dirty dishes away as fast as you move them to the side of the table.  The ambience is terrible, too much noise and plenty of crying babies and noisy kids. But its a cheap place for families and they have to eat too!  The best time to go to get a table is to avoid the crowds at lunch and dinner. If you show up for a late lunch at 2:30pm versus earlier at 1 or 2pm it's easier snagging a table and no wait. For fresher offerings, it's better to go for an earlier dinner, around 4:30p.m.   The last few times we have been going, I have noticed that some items aren't as tasty as before, like the macaroni and cheese. And some other items. I wish they would go back to quality instead of quantity.  I would go to this location again though."}
{"text":"It always starts out great here but seems to gradually slide downhill after the first few bites. Most salad options look fairly good and I think I have been lucky in my selection. There area also other cold salads on the bar. Tuna Noodle Salad of some type typically is one I'll try but on this visit is was soupy and just blech.  I couldn't even have a second bite. The soup selection on the day we visited was good, but I guess I'm one that just likes soup.  I had the Chicken Enchilada on that day.  Lots of good flavor but I don't think I even had a bite of chicken.  Also tried the Chili but it was more beans than anything.  I mean every bite was a spoon full of beans.  My husband and sons theory is that I need to laddle a serving up from the middle of the pot and refrain from stirring the soup first.  I wasn't going to serve up another bowl to find out.  Dessert is always a must even if it's just a bite of something sweet to end the meal. On this occasion they had Red Velvet Cake with a cream cheese icing.  Looked appealing, well except for what it begins to look like after a couple dozen people attempt to serve thierself from a dish set under a hot lamp. Oh yeah, and it doesn't help that they provide a long handled SPOON to cut and serve yourself a piece of cake.   C'mon staff, even one of those pizza servers would be 100 times better than a SPOON!  One bite of the RVC and some vanilla soft serve was more than enough.  We come every few months cuz that's more than enough for us.    If you miss out on the Mon-Wed deal as another reviewer mentioned, I suggest you do a search online for coupons.  You might be surprised what you find."}
{"text":"This place presents a huge buffet, centered around soups and salads. It is almost impossible to leave this place and still be hungry. There is nothing worthy of being called spectacular, but for the most part everything is satisfactory."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to a \"real\" sweet tomatoes , avoid this one.  Weak selection, but otherwise true to the franchise.  EXTREMELY small portions, tiny plates,  and poor dessert selections.  Great south west flair.  They have posole,  a rarity indeed. If you've never been to a real sweet tomatoes,  you likely won't know the difference."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings on Sweet Tomatoes. While I love their fresh ingredients, and the fact that they label whether or not the dish is vegetarian, I am not a fan of the price. I just seems really high, AYCE or not.  Noting that, I was very impressed by this new Sweet Tomatoes. It was very clean, but also very small. The feel of it is a bit more modern than the Green Valley or North Rainbow locations. They also had different items than the other two (steamed veggies, where have you been?).  I did notice that some of the items were fresher at this location, which may be because of the size. Not as much room to have things sitting under the heat lamps. We will be back, as we always find ourselves coming back to Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Soups, Salads, fresh bread, and desserts...AYCE styling. This Sweet Tomatoes has been hopping the 3 times I've been here. On our last visit, it was no exception and it hadn't hit 5pm yet.   The staff here are nice, and I would say that they have the friendliest and most efficient dining room staff of any of the ST locations in town.  They are pricey, but you can be super healthy here, and eat all you care to eat."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Sweet Tomatoes since I was a little girl with my mom, so every time I go back it reminds me of lunches with my mom when we would go shopping! Still all of these years later I am still a huge fan of the place, they have a great salad bar with a ton of toppings (although I am still super bummed they don't have hardboiled eggs anymore) some awesome pasta salads (tuna tarragon all the way!), always have a huge selection of yummy soups (I love the chunky chicken noodle), muffins, pizza, pasta and a baked potato bar and if your not full after all of that there is a decent desert selection!  For the price you can't beat it, and I love that they have to-go containers so I can come by and grab a salad and bring it back to my office!  The service is always friendly and the restaurant itself is super clean! I am totally a fan!"}
{"text":"I ate here with family for a quick lunch in the midst of running errands, and was absolutely appalled with the filthy condition of this location in particular.   The salad bar was caked with dried salad dressings, the bins of chopped salad additions were all mixed, and the counter was cluttered with food. The ladles and handles to serve food were also caked in liquid (be it salad dressing, soup, or pasta sauce), and the floor was covered with food particles.  The only saving grace for this location was the prompt response of the manager, who responded to a complaint that I filed on the Sweet Tomatoes website."}
{"text":"Lost on me. Fairly void of any protein. Carbs with some interesting salad and soup choices. Potatoes, bread, ice cream. Clean. Staff were nice. Obviously popular. $12.99 is a good price to eat this way?"}
{"text":"The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful, even suggesting how we can save more by combing coupons. Someone (manager?) told us about new seasonal items that were actually really good -- asparagus and capers in pasta with creamy lemon sauce.  Fun for the family and affordable with discounts. I mostly come to pile up on a great self made salad. The fat free ranch was actually pretty good, unlike others I've tried."}
{"text":"This location has really gone down in quality, cleanliness and customer service. The salad bar was completely filthy.  A lot of workers standing around playing with each other more than working. Poor cashier working both lines. The floors were sticky, tables not cleared off, dessert bar literally EMPTY."}
{"text":"I was so anxious to introduce my husband to this restaurant, as I had fond memories of one I had visited in Tucson.  Yeeeeccchhhh. Unless the entire chain has gone to the dogs, this branch should be closed.  There was nothing good about it. I lifted each ladle of soup and--depending on the main ingredient--they were quite the same:  beans in dishwater, potatoes in dishwater, noodles in dishwater. Exception:  the chicken and rice soup wasn't thin.  It had been thickened so much with flour that a spoon could have stood up in it.  The salads were even bad (how do you wreck a salad??)  The total price was fair ($21 for two) until I realized we didn't have a bit of meat. The only thing I could tolerate was one of the 3 pizzas (the other two were hideous) and a chocolate muffin.  My husband went back for another muffin because he was still hungry.  I looked around at the other customers. They appeared to be going for volume. Their plates were stacked high with salad and then they dumped piles of cheese and other toppings (I suppose in an effort to get some flavor)  Hey, call me!  I will show you how to cook and I will do it for free!  We won't be back."}
{"text":"What can I say....it's a salad buffet spot. Me and my kids love it. Yays: That Cream of Mushroom soup is to die for...like seriously, what's in it besides the obvious cause I can eat 4 bowls.  Can't go wrong with the big Chunky Chicken Noodle soup. Baked potatoes are bomb. Ceased salad is legit. Service has always been steller.  Nays: Greek salad dressing is gone, seriously??? And if they can add avocado to the buffet line, that'd be fabulous..."}
{"text":"The vegetable choices are out of this world.  Protein, however is nil if you don't eat beans (like chili offerings).  Thus, I can only give it 3 stars.  They took the meat away from the salad bar and that SUCKS."}
{"text":"This location is really rundown. The bathrooms were not clean at all and it was not safe to change a baby in the changing area. The food was ok but that was it. I am going to stick with the Arrowhead location."}
{"text":"This is our third time eating here but the first since the remodel and it was great. They seem to still be working on some of the decor but it was very clean which I appreciate. The food is always organized nicely and clean. My daughter loves to be able to pick her own items. The soup bar is a lot larger then before. The noodles are probably the only area that my family did not like but that was okay because there was so many other yummy things!"}
{"text":"All you can eat salad, soup, and potato bar. Buffett style salads and soup bar with self seating. Desert included.   Lunch is only $9.99 per person. You can't buy all of the salad toppings and greens under $9.99 in the store, so this place offers a great value. Additional charge for drinks.   Excellent place to grab a variety of several different types of salads and soups. They offer pre made salads or you can create your own with romaine, ice burg, or spinach mix.  The wonton salad was so delicious I must have made two trips back for seconds and thirds. I was impressed with the available fresh salad toppings.   There were many soup selections ranging from low calorie to hearty choices.   What is impressive is the calorie count per serving listed on the item, this way you can make educated choices regarding your meal.   There is a small potato and sweet potato bar with all the toppings.   The employees were friendly and hard working. The salad bar had fresh toppings. Employees were constantly cleaning and keeping the salad bar looking appetizing.   Absolutely a fabulous choice for healthy lunch or dinner meals."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Sweet Tomatoes?  Always fresh, healthy ingredients to build delicious salads and a great selection of soups, breads and drinks."}
{"text":"Went there tonight at 7:30 for dinner and one side of the salad bar was closed and a very long line for the only salad bar line. Waited 10 minutes and ended up leaving. This location seems to be poorly managed the last several times we have been there"}
{"text":"I'm partial to the Sweet Tomatoes / Souplantation franchise having been an employee for Garden Fresh throughout high school. However, I have remained a loyal patron over the years because unlike other buffets, the options are always fresh and plentiful.  I understand why Sweet Tomatoes gets some negative reviews. Its prepared salads and pastas are generally just OK. But, what I personally love about this place is that you get the chance to be creative with what you eat.  If you're like me and you enjoy piling your plate with dozens of types of fresh veggies to make that perfect-tasting salad, you'll love this place. Doctor up the rosemary potato soup with some jalapenos or red peppers and you have a complete meal.  Its all about the salad bar -- you wont find a better one anywhere in Phoenix, at least I haven't. Whole Foods is about the only one that compares even in the slightest, in my opinion.  Not all the prepared dishes are mediocre... in fact, a few have me rushing for Sweet Tomatoes whenever I hear they'll be served. Try the tuna tarragon, lemon cream pasta with capers and the vegetarian black bean chili. Mmm Mmm Mmm..."}
{"text":"i am sooo glad they have one near me on the sw side of town."}
{"text":"i love going to Sweet Tomatoes...met my friend here since it was closer to her than to us on w flamingo. i forgot how busy they get with alot of keikis...unfortunately on this side some people are just ignorant and messy."}
{"text":"This is a fairly consistent place to go for soup and salad.  The only problem is for the most part the menu only changes once a month.  So if you go there and find the items are not your liking you should wait till the next month and check back to see what has changed.  One last thing they seem to not always have what is advertised to be on the menu.  Sometimes they will have an item that may have been left over from the previous day or provide something that was not even published."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to do another review of this place, but felt I needed to give a holiday update.  They have this Turkey soup thing with cornbread stuffing that is amazing.  SO GOOD.  I am not sure how long it will be there, but if its still there you have to try it!  Or put it on the calendar for next year.  Adults love this place, kids love this place ... its a win win, and the food (and service) is always great!"}
{"text":"What can I say, it's your typical soup and salad establishment that's all you can eat. The service is minimal, you go in and pay, they give you a drink cup and you're on your own. They only clear the tables, everything else is up to you. The soups are \"ok\" and the salad stuff is \"ok\". Nothing to cry home about but the price is reasonable for what it is and you can even get a little break with the Yelp check in coupon. Once in a while they have something new for a limited time. When I went they had an avocado Caesar salad which was pretty good."}
{"text":"While the food is always good at sweet tomatoes, this location seriously needs a new dishwasher! ! Walked in, and every tray looked dirty. .. One even had a toothpick on it! Went through five plates before I found one worth eating off of. The silverware were dirty. .. cups. .. dirty. Even the soup bowls had crusty food stuck on the inside!  I'm hoping the health department has been by lately. .. ugh."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to spots.  Healthy, delicious options and easy to access!  The dessert options need a bit of updating, however, the salad/soup/muffin options are always amazing.  I especially love their chili choices...  Bring a jacket as the restaurant's AC is sometimes placed rather high."}
{"text":"Looking forward to my next visit, great selection of freshly prepared food. This was my first time. It was quick, easy and clean"}
{"text":"Second time here and I am beyond satisfied food is amazing and staff has the best manners !"}
{"text":"Amazing buffet! Even though it's just soup and salad it's excellent. Good for a nice healthy meal. Get the coupons online and you can save a lot of money.  Chicken noodle soup is here is excellent."}
{"text":"Lots of choices in salads and soups, the bakery section is somewhat small. The dessert is good as well (the strawberry mousse is more sour than your typical sweetened strawberry syrup). I can't complain about this place, I'd definitely come back when I'm not in the mood for meat."}
{"text":"The food was good and the place was clean. The employee's were friendly and seemed up on bussing the tables. The only thing I didn't like was the music, it's too loud for a restaurant. I just don't find it relaxing to have music blaring when I am trying to eat, especially music I don't enjoy."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes brings back memories from my childhood because of the buffet line and macaroni and cheese. Lately I have noticed the salads getting more mixed together than usual. The dressings seem to taste more artificial and have a clumpier texture than I remember but I still prefer their house Caesar over a store bought container. The soup selection has not been appealing to me as it did before since the chicken noodle soup is watery and not evenly distributed and the vegetable soups either have too much or too little salt. Their blueberry muffins will always be my favorite dessert option but the never ending ice cream is a close second. Lately the pasta has been a bit more greasy but it still tastes decent. The macaroni and cheese is still made of real cheese and has the best texture. I don't remember if they still serve those cookies but I used to love them when I was younger. I would still come here but only once in a while and only when you get the online coupons for the cheaper meal."}
{"text":"I've only been here one other time 10 years ago.  They're way over priced for the selection they offer. Everything tasted very generic and lacked flavor. Nothing special about it. Probably won't go back for another 10 years."}
{"text":"This is regarding the breakfast. Any other time I go in its 5 stars.  Nothing on this review is a reflection of the employees, they are fantastic everytime.  We have tried there breakfast just once and I cant say how much they made me appreciate my frosted flakes at home. I dont know if there sausage always taste like this and if there scramble is always a tad below luke warm , but im very disappointed with our outing. Feel like we wasted $20 bucks. I hate mcdonalds breakfast to death but the one next door sure looked good a that morning. Wont be coming back for breakfast again thats for sure. Smh"}
{"text":"I go here when I'm craving some fresh greens. I'm obsessed with their broccoli salad. The build-your-own salad has been done before, but they do offer a larger and more varied selections. Their hot foods aren't bad either. I always get their blueberry muffins and their chicken noodle soup. The soup is so simple yet so good. They also send out weekly coupons online, so take advantage of those. I don't understand why their price for lunch and dinner are different, since they don't change anything in their buffet aside from adding \"dessert\" after 4pm. *shrugs*  The biggest complaint I have about this place is that sometimes their plates are still dirty. Like, small pieces of dried food's still stuck on the plate which is pretty nasty."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes... Souplantation... whatever you want to call it, it's pretty consistent wherever you are!  My favorites:  --Tuna Tarragon --Caesar Salad --Lemon Linguine* --Asian Ginger Broth*  --Chicken Noodle Soup --Three bean chili soup --Mac & Cheese --Blueberry muffins --Chocolate lava cake with vanilla soft serve --Strawberry lemonade  (* seasonal)  Always google for coupons. Always."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a buffet-style place filled with your healthy favorites -- soup and salad. The soup bar also has pizza squares, pasta, Mac n cheese, and fruit.   This is my first time in one and I particularly liked the options they had. It's all very simple for $12 (all you can eat along with a drink). Awesome! Great for a quick dinner on a budget. Not my first choice but it's quite a healthy option for those who like healthier diets for the price :)  Carlos was our cashier and he was very helpful! Shoutout to him."}
{"text":"First time here always wanted to go, ended up being a very cool spot, lovely environment beautiful property, nice food, nice people specifically the manager Salvador (who was very professional and polite) gave me a free batch of cookies because he overheard me talking to one of the employment that I was the first time customer, server Lorena was very friendly and helpful. Overall good place to bring your family and enjoy it! Thanks Salvador and Lorena!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been here, the salad bar is clean and the tables even cleaner. The amount of meal options you have makes the price okay, so I load up on plenty of yummy salad, pizza focaccia, and frozen yogurt with a mountain of sprinkles.   I really appreciate that they change up their food focus monthly so it's not the same exact thing every time. This month it's grilled cheese focaccia bread and tomato soup and it is HEAVENLY. I always wonder what they would do if I took the day off of work and spent my time off, open to close, attempting to eat through their food. The employees are really nice, especially the bussers who sometimes ask if I would like a refill on my coke... As my family says, you never know until you try!   I still haven't ruled out the idea."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is the buffet for anybody who is trying to work at eating healthier (or not).  Though it's primarily a salad bar, and you can get all your veggies fresh and well-presented, the wealth of other items enables you to come with a differently-motivated companion, even a carnivore.  You can be good with a selection of three prepared chopped salads, and/or create your own with spinach, lettuce, broccoli, cauliflower, jicama, carrots, kidney beans, chick peas, sweet peas, corn, hard-boiled egg, radishes, raisins, crumbled blue cheese, shredded cheese, tomatoes, dill pickles, sweet pickles, onions, sprouts, bell peppers, chili peppers, croutons, bacon bits, sweet raisin broccoli salad, and a dozen different dressings.  Or, you can be not so good with mac-and-cheese, or stir fried pasta and vegetables, or a baked white or sweet potato, or eight different soups such as cream of broccoli, navy bean, mushroom, clam chowder or big chunk chicken so loaded with chicken that the meat eaters can fill a bowl just with white meat.  Or, you can be really bad with garlic asiago focaccia bread, or four cheese pizza or pepperoni pizza or muffins, and corn bread.  Finally test your will power with tapioca pudding, frozen yogurt, brownies, hot fudge and caramel sauce, or fruit and jello.  I go because it makes me think I'm being good, then give in to 2000 calories of temptations every time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a lot of it.  This is a very family friendly place.  There were so many options that it was hard to choose.  Truly enjoyed the variety of soups.  We tried the chicken potpie stew the fiery quinoa and black bean chili with cornbread and honey butter.  Everything was kept fresh and clean and no item was disappointing."}
{"text":"Ok we've lived here almost a year, keep getting the coupons in the mail, and yet somehow last night was our first visit and I am really regretting that we waited so long.  I am giving this 5 stars because it was a fantastic family dining experience.  Was it gourmet? No.  The best meal I've ever had?  Obviously not.  But my whole family (2 year old included) love soups, salads and ice cream so you can't go wrong.  My kids love the idea of a 'buffet' and I like having healthier options so it's a win win situation.  Their salad ingredients are so fresh and a really good selection.  Between us we tried 4 different soups and all were really good.  The fresh breads and pasta were good too.  We all left very satisfied and it's a decent price as well.  Hence the 5 stars!  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the huge salad bar. So many choices and options you can take anyone here and they can find food. It's perfect for kids with many options in pasta , breads, and soups if kids don't like all salad. It is always clean and fresh. I especially like the beets and sweet pickles. Weird I know. The brown bread is amazing and having both regular and sweet potato is a boon for me as a vegan. I come here every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This location is not closed and the renovation looks very nice, the big community table seems like wasted space"}
{"text":"We started coming here 11 years ago. It has been great, good, fair, poor, and great! I enjoy having date night with my 6 year old here and he loves it!! Prices went up a little, however, so did everything else.  Always know what you are getting when you come here, and never have we gotten any food poisoning...ever."}
{"text":"Mom says the chocolate chip cookies are best when warm and gooey. The creamy tomato is tasty. And if you finish that off with a bowl of tapioca pudding you're set."}
{"text":"Seems the quality of the food has gone down at this location.  Not much selection and no protein... just processed white flour. They must be spraying the lettuce with preservatives because we all had stomachaches after we left...."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES sweet tomato. Decided to write review today because I LOVED the Greek salad - I added some extra cucumbers and extra Feta.  I also LOVED the tomato chipotle bisque and the broccoli cheddar chowder! Today was a good day to eat at Sweet Tomato!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Whenever you want a yummy salad and soup this is the spot. They also serve one of my favorites...Tuna Tarragon. That stuff is so good here whenever I have a craving I'm there. I especially love it when it's Lemon season. The lemon chicken orzo soup is the best. And of course they have fruit and fresh blubbery muffins to satisfy that sweet tooth and pizza for the kiddos. The place is typically busy during dinner time but it's worth it for me."}
{"text":"Located in the Best Buy shopping center near Sprint. There is usually plenty of parking. This place is busy during dinner time.   UPDATE 2-17-16 PRICES HAVE GONE UP RIDICULOUSLY FOR TOGO so now I make my own salads!   This place is one of my favs when I don't feel like cooking and want to have something healthy. Typical salad bar set up, you can make your own salad and pick a soup of your choice and you are ready to go! I most always do a to go order, and it so convenient, I'm always in and out.   In addition to my salad, my absolute fav is the Tuna Tarragon. I need the recipe for this as I could eat that stuff all day! I live for the Lemon Chicken Orzo soup when it's in season and the Udon Sriracha soup is great on a cold day."}
{"text":"I can only see salad lovers rating this garden house five stars. But I just like to even out my diet once in awhile ya know;)  Endless topping for your salad! I couldnt stop adding stuff going down the line. Besides that, they have about 8 soups to throw down and some sweet treats to grub on so the kids wont be whining (including ice cream). The Madness Broccoli(9) down here had me hooked the whole afternoon, and was the first time having raw broccoli. Since it was my first time, i can only say i enjoyed their Cran Orange Muffin(8) and their house chili. Dressing wise, Greek(10) is the way to go! Especially if you like that vinegar sour taste.   Overall i was surprised how busy for a restaurant just for salads could get. The price wasnt to bad either, if your stomachs big on greens."}
{"text":"Nice selection but we must have caught them on an off day or off time. seemed understaffed for the crowd. missing pre-made salads on half the line (our half) lots of things empty and couldn't find tomatoes for my salad? (change the name to sweet no tomatoes?) still managed to create a jumbo masterpiece. anyway people were friendly and mostly seemed to be working hard to take care of customers. potato bar looked good, didnt try, had some mac & cheese...mehh. corn bread and honey butter very good. hard to find someone to help you when they are out of something. needed strawberries, we wondered around for a few minutes, finally someone came and noticed they were empty but only because she wanted some on something she was eating. she filled them, served herself then went off somewhere. oops....forgot to fill the whipped cream, guess she didn't need any. all in all not a bad place. 2 salads & two drinks (no add on's) was about $18 for two of us with a coupon. will give them another try."}
{"text":"Do not come here on a weeknight around 6pm unless you enjoy eating to a stereo chorus of screaming and crying babies and toddlers, and dodging children as you make your way around the buffet. Overall, an obnoxious dinner experience. The food, however, was great. Tastes better here (soup/salad-wise) than at the big hotel buffets (for way cheaper). Good seasonal/holiday choices, too."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is based around healthy food options, with a small variety of food for those who tag along and have to eat something. I am that tag along person. They do have a good variety of food and many options on their initial salad bar, all of which are very fresh. Most of the time when I go I end up eating the soups, because they are one of the extremely few items which has meat in it. I do love their chocolate or fudge muffins and put some of their soft serve ice cream on it. Not much of a foccaci bread person, their Mac and cheese is runny and bland, the linguine usually has this unusual flavor to it I can't pinpoint but certainly don't prefer, the baked potato setup is nice. Anyway, if you are the type of person who loves salad, alternatively made comfort food dishes, and a small option dessert bar you are going to 100% 5 star love this place. If you are a carnivore, must eat meat at all meals, love a good dessert with your meal, and in general don't like rabbit food... Well, suck it up and enjoy the conversation with your company and hit up someplace you like afterwards."}
{"text":"All of my family and I went here yesterday when they opened.  Their were 21 of us.  The food was mainly fresh, but there were a few items in the salad bar that didn't look fresh.  The cucumbers didn't look good either, like they were from a couple days ago or they sliced up bad cucumbers.  A couple of the salad dressing items didn't have ladles so this made it a bit challenging to get dressing.  My kids used the dressing cups, but if everyone did that, that would be unhygienic.  Same thing with some of the other items like the seeds & croutons.  They need to have serving utensils for this.  Service, however, was fantastic.  We had a couple of servers for our table and they regularly took our plates away, refilled water, stuff like that.  Since it was early, the rest of the foods, the hot foods were fresh.  Wish there was a great dessert selection, but I can't really remember if they normally have so little in terms of selection to offer.   We were able to easily use a coupon from my phone for $8.99/adult with drinks."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was just this branch restaurant but I think the quantity is going down  It has been at least a year since we ate at this particular spot. It was a Saturday and it was filled. Service was fine as usual. I got the feeling that there were fewer salad choices. The soups and chili were very good. The different \"sides\" I think were fewer and were not as appetizing as before."}
{"text":"My coworker and I come here for lunch pretty often. It's not my favorite place to go, but it does the job. My biggest gripe is that, at over $10 for lunch (and that's getting water), it seems a bit high for what you get.   With that being said, the salad bar is usually clean and stocked and they've got a nice selection. I'm just not eating enough soup and salad to make this place worth the amount I have to pay to eat here. I'd rather pay $7 for soup and salad somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time ever at Sweet Tomatoes and it hit the spot! Instead of going to some fast food joint, decided to try out some salads and fresh soups! The prices are affordable, the food is fresh, and I love the music choice. I kept singing along to every song as I was choosing my soup. And the staff were all so friendly and helpful, they all had smiles whenever I asked them a question :)  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Buffets are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas, and while this place is a chain, it does manage to separate itself from the greasy disgusting traps inside casinos.  A mile-long salad bar with just about every topping you can imagine for your custom salad? Sounds like heaven to me! Being vegetarian, it's hard to find a place that focuses on salad as the main buffet draw. There is also soup and fresh baked bread, and along with baked potato, pasta and dessert stations. The pasta does leave a bit to be desired.  I usually doctor up their mac & cheese with toppings from baked potato bar (sour cream, shredded cheese, hot sauce, etc).  it may not be the best food in the universe, but I love it. Every time I go, I am satisfied and inexplicably happy."}
{"text":"What can you say about Sweet Tomatoes that no one else knows? You always get fresh food, vegetables and great service! I wish their menu would expand more, but it's what they are known for."}
{"text":"I like this place, when you're in the mood salad this is the place to go. We always go there , when we want to have a late dinner."}
{"text":"My idea of going out for dinner does not involve fluorescent lights, kids running around, and using tongs that are sitting IN the food.  But once in a while I break my own rules.  I had some errands to run, late as usual, and was in the shopping center anyway, so I called my husband and suggested he meet me there.  We've been here many times before.  He got a BOGO coupon online and drove over. Sweet Tomatoes is usually okay, and tonight it was less okay.    I was surprised to see that the prices are now up to $10.50 pp.  Okay, but we had a BOGO.  But wait...in order to use it, you have to buy two drinks.  We don't usually buy drinks unless they're alcoholic, and I know from past experience that Sweet Tomatoes' coffee is the worst swill in the world.  They charge 2.39 for any drink, which puts their coffee at a price even higher than Starbucks, and it's undrinkable. I don't do soda or iced tea.  I usually like their salads, but tonight was an exception.  One, a spinach with turkey, apples, and almonds, tasted really peculiar.    Every month the theme changes except, apparently, December.  All the inspiration went out with Thanksgiving.  There was stuffing to put into a cream of turkey soup.  Many of the salads had turkey as an addition.  The soups were uninviting, too, unless you like cream soups:  there were two to choose from.  They had an Asian Ginger broth whose sign said to add spinach, mushrooms, scallions, and a host of other ingredients, but all of those were way on the other side, requiring a walk to the back of the restaurant to get around back to the front, where the salad item are.  And the one chili seemed like a soup with meatballs, thin and watery, and not very spicy.  I've never tried any of the hot pasta dishes until tonight, but the penne in a peppery sauce with Italian sausage sounded good, so I took a tablespoonful.  It was dreadful - lukewarm, with gummy pasta and just one speck of sausage left in the entire wok receptacle.    One big reason I don't like coming here is the ambient temperature.  In the summer, it's freezing, because the air conditioning is blasting and the ceiling fans are spinning.  In the winter, it's...freezing!  I had on a sweatshirt and a fleece jacket, and couldn't take the jacket off.  It started to warm up a little, and then got so cold my nose was running.  I asked the manager if it was corporate policy to keep the place so cold that people eat fast, eat less, and leave!  He said the AC wasn't even on.  I hope this review will help turn on the heat, literally and figuratively."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me.  Salad bar is awesome, service is great, and OMG that entree of side dishes you can choose from besides just salad.  This place does get busy so you may want to call first to see if there is room to dine.  Overall highly recommend anyone to check this fine establishment"}
{"text":"Last night after bad experience at The Office restaurant I walked next door to Sweet Tomatoes. I have never been there before so I thought it would be worth a try. The salad bar was more extensive than Souper Salad so I liked that a lot. I also had some pasta, vegetable soup, and frozen yogurt. First of all I loved the frozen yogurt! I know I'm weird but I definitely prefer frozen yogurt to ice cream, especially soft serve frozen yogurt! The pasta and soup were OK but I have to say they were lacking some flavor. Also I tried a bite of a brownie that tasted like fluff with a hint of chocolate...weird.   I preferred the atmosphere, staff, and choices at the salad bar to my usual salad bar Souper Salad. Some of there food definitely could use a little seasoning, but all and all nothing a little salt didn't fix."}
{"text":"i recently took my family out to there...which we go there allot cause my 3 yr old nephew loves salad. the place is always clean and the staff very friendly. the service is outstanding. the only draw back i have is that there are none closer to my place. and that the one closest to me is always crowded and parking is a bit hellish......but i do love the place"}
{"text":"Clean fresh food. Very slim on protein. Soup is always good, would like to see Turkey ham or eggs, they are selling this as an salad bar, not a side salad. Jason's deli is a bunch better choice"}
{"text":"I always feel great when I eat here. So many options of composed salads and regular green salads. You can build your own and choose from every condiment you can think of... beets, corn, peas, pickles, egg and so on. A great selection of soups, breads/muffins/biscuits and pasta dishes. Love their strawberry lemonade. Definitely a great deal and eating healthy you can't go wrong. Keep an eye out for coupons in the mail. Anything helps. Parking can be a little tight, since every time I have gone no matter what time, it is always packed. So you may need to park in neighboring businesses. I parked at Tokyo Boys Diner."}
{"text":"As far as the salad bar part of the restaurant, it was great! Super fresh ingredients all cut well and presented clean and a lot of great options to make your own perfect salad. I had the house made green chili ranch dressing and it was really good!!! Had a bit of spicy from the green chili and was thick and creamy! Yum!!! They also have 8 or so different soup options, a baked potato bar, and some pasta (spaghetti, fettuccine, and mac & cheese) These, not my favs.... I had the chili, it was just like any ordinary can of chili.  The pastas about the same.... I tasted the spaghetti and fettuccine neither had much of an appetizing sauce, a great option is you have kids though. I would come back for the salad and maybe try the baked potato bar next time!"}
{"text":"I don't go to these salad places much but I have to say that Sweet Tomatoes is much better than Souper Salad.  Cleaner, better quality food options, better atmosphere, better service, and better drinks.  The bathroom stunk real bad which didn't seem like it came from the last visit if you know what I mean.  I think I am going to start Yelping more about the bathrooms since a nice bathroom is priceless.  I cant doc much for that since I am glad this place exists otherwise I would be stuck with the other place.  Food is a little more pricey than the other place as well but well worth the extra cost.  Also the trash outside stunk too."}
{"text":"It just seemed like everything here that wasn't salad was so one note no layers of flavor pretty much just garlic. That being said it's a fast easy lunch option in a busy district and the servers have always been very nice and attentive which is always a good thing. But honestly with the choices of food in the area this will hardly ever be my choice just not good enough to beat out the other restaurants around."}
{"text":"This location is extremely clean and the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. The food was all delicious and hot. A great spot for soups and salads and not crowded during lunchtime on a weekday. The soups had a great depth of flavor and the salad bar was clean and well stocked. Definitely not your average buffet. I'm already looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"An upgraded version of Souper Salad.  I don't really like eating at buffets because I tend to over-indulge, so if I come here I usually order it to go. Now, it's certainly not the freshest and defiantly not local and organic, but sometimes you just want inexpensive and healthy alternatives that's not greasy, fried, or fast food. I do like their strawberry walnut salads and soups. They are pretty good and it's great when they offer vegan options!  As far as the price, it's very reasonable and it's even better when you have a coupon.  The Sunday paper usually have them or you can subscribe to their email list and they'll send you the discounted deals. :)"}
{"text":"This location is always clean or being cleaned. They really care about quality and service. Hard to ins these days. Fresh food and great service. Why wouldn't you love to eat here. Gotta live the 4 peaks selection."}
{"text":"When I am feeling like I need to eat healthy, or try to anyway, I go here.  All you can eat salad, soups, breads, pastas, and dessert, how can you go wrong?  I love their focaccia bread.  I always have to get several pieces.  My favorite soup is the broccoli cheddar but they they only have it some of the time.    The Oriental salad and the Caesar salad are good when made fresh.  I gran 2 plates when I first get there cause I also make my own salad.  I try to make it close to a Greek salad but of course I throw some extra stuff on there.  For some reason this place has been a little slow on service the last couple times we have been here.  Hopefully they get it fixed soon."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner,  I am on the phone with my client who is cancelling a project. A server comes up to me , I point to the Bluetooth headset and whisper I am on the phone. He raises his voice and states SIR over and over again until it was a yell. People now look up and my client is asked , \" what's going on.\" I move away from the server  to a quiet area and continue  with my client. The server was screaming  why? I put a tray in a clean area he was closing the section. Why he could not wait a moment is a mystery. I finish the call and go back to the buffet,  where the server states, \" never-mind.\" I ask his name to which turns and walks away. I ask for a Manger who listens as I explainable says, \" customers  don't always treat us good. But I talked to him\".  I asked what does other customers have to do with this issue? Confused,  I asked before eating  to refund me and I left.  Poor management,  employees  can scream at customers wow.....would not recommend. 715 pm Outback is where I ended up , Olive garden is nearby and Tony Romas. They may have a more professional service teams.  Based on some of these Sweet Tomatoes reviews in Yelp, It was not usual but a trend of  poor management"}
{"text":"I've already reviewed this Sweet Tomatoes, but had to provide an update. I have no idea how this place isn't 100% 5 stars, but it should be. The management is great, the restaurant is always clean, and the staff is super-friendly.   Dwayne was very friendly and went above and beyond our expectations on our visit tonight. He deserves a raise. ;)"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking in the Rainbow West shopping center! Upon entering USE THE SANITIZER, it's there for a reason. Grab a try and probably 2 plates. They have 3 premade salads a ceasar which I don't care for at all.   Okay so the salad bar is pretty good, I myself LOVE when they have the sweeter premade salads. Otherwise they have like 15 different dressings to choose from. They have TONS of veggies to choose from. 3 premade salads and 4 different types of greens. Joan's broccoli madness is the shiz! Their strawberry lemonade is awesome but pretty sweet so I usually mix it with their unsweetened FLAVORED iced tea. My favorite soup is the clam chowder and the big noodle chicken. Sometimes they'll have a creamy tomato soup which is soooooo much better then Campbell's lol. My daughter loved their Mac n cheese, I personally don't care for it. Their cord bread has whole corn in it and is awesome with their honey whipped butter. For dessert I ove vanilla frozen yogurt and their butterscotch sauce.  My family and I come here ALOT I'm signed up for Club Veg so I get new coupons or specials every week! You also get a bogo on you bday! So siiiign up :)"}
{"text":"It really isn't bad for what it is. I'm currently mowing down on one of the most bizarre and wonderful salads EVER (okay, there's mac and cheese and some orange slices in here too), and with a drink, it cost just under $8.   Word to the wise: My roommate taught me the clever trick of getting a to-go container. Cram as much shit in there as possible and try to shut the lid. Theory is this: You probably couldn't eat it all in one sitting, but you can refrigerate it, so you could squeeze 2 meals out of it. Eating there promises a fat belly, but no to-go."}
{"text":"Coupons FTW Save yourself a couple bucks from the normal price for about 10 seconds worth of google searching for sweet tomatoes coupons.  I like the different themes they have monthly but I do wish they would change them more often like they do in May and June. I also wish they had the french onion soup more.  As far as the salads, Iv'e never had a bad one and hope it continues like that!"}
{"text":"I love this place. If you like fresh salads you can make yourself with fresh ingredients and great soups this is the place for you.   The restaurant is always clean. The salad ingredients are always fresh. The soups change seasonally, but they always have the chicken chunk and noodle which you have to try.   I suggest Sweet Tomato for any kind of lunch even a business lunch."}
{"text":"Salad was bomb. Soups were yummy. Strawberry lemonade was good. Dessert was good. Very nice staff. I always come here with my mom it's here favorite place. Please bring back broccoli cheese soup!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a salad this is hands down your go to spot. I love all the options they have for salads like egg, broccoli, feta cheese, olives, and really everything your heart could desire. They also have various soups and focaccia breads. I highly recommend the Rosemary potato soup with cheese, bacon and green onions added in. So good!   On the pasta side I usually tend to not even try them since they always taste super bland to me. Same with the desserts they're just kind of meh, but this is supposed to be a healthy restaurant promoting mainly salads anyways so I suppose dessert isn't too much of a concern.  Make sure to sign up for club veg too! They always send email coupons for lunch and dinner as well as letting you know about limited time salads and soups."}
{"text":"It is good if you are in the mood for soup and salad.  I just think it is wayyy too expensive.  I would much rather have the buffet in the talking stick casino for a couple more dollars."}
{"text":"After a good workout I like a big salad. Sweet Tomatoes hits the spot. I enjoy making my own salad with all they have to pick from. Always a good meal."}
{"text":"We frequent this location. The staff is always very friendly, and great to help you with your coupons. The food is always fresh and tasty. Baked potatoes are cooked perfectly. There's a big assortment of soups that change daily and weekly. Pizza is sometimes soggy tasting. The pasta isn't anything too special. The ice cream is always yummy, especially topping off some yummy chocolate lava cake or muffins. Definitely sign up for their emails. They send great coupons and menus."}
{"text":"I'll take this place over Souper Salad, but its not the greatest as it used to be.  I used to go here every weekend for breakfast, which wasnt too bad.  What I do like is their salad.  Always fresh.  Where they do fail is the rest of the food.. always seems old."}
{"text":"Ive been waiting to write this for a week or so...Id give it 1.5 stars, but they dont have those here on Yelp.  I used to love going to Sweet Tomatoes.  I called it the great upgrade from Souper Salad.   And for a long time it was.. and in some cases, still us.  But let me ask you something.. Why would call yourselves Sweet Tomatoes if you literally had no tomatoes?  We decided to hit this place up because we were trying to eat \"healthier.\"  I know funny, huh?  One could still eat like crap at Sweet Tomatoes.   So get my plate and begin my salad creation.. romaine lettuce,, mixed with some ceasar and that's when I noticed things missing.  No tomatoes, No cucumbers, No egg..  uhh hello??  These are what makes muy salad good.  So here I am left to enjoy a lettuce and blue cheese salad?  Horrible.  They said they'd give us a  break of $2  of our bill.. Oh thank you very much for your hospitality. we came to enjoy good food, but you didn't have any.    My final dinner was a small dish of OK pasta along with a half plate of lettuce and blue cheese.  That was sooo worth $10.  (sarcasm).    My last few trips to Sweet Tomatoes have not been great, so next time someone suggests this for dinner, I'll kindly reply with: \"You have a good time, I'll make me a PB&J for dinner.\"     I hope there's another Souper Salad/Sweet Tomatoes type place out there that would like to open a few locations in Arizona and show these guys how it's really done."}
{"text":"If you want a Healthy Meal that's Delicious this is the place to be.Salads,Pastas,Breads,Soup & even Dessert.You name it they have it! They mostly have Vegetarian options.  The salad bar buffet has a variety of dressings with fresh ingredients for both tossed and prepared salads. The Soups are great,on a standard day they have at least 6 varieties of soup (including specials that they do from time to time).I love the Corn Chowder and Minestrone. They also serve baked potatoes and sweet potatoes. The bakery has different types of muffins and breads.The chocolate lava cake is so gooey(it melts in your mouth) they also have beverages and a Mean Soda Machine. If you still have room in your stomach try the hot pastas and some ice cream(chocolate/vanilla or both) with sprinkles and chocolate/caramel before you leave.  Also sign up for Club Veg they will send you a bunch of discount coupons in the Mail.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm sad they don't serve the quinoa anymore. One of the two I only look forward to when I go here. I eat here almost everyday. I guess I'm back to whole foods. Sad"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes has a great selection of food and desserts. I loved the food and the desserts but the staff is horrible. Just rude."}
{"text":"Best salad bar I have been to. Excellent salads and warm food like soup.  Excellent value especially for children and seniors."}
{"text":"In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet.  I had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \"For this?\" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery.  I sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap.  So I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much.  All the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar.  As for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was.  The soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy.  The pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh.  One of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there.  Didn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well.  There is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything.  Something else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see.  Will I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets.  Should you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then.  Good value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price.  If you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes! I come here whenever I get a coupon in my email! This week they have amazing berry salads and dessert! The strawberry shortcake was delicious!"}
{"text":"What can anyone say that isn't POSITIVE about this place. Before I visited, I didn't know a place with never ending salad bars even existed. Now that I know, I will be back!  They have great coupons (by email) and so many options to choose from.  Since I'm eating clean/healthy these days I steered clear of the pasta's and desserts but went in head first for the soups, baked potato's and salads.  I even indulged a bit with the soft serve area.   It was ALL fantastic and I am a life long customer for sure!"}
{"text":"It's nice to find a healthier buffet option. They have plenty of vegetables and other salad toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes! First and foremost, I'm not too big on eating meat in the first place, so I definitely do not mind that there's little to none here. A bowl of hot soup is an instant comfort, and my last meal on earth would definitely be a truck load of carbs. I am just the carb kind of gal, and that's exactly what you get here: an abundance of carbs!  Although some of the food could use a little more flavor, not once have I had a negative experience here. I personally get my money's worth and enjoy my meal!"}
{"text":"After the sad disappointment of the Tempe Field Kitchen, we headed over to this Sweet Tomatoes to enjoy their endless soup, salad, and starches before this location makes the transition to a Field Kitchen as well.  They had the standard pre-made salads (e.g., chicken wonton, Caesar, tuna tarragon, broccoli salad), 8 different soups, the requisite pasta station, muffins, russet and sweet potatoes, and a dessert bar.  I went into a feeding frenzy and got a mix of different salads, tried all the soups, had the gingerbread and orange cranberry muffins, and enjoyed a nice vanilla soft serve sundae!  All had great flavors, and I stuffed my craw to contentment.  Prices for the weekend lunch were a little under $10, and drinks from the soda fountain, tea, and lemonade stands were a little over $2.  We will have to go here again before the major change to Field Kitchen!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes has seen the light and converted back to its original concept! Today was the grand reopening of this location after months of being Field Kitchen. The menu is for the most part, the same as it was before the Field Kitchen conversion, but the interior still holds the swanky bistro feel. The dinnerware also has the same nice cups, plates, and bowls that Field Kitchen had. We went for lunch, where they had some staff outside entering people for a raffle for 52 free meals. They were very friendly and very eager to make sure this new, yet familiar experience would be good for all the customers.  Your old standard dishes are back, such as the tuna tarragon and the broccoli salad, although the wonton salad is now chicken-less (At least for this month). There seems to be slightly less of a selection of toppings for your salad, to be replaced be more dressing options (Including some unique ones like smokey bacon and mango basil). As a throwback to the previous Field Kitchen days, they do offer some a la carte skewers of rosemary chicken, and fresh mozzarella with tomato for a little over a dollar. Since they nixed the fresh fruit bar during the Field Kitchen experiment, they had to move the puddings, mousses, and fresh fruit into a smallish corner of the salad bar portion of the restaurant.  The drink station is pretty awesome. There's an automated soda machine with a touch screen that has a plethora of soda and water choices with various flavor additions if you so desire. They have an increased selection of diet sodas, such as diet Seagram's ginger ale (With various flavor additions like lime), and diet Barq's (There's an option for regular diet, or vanilla diet, very cool!). There's a nice selection of teas, including a very tasty mango ginger tea, as well as various regular and strawberry lemonades.  The soups seem to be the same quality and quantity. In addition to the standard chicken noodle soup, they had at least 2 different chilis, a tomato soup, and a rich and hearty posole with big chunks of pork in it, just to name a few. The bakery selection is limited on the muffin side, although they have the same pizzas and focaccias as they did before. When we went they only had brownies and blueberry muffins available. These muffins are huge compared to the usual sized Sweet Tomatoes muffins, about twice the size of the previous mini-muffins.  The pasta section was probably the most improved since the transition back to Sweet Tomatoes. The pasta was nicely cooked, and I was a big fan of the spicy marinara. It had lots of spicy kick, and a nice rich tomato flavor. The mac and cheese seems to have improved as well.  I didn't try any of the soft serve, but they still had the standard vanilla/chocolate combo, with the various toppings and sauces to go with it.  Service was cheerful and friendly as always. After we paid, we got a 15% off coupon to use for the whole month of April. Nice!  There are a lot of good options for restaurants in this area now, with the opening of Spokes, the reopening of Sweet Tomatoes, and the highly anticipated opening of Los Reyes De La Torta. I'm glad Sweet Tomatoes is back to its original concept, and will be dining here again with frequency!  Weekend lunch: $8.99 per person Fountain drinks: $2.39, unlimited refills"}
{"text":"I love this place, I really do. There is never a wait, at least of all the times I've been here, and they have a lot of vegan and veg options which I truly appreciate . One thing PLEASE serve vegan soft serve, you guys are catching up with the times but I want dessert too! :(  The service is always good and the restaurant seems to always be clean:)"}
{"text":"Reviewing breakfast. After everything you're looking at almost $15 per person. Too much. Scrambles are mediocre. Sausage is gross. Coffee isn't hot enough. Waffles are dry. Worst breakfast value in town. Don't bother."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Sweet Tomatoes. My cousins and I decided to eat lunch here yesterday after a nice hike out at Red Rock. I knew about this relatively new location for a while, but it was my first time here. I really like the spot. It seems like a bunch of places have suddenly sprouted up around them, from Yogurtland to Sammy's Wood-Fired Pizza.  As for Sweet Tomatoes, you probably know the deal. As soon as you enter, you're faced with the salad line. You pick up a tray and a plate (or two), construct your salad, and pay at the end. This location seems to be a little different in that they actually seat you. At every other Sweet Tomatoes I've been to, you just seat yourself.  I have never had a bad salad at Sweet Tomatoes. No matter what ingredients I add, it always just turns out great. This occasion was no exception. I think you can go back for more salad, but I usually don't. To be honest, their post-salad items aren't always amazing, but I come here for the salad anyway. Anything else is just a bonus.  They usually have at least one great soup. They are made from scratch daily and there is a wide selection. I guess February is potato month, so on this particular visit, they had baked Sweet Potatoes. Yum! Yum! Yum! I didn't have any muffins on this visit, but those are usually great too, especially if you pair it with something from their excellent butter selection.  By the way, where else can you get a freakin tiny ass ice cream cone? They don't actually serve ice cream, but they have a frozen yogurt machine. You really have to be careful with those tiny cones because they fill up almost instantly!  I'm still a fan of Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"One of my fav places. Affordable, consistently good quality salads, soups and such. It's not gourmet, or all organic etc but a reliable place for a vegetarian when you're in the mood to pig out with a big buffet."}
{"text":"Very clean facilities. Tons of parking even though its nearly full at noon each day. The salad bar is always well stocked and very fresh. Wonderful soups and deserts too. Nice music, modern not elevator. Attentive staff to remove your dirty plates/bowls. Nearly always use their emailed coupons for BOGO (with drink purchase). Pricey but worth it as long as it's not too frequent."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant is soooo friendly and welcoming!!!! When my ex and I were dating, this was our go to restaurant once a week! Delicious food and great conversations with the staff made us smile each and every time!"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 22/100  My coupon collector of a girlfriend (you know who you are, Candy!) got us a $5.99 deal here a couple of weeks ago. Abundant salad options with extra charge on certain toppings, although you only get a one time go at it. The salad bar is a one way glide towards the cashier where you pay a one time fee for it. It is after paying that you can bask in the unlimited supply of pizza, soup, muffins and non-fat frozen yogurt in the interior of the restaurant.   Great options. We kept heading back to the soups - Mexican Meatball soup for Candy and cheddar brocolls/potato leek for me. For once, I could take in mouthful after mouthful without feeling too conscious (or too bad) about the calorie intake. Clean atmosphere. Efficient staff (one woman accidently dropped her tray & all that came with it. Soon enough, the staff was sweeping it and everything was gone in a jiffy). Healthy options. Great place for family and friends."}
{"text":"Ok for a quick lunch but the tossed salads are left way too long and wet and soggy but the standard salad bar is comprehensive"}
{"text":"i was hesitant about the change but gave it a shot. you can still do the \"make your own salad\" bar with some soups and the same mac n cheese they used to have.   but you can also do a fancy-pants salad. i got the california cobb. they mixed it and it didnt get served with those cool stripes of ingredients . . . but it did have this awesome chunky shredded turkey that they now roast on site. honestly tasted like really good thanksgiving turkey when you eat it the next day. and this salad was, i think, cheaper than the old sweet tomatoes salad bar.   didnt get to try any deserts though.   biggest complaint was that i wish they woulda given me an actual cup for water, not some rinky-dink 6oz plastic thing."}
{"text":"This place is what it is.  A cheap place to feed your huge family of kids mostly.  Seems like there's usually way more kids than adults in here.  Too bad I don't have any, LOL.  But sometimes I am just in the mood for some soup and salad.  This location is almost always super slammed, I wish they would build another one to the south - with less outdoor seating (because this isn't CA) and more bathrooms (2 stalls...wtf???).    The staff generally looks like they are trying the best they can, but it's usually a little messy and gross all over, with shortages of half the stuff.  If you're actually really trying to be healthy, stick to the salad bad (you can go through more than once, you know) and the broth-based soups -- and skip the bread and other high-carbs, the cream-based soups, and the soft-serve.  But a lot of the stuff really isn't all that healthy, and it's hard to find stuff with protein.  I keep hoping they will try harder to put more gluten-free and less heavily-processed choices.  It still reminds me a little too much of the salad bars of the 80s with all the \"comfort junk food\".  But like I said, it is what it is, and at least it's cheap, especially with coupons."}
{"text":"We absolutely love, love, love Sweet Tomatoes and eat here quite often with family and friends. Everything is exquisite!! The price is right, the food is the best and the choices are many and hard to choose from. You will never leave their hungry!! The employees are very efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Family favorite. Kids love it. It's a buffet on steroids.  Wet clean, options are fresh and soups have a vegetarian/vegan option every time. Easy going atmosphere and love there employees. They are friendly and always help us get to a table when it's busy."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is BACK and better than ever!  Field kitchen was an absolute nightmare and disaster. Many guests including ourselves voiced our opinion and Sweet Tomatoes listened. That alone shows you this is a great company.  We have been long time fans of Sweet Tomatoes and before, the food was very yummy. After their Field Kitchen trial and return back to their original, their food has become delicious! There are more choices on the salad bar (LOVED the sliced apple), blueberry muffins are bigger and tastier, soda machine is updated, and everything else just tastes better.  Sweet Tomatoes has really stepped up their game and I cannot see any business in the area compete with them. On top of the great food and reasonable price, the staff is just so helpful and friendly. Everyone smiles and says hello, goodbye, thank you, etc. This experience was so great that the wife and I ALMOST went back the next day!  Go in to eat, visit, and relax. I would give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Overall this place is consistent and the food is pretty decent."}
{"text":"This place is not clean. They don't clean the pans between batches of cornbread and what ever else they cook in it which the lady almost completely blurted out before realizing what she was saying. 53 dollars for shit for food.  Only location I like in the east valley is the one in gilbert."}
{"text":"Bad. Limited choices of vegetables at salad bar at lunch.  Quality of vegetables are average at best.  They charge you extra each time through for their cold dry chicken and other toppings."}
{"text":"I have to say there are best location and grate costumer service. Love it and will come back again............."}
{"text":"Love this place when I want a big salad and feel vegetarian. You don't have to work very hard to skip any animal protein, but that is why I go here. I have eaten at many of these in San Diego  (called soup plantation) and they parent company is slowly remodeling them. This one on Indian Bend could use a face lift, it seems a little tired."}
{"text":"4 Stars? Put down the bongs everyone, come back to reality and look at what you're giving 4 Stars to. Sweet Tomatoes is what  happens when a bean counter accountant looks at a Golden Corral or Sizzler type salad bar and says what if we could build a restaurant around just the salad bar with a few non-steak extras thrown in to spiff it up? Imagine the cash we'll rake in. Hello Sysco, I want your cheapest product line....  If you haven't got my point by now you never will. Seriously, it's freakin cafeteria style food. I don't know about you but I have very bad memories of school cafeteria food. So handing me a tray and sending me down the line to pick out my choices brings not so good flashbacks. In this case of Sweet Tomatoes you get picked over greens, a bunch of Sysco cheapest product possible bulk food service toppings, more bulk food type salad dressing, and all set in a decor that is circa 2010 but yet would not feel out of place in 1982. This is a place where I had an OMG WTF was I thinking moment when I tried to be polite to the people I was with and choke it down.  Toss in staff that are slow to clean the place up, screaming kids, and ho-hum bakery offerings and I see absolutely no reason to think of turning off Stephanie Street into a tight, usually packed parking lot to come here again. 4 Stars? Maybe if someone slipped me special brownies and I had the worst case of the munchies ever. Otherwise it's not only no but hell no. I love salad but every time I think it's a pain in the rear to round up all the ingredients I like for mine I just think of this place. I won't grumble when I go to the store and achieve a sneeze guard free salad experience after coming here.   Oh and this is another place where you'll be glad to know there's CVS and Walgreens locations close by for all of your upset stomach needs."}
{"text":"This was the second time our families vacationed at the JW Marriott at the second time we all came o dinner here this time, we had a total of 26 people (12 adults 14 kids). I called that day to give them a heads up. We arrived at 5:15 and our table was all set up. The food was nice and fresh. The only thing was that they did not have clam chowder. Big :( otherwise everything was great. Service was good and empty plates were cleared out quickly.  Great place for casual meal"}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh and yummy! I eat here monthly and I am never disappointed!!!! Great food! Great service!!!"}
{"text":"I was trying to figure out why every plate I picked up was either dirty or greasy or wet. Then while I was eating I saw the clean plate cart coming around, putting out new plates. I will never eat there again. Terrible dirty."}
{"text":"First time here and loved It....... I definitely over indulged but it was all healthy nutritious food.  I will be back next time we visit the 9th island....las/hnl....."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: the food isn't going to rock your socks off and it's not anything special, but the diverse salad bar is fresh, it's a wonderful place for Vegetarian-friendly (and Vegan, if you're lucky) eats, and you simply can't beat the price! With their coupons (weekly ads and online), we had their AYCE lunch for just $5.99 each (regular is $8.29). I mean, six bucks for delicious, fresh, make-it-your-own salad? YES PLEASE! My favorite part of Sweet Tomatoes? The monthly, and sometimes more frequent, changing menu! It's just fun and there's a smaller chance of boredom.  I love that they have beets and all my usual friends: broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions, celery, etc. Plus, you can go back for more! They also feature other ready-made salads and in the last few months that I've been, I have really enjoyed the Greek Couscous w/ Feta Cheese & Pinenuts (Vegetarian) and Whole Grain Fiesta Couscous (Vegetarian). From the bakery, I like the Blueberry Muffin, Banana Crunch Muffin Top, and Quattro Formaggio bread. Now their soups are a different matter; I'm not a big fan. Especially their Vegetarian ones. The last couple times I've visited has been after my Vegan/Vegetarian journey and I haven't had a soup I've enjoyed. Prior to that however, I've really enjoyed the Chicken Pot Pie Stew and Creamy Herbed Turkey (additionally because they serve it with their buttermilk biscuits and stuffing, respectively. I've also seen their nutrition guide (love that they have this!), so I know there are TONS of items I've never tried and there may be Vegetarian soups out there that I'll like.  Bottom line: this is my go-to place for a quick, cheap, casual, healthy and Vegetarian meal! I also visit frequently!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is an awesome chain and this location in particular is my favorite! Lots of clean, open space and the food is always fresh and delicious. I always get my money's worth, despite it being mainly a salad and soup buffet. I feel that they have wonderful options if you want something other than salad and soup. I love how every month they feature a different ingredient and make some cool recipes with it. It goes to show that they really care about the customer experience and try to make it as special as possible! The only thing I don't like are their tiny plates. I feel like I have to get up and down to get food so many more times than needed.   Check this place out if you're looking for fresh, high volume food at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I rolled in for dinner the other night. We don't have unreasonably high expectations when it comes to buffets but this was our first time at this one. We liked the salad bar, lots of offerings for lettuce, decently tidy. Price for two dinner buffet with drinks was over $31. So our expectations were a bit higher after we paid. One thing that's a little disappointing about this place is there aren't any proteins to add to your salad or even any protein based dishes in the buffet (this isn't the franchise's fault), which is a bummer and makes this not a super diet friendly spot as a result. Pepsi products only! The ice cream was disappointing as was every single soup option. We felt like the overall presentation was pretty dirty, and the food quality was lacking. Overall, not a great value for the price, might be able to justify it at lunch when it's about $8.99 per person, but not great. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My first time here. Service is exceptional. Salad bar is fresh and yummy. Love, love the Albondiga soup. Yeah on the bake potato. Will come again."}
{"text":"This is a self-serve salad bar. $13 per person for all you can eat salad and fixins. They have 8 made-from-scratch soups, a few pasta choices & baked potato bar. I was surprised that they don't offer any proteins with the salads for that price.  We found bacon bits in the potato bar for our salad protein. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My first time here today! They didn't have much variety of the pre made salads but I guess that's the point since you're suppose to make your own. I enjoyed that aspect a lot. I also enjoyed the fact that they had a wide variety of teas I could choose from. They also had pizza & pasta which my BF loved. & a great variety of soups as well!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I haven't given this place a review before. My boyfriend and I are literally here every week! The food taste fresh and amazing. We never leave here feeling gross. Their crew is very friendly. I'm not sure if the guy that's always here is the owner or manager, but he always greets us. You'll see him carrying people's trays to their tables when their hands are full. Awesome guy. I've been to the one on Peoria here and one in San Jose, CA. This one is still the best location though."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Sweet Tomatoes.   It's an all you can eat salad bar complete with different soups, breads, pastas, and desserts.  Through my visits here, I can say that the food is consistently fresh. The salads and veggies have always been fresh.   I agree with other reviews regarding cleanliness, especially  at busy times. Dirty plates can start to pile up on tables and sometimes it seems like they could use some extra help clearing plates and cleaning tables.   I signed up for their email club and get coupons regularly. I don't visit without a coupon.   All in all this is a good place with a lot of healthy options!"}
{"text":"When I want to eat something fast, but stay away from burgers...this is my go to place."}
{"text":"I brought the step daughter here today for her birthday breakfast. Its been awhile since I was here. They now have a \"premium\" section that costs $3 more to add to your salad. There was some chicken & tofu and a few other things. I didnt get that since there are so many other things they have. One of which was the best tomato soup..it was so creamy. I wish I would have bought a take home container of it cuz I would really enjoy snacking on that tonight!"}
{"text":"I didn't have the greatest time visiting this Sweet Tomatoes. I found it fell out of sync with the quality of other Sweet Tomatoes that I've been to in the past.   Other than that, my family all got sick and that consistent factor was this location. They offer a lot and the staff is courteous and friendly. I just wasn't too impressed here."}
{"text":"So we're here, a lot.  And I keep telling myself we need to stop coming here cause...IhavenoselfcontrolandIovereatwheneverI'mhere.  There, I said it.  Also, to be honest, I'm hardly here for the salads.  It's the soups.  I want all of them; the chicken noodle, chili, clam chowder, corn chowder, broccoli cheese, some sausage soup that I can never remember the name of.  You name it, I've had it.  The pizzas/breads are amazing, especially with the recent addition of the BBQ chicken \"pizza\".  Mac and cheese, 'nuff said.  They have sweet potatoes and baked potatoes too if you're not full enough at this point.  And of course, desserts!  There's always room for dessert.  Or I'll make room.  Tapioca pudding (with chocolate syrup)!  Ice cream!  Chocolate lava cake or whatever's seasonal!  You get the idea, I love this place.  It's not top-notch food, but it definitely hits the spot.  Plus it's a buffet, it's cheap, the staff are really friendly, and it's quite possibly healthier than any other buffet you're going to find.  And don't forget to sign up for their mailing list!"}
{"text":"Ok, so at first, I was not a really big fan of this place.  I do like salad, but I just wasn't impressed.  It was a few years ago when I first tried it, so I do not remember exactly what I had.  WHAT CHANGED was when I tried the Albondigas Soup!! WOW!  I loved it so much, a few weeks later I went online and found a recipe and made some at home. Its just so flavorful! Me and the family went again a week or so ago...this time they had some Horchata Muffins! Those were uber-amazing!  Warm, sweet and soft, with a slightly crunchy cinnamon/sugar topping.  They need to keep the Albondigas Soup a constant thing."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointing! We had coupons...$20 and that included drinks. Seemed skimpy on the hot items. Salad bar was fine, nothing to write home about. Doubt I'll return!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a bit pricy but you can always find coupons online.  Join their email club and they send you coupons that way too.  This location is currently being renovated so it's a little messy looking but the food is great.  Their chicken noodle soup is AWESOME.  Be sure to ask for fresh pizza, too.  My only complaints are the price and that the drink station is out of the way if you sit closer to the buffet areas. The manager of the location is really nice and always samples freshly baked cookies at night.  We usually come here once a week and are rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is smaller than the one on 95+ Warm Springs. It's ok. It's a Sweet Tomato. The other one has more stuff but everything here is fresh. Its a smaller place and the items are a little different as far as the soups are concerned. I think the salad is the same."}
{"text":"It's a Sweet Tomato. I am not sure why I came here instead of the one near my house. It's not bad if this is what you wanted."}
{"text":"I am back! The foods still greats, the services awesome and now they have beer and wine..lol!"}
{"text":"Meh could take it or leave it!  Cashier took 10 minutes to write our Id numbers down when ordering wine with dinner because a person in our party looked under 21 but was in fact 30. Food was so so aside from salad other dishes were just meh. The French onion soup was good tho. Prolly won't eat here again"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place but they have the most awesome soups and their corn bread is the best especially with some honey whipped butter. The salad bar is amazing so many topping to choose from. The restaurant was clean and the waitresses kept coming around and cleaning the empty plates."}
{"text":"Fresh salad, hot soups, cold ice cream...who can't be happy with all this? Plus, so much more. My husband and I come to Sweet Tomatoes but only after I've had a good workout, because I know I will want to try everything at this \"healthy\" buffet. Sure, you can eat healthy here, but you can also eat unhealthy and definitely overeat. I love their soups and everything is so fresh. And for a buffet, its a good price. Especially if you can get a coupon out of your local newspaper."}
{"text":"I am in general a fan of buffets. Endless possibilities and food choices. Sweet Tomatoes is a good go-to place. There did not seem to be as large a selection here as at other places. Plus the same things seem to be on the menu over and over. The same focaccia. The same soups. Only if you come in the evening can you get the \"special\" of the month. Still good, just not as impressive as others."}
{"text":"Went in a few weeks ago and just now am posting this, as  a friend witnessed the same exact act. But I went in about a month or 2 ago simply to grab some soup for a sick sibling, I was shocked when one of their employees (a Hispanic man, probably about mid twenties, I'm assuming he was a manager) proceeded to take a tip off the table from a family who had just left, and just walked away. Then, when another employee came around to clean the table, nothing was there for him. It was truly appalling. I let it be, thinking that it must be a system they have In place for tips or whatnot, but was furious when a friend went in the other day, and saw the same thing happen. Watch who your tipping, because clearly those who are higher up take advantage of their employees."}
{"text":"We really like this place they're always exceptionally friendly and very knowledgeable. The places nice clean safe"}
{"text":"I regret checking in after we paid for our lunch as this place is pretty overpriced for what it is. Yelp offered 15% off! Shame on me!! I had been wanting to come here for quite some time as I heard the soups are amazing. First of all, the entrance is very confusing. There are three sets of doors. We followed someone to one set in the front and it was locked. After walking to another set of doors, an employee decided to let us in. Seeing we were lost, he could've explained the beginning of the line. We arrived just after 4 when the price increases from lunch pricing to the dinner rate. I wouldn't mind if the bar were fully stocked, but it wasn't. There were several empty bowls. I dressed a mediocre salad, set it at my table and went off to check out the soups. The station was messy. I sampled two soups - the curry bisque and the mushroom. Both were really salty. I didn't think the curry complemented the bisque whatsoever. The mushroom reminded me of my Campbell soup days. Oh, I forgot.. You have to pay extra for your self serve fountain pop. The price has slipped my mind, but I remember it being not at all worth it. I opted for water. So then you can have dessert, because you will have room in your belly.. There's a soft serve station with minimal fixings.. Then beside that is random additional desserts..that day it was rice pudding and a chocolate lava cake. Sounds delish, but I'd stick with the soft serve.. So then I see people leaving tips. Hmmmm. I've been to buffets in which a server will get you drinks, and that is deserving of a tip. But to tip someone to take my plate away after I leave? Since when do we tip busboys? This wasn't the worst buffet in the world, but for the price I'd rather be served a better quality meal and won't be running back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had no problems with the service. I thought the buffet would be a little bit bigger with more selection. I could've sworn I'd been to soup plantation (same company) and there buffet was bigger, I could be wrong though.  The pasta station was alright in terms of taste. The souls were pretty good, a bit salty. The area was kept clean though.   For the price you pay, there should be a little more variety and perhaps some more healthy options (besides the salad)"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomato. This place is always first choice for my mom. There salad bar is so tasty with different vegetables, fruits and salads. Often there are new combinations available. Recently, they added premium choices to the salad bar. I'm not a fan because I always get edamame when I go, and now it's $2.49 in the premium section and you only get 1 serving, so make it good. I was quite bummed. But, I love Sweet Tomato too much to stop going. The mac and cheese here is so creamy and good! I always eat more than 3 bowls of mac and cheese. The soups taste very fresh. Most of the time I get the chicken noodle and just eat the fresh egg noodles. My mom loves clam chowder and broccoli cheddar. The pizza bread is baked just right- the bread has a nice crunch while being soft.   The price is not that bad if you get your money's worth. They have senior and military discounts too.  The service is great too. They are always willing to help. My sister brought her baby one day and they seated us where we wouldn't be in the way of those passing by with the baby chair. The workers came around often and cleared our table, so we could indulge in even more tastiness. At one point they walk around and give everyone complimentary cookies. Although the new premium menu is a bummer, I will not turn down a trip here."}
{"text":"Weekdays are usually a good time to go. Weekends are busy and long lines are not cool. Nice atmosphere plenty of clean tables and plenty of food to choose from. This is restaurant is a good place to eat especially during the weekdays. Weekends is a different issue altogether."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Sweet Tomatoes location for quite some time. Fresh veggies and salads along with pasta and desserts. Not to mention the selection of muffins and pizza breads. I signed up for their club veg and every two weeks or less I get an email with at least three coupons. I use the buy one meal get one free with the purchase of two drinks every time I go and it comes out to a decent deal. Recently I went for lunch with a friend and I had a buy one get one free coupon, somehow the total came out to more than I usually pay for dinners? Today when I went I noticed they have indeed raised their prices. I don't know who would charge over $2 for drinks but they do have some great lemonade and flavored teas.  This month is lemon themed and I went a little crazy with the lemon salad, lemon orzo soup, lemon pasta with capers, and lemon \"lava\" cake. Oddly enough I could taste the difference in all items instead of having the constant lemon flavor in my mouth.   I noticed they have a new option where you can order fresh cut veggies in different sizes for parties or family meals. Their small is less than what you would pay at a Whole Foods or something else with decent produce, and you get more for the value. The lower price and fact that you don't have to cut anything makes me wonder if I should make this a weekly purchase."}
{"text":"Been here two times, but I've also been to the Souplantation in Los Angeles a few times. There are a lot of coupons to get in the mail or if you sign up online! You also get 15% off when you check in which is awesome.   I love the tomato soup but they didn't have it the second time I went but that's okay. I didn't like the chicken noodle soup though. The salad bar is always clean and the salad is fresh and the prepared salads are really good!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a healthy alternative to fast food, come try this salad bar. Some ingredients I will not eat like the kidney beans and the corn which come from a can and you need to ask the cooks which soups are actually made from scratch and which are from a can as they are not all from scratch. the menu is the same all day but for dinner the price increase $2.00 so go for a late lunch as dinner begins @ 4pm...you can stay as long as you want and sit in the new section as it is sunny and bright compared to the drabby dark old section.  Good place to a somewhat healthy meal for around $8.00"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this location since I used to always go to the one in Henderson. It's right off the 215 and Flamingo exit. It appears to be smaller but overall the same. The staff was nice and friendly. Our busgirl was very fast and efficient. She was constantly moving and cleaning. Place is clean and restrooms decent. Good for families. Prices are reasonable. Will definitely come back.   YELP 100 CHALLENGE: #13"}
{"text":"I am a junkie.  There.  I said it.  In all the years I have eaten here, I have never seen even a remotely unfresh piece of produce.  Ever.  I'm big on the takeout salad.  The tray looks small, but when its filled, its a humongous salad.  The only reason they don't get a five, is that I'd like to see a little free protein on the buffet.  It's a great place to go when you're hungry, but want to eat healthy.  Oh, speaking of a little unhealthy the asiago foccaccia ROCKS."}
{"text":"Love the place, go there quite often. Wish they have some vegan options for soups, otherwise, it is a perfect place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Thank you for always keeping it fresh and healthy. Great place for a quick lunch with friendly and courteous people who can smile"}
{"text":"Sign up for the ClubVeg coupons. That's the only way this place is a value... Cuz seriously.. WHERE'S THE BEEF? :)  Four stars for the salad bar itself. I've yet to encounter any of the freshness issues.. in fact, everything I've had has been super fresh! Most of their prepared salads are downright tasty, especially the Chicken Won Ton Salad.. a classic! As for the soups, and hot foods, 2 stars, on their best day.  Their soups just aren't that great, and I've tried just about each one... Today the featured soup was lemon orzo and it was absolutely inedible.. Their chicken noodle, is decent, and so is their potato soup, most of the time.. just don't be surprised if you get raw potatoes sometimes. Not uncommon.  They've got a nice selection of carb-tastic breads/pizza type things, which aren't what I'm really there for.. If you're going here to eat healthy, you may as well avoid the hot foods all together. All things considered, the full dinner price, with drink is a bit over $13.00.. The Casino Arizona buffets aren't much more expensive, and neither are the top Asian buffets in the valley. Finally, this place is CRAWLING with some of the most insufferable brats suburbia can offer."}
{"text":"An over whelming  smell of cow dung lingering in the air... not enough \"bread\", super busy Saturday crowd! Feels like we are at a church pot luck next to a giant barn!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD OK, clean? NOT! the floor and restrooms needed alot of help. Dont care to ever go back, but the kids like it."}
{"text":"This place is great for the whole family! I love this place because I am a vegetarian and there is an endless variety of things for me to choose from! They always have fresh food out and it's yummy! The salad bar is my favorite! Of course my kids love the mini ice cream cones, while my husband can't get enough of the Mac and cheese!  This is always our go to place and with the family coupons it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"I LOVE SWEET TOMATOES! Ok after a good workout from LVAC and you don't really want a smoothie but you wanna at least feel good about myself not eating crap. Just stay away from the MOLTEN LAVA CAKE in that ghetto ass pan.  The salad selection isn't bad. It's rotated for freshness. I've always had fresh veggies. The soups are pretty good. They label what's Vegan and what's just meat. I like knowing all the ingredients. Yea definitely all you can devour under ten bucks is a good selling point. So what you gotta pay extra for chicken? I mean if you really want chicken. Pick it out of the soup. Hehehe. For what it is, it's a great place. If you're on a diet....LAY OFF THE RANCH DRESSING!"}
{"text":"This location seems to be very well stocked, upscale, and clean. At 6'4 sometimes I need more than 1 salad to fill me up. Sometimes I need 2 and a half salads. And soup. And bread. The value quotient here is quite high especially for lunch. If you sign up for their email blasts, you get the meal for $8. There are even 2 person deals that include drinks.  The make your own baked potato with all the fixings has been a favorite of mine. They also kill the french onion soup! Dump in as much cheese and croutons as you like. I have never encountered spoiled veggies. everything is fresh and changed out regularly.  Only grips is during the dinner hour, Tomatoes offers up a few premium salad bar items with protien. 8/10 times these premium salad options are laced with nuts. For someone with a nut allergy, this is disappointing. Perhaps put the nuts on the side or offer the dish in a separate container without the nuts.  Rounding out the experience is a coke freestyle machine, and some delicious strawberry lemonade making paying extra for a drink truly worth it!"}
{"text":"We decided to go have dinner this weekend and it was horrible. The salad bar was filthy dressings all mixed and all over the bar, the 3 salads they had were close to empty with no one making new salad, the lettuce was old and it wasn't even close to the closing time. The soups looked old as well... I used to love this place but we will not be back."}
{"text":"This location is now \"Field Kitchen,\" and me and the hubby were very hesitant about staying. After a manager got us to sample some of their fresh chicken however, we ended up staying out of good faith. It was a great idea and the food was just lovely...Their take is more modern, portions bigger per a la carte' and they now carry meat and a wide array of other alcoholic and non-alcoholic infused beverages. Overall, very good changes I'm seeing on the horizon. P.S., with the $7.99 build your own salad & sides, me and hubby paid around $5 dollars less for everything we usually want ;)"}
{"text":"Everything was super clean and organized.  A giant fresh salad bar welcomed me at the front door.  A huge selection of toppings and dressing.  Nice soup selection -- French onion was on point."}
{"text":"I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or ?  There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert, chocolate, had no taste at all.  It was cold, creamy and without any flavoring.  The lady at the registered dropped 2 large stacks of glasses (all glasses are plastic or paper).  She and others picked them up from the floor and stacked them back up.  I watched as they gave them to the new customers.  What do you think would be on a floor? There is always lots of food but they obviously care nothing about food temperatures or bacteria on their dishes. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a log time.  Decided to try it at about 1:15pm.  Wasn't too busy and a variety of people (young and older) were dining.  Salad bar and dressings all cool and fresh. Chicken Noodle soup barely even warm.  All the hot breads were cold. Mac and cheese was stuck into one big ball. Coffee was barely warm, and cream was warm.  Obvious  there is no quality control though soup etc temps are really important.   I informed one of the ladies cleaning tables about the soup, and I saw her go over and tell a guy behind the counter, but I never saw anyone touch that soup again before I left.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times.   My gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads.   Service is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???  And something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks????   In the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                      The pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there..   The funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed!  I guess people love a so so place.  I dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!!   I'm just sayin,,,,"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years and the food has really gone downhill over the past few. Tonight I believe will be my last night ever at Sweet tomatoes on Flamingo. I am a soup person matter what season, and the soup tonight was absolutely horrible. It was watery and many of them had the exact same underlying taste. The minestrone soup had hardly any veggies in it. The onion soup had a very strange flavor. When I went back for a different soup, there was a customer they're trying to tell the guy behind the counter how to make a better onion soup. The guy looked like he couldn't care less. For my daughter and me the meal was $26. That's a lot for a bunch of food that we really couldn't eat and no protein. My daughter had the lava cake and she says it tasted like the Kids Cuisine desserts that she had a couple times when she was very little. The only thing that was good about tonight's meal was the fact that we are able to make ourselves chocolate Coke's."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat a salad of choice with a little side snack of soup or pizza"}
{"text":"For $8.50 you are getting a \"sweet\" deal!! AYCE salad, soup, pizza, baked potato, etc...super worth it. Tasty, fresh, and cheap!! The floor was a bit slippery for some reason, but oh well. Love their ice cream and toppings, too. And although it's an extra cost, their strawberry lemonade was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Salad bar is one of the best. The food is ok but not much of a selection. For the price it's a little expensive but I joined their club to get their coupons which makes it more reasonable. Also they keep it very clean."}
{"text":"My 6 year old's favorite!  He loves that you can all the pizza and mac that you want! :)  I love that I can eat all the salad I want.  I don't feel guilty when I stuff my face with salad.  Great place for families too.  Plenty of options.  I do wish they would have a meats selection to add to your salad though. (chicken, ham, etc.)"}
{"text":"I really love this place, okay, this place is great because they have a lot to chose from and have a fresh spin on it, for this place is a salad place that has more then just salad; they have soup and pizza, mac n cheese, plus they got some got desserts   + Great CS, always help full + food always tastes great, fresh and able to keep you going for hours. + They have salad, and all around their food is great and the drinks that have a great too. +the style of this place is all its own, for it has a place for culture to be a big part of the means of them have such a willingness to make sure that you are happy, enjoying and even recalling the food, and loving that you want to go back to a place that is so well, full of life and has something that does so much for your life that you will for sure live life that much more, crunch."}
{"text":"Great place for veggies! Pizza and breads are a Great surprise . Have they  Changed the carpet?"}
{"text":"If you want to watch a pedestrian traffic jam, while you eat, this is the spot. Also, don't look too close at the hygiene of the guy in front of you while he navigates the spaghetti bar. I will never be back. I'm not the most patient person to begin with. Paying 10 dollars to dodge people at a food trough is not my idea of a relaxed dining experience."}
{"text":"I love LOVE this buffet because it is ALWAYS clean and I never feel gross after stuffing myself because it is a salad buffet. I am addicted to their chicken noodle soup, I seriously cannot get enough. I recommend grabbing a blueberry muffin and asking the guy behind the counter for the honey whipped butter (they don't leave it out anymore). Together the two are sinful!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre but honestly they have no respect for veterans which is actually a big deal to me. I asked the lady who rang us up if they had military discount, she then asked if we were active duty and when I said no she said then no we don't. I think it's really rude for a place to respond like this. My husband served 8 years in the military and now has permanent disabilities due to it but because he's not still active.. he doesn't deserve a discount. But she gave the people in front of us senior discounts without checking their ID. Please learn some respect and at the very least treat veterans with some dignity."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Sweet Tomatoes for a long time. I didn't know what to expect. A co-worker raves about it yet a good friend refers to it as \"her dirty little secret.\"  Here is my take on Sweet T's:  I don't eat meat which one would venture to guess that I would have a field day here, not so much. While the salad bar is extensive, the soup bar fell short. There are no vegetarian/vegan soups. They did have a black bean soup and when I asked if they used chicken/beef/veggie broth no one could tell me so I just avoided it. So you feel like you get your money's worth there are lots of bread, baked potatoes, mac & cheese, pasta dishes desserts, etc. to fill you up. The best part of my meal was a brownie and a chocolate chip cookie.   Will I return to Sweet T's? Magic 8 ball says probably, the people watching is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I had posted a review while in the restaurant, but realized that the few words I prattled off did not do justice to the experience.  All these other positive reviews this place has, I do not understand.  So here is the real review this place deserves:  First off, the entrance to the place.  I get that this franchise is trying to sell the idea of fresh/healthy food.  Salad is suppose to be healthy.  However, walking in the first thing you notice is the dead and dying hanging herb garden.  This assortment of plants look as though they had not seen anyone's attention in months.  Given the storms in the valley, I would have given this a pass, but once inside the door, you are greeted with baskets full of rotting red peppers and Leaks that have been ignored for so long they had mold growing in the stems.  (Not exactly what you call fresh)  You can tell it was nothing more than a thoughtless display that was tossed together months ago and forgotten.  Next the price.  26$ for two people to eat lunch...  Really... for a buffet?   I understand that healthy food is more expensive.  (Pita Jungle regularly gets my dollars) The price would not be that far out of line if the food quality was there to support the price.  Or if it was fresh, made-to-order like PJ.  (This was not)  So the food.  Bland, no seasoning, pre-packaged tasting and gross.  As I got my plate and stepped into the line I was met with wet, wilted over dressed greens.  They were soaking in a bowl of water and dressing.  Not a good start.  I picked a few of the other items as a sample, expecting to find something worth coming back for.  Alas, I never came back to this line for many reasons, but mostly because nothing had any flavor.  If was mostly texture and the idea of salad.     I continued on to the soup.  Several selections, but again, you could tell nothing was fresh and everything came out of a commercial plastic bag.  No flavor, and not a speck of salt or seasoning.  Bland and flavorless.    I then tried the mac n cheese and other pasta choices, hoping for something to save the meal.  No luck...  No seasoning, bland and gross.  The mac and cheese would have been better if it came out of a box.  The oil rising to the top of the cheese sauce you could wick off with your napkin.  Last chance to save the meal, I hit the potato bar.  (I mean, how do you screw up a potato?)  They found a way!  The potato was so over-cooked that it had the texture of chalk... Hot, flavorless, chalk.  Even with all the toppings, I could not get past the texture.  Then came the extra-special bonus.  A piece of plastic.  (Looked like the tip of a bag  clip)  Hey... It happens, so not a big deal, but...  Where did it come from?  The potato was whole, so it had to have been in with the toppings right?  (The mystery of the rouge plastic bag clip bugged me the whole drive home.)  All in all...  This place is off my list for good.  Even if they cleaned up their act, I'm not sure that I would give it a try again.  For the price I can do sushi, Pita Jungle or just about any other healthy alternative for the same price or less.  No, this is not a place I would ever recommend or return to again. MRM"}
{"text":"Love this place, I eat there all the time.. If you are up for a salad or just carbohydrates, this is the place. If you want protein, they don't offer much of it. I am a senior and they have a deal where if you make in before 5:00 you get a drink and the salad buffett for around $8.00 which is a deal. The salad is very fresh, the soup is excellent, and the baked goods and very tasty... They also have a baked potato and pasta option. For desert you they always have fruit, jello, soft serve ice cream and some kind of cobbler.   I like it that they will give me an iced tea to drink with my meal and then allow me to have coffee with my desert..  My wife and I eat out more that we eat at home so we are always looking for good healthy, economical places to eat.. We also like it that it is basically a self serve place.. If you are not a senior or you can't eat before 5:00 there are always coupons you can sign up for on line. We do some of that as well.."}
{"text":"Oh shit!  Literally.    I was at this location on Sunday night (2/25/07) and it was horrible.  The first thing we noticed was that there weren't any dishes.  It was like nothing new was being washed and brought out for customers to use.  Then the place started to smell bad... and then we noticed the waste water bubbling up from the floor drains behind the salad bar.  It was like something out of a horror movie.  We left in a hurry... a drainage grate in the parking lot was flowing with more raw sewage.  It was amazingly gross.    Any good experiences I've ever had in this place are moot... I'm never going back to this location again."}
{"text":"they have changed this place and to me it wasnt for the better. They have taken away lots from the hot food section and the desserts."}
{"text":"For a guy like me who is mainly on salad diet, this is a good place to eat with lots of options. They always serve different varieties of soups and salads. Also, they keep on changing the menu every fortnight which is another plus point. People not much inclined towards salads may find this place little bit pricy, so always look for coupons before visiting (15% discount or other combo offers are pretty common)."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is the same as the other souplantations/sweet tomatoes.  Same great blueberry muffins, salads, and soups!    This location has a little more trendy look to it with the hardwood floors.  The venue is smaller than all the other places I've been to.  Still great food! And a great detox buffet compared to all the buffets in the casinos"}
{"text":"My daughter really wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes.  After some prodding, I told her we could go, but I wanted to find out what was behind this instance that we have Sweet Tomatoes for lunch.  What did she hold to be the very essence of Sweet Tomatoes that was driving her to say that we must go?  Here is my interview.  Interview with my daughter.  Me: What  do you like about Sweet Tomatoes?  Mira: The dessert and the pizza.  Me: What else do you like?  Mira: The food.  Me: But, why do you like coming HERE?  Mira: Because .  . . Of . . . the FOOD!  Me: Is there anything else you like besides the food?  Mira: The drinks."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive for what you get. My husband, son (4) and I came here just wanting a salad and noodles for my son. The salad was good but not for $35. We could have gone to a Resturant and ordered one for less. The staff was nice and friendly though so that why it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"Always a good choice when you want a plate full of vegetables.  I do think it is a bit overpriced, especially if you want a beverage."}
{"text":"So many toppings for your salad. It's just a salad bar people say, but what salad bar has all these vegetable options? The soups are tasty. I don't eat the pasta, but my wife says they are good. The manager is always happy and checks on tables"}
{"text":"Super long salad bar with all the toppings you want and some you never thought of. Keep it low cal by using red wine vinegar insread of dressing.  Soups are usually yummy  and  ot very salty. I dont eat breads so i cannot comment on the pizza/foccacia things. They had sweet potatoes on the last visit, they  did not the previous couple visits.  Check online for coupons and skip the sugar and just drink water. Negatives: parking is tight and the bathrooms could use some work."}
{"text":"Great selection of salad, soup, and breads. I love the wonton chinese salad the best and they always have a new pre-made salad every few weeks which are usually good. The blueberry muffins with the honey butter are my favorite. No trip to sweet tomatoes would be complete however without a dish of soft serve frozen yogurt at the end! The ingredients are always fresh on the salad bar, the dressings always have at least 8+ choices, and there is usually some fruit as well.   If you sign up for their \"club veg\" emails, there are coupons every week for lunch and dinner. I always feel like I am making a \"healthy\" better choice for eating out when I come here."}
{"text":"If you like soup and salad this is the place for you!! Great selection of salad. Some soups are delicious and some are so so. They also have pasta, Mac and cheese, breads, muffins, and ice cream. Great environment and great family place"}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall, a little pricey and they don't always have many gluten-free or vegan options available."}
{"text":"This is a salad bar to beat all salad bars! So many delicious options to pile onto your plate. I felt like such a pig with my mile high plate of veggie goodness. They also have a good selection of soups and breads and desserts. I was pretty full after my salad, so I didn't indulge into many of their other options. I did have a brownie, which wasn't anything to write home about. It was pretty dry. :( The area with the soup and breads didn't seem to have trays available, which was pretty inconvenient and was probably a contributing factor to me not eating more (maybe a good thing?) because I wasn't able to carry more back to my table.  We went here for lunch on a Friday. It was very busy, and we had to wait for a table to open up after we paid. Lots of families and kids."}
{"text":"Took my family to this location for lunch on Sunday. The establishment was clean and well kept.   All of the food items that we tried we well made and tasty.  My kids loved the little ice cream cones."}
{"text":"This is an all-you-can-eat serve yourself establishment.  Excellent very healthy food choice, reasonably priced.  Always fresh food, always very good.  Some of the soups are a bit heavy though.  Often somewhat noisy, dirty tables, mediocre atmosphere, usually very crowded with people at every table and sometimes milling around the food but, the pros greatly outweigh the cons.  Fairly good service but, it varies.  If you want the table cleaned before you sit down, someone isn't far away. Despite a usually very busy place, the staff makes a good effort to get the tables clean for the next people and they are usually not far away - always watching to clean another table.  They're usually pretty quick and the business keeps enough staff on hand, which is good.  I am sure people notice. Kids friendly - I think that is why it is somewhat noisy.  We usually sit where it isn't too noisy."}
{"text":"I really like Sweet Tomatoes but  it is a little pricey but I love their chicken noodle soup.  it has chunks of chicken in it and you need a fork! The chill is good also! Look for coupons and it helps!"}
{"text":"We love sweet tomatoes aka Soup Plantation but this location needs some work.. We picked up multiple dirty plates from the clean stack and found bright pink lipstick on a glass, sure these things happen from time to time but it should be noted. We also did not have a busser help clear our table one time and the women's restroom was so dirty my girlfriend refused to use it.. Also the salad dressings were a little bland and watered down but that may be a corporate change idk.. Overall maybe we just caught them on an off day, we just moved to the area so will probably give them another shot at some point"}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch with a good selection of soup, salad bar, pasta, and desserts.  There are often coupons online!  The parking here is limited, so I would suggest not going during peak lunch and dinner hours.    Soups change weekly, and you can check their website to see what's available before you go.    Fountain drinks, iced tea, specialty tea, lemonade and Crystal Light.  Nice variety of drink options."}
{"text":"It comes down to this: do you think that paying about $13 for a salad bar (not including drinks) is too much?  If you do, don't go to Sweet Tomatoes.  Since you are still reading this review, you are probably thinking \"it had better be a special salad bar\".  Well it is.  Sort of.  Here's what you are going to get:  The Salad Bar Itself: this contains a large variety of items but nothing outstanding.  There are a few prepared salads and some specialties like country potato salad.  The big plus here is that you get so many choices that you will be able to build just what you want.  The Soup Bar: this is the high point for Sweet Tomatoes.  You have eight choices, more than half of which are vegetarian.  Chicken Noodle has huge pieces of white meat chicken, and there are usually at least a couple of soups that rate an A.  Pasta, Potatoes, Bread: the freshest items are the pastas, which they make in small batches.  There will be two or three, but unless you think that mediocre mac & cheese is worth dying for, these are not worth looking for.  The baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are ok but no more.  They have a few breads, incuding a couple of foccacios which are not bad (I will say no more).  Desserts:  This is what you get -- soft serve ice cream in two flavors and a few desulatory toppings, a couple of dishes of cut fruit, jello, and a few types of standard muffins.  They also have one warm specialty dessert each day, such as a chocolate lava cake or a fruit cobbler.  This is usually a cut above average -- try it first.    Sweet Tomatoes is a comfortable place to eat, and not as crowded as it used to be.  It is clean, bright, and in good repair.  The conclusion -- if you are not put off by paying $13 plus drinks, and you are not primarily a carnivore, there is really nothing MAJOR wrong with Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great salads, gtear soups and very friendly staff. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Up until recently I had no real complaints about Sweet Tomatoes but it seems that they are trying to save $$$ and it really shows in their food..   The chicken noodle soup was once packed with huge pieces of juicy chicken but is now just more noodle & soup than anything.. & their chunky chili seems much more watered down than before.. Their salad bar is still packed with fresh veggies.. However, they did get rid of their \"premium items..\"  I still go to ST because it's close to me and is a healthier option than other quick fix places but I hope this isn't the beginning of the end!!! Red Rock lunch buffet is only $8.99 and they have a salad bar plus much more hot items so ST needs to get back on their A game...   HOT TIP: join Club Veg to get weekly coupons.. I also noticed that instead of their coupons having a fixed discounted price they now just offer 10% off~"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this place and im in love, I wish it was more affordable so I can have lunch here everday.  Such a huge variety there"}
{"text":"I haven't been to one of these in 17 years. Came for lunch with coworkers. I would definitely come back some day,  but I wouldn't day this is a great place. I think all the food is ok, but nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"I always vow to go here more often as I enjoy it so much each time I go. I'm not a 'salad fan' in general (don't make it at home), but there's such a selection of ingredients here (all nice and fresh) that I can easily concoct a salad to my liking sans lettuce (I have spinach instead). I am also a big fan of their blue cheese dressing. They also have soup and chili, plus desserts. The building is kept nice and clean and the staff are always friendly and helpful. Easy parking outside including disabled."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE coming here for salad. The offerings are always  fresh and there is a great selection enabling the creation of a salad to your own personal specifications. When you consider the salad selection, the chili soup and other offerings, plus the choice of sweets; it is very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"My family a five needed a quick dinner and decided on the Sweet Tomatoes at Desert Ridge. It has been a while since I have been to one, as I am not generally a fan of the buffet, but score one for a buffet!  If you are looking to pig out, sure this place is for you, with pizza, pastas, breads, desserts, etc. You get the idea. But, in addition to the obvious salad bar, which you can make as healthy or unhealthily as you like, there are good healthy options (assuming you can control your portions and have any willpower....).   I had a great chili that was spicy, with great flavor, and it was vegetarian and gluten free, for those who care. And the salad was great, with fresh veggies and a good choice of dressings.  So it was a buffet with healthy options in mind. Again, if you have willpower and won't over eat, it is a good place. If you want to over eat and pig the hell out on fattening food, it will work for you too! So enjoy at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I prefer non chain places, but Sweet Tomatoes is one I can truly truly count on all the time anywhere.   Had some great won ton salad, broccoli salad, volcano cake, focaccia, and cheese soup with ham. The decaf carafe was tepid at best so I mentioned it to the cashier.  She said she'd notify someone.  It didn't look like she did for the next 20 minutes we were there.   But we can always count on the whole being wonderful and satisfying."}
{"text":"If you're craving a healthy meal (soups + salads with a few desserts to indulge from) without a limit, then this is the right place for you. It is a buffet style that starts out with building your own salad. FYI for my California friends - this is the same as Soup Plantation!  I wasn't particularly impressed with this location. I thought the selections were decent. Everything was refilled as needed and on time. The one night I went to this location, I really enjoyed the creamy tomato soup. I had a major craving for clam chowder tho (like every day), and sadly I found out they only have it on Fridays.  Service was good. I do think the place could be a little bit cleaner, especially considering it was a quiet night when my family stopped by. I like Sweet Tomatoes but would probably only come back to this location if we're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was automatically impressed! The place is clean and the salad options are plenty. For lunch, I paid roughly $8.00 which I think is a super fair price for an all you can eat salad restaurant. The restaurant also offers other options such as pasta and soups. Please be aware that there is no meat. My friend that is a vegetarian appreciated this!   I really liked their mac and cheese and other pasta options. Their dessert area is limited but good. I tried their blueberry muffin and soft serve ice cream and I liked it.   My recommendation is to look for offers and coupons online. I checked in with Yelp and received a 15% coupon which is nice to be able to save!  The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because it seemed that there were a couple of food options that did not get refilled quickly enough. I went to the salad bar multiple times and they always seemed to be out of something. They were also out of the chocolate ice cream serve which was my friends favorite. I did make up for this by putting a delicious brownie under my ice cream.   Overall this was a great experience and I would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is an AYCE salad & soup and my fav frozen yogurt. Typically throughout the year they will have various themes. For example in one month will be strawberry month - or pineapple month, and they will have salads and soups and or desserts infused with this favorite item. almost like Iron chef's \"Secret ingredient\". I love it. In the summer months they have different countries as their themes, Greece, Mexico, etc. I missed mexico's month by one day and I was not happy. There was an instance where I had Cream of Cauliflower soup and I have yet to ever see this delicious soup again. I always hope it will be there the nxt time I go.. ah maybe someday. Salads: They have all the toppings and ingredients you could ever want including pre-mixed salads i.e. caesar salad, asain salad and typically some broccoli salad. Really good.  Soups: they usually have various chii's and staples like chunky chicken noodle, cream of asparagus, chicken tortilla, santa fe black bean. mmm so good. This place is a must try. I used to use their bogo free coupons but they have a fine print item on them (if you join the veg club that says not valid i Nevada.) wth? That kinda upset me b/c why email it to me if you know I reside in NV? Ive only been back once since this altercation and that was to go tthe Mexico month- which I missed by one day b/c it didnt go to the end of the month, but only to the 28th. Arrgh.  Either way you have to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every two weeks.  I love it.  I love salad and I like to eat healthy.  The great thing about this place is that you can choose to not eat healthy as well.  They have muffins, breads, pastas, and soups as well as all the salad and veggies one can eat.  I love the cornbread  because it has corn kernals baked into it.  I like to go with a two plate tray to start out.  I probably eat about four plates of salad every time I go.  Not always a big fan of the soups.  Two out of the eight or so usually catch my eye.  They have rotating desserts every month along with specialty soups and salads that go along with the monthly theme.  Sign up for the Club Veg and you get coupons every couple of weeks or so for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  If you're lucky they come around with fresh baked chocolate chip cookies.  The staff is always friendly and they are quick to clean up your used plates/trays."}
{"text":"Love this location. Have never had any issues other than a stench one time. Easy fix, move to the other side of the restraunt."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so clean and fresh. There's a wide variety of salads, toppings, soups, and pasta salads.   There's ample seating and the location is solid (within a complex do lots of parking). The only con would be the cashier at the end of the buffet line--she was unnecessarily rude and confused. We only had to deal with her when paying so it wasn't that big of a deal."}
{"text":"Meh.  That really sucked comparatively.  What happened to this place?  When I came here a few years ago before my wife and I were married, I thought this place tasted great--similar to Fresh Choice in California.  When my wife and I landed in the Phoenix area last July, we came here for dinner and I was struck by more of a sense of mediocrity than before.    After coming here a week ago, we found that it has gotten worse.  We all really had a hard time finding something here we liked.  The salad was mediocre, the panini was a doughball, and the mac and cheese might as well have been syrup of ipecac as far I'm concerned.  Only the senate bean soup was good out of all of the things I tried.  The woman clearing the tables was nice, and we at least left her a tip.  This used to be my daughter's favorite restaurant.  Now, she doesn't even want to come here again.  That says a lot to me."}
{"text":"The return of Sweet Tomatoes!  There isn't much more I can say than what has already been said in other reviews.  Yes, the Field Kitchen experiment has failed and Sweet Tomatoes has gone back to its old format.  Even better, with the renovation and cool new soda machine and utensils, it's better than ever.  Before the Field Kitchen phase, I was just ho-hum about this place.  Now, it's a place with such good-tasting food that I want to return on a frequent basis.  The only bad thing is that the soda machine has one spigot for over 100 flavors.  If you want a drink, you are going to need to get in line.  Apart from that, this place is primo now.  My family and I aren't the only ones happy to see this place back and better-- when we visited recently, it was PACKED.  Lots of veggie options only sweeten the deal here.  Pile on your plates and chow down!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place to stuff our faces and not feel guilty! Offering a big salad bar with lots of variety and delicious soups and breads, I really enjoyed it. Loved their creamy soups the best, and their yummy corn bread. Salad bar begins at the entrance, and you pay at the end of the it, so don't go overboard because there's more food in the back! For first-timers, log on to their website and create an account so you can get a discount coupon. I got my first meal there at 20% discount. :-)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of a Fresh Choice, and it was my first time at this all you can eat joint.   I came around 4:30 pm on a Saturday and they had a steady stream of customers.  When you walk in, the salad bar is already laid out in front of you.  They have you getting your food and tray way before you pay!  They have a pretty decent selection of things to throw on your salad, including prepared tossed salads, pasta salads, slaw, potato salad, tons of dressing choices, and all your typical toppings.  It's not hard to fill up your plate with just salad alone.  If you ever venture past the salad bar, you'll find a few varieties of soup (chicken noodle, tomato soup, french onion, etc.) and chili, a make your own baked potato section, a few selections of focaccia breads, cornbread, and even the pasta bar.  (Their mac n' cheese reminds me of the Kraft in the box variety, which I actually really like!)  When you're ready to satisfy your sweet tooth, they have chocolate pudding, fresh fruit, sundae bar, and rice pudding.  (I didn't see any molten lava cake like Myke R. was talking about though!)  Beverage choices include your basic soda, along with strawberry lemonade and cranberry green tea!  You can even make your own coffee with a shot of something or other and chocolate milk with syrup!   They claim that everything is made from scratch, which definitely impresses me and I wish I could take a look into their kitchen to see if they are really are brewing up chicken stock!  They also label what's vegetarian and  vegan, which is definitely a rising trend and helps everyone out.  Service is surprisingly good.  There's someone there to help you find a table when you're carrying your tray (and sometimes they'll even help you out with your tray too)!  And there are a lot of busboys and busgirls clearing you table efficiently and quickly.  There were some staff members even asking how things were.  Although you may think you're eating healthy though, you can easily OD on the fatty stuff.  After all, it's still a buffet and you'll find yourself eating a few too many breads or potatoes with real butter and sour cream.    Their Sunday morning menu offers waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs, and make your own burritos too!   Dinners cost about $9.39/pp, but you can always find a coupon in the weekly ads.  It's a real deal for children to eat here though!  And you can also do take out too!   Overall, it's not a bad choice when you're eating like this for under $10/pp and with such a variety, everyone will be happy!"}
{"text":"I'm really not a big fan of buffets, but my wife and son had a craving for salad and wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes. So I guess I gave in. Anyways, I've been here quite few times and my family wanted something healthy tonight.   There is so much to choose from at this place from the salad bar, soup bar with 8 different home-made soups, pasta bar, bakery, potato bar that includes both baked potatoes and sweet potatoes, and of course the desert bar.   I really do think the salad bar is one of the best I've been too. So many choices. They have both lettuce and spinach with everything you can image to put on top of the salad. Also, they have a few pasta salads and other pre-made salads like Cesar's and the likes. Really good. With all these options, it has to make everyone happy except for one thing. Where's the meat? Where's the beef? Not much here.   They have different Focaccia breads (something almost like pizza bread) that are pretty good. My wife and son really likes their soup especially the chicken noodle soup. They love it. I tried the chili soup and it had multiple kinds of beans, ground beef, tomatoes and other thing. It was pretty good but little sour from the tomatoes. The pasta bar is ok and probably my favorite would be the Mac and Cheese.   The best part of the desert bar is the soft swirl ice cream. Seems like one of the most popular things at Sweet Tomatoes. One last thing, ask the people in the bakery for freshly baked chocolate chips cookies and they will give you some. If you don't ask they won't give you any. Usually, they just pass the cookies around on platters so if you want to make sure you get some cookies then just ask.   So the workers are always available for you and they are picking up your finished plates and bowls. They always clean up the dirty tables pretty quickly so overall the place is really clean.   So overall the place has pretty good food and if you looking for healthy food then this is the place. One warning, don't over eat cause it's so easy. So enjoy a healthy meal once in awhile."}
{"text":"So far, so good! I have been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both enjoyable experiences and good food. Almost always fresh and hot. Does get busy. Staff is nice and helpful. Helped me to my table since I was carrying my car seat. 4 stars until I come again."}
{"text":"spontaneous visit during the summer with two other friends.  My main concern with this location is the fact that the salad bar, soup bar, hot foods corner were a lot smaller than the soup plantation in LA I always go to.   The food was good regardless, had a good time being fat sitting in one of the comfy booths they have. We sat right by the food for easy access hehe  Parking is widely available, huge lot."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place in Arizona! It was cute, concepts the same as all the other locations I've been to in california.. With the exception of their soup station being pretty small, no dessert bar just soft serve (which was mm mm mm) and you had to pay for cookies -.- BUT the salad bar is still amazing, the Mac and cheese, the cornbread, the pizza, the baked potato.. All still there and all delicious. Who doesn't love getting stuffed off nothing but leaves and water?:p"}
{"text":"I would say it is a little harder to rate this place because you are really making your own meal. Knowing that, I would have to make my rating on the quality of the food. My salad ingredients were fresh. I like the variety offered there. I had some tomato focaccia that was really good. The macaroni and cheese was very bland and soupy. The ice cream was good. I do notice that the wires that the lights are hanging from are fury with dust collected on them. I also think this place is expensive. That is the reason for the 3 stars."}
{"text":"My husband had memories of going to soup plantation when he was younger, so we decided to check this place out. When you walk in, you grab a plate and walk down to get salads, pastas, etc and then get to the cash register to pay and pick up a drink cup. Apparently they have a lot of coupons out there or if you are an email member. The register signed us up for emails and we got a discount. Our food came to about $30 for 2 people, not too bad-or so I thought.  The location has booths and tables. Lots of screaming kids around and big families. We found a booth and went to get our drinks. They have pretty good lemonade that I settled on. I then went to pick up utensils and napkins. Then went to the food counter. it is a small counter with about 8 different soups, baked potato bar, pizza type bar and bread. And thats IT.... I was very underwhelmed. So I tackled the bar by reaching over a dozen kids trying to get some food.   So, would i come back here. Nah. I would rather pay $10 bucks and go to red rock buffet or somewhere with a better selection of food. Considering the price of the meal I felt ripped off with my little baked potato, mac and cheese and lemonade. I'm still hungry just thinking about this place."}
{"text":"The establishment is very clean. Not much in the way of meat but plenty of tasty soups and salads. Price reasonable.  Great for the vegetarian."}
{"text":"Fresh salad was just what I needed on that hot day.  I wasn't happy that chicken, and bleu cheese are premium ingredients, and that either was an extra $2.49 (which I didn't get), but meh.  I'd go back, but not often."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come here at least twice a week. The staff is great and always friendly. Food is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I tend to forget about the existence of Sweet Tomatoes since I have it every time I have gone and the price is fairly good. The salads are very good with the pre made types but I love the selection of dressing with the create your own. But forget the salads! I love the soup and variety of muffins. YUM! Always a great selection of soups and I end up having at least 3. But the corn bread with honey butter is so unreal. They also had some special coconut lemon muffins that were as good a muffin that I think I have ever had. It is a seasonal thing for the month too bad. But yes very good and only $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place. The other day we stopped in for lunch and we're terribly disappointed.  The large salad bar was filled , but when I sat down to eat my salad it just did not taste right. I don't know if it was just a bad batch of produce, but even the salad dressing tasted off. It was a Friday and I was excited to eat their usually creamy and tasty Clam Chowder. Today it was awful!! It tasted like dirt. My mom got their chili which she usually loves and tasted terrible too. I tried it and it was like eating a tin can. Bad just bad! After that I couldn't even eat anything else.  This was the first time I've ever left here hungry! Glad I had a coupon or I'd be even madder if I paid full price. You can't charge those kinda prices if your going to serve crap! Step it up Sweet Tomatoes! I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars for the pure reason that I LOVE having lunch here!! The cashier is usually rude but as far as the bussers, they're great! It's very clean and you can tell that they want you to have a good experience there. It's always clean and well maintained.   I went last night for dinner for the very first time in the 5 years I've been eating here and it was AWFUL! The cashiers shirt was almost all the way undone, being that it was two sizes too small. Our  busser seemed to be the ONLY one on shift for quite awhile so in all honestly she didn't even deserve a tip. Especially after we witnessed her filling the teas and such, at the beverage bar. She spilled over half the strawberry lemonade on the counter top, it was EVERYWHERE, and she didn't clean it up. She filled all three other liquids there so there's no way she didn't seem the bright red substance, all over be place. The floor had lettuce, crumbs and napkins all over it. Every counter top, where you went to get food, was covered in crumbs or food. Some food even had bites out of it! The frozen yogurt machine hadn't been cleaned, for what looked like at least since noon. Mind you, this was at about 6pm. Most of the food was old and had been sitting under the heat lamps for hours. I was excited to try all of the Asian style specials until I saw that the chicken had been under the lamps for so long that it as rock hard and see through. Also, every muffin was hard as a rock. It was a waste of $25. That's for sure!   I absolutely love this place but I will NEVER be back for dinner. I was appalled at how horrible the staff maintained the establishment. How embarrassing!! It's fairly obvious that the day shift is the better and more caring shift."}
{"text":"I know of three Sweet Tomatoes locations in/near Vegas.  I've been to the Henderson location several times and found the food fresh and the facilities clean and inviting.  This location is a little smaller but earns top marks for parking availability, good service, clean tables and restrooms, fresh salads, and consistently hot soup and pasta.  If in the mood for soup and salad, Sweet Tomatoes beats out the casino buffets by a mile.  If you're in a carnivorous mood, definitely look elsewhere since meat entrees are nonexistent at Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"I like Souplantation in general but have been to enough of them to know how much the experience can vary depending on the location.  This location has been consistently good in terms of salad bar freshness, staff attentiveness (both for the salad bar and for clearing tables), and cleanliness (both restrooms and the dining area).  Lots of parking is a definite plus, as well."}
{"text":"I was SO sad when the Souper Salad near Boulevard Mall closed.  It was a nice change of pace to pig out on soup and salad rather than the much heavier food on most Vegas buffets.  I didn't even know about Sweet Tomatoes (Souplantation) until I was at a workshop in Orange County, where there was an advertisement.  I went on the web and saw that there were Vegas locations so as soon as I had some time, I dragged the Mrs. here to try them out.  Sweet Tomatoes is like Souper Salad but better.  More selection of salad items and soups, fresher looking and tasting bread and pizza.  Even Marian loved it!  The salad choices were very good but my favorites were the cream of mushroom soup and the garlic Asiago focaccia bread.    Don't forget to sign up for weekly coupons on their web site before visiting."}
{"text":"Salad buffet and Strawberry lemonade! Doesn't that sound refreshing? A little roughage every now and then does a body good. And forgetta bout all the fancy schmancy restaurant options on the Strip for a minute. You must check out Sweet Tomatoes in Summerlin!  I grew up in sunny San Diego eating at Soup Plantation with the family on Sunday mornings after church. It was always a treat! A quality salad bar and soup buffet for less than $10 was such a great value and still is!  Now, Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation are related. Soup Plantation was founded in San Diego and is headquartered there. As they expanded, it was decided that any location outside of Southern California would be called \"Sweet Tomatoes.\"  The Salad bar buffet at Sweet Tomatoes (Soup Plantation) is one of the largest around. I'd say it's even bigger than what you'd find at buffets on the Strip. The first selection of greens are pre-mixed \"Salads of The Day\" like Caesar, Oriental Chicken, or Strawberry Kale. Further along, fresh raw greens and various vegetable add-ins are filled to the brim. Never a shortage. There's always a wide variety to choose from too - something for everyone. It's amazing how everyone flows through the same line and ends up with Salad creations that are so different from each other! Finally, top those plates off with your favorite dressing, croutons, seeds, fresh pepper, etc. They have disposable cups for extra dressing or toppings. So, fill 'em up!  After your salad is made, pay at the register. Check-in with Yelp for 15% off! And if that offer is no longer valid, they also honor military discount.  After paying, an attendant will escort you to a table. Once you're settled in, visit the Soup bar! At this location, there were 8 soups available to choose from. Clam chowder is my go-to. But then, because it's a buffet, I'll go back to try other soups in smaller portions, like chili, chicken noodle, minestrone, etc. And they're all homemade!!  Speaking of homemade, there's also the Bakery for fresh yumminess like corn bread, blueberry muffins, and focaccia. As well as the Pasta station for fettuccine or penne.  Finally, if you still have room for dessert, there's a fresh fruit bar, soft serve ice cream, and more!  Overall, Sweet Tomatoes is a great restaurant. Perfect for large families with small children, too. Kids just love having the freedom to make their own plate as well as the full-on permission to get up and out of their seats to grab more veggies and soup! They might even surprise you with a special-made sundae. Win-win for all! :-)  Oh how I wish Sweet Tomatoes (Soup Plantation) had a location in Hawaii...."}
{"text":"We always come here as a family and my father in law comes here like three times a month. He loves this place and so do we. We always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes. This place is always clean and really has good food. There salad choices are endless and there broccoli salad is awesome! It has cashews, raisins, sunflower seeds,sugar and mayo in it. It is so good but I just found out it has almost 50 grams of fat per serving so I'll be laying off that. They also have great soups, a warm chocolate lava dessert that is to die for and good pizza and hot steamed veggies. They also come around and deliver hot baked chocolate chip cookies to your table. Sign up for there newsletter/birthday club and you'll great coupons delivered to your email. They also have a breakfast bar on Sundays I believe but I've never tried that."}
{"text":"Great for quick lunch...I love their honey butter and cornbread and they always have good soups and salad my favorite is the broccoli salad"}
{"text":"I do dig the buffet here. Printed out coupons from signing up on their e-mailing list and knocked a few bucks off the price. Then proceeded to try a bit of everything, which feels a little guilt-free since the main buffet line is all salads.  You may notice the absence of bacon bits whilst assembling your salad goodies on the main drag of this buffet experience. A little hint... they're in the dining area at the baked potato bar, once you get through the cashier checkpoint. The real Sweet Tomatoes pros know how to navigate the restaurant as if it were Def Leppard's under-the-stage den of debauchery during a live guitar solo. Oops... I've said too much! Or I've been watching too much of VH1's Behind the Music and not concentrating on my salad snarfing. Crunch!"}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this restaurant ever since I moved to Las Vegas, but always seemed to go under my hunger radar. Finally, after three years, my husband and I decided to check it out. This place is a buffet, which we had not anticipated. It looks like a cafeteria - though a nice one, for that matter. If you are looking for Vegas' signature buffet staples (crab legs, prime rib, endless shrimp, and stale pizza), you should not visit this place. When people say this is mostly for vegetarians, they are not kidding. First, there is a hefty salad bar, with build-your-own and pre-designed options. I tried the Asiago Ceasar Salad. It was absolutely delicious, I have to say. Not at all what I expected from this place. The dressing was tangy, mustardy, and the pieces of lettuce were not soggy. I went back for seconds. Then, as I tried to figure out what to have next, I realized that salads and soups were basically considered entrees. So, I tried the Dijon Chicken soup, and again, I was pleasantly surprised. It was full of flavor! I also had seconds. Then I saw my husband helping himself to some \"chunky chicken noodle soup\", and I decided to try that to. The thing is, that soup was lacking in flavor (only chicken - huge chunks of it - and noodles...no veggies). So, I filled my cup half way with Dijon Chicken soup, and topped with Chunky Chicken Noodle soup. Great combo!   We also helped ourselves to some of what they call bruscetta, though they look like pizzas. They were pretty good. We also tried their honey-wheat bread, and sourdough bread, both of which were very good. For dessert, I tried the chocolate lava cake, which was too sweet and not at all tasted like it was made with \"good\" ingredients. The blueberry muffins, however, were quiet tasty.   At the end, you sort of feel stuffed, but not really. I mean, you basically had little to no protein, and you're probably going to crave some a while later. If you're watching your weight, this is a great place to visit. They have all sorts of coupons, and I sort of felt like the only person ever to pay full price for dinner (about $27 for two adults' dinners, and two endless fountain drinks). I am definitely coming back here, coupons in hand, given their proximity to my home, and the surprisingly great flavors they offer! However, whenever I wish to fulfill canrnivore cravings, I would definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"Now I like a good salad. And I like it even better when you put a whole bunch of fresh veggie ingredients in front of me and let me select the ones I feel like having today.   So on a scale of 1-10, I would say that Sweet Tomatoes gets about an eight. Why only an eight? Because today I actually looked at my receipt when I pulled it out of my purse and before I threw it away.   The salad at Sweet Tomatoes is not cheap; nor too expensive . . . but, oh my goodness, I nearly had a heart attack when I saw that I paid $2.39 for a little dinky glass filled with ice cubes and about 4 oz of tea. Yes, I could have returned to the drink dispenser and refilled my glass a half dozen times until I had consumed $2.39 worth of tea. But, $2.39? . . .  at what is a glorified fast food salad bar? Next time I will be drinking water . . . unless they start charging me for that too."}
{"text":"Last night a few of us did our newly appointed, Friday night shenanigans.  Tonight we came to Sweet Tomatoes because of the value and location.  Salad, soup and dessert bar was about $10.99.  Now this place wouldn't be the first choice when I think of great grub, but my decision was out numbered.  Here's what I thought:  AMBIANCE:  The place is like a buffet joint.  You walk in, grab your tray and plate and then you start building your salad.  The decor isn't something to be excited about.  This place tries to fill a lot of people in a such a small space so there's not much of privacy, even at your table.    FOOD:  Although the ingredients are super fresh, the salad bars were sloppy and food was everywhere.  I also appreciate that there's a huge selection of salad fixings, however, I can't stand the fact that places like Sweet Tomatoes tries to upsale and already high priced buffet with \"premium toppings,\" like chicken or artichokes.  C'mon!  Get out of here with that.  Like any other buffet out there, it should be included.  I thought their premade Chinese chicken salad tasted good.  It was sweet and offered great texture with the won tons.  The Dill Potato Salad was really bland and not too good.  When it came to the soups, I loved the clam chowder and turkey chili.  I also love the fact that they have an area with all the possible toppings for your soup.  Remember that when you come here, do not miss out on the pizza type bread they have there.  It's located between the pasta and the soups.  SOOOO GOOOD!!  April, apparently, was their \"Lemon month.\"  They served things like lemon muffins, a lemon pasta with capers and lemon molten lava cake.  The molten cake was way too tart for my taste buds.  Lastly, for dessert, I LOVE and LOOK FORWARD to their soft served ice cream.  You can choose to put your ice cream in a bowl or small cones.  They also have caramel or chocolate sauce and a bunch of toppings.  YUM-O.  Last night, I think I actually got full from all the desserts they have.  All in all, I think this place is alright.  In a city filled with buffets, many of which are worth the price, unfortunately, I don't think Sweet Tomatoes fits in that same value.  If you're looking for a salad buffet joint, Sweet Tomatoes is a great option.  Just be sure to come early because parking is very limited!"}
{"text":"I come sometimes when I just want a salad lunch. Today I went with my mom and grandma in law.  It's a \"A-OK\" place, but \" I am a fan\".   The veggies are fresh and there's a good variety of them- that's what I come for so I'm happy. Soups are alright.  I like their cornbread or foccacia. I stay away from the desserts, and pastas. Drinks- they've been having flavored ice teas lately that are quite good. Today was green tea mojito- nice.   For the lunch price, specially since they're abundant in giving coupons ($5.99 lunch or 2 for 1), can't complain. Most salads at sit downs are going to cost me more than this and I can make several kinds here."}
{"text":"I love the salads here and the corn bread is my fave. You can't go wrong with the strawberry lemonade either :)"}
{"text":"Always a great place to dine for a good value. All you can eat soup & salad bar. There is also a selection of pasta, breads and desserts. If you sign up for their club, you can get weekly email specials. I'm a big fan of their 4 cheese bread, teas and various desserts. Yeah, I know, the least healthiest stuff found in a feast of healthy stuff. What can I say, I'm cheesy...and sweet? Perhaps not. But still try out this place at least once."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with this place! Everything I have ever had there was perfection. Amazing quality all around. They have many different varieties of soups and their salad bar is definitely the highlight. They have warm pastas, cold pasta, and a baked potato bar with normal potatoes and sweet potatoes. We always pay the money for drinks to get their strawberry lemonade, definitely worth it! I always take whatever desert they have and top it with ice cream. I would absolutely suggest joining their club to get coupons. No spam, just coupons and emails informing members about monthly flavors and special entrees. I would suggest this Sweet Tomatoes any day!"}
{"text":"Need a break from meat? This is it.  Love coming to the ol Potatoe for some cheap salad eats. Always fresh, with an amazing variety of choices at the bar including choice of greens, cold pastas, toppings and dressings. They have a great line up of soups including cream of mushrooms and my fave bacon cheddar.  $20 gets ayce, 2 drinks and great service. Bussers constantly making rounds to make sure plates are cleared and counters kept clean. 10/10 for cleanliness.  Definitely a great go to for that soup/salad craving."}
{"text":"This is still my all-time favorite restaurant in Vegas. Restaurant is incredibly clean. Food is always fresh. Soups are never empty. I have encountered situations where the soft serve machine was out of service, but the delicious blueberry muffins make up for it. I went to this branch a couple days ago, and they added muffies (muffin tops only) to their selection of baked goods. Oooo...banana nut muffies!"}
{"text":"20 min wait to get seated after getting food and paying. What a terrible experience. They should limit number of people coming in so nobody's time is wasted"}
{"text":"It's a good place,  You certainly can't complain about their salad bar. It's fresh and a great selection.  Their soups are ok. I typically only find 1 maybe 2 that I think is really good.  I love their muffins and their pizza slices.  Service is good too.   I just wish they would change up things on their hot bar more often."}
{"text":"We often go to soup plantation in California so we decided to come to sweet tomatoes location.. once again did not disappoint. Very good quality food and also great customer service  we will return to this location when we come to las vegas!  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes is a great healthy salad creation buffet. This review is for a shout out to an amazing manager named Salvador who works at this location on Flamingo & 215.   I went there yesterday around 12-1pm. It was during a busy Sunday afternoon rush. We saw Salvador the manager keeping the front of the house intact. I've never seen such a caring and hard-working manager. My boyfriend and I both noticed him and said. \"Wow, what a great manager.\"  Thanks for keeping business running smoothly at such a busy time, Salvador. I wish there was more managers like you in the service industry."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes- land of the flavorless food.    If you're going to go to a restaurant like this, at least go to Super Salad. It's a little less expensive and much better.  I don't go anymore, but of the times I've been to Sweet Tomatoes, anything I've tried (aside from the salad) is extremely bland.   It doesn't matter if it's pizza, pasta or bread, nothing from this restaurant has flavor. Although the food itself isn't awful, I can't describe any one item as being good either.   My advice: Eat a salad at home before wasting your money here"}
{"text":"Last of the great salad bars.  All you can eat buffet of salad, soup, potatoes, pizza, pasta and soft serve ice cream. Dig a bit and find a coupon. It's not hard. Cost is about $10 each, not including drink, but water is free.   Good selection of items, all fresh and hot or cold as needed to be. The Staff was great with offering to get our table beverage refills, booster seats and salt and pepper.  The manager jumped up and ran over when the two year old flipped her chair. It was nice to see he was watching his dining room and was concerned.   Great for lunch or dinner. Leave a tip for the wait staff. You can access this location by taking the Dunlap northbound frontage road for I17."}
{"text":"They don't honor the 15% coupons on the bag of cookies, even though it does not say 'only valid on return visit'. We won't be back, no Sweet Tomatoes in Michigan. Wouldn't have bought the cookies either, had we known."}
{"text":"Went to Sweet Tomato for the first time today. the soup was OK but the salad was fabulous! Wish they would have had some protein (boiled eggs, diced chicken, tuna something)..they had tuna terragon....(pasta but no tuna) confused by the name.....but it was good.  it's just like Souplantation.  .buttt they don't have the variety. If ever in Vegas I will go back. Staff can be a little friendlier. Overall I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch. There is a large salad bar when you come in the door. All the food was tasted very fresh!. At the end of the salad bar there is a cashier to pay for your meal. The area where the hot food and dessert is a bit small. They had a mashed potato bar which was good and I had some tomato soup which was extremely tasty. Also I had soft ice cream with topping in their little sundae bar. The   food here is pretty good and at a good price."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other night. It was pleasant. We went pretty late, so we didn't encounter any rowdy kids as mentioned in some of the other reviews. Now, I'm a total meat lover and never been really big on salads, so I'm a little biased in my review.  The salad bar was okay. I tried the Asian wonton salad, which tasted pretty good. I also made a mini salad of my own. The ingredients looked pretty fresh, which I find impressive since it was only an hour before closing time. The soups I tried were pretty tasty; corn chowder and a chicken casserole inspired one. I also had the mac & cheese and penne in marinara, both of which were alright. The focaccia bread was okay. Too many burnt toppings. The soft serve/froyo was delicious.  Overall, I can't complain too much about the quality of the food. I'm not so happy about the price, though. Buffet pricing for greens and soup? I'd much rather spend the same amount of something with more protein. I wouldn't mind going again, but I'll probably look for coupons and it won't be a regular thing."}
{"text":"this place is AMAZING!!!! second time in under a month. Whats really amazing also is ROBBIE who works here. We've never seen anyone work as hard as robbie, he is also SOOO friendly, ALWAYS smiling, and going up to every customer seeing how their experience was and if they needed anything. He made the experience SOOO amazing , corporate should have this young man be training the rest of their employees"}
{"text":"One of the cleaner Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation locations I have been too (and I have been to quite a few).  They really kept it clean and fresh here. The food was really fresh, and it was well-stocked. I like the layout of this particular location as well, as it makes it really easy to see what my kids are up to when they get up to get food."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is always a decent place to go to for soup and salad. It gets three stars because everything is just average food, and that's ok. Sometimes explosions of exquisite flavor isn't always necessary. This place offers pretty good salad, soup, veggie, pastry, and noodlish variety. You'll feel happy to get greens in and disgusted with yourself for overloading in the sugar and fat options at the same time. One thing I dig about Sweet Tomatoes is how the menu slightly changes every so often with a different theme (this month's was berries.)  What stuck out to me the most at the moment was the overly soggy sweet potato (I don't remember it being like this the last times I've eaten this here) and the overly salty French Onion Soup. The poundcake with strawberry butter/whip was delicious... and quite guilt-inducing.  Tip: If you forget to print out a coupon - they accept you just showing them the coupon on your phone."}
{"text":"Sweet tomatoes has been around since forever.  It's Salad and Soup.  Back in the college days, I never enjoyed the \"salad and soup\" concept being a carnivore.  But now, my body speaks differently and it's a good alternative when I get lazy to make salads at home.  Plus, let's put it in perspective.   Here you get unlimited salad in freshness, lots of selection of salad stuff, dressing, toppings.  Over at wendys or Ihop you get one salad bowl. If you tried to make it at home, it'd probably all spoil and go bad considering all the ingredients.   Spot a coupon you can get away with lunch for 10 bucks.    The soups are good not great, but it goes along with the salad.  Neither is the any of the hot foods are anything but okay.     Good place to go when youre lazy and don't feel like making a boring salad at home."}
{"text":"We are a family of 6, so eating here is a splurge, one that we do about once a month.  Our kids are old enough to help themselves at the bar and go back for seconds. At the salad bar the kids usually get some of the toppings on their plate( not much lettuce), but go crazy on the soups, mac and cheese, pizza and chocolate muffins. Our family favorite soups are the clam chowder and chicken noodle.  I love the cornbread with honey butter. I wish it weren't so expensive to eat here!!!!  Oh well.... we love this place and will continue to visit.... just not as often as we'd like to!"}
{"text":"Good, healthy food at a great price.  I wish they had someone get the drinks for you or had more than one beverage station."}
{"text":"Loved this location! Environment was relaxing, food was great and staff was outstanding. One of the gentlemen offered to refill my water (I have never experienced this at other locations as it is a buffet setting), I also watched him switch a family's baby from a supplied wheeled chair used to cart them easier through the salad line into a standard high chair so she didn't have to strain to sit up to eat. All staff were very friendly creating a great end to my evening."}
{"text":"What a great experience!!  I love this location.  Good vibes from the employees and you can taste it in the food. Everything was fresh and treated great.  I've been to other locations and this one is by far the best.    The staff is great.  If you run into Oscar, ask him for his famous ice cream.  It was pretty fun to watch him make it."}
{"text":"I really expected better from the reviews I had read. Unfortunately, while the idea is great, the execution was lacking. Don't get me wrong, the salad bar had some great choices, but it's placement made me hesitant to return for seconds. The soups were all right, but I think I've had better from Campbell's, so I can't really give extra points for that. The pasta was cold and bland, and the bread products (except for the cornbread, which was quite tasty and moist) were reminiscent of lumped sawdust. Maybe I caught them on a bad night or something, because I do recall having a pleasant experience once before, but that could have been the pre-dinner cocktails down the street that were doing the tasting for me."}
{"text":"If you're a vegetarian, this is going to be one of the best buffet restaurants you've ever visited.  I have never put so many fixings on a salad before.  In addition to the salads, they have delicious soups, desserts, and other meals available too.  To anyone who isn't afraid of eating their vegetables, I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Used another Yelper's suggestion of joining Club Veg and got a buy one get one free offer. That came in handy. Got 2 buffets for $15 with drinks and tax included. The line was relatively fast and easy to navigate. When we arrived they were low on Caesar salad but a server quickly remedied the situation and had a new salad out in 2 minutes flat. Their Caesar was nice and much lighter on the dressing than some other places.  Tried the strawberry lemonade and that was indeed tasty. We found a booth during the lunch time rush and made our way to the soup, pasta and bread stations. Their Rosemary potato soup was great paired with their fresh sour dough bread and slightly melted butter pats. Nothing worse than fresh bread with frozen butter. Thanks for the softened butter.   The toddler of the group loved the ice cream station and had an apple which was a big hit. She also loved the mac and cheese which was fresh, flavorful and very creamy."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sweet Tomatoes in the Bay Area since childhood, and it's still one of my favorite places to eat at (occasionally). This Arizona location looks MUCH cleaner and nicer overall than the one in my hometown, so I was expecting the food to be just as good or better.  However, the food was completely below par. I tried a little bit of everything and found that all of the pre-made salads and soups were way too salty. Even the desserts weren't good. Where were the blueberries in the \"blueberry muffins\"?! So disappointing...  I wouldn't want to return here unless I had absolutely no other choice."}
{"text":"Salad buffet? Really? That is what I thought when my Aunt and Uncle brought me here for lunch. Little did I know how much there actually is to choose here. Super cheap for around $10 and you can go back for more and more.  All different types of greens to choose from and a multitude of ingredients to add along with many dressings. You can seriously go up to the buffet a dozen times and still not try everything. Plus, all of it is fresh and replenished constantly.   There is also an area with soup and dessert choices. Loved the chicken soup - full of white meat chicken and delicious. Just so much to choose from here at a great price point. I was actually stuffed when we left and could not eat anything else.  Clean, cheap, fresh, and a lot to choose from. Can't wait to go back next time when in Vegas visiting relatives."}
{"text":"I was stuck on having nothing but salad for dinner but indecisive on what kind to have so here I am... better to come at lunch as the crowd is off the hook... best part, we ran into some friends so we all sat together. Downside was the amount of people which causes problems downstream. Clean bowls and plates were a hot item and silverware for certain things (spoons) were hard to find. When they did come, they weren't 100% dry and some food was still stuck. I found myself going through 6 bowls at one point to find a good one to use for soup. Certain food items they couldn't keep up with having available like focaccia or even stuff from the salad bar. They were probably short handed but it was a bit more chaotic then I was ready for. All in all, when it's not crowded you can get a solid balanced meal with an emphasis on salad!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes (aka Souplantation) is a nice AYCE salad/soup bar with pizza, pasta, and dessert offerings. It's a fun place to come gorge and be a fatty while still feeling somewhat healthy. Just watch the dressing ;)"}
{"text":"DO NOT go on Tuesdays at all, because it is Free Kids day it is awfful. Kids run around, the grow food & drinks all over the floors,tables a mess. Always out of Drinks.  Terrible.  Will never go"}
{"text":"So I decided to check this place out for a salad. When I entered, I didn't know what to do. A woman working here told me to take a tray and a plate to make my salad. Ok, easy enough. I picked out all my favorite salad toppings. The quality of the food looked really healthy. After making the salad I paid and sat myself. The salad was good! I would have liked it better if avocado was on the menu but, it's still fine. After having the salad I decided to look at the soup. The soup looked good. I had a cup of the ginger something. It was surprisingly tasty! Also, I saw they had ice cream as well. I have to say if your looking for a refreshing quick lunch salad, this is a good choice. Enjoy"}
{"text":"VEGANS AND VEGETARIANS BEWARE! My pregnant girlfriend and I called ahead to see if there was any Soups we could eat and the person on the phone told me that there was a Minestrone. Turns out someone mixed some old meaty chili with the So Called Vegan Minestrone and I wish I was the one that tasted it instead of my girlfriend. She got sick afterwards and all they gave us was two complimentary meal tickets. Ugggh. As if i'm going back now. Very unprofessional. Obviously knowing what' vegan' is isn't something you have to know to work there."}
{"text":"There's a lot of variety for salad toppings and the garlic pizza is pretty tasty. Other than that, this place lacks imagination in food options.  I guess the positive is that you can stuff your face with large amounts of mediocre food- which is sometimes rather enjoyable.  Plates got cleared at a snails pace last visit."}
{"text":"Awww - I so wanted to love this place - the idea of it is really great and it's sister restaurant soup plantation is on point - but this place falls way short- first the price for the buffet - for what it is, is a bit high - the salad bar lacks variety although what they have looks fresh enough - the soup selection was boring, less boring and most boring - ginger water is not a soup! The macaroni and cheese is a dressed up watered down kraft special. They did have good drink choices - Jamaica, strawberry lemonade, lemonade and the regular sodas - the dessert bar was also lacking - poorly cleaned grapes Jello and sugar free chocolate whip ??? Really - they do have a potato bar - which is very awkward to use but offers the basic boring toppings - such an opportunity waisted - come on sweet potato do better!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Sweet Tomatoes I've been to, this is a second coming of sorts. Modern interior, fresh and constantly replenished selection - this place has become my number one suggestion whenever I feel like being healthy.  What separates this from other locations is service above all. I had planned on grabbing dinner here with a friend, and was waiting for her inside. In the five minute wait, I had been kindly attended to - conversations ranging from \"How are you doing?\" or just chatting about random topics. Never have I experienced staff so cordial and attentive at another Sweet Tomatoes. Another difference would be the modern decor - completely different from the country stylings of other locations.  The food is nothing spectacular other than its freshness. Ever since living in Seattle, salads have become at least one meal out of the day. So coming here satisfies that requirement.  Not only do I satisfy my salad fix, I engage in carbohydrate overload with all the delicious breads. Oh, but then there's the strawberry butter hidden away above the baked potatoes. Overall, just a great selection of delicious food in copious, endless amounts for a decent price. I like!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Sweet Tomatoes location in well over 3 years. I have never been to this location before, but the service was good. The selections haven't changed that much. I was pleased to see they had strawberry muffins with strawberry butter. YUMMY! The salads are still fresh and good. I wish they had more non dairy alternatives there."}
{"text":"Good prices here, but better if you have a discount coupon. I kind of wish they give you additional access to the salad bar portion after you have been through the line and paid, because I kept wanting to go back for the fresh veggies and only ate a little soup and pasta."}
{"text":"My stepdad is in to the whole no meat and all vegetables diet.  Not that he needs to be on one considering he's the healthiest person I know in this entire world.  He is a firm believer that eating only vegetables and fruits will give you a longer life.    In a lot of ways, I have started to think the same way.  Maybe because I started watching too many documentaries regarding the exploitation of meat and how hormones are commonly used in the growth of all animals.  But, I still love the taste of meat and can't completely remove it from my diet completely.    To please my stepdad, I took him to Sweet Tomatoes.  Once we walked through the entrance door, I saw the long bar table filled with different salads, and vegetables.  I also looked at the price and it said $9.89 per person and $2.39 for unlimited drinks.  Altogether, we paid almost $27.00 plus tip for two people.  We got our trays and placed two plates and then filled our plates with the salads and vegetables we desired to eat.  I thought we could come back for seconds or thirds with salad, but that's not how it works here.  After seating ourselves, there's another bar with a small assortment of pizza, breads, one choice of pasta and steamed vegetables, baked potato stuff, and a large variety of soup.  There's also another station for drinks and dessert.    Since the advertisement was buffet style, I figured there would be more variety to choose from.  For anyone choosing to eat buffet, it's ideal to eat at a casino and pay a little extra.  The only good thing I can say about this establishment is the freshness of their vegetables and fruits.    I can't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Salad bar I would say was fresh, soup had no flavor.  The pasta from 1-10 I give it a 5.  The bread and ice cream where the only thing decent.  The service was good BUT come on folks you want people to come back not never come again. I'll never be back again sorry..."}
{"text":"My favorite chain because I can eat all I want, I always have digital coupons in an email, and I don't have to worry about check anxiety.    To read what I think about the Sweet Tomatoes/Souplantation chain in general, check my detailed Souplantation review in Garden Grove, CA review.  This review is specific to this location.  Good service. Manager reserved a table for my party of 12.  Cashier let my parties use my coupon even though they showed up separately.  Plenty of parking.  Bonus for having the drink machine.  If it means getting Diet Dr Pepper I'm willing to press eight buttons."}
{"text":"Come here alot - really great salad bar and everything you should expect including a nice crowd."}
{"text":"I love this place. Strawberry lemonade is perfect. Food is always fresh. Mix and match your food and create amazing entrees!"}
{"text":"$$$$$$$$ expensive, not much to really brag about, felt like i was in a cafeteria. Not really to impressed. Busy, loud."}
{"text":"Got there about 8pm. Not a good time to go. Stuff didn't seem very fresh. staff is so busy cleaning getting ready to go that they don't take the time to even pick up your tray or ask you if you need anything. I got up to go get some ketchup and they said they don't have ketchup. Ugh... Also...they charge more sure artichokes & extras.like $3 more Ok...I went back and found out that one of the Managers...Robert moved  out of state.  New people....you better get on the ball!"}
{"text":"For a salad bar, we go there quite often.  Need to watch all the additions or it goes from a healthy veg place, to a sauce, fat laden plate of calories.  We like the soups as well.  The always-present Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup has those big, thick, egg noodles we grew up with.  The French Onion Soup is good as well.  All in all, it's still one of the best salad shops around."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this location about once a week with our toddler. She doesn't like waiting for food, so buffets are perfect, and this is the healthiest buffet around! We've never had a bad experience at this location, from the service to the food to the cleanliness of the restaurant. We are on their email list and get great deals for every visit. I'm sure the staff recognizes us by now, and we will continue to be \"regulars\" here!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to give them 4 stars.  After being on a plane all day, this was a nice healthier choice than many of the other restaurants in the area.  They have lots of great veggies and greens to create your own salad of choice.   The flatbread and mac'n'cheese were ok and the coconut muffin my husband had for dessert was really good."}
{"text":"The price is right with coupons for this place.. Unfortunately I found salad not bad but the pasta too watery especially the Mac and cheese. Unlimited on all foods- salad,soup,muffins,dessert-ice cream. Parking lot was easy to find a place to park even though it seem small ? The gal clearing the used dishes,very busy and doing her job with a smile.."}
{"text":"I did not like his buffet. There's an extreme limitation in food. All there is to eaten is salads, bread sticks, soup, and ice cream. Where's the rest of the food??????? Moreover, the establishment was dirty, as was the bathroom. Seating is tight but plentiful. Parking isn't a hassle and the location is near the 215 highway, off of Flamingo.  Pros: Easy parking, buffet, location Cons: Outdated decor, unsanitary, lacks food variety, dim lighting, poor customer service Overall: I wouldn't venture back here within the few coming years, or until it gets a makeover."}
{"text":"I have been introduced to this location very recently. I find the service on my last three visits to be spectacular. I have read the other Yelp reviews, and I cannot disagree the the complaints of changing the ingredients because I find all of the ingredients that are pleasing to me. The spectacular friendly service takes this location from 3 to 5 stars for me. The soft serve is ideal, and why not making a root beer float like my kids do!"}
{"text":"First, you cant beat the price. Salad was very good and i enjoyed the variety but i have to say the cornbread with the honey butter is what did it for me.. ill probably be craving that when im home. But im gonna share my knowledge with you. Take the blueberry muffin mash it inside a soup bowl then walk over to the ice cream and pour the vanilla soft serve on top then sprinkles then caramel and the BOOM!!! Say goodbye to your healthy lunch but your welcome. Done."}
{"text":"This is the worst one we've been to.  This is our second visit, thought the first time it was just bad because we were at the end of the day.  Today it's Sunday lunch time and they're only maybe 1/3 but out of stuff on the bar.  No potatoes, told at least a 15 minute wait after I've already been waiting 10 minutes.  Mac & cheese was out too.   Everything is hard to get to."}
{"text":"Love this place food is always fresh. Good clean atmosphere.. friendly staff. If you like salad you will love this place!! Good alternative to fast food!!"}
{"text":"We come here every couple of months.  The food is good and they have pretty good service but the downside is very little to no meat and they took out the fancy coke machine replacing it with very little choices of low calorie Pepsi products. We probably won't come as much."}
{"text":"This restaurant never ceases to amaze me. I love the open pasta bar. The cornbread with the honey butter spread is so delicious. It tempts me to wanna bring a ziplock baggy to take them to go. The servers are always working hard to keep the tables cleared and ready for incoming guest. The prices are reasonable and affordable. Very spacious restaurant seating area."}
{"text":"I frequent this place every time I am in town. My visit in the east valley has been for three weeks this time around and I have been here five times... once alone and four times with family. I love their salad bar ... very tasty!!! They have a great selection of fresh greens and veggies. I did dock a star as there are some things they do not stock in the salad bar that would knock it up a notch.  Radishes, pepitas, artichoke hearts, feta cheese ( thought I remember them stocking this on past visits, but not this time around...??) Also, I'd love to see some organic produce in there... and wouldn't even mind paying more for it. Their soups are usually pretty decent, at least the handful I have tried. It's decent value for the money... no complaints!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves going to eat here there is something for everyone. Of course the kids like the ice cream. Wish it was a larger location since sometimes it is really crowded."}
{"text":"I am disappointed.  I love to come to Sweet Tomatoes because it is a healthy option with a variety of foods I like to eat.  I like to go there after working out down the street at Planet Fitness.  The reason I am disappointed is that I cannot get a to-go container without paying an additional $7.69.  I have had Gastric Sleeve surgery years ago and cannot eat a lot of food at one time.  So this time I put a little too much food on my plate and rather than waste it, I was hoping to bring the remainder home to finish and was told I would need to purchase a container.  This would have been the most expensive salad (only once thru the line) that I have ever had.  The cashier was all too excited to just throw it out and offer no consolation or care.  I will make sure that I make a better decision next time when I have to choose a place to eat, or perhaps I need to bring my own to-go container.  If you do not eat a lot at one time, I do not recommend this place to eat, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We're visiting from Seattle and this was the first place we really enjoyed. The Mission (old town Scottdale) and Totties (Lincold plaza, Scottsdale) were ok, though Totties was on the salty side of things. This place was awesome, used local ingredients, and fresh!!!  I loved all the signs placed everywhere that direct you where to go and what to do (although I probably wouldn't enjoy that if I was sick and all I wanted was soup).  So many options and so little tummy room! It was a challenge to taste everything.   All the salads were fresh and tasty (my favorite was the orange chicken salad). There pasta salad were equally mouth watering. The toppings were endless from beets to pickles, to olives and garbonzos.  The hot bar was equally delicious with chicken pot pie soup, clam chowder, new england ham and cheese soup (my favourite), and sides such as buttermild biscuit and corn bread (low-fat but I didn't find that out until after I tried it and it didn't taste low-fat to me at all).   I'm going to miss this place and can't wait for them to expand into the Northwest."}
{"text":"They had a group of kids in there that would not sit down what so ever,The worst part is when they got to the ice cream machine as they put there hands on the ice cream nozzles as well as using their hands to catch the falling custard.They were taking the finger size cones and putting them in the soda machine AND pushing the nozzle again with their hands as well as taking that cone with whatever soda was in it back to the ice cream machine.This went on for over a 1/2 hour.There was even a mother who let her kid put her hands on the ice cream nozzle,s  as well..Wont be back there as being a Dialysis patient if I get sick I am going to sue the shi* out of (squashed tomatoes).The workers went by but did not ask them to go back to their tables or leave the area and it was a frggin mess"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to a Sweet Tomatoes. They have a large salad bar. But, it is missing lean protein choices, no chicken for the Caesar salad nor tofu. The food is not healthy, lots of high fat options for the salads, carbs galore, and desserts. The special item was nachos. The total for 2 adults with drinks was a little under $25 - expensive for a meal without meaningful protein."}
{"text":"I come here often during lunch time. The prices are affordable. If you prefer a simple and light lunch thus place is it. You've got your salad bar with plenty of soup options and other side items, as well as dessert.  The staff is very friendly and there is always someone greeting you when you walk in and they acknowledge you when you leave.  The interior is very clean and earthy.  The staff will come by and pick up your plates for you. We always leave a tip for them.  I do enjoy their coffee and their chicken and chili soups are my favorites."}
{"text":"This new location is pretty damn spiffy. It felt clean and prices are OK ($8.50 for lunch). I had a coupon bringing it down to $6.99 - I'd consider going again next time they send me one.   The salad bar seems weird in that you fill it up and then pay. Rest assured, you can come back as much as you like. The premade salads were pretty gross, but the fixings for the DIY salad were decent. Nothing premium like avocado (and they make you pay extra for chicken! What a ripoff!). However, I was pleasantly surprised by the fun veggies they had - jicama, zucchini, butternut squash, etc, all shredded for your salad eating pleasure.   Fountain drinks are pricey at $2.49, but they did have Coke Zero!  I tried a bite of their chicken coconut soup (my typical fav at Thai restaurants) - it was really gross. My coworkers cauliflower soup looked equally disgusting.   For dessert I had a small bowl of their sugar free mango coconut mousse. I can't fault them for it tasting REALLY artificial (it was sugar free after all), plus it's cool they even offered something without sugar. The sundae bar looked pretty great if that's your cup of tea.   In general this place is a carb-fest with an adequate salad bar. You might come in here with good intentions to eat \"healthy\", but be careful as the pizza, ice cream, and baked goods will all be staring you in the face the whole time!"}
{"text":"It's about as good of a salad bar as you're going to find anywhere, and far outclasses SouperSalad, who remains their only near competitor.  When I've taken my time and thoughtfully combined ingredients, I've had some wonderful, tasty low-cal and low-fat meals at Sweet Tomatoes. Of course the temptation is to just pile stuff up on one's plate, and that's what most people do. Usually that just leads to indigestion and negates the whole \"health\" aspect. I've done that as well. Shamefully. Regretfully.  The cost can be reduced with coupon (that seem to come in every Sunday newspaper) and by foregoing soda, juice, tea, coffee. It's a lot of good quality food for $8-$9 per person presuming you can get by with water. Do you really need a Diet Coke?  During my visit today at this location none of the complaints I've noticed from other reviewers applied. The help was very attentive, my tray and used plate were collected quickly, and there were plates and additional silverware near the hot food.  The turkey noodle soup was tasty, and all of the salad ingredients were fresh and of a high quality. Compare that with the typical SouperSalad where everything tastes shot through with nitrates or something.  So yeah, it's usually a good experience."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I go this location often to celebrate birthday or special occasions due to it being very close to our office.   I find it funny how they are called Sweet Tomatoes but they don't have any tomatoes at all.  And I don't count those little grape size tomatoes, tomatoes.    They have a great variety of salads and toppings, and I love their Wonton Salad.  Their chunky chicken noodle soup is amazing, and probably the only meats you'll get from there.  They have sweet potatoes and bake potatoes, and they also have a ice cream.  They are usually well kept and the service is usually great.   Overall a good place for lunch, it's probably smarter to do take out.  And don't forget, always use a coupon, probably the 20% off, but preferably the 25% off... this place is a little high, and it's quite hard to get ones money worth from veggies alone!"}
{"text":"This location does not make fresh salads when the bowl is empty. When bowl is half empty they just keep adding plain lettuce diluting the salad so it has no taste. Terrible management"}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to another country and were confused initially by it's customs?  That is kinda how I felt walking into Sweet Tomatoes.  No greeter, just trays and a salad bar with two identical sides (left & right).  At the end of the line was a register.  After you pay, then you are seated.  Behind the register is where the majority of food choices are.  They had desserts, fountain drinks, ice tea, soups, pizza-like bread, muffins, baked potato, and themed food.  When I went, it was an asian theme.  The lady that picks up used plates from tables came by with fortune cookies.  My daughter got creative and took a bowl of soft-serve icecream and added pieces of chocolate lava cake and chocolate cupcake into it.  She absolutely loved this place.  This buffet doesn't have nearly as many food options as Golden Corral.  Granted, they do lean more towards healthy selections."}
{"text":"I always shop in this plaza, but never stopped here before. Glad I did super easy and fast lunch in between shopping! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants in general - but I do think Sweet Tomatoes offers a real value in \"fast food\". Sure the circa 1980's salad bar atmosphere is nothing to speak of, but their overall selection, quality, and freshness is impressive for the price."}
{"text":"I had never been to Sweet Tomatoes until today. I have been to Souper Salad many times before and I expected it to be similar but better.  Well, I will start with the good.  Okay and now the so-so. I had the chocolate bread muffin. It was tasty, and chocolaty, but dark chocolaty. Not sweet at all really. Like I said, it was good but as it was not sweet, it was not dessert, and as it was chocolate it didn't really go with anything else. I moved on to try the chocolate bread pudding concoction they had. That was REALLY good, but it was almost gone so I only got the edges. I got hardly any of the gooey chocolaty messiness that I truly wanted. This dessert probably would have been in the good category if I had gotten some 5-20 minutes earlier.  And now for the bad. I'll just start from beginning to end. Raw beets = not good! Dry, stale spit most of my first bite out. The light ranch tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The regular ranch was watered down. They were out of Coke, Dr. Pepper and Rootbeer and only had ice at the cashiers station, not in the soda fountain. The Chinese orange happy chicken salad had no chicken and I was not happy! I moved onto the soups. First I tried the 3-cheese tortellini soup. I couldn't taste any cheese and the tortellini was mush. The broth was flavorful but I still only had 3 bites. I moved on to the Irish Potato and Leek soup. It was pretty tasty actually but I still had to doctor it up with salt pepper and cream cheese because it was otherwise rather bland. I also took a bite of the chicken noodle soup. It had big chunks of chicken in it. Big, dry, overcooked pieces of chicken. It was also bland. Should have had some veggies in it. The mac n \"cheese\" was soupy and also bland. You won't catch me back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Unlimited salad bar is amazing, and there is also unlimited soup, baked potatoes, breads, select pastas and desert all included. A great way to not blow your diet or wallet on a meal."}
{"text":"I really love the of idea Sweet Tomatoes, and the food is good, hot and fresh. We were happy with everything we tried. I had issues with the restaurant itself though. The tables were clean, but the booths are showing wear and need recovering. The salt and pepper shakers were filthy and the floors throughout the entire building were very sticky. The women's restroom was a disaster. The trash bins were overflowing onto the floors. I was going to bring these issues to the attention of a manager, but I did not see one while we were eating and we had to leave quickly. The employees at this location have always been very nice, until tonight. They weren't rude by any means, but they just did not seem happy to be there."}
{"text":"Best buffet hands down!!  I love healthy eating, and I also love buffets. This is the best of both worlds for me.  The salads and topping always taste fresh and the soups are always very tasty. I love how they rotate specialty items every week it seems so you get to try new soups, salads, desserts and more.   You could eat super healthy here, but you can also fill up to the point that you need to be rolled out very quickly. Even the kids plate you can get for the little ones has more than enough room for plenty of food.   As far as this location specifically, it is my favorite. They recently remodeled not only their decor, but their overall operating structure in general. Definitely a vast improvement to what they were and compared to some of the other Sweet Tomatoes locations. Sine the change, I have not had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Nice selections but missed the free chocolate chip cookies and usually there are pizza slices."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars since they opened and we live close by this location. We had lunch on 10/18/15 and the Salad was Amazing as always but I went to eat a bowl of their \"Mexican Harvest Soup \" I began Choking! I spit out what I thought was Chorizo but it was Three Pieces of Cardboard ! I grabbed my wives' water and I told our hostess \"Kathy\" what happened and she apologized. She told the Manager and we left. I was very upset and I sent and email to corporate in California and they are sending me a Gift Card! Wow! I almost Died and they send me One Gift Card! We will never return!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't get this place.  I am a buffet freak.  I'll go to a buffet in a dark alley with no lights if they promised all you can eat crab legs.  Sweet Tomatoes is more like a senior hangout.  Well more like a place that has a lot of promises but no follow up.  1 - They guarantee fresh.  HA!  Most of the veggies looked like they were past ripe time and sitting out all day.  The tuna salad tasted like funky chicken (if you know what I mean)  2 - Variety.  I disagree.  You start out with a huge salad bar and some of the veggies are on there twice (sorry but beets shredded and diced is not variety)  Then you have soups, nasty pizza and jello.  3 - Reasonable price.  No way!  $13 per person (with drink) is not reasonable.  I think Golden Coral has twice as much variety and half the price at lunch.  Bottom line, don't go here.  Even if grandma wants to go and she's paying, just say NO.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is because of the friendly service.  They were even willing to refill your drinks for you.  But that's no reason to go there again."}
{"text":"Great and fresh foods. Their soups are my favorite. Make sure to try out their chicken soup with green onion."}
{"text":"this place is the bomb.great food at a reasonable price.sometimes i just come here for the strawberry lemonaide.so glad that they went back to the normal sweet tomatoes format.recent updates in decor as well!"}
{"text":"Sweet sweet Sweet Tomatoes. This is one place I absolutely adore above all restaurants, chain or non-chain. Everything they offer- be it salad fixins, pastas, pizzas or desserts- are always fresh and varied. They carry a few house salad dressings that I absolutely adore. The pizza bread is also very unique! Never have seen it anywhere else. Overall this place is amazing simply because they have so many simple things and can cater to a lot of different tastes."}
{"text":"Love the digital coupons for dinner & drinks! Still not a salad eater but I like to get some garbanzo beans/chickpeas, kidney beans, and boiled eggs before going to the hot bar. The blueberry muffins were delicious, as always. I was not a big fan of the gingerbread muffins. I tried a bite of the candy cane muffin and it was pretty tasty. The chicken pipette w/ vegetable soup was decent. The mac & cheese was not very cheesy at all, so that was a disappointment because it's usually better than that. Just an off night I guess! The foccacia (cheese pizza) was yummy. They also had a stroganoff-like pasta which I liked. The iced tea is always good. Too full to get dessert! Would love a Sweet Tomatoes in Goodyear/Avondale."}
{"text":"I had high hopes that this place would be as good and have as many options as Fresh Choice. NOPE. The concept is similar with a salad bar that greets you before the cash register. The salad bar itself was stocked alright. I remember thinking, ok they're gonna have some hot food around the corner. They had cheese pizza that tasted like cardboard, pasta, 6 soups and baked sweet/regular potatoes. Where's the beef?! The only meat I found was in their chicken noodle soup which I had about 4 bowls of where I just picked out the chicken and left piles of dough just swimming in the bland broth. Seriously, how full can someone get from this kind of menu? Their dessert bar was also just sad. Jello, some kind of crumb cake and a \"molten lava cake\" in a tray. The ice cream was ok but that cake was so dry! Definitely not worth the $30 something dollars spent here for 3 people and this was after a military discount. Save your tastebuds for another establishment with a broader menu or get some groceries to make a better tasting salad. Seems like it only caters to old people or tired looking parents with a herd of kids that only care about quantity and not quality."}
{"text":"Years ago, before the prices sky rocketed and quality decreased, My family and I enjoyed eating there often.  Last week we went for dinner even though the prices have become outrageous.  After making my salad I went to put blue cheese dressing on it.  I commented to my mom that the dressing looked watered down.  By the time I got to our table to eat my salad the blue cheese dressing had pooled to the bottom of the plate.  Then the spaghetti was cold.  The 7 vegetable soup was only broth.  Higher prices and lower quality will certainly leave Sweet Tomatoes off our dining choice."}
{"text":"Good food, but $11.50 for a salad and a drink?  I ended up only getting water..  Should have got $2.50 back..  Still..  Everything was good and seemed fresh.  Tried 2 soups, both of the current vegetarian ones.  I enjoyed them.  I guess the concept of the buffet is that people will come in and make 12 trips and eat everything..    If you only want 1 salad trip, a cup of soup, and a drink, go elsewhere.  Not worth the price at all.  That said, I knew all of that going in, and went anyways..  So I give myself 2 stars for going in and having the nerve to complain.  I did make a hella good salad, so I feel my 2 stars are well deserved."}
{"text":"There is a certain trust that comes with the words \"all you can eat\". It is the warm, welcoming reassurance that this establishment encourages gluttons from all over the world to eat, drink, and be merry. It is a sign that full bellies are nigh. Sweet Tomatoes breaks that trust.  I am a veteran of AYCE buffets of different styles: Chinese, Indian, breakfast, continental. They all have one thing in common; they are flavorful, and filling, because eating your fill is a pleasing experience. Sweet Tomatoes would be better called Bland Tomatoes, because tomatoes these days are usually quite bland, and so is their food selection.  Seriously, when was the last time you just bit into a tomato? Try it. It sucks, just like this food.  They start by walking us through their salad bar where we fill our trays with an array of salad ingredients. Salads are not known for being filling, or flavorful on their own, so that means that we defeat the whole purpose of this health food buffet by using salad dressing. There are also bland potato salad, flavorless pasta, and \"trust me, it's great\" tuna salad options to mix into our greens.  We can also pay $3 extra for a chicken patty, because every AYCE buffet has some kind of upsell, and meat is theirs. Yup, Sweet Tomatoes leans vegetarian, so there is no room for bulking up your swole here. $3 also feels steep for a single patty of meat, and I sincerely hope that the $3 upsell buys as much chicken as we want, although I doubt it. On my visit I opted for the basics.  We then pay to enter, and then eat the vegetables on our plate, which are high water content vegetables like lettuce in the first place. After that unsatisfying experience we are free to explore their hot food options, which are a little more interesting.  Their saving grace is the baked sweet potatoes, filling, flavorful, wrapped in foil, and ready for us to grab. We can eat them plain, or use the nearby potato toppings to sweeten the deal. The soups are also pretty enjoyable. The chili was great. Sweet Tomatoes is too cool for pizza, because they are supposed to be healthy: they serve cheese foccaccia, because this cheese bread is some how better than that other cheese bread.  After filling on the light, watery foods that Sweet Tomatoes serves I finally stood up to leave.The filling sensation was mostly water weight though: remember those water heavy vegetables, and soups. So yes, technically I ate all I could, but Sweet Tomatoes just definitely broke that AYCE trust, and I had to run crying to the open arms of Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Salad bar and hot food areas are clean and well maintained by staff. The dining room is monitored by staff very well and they make sure tables are cleared well. Never a problem with the quality of the food. I always leave with a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I love their food. The service is great. The lines sometimes can be a little long but other than  that you can always have a healthy and quick option."}
{"text":"Second time eating here and it's a good soup & salad bar. They have a few different types of salads already made including Cesar salad. They have 10 different dressings and good varieties for the salad toppings. The one thing good is the different types of lettuces are fresh.   As far as soup goes, they have some pretty decent good soup. Their Clam Chowder and Kettle Homeade Chili has been my favorite soup during my visits. They have good bread and pasta on some days. They have many flavors of juice as well as soft drinks.   Overall this is one of the better soup & salad places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love sweet tomatoes. This one is particularly clean, including the bathroom and the staff is always amazing. Today I started a freestyle hip hop song about salad and the cashier started dancing with me. That's great customer service"}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday evening and got a buffet without protein for about $9/ea  - I can always find some kind of coupon on the internet for this place!  - 20% off entire check expires 8/17/13! $7.29 Lunch expires 7/24/13 - Love the broccoli salad and the wanton salad. - Always get the chicken noodle soup with crackers! - Who fills their water cup with sprite?  - Save room for fresh corn bread and especially the the blueberry muffins! - It almost feels like you defeat the purpose of eating healthy bc it's ayce, but hey, it's better alternative than Feast! haha - This place can get real messy! Families definitely welcome!"}
{"text":"No romaine lettuce. Many things on salad bar were a mess or missing. Signs were missing. Soups on bar were gross. Even the chicken noodle soup tasted like water. Probably won't be back. Especially to this location."}
{"text":"It's amazing how one can have all they need to make their salad. So fresh and amazing. The homemade soups are delicious. Healthy alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"I have been to all the sweet tomatoes in the valley and this one is never clean. I have given it three chances and I it's very dirty within the bathrooms, the salad bar and the plates themselves. Not one I want to go back to."}
{"text":"All you can eat soup, salad, bread, and pasta! Never disappointed when I eat here. The broccoli salad is amazing!"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is meh... I realize it's not fine dining & a buffet to boot, but the entire time we were there not one person came to pick up any dishes & they were constantly running out of things... We felt like soup, but they all just tasted the same... Really disappointed..."}
{"text":"I went to sweet tomatoes tonight for dinner and it was great. It was my first time going and when we walked in it was a bit overwhelming but Paul (I believe his name was) told my friend and I what to do and was extremely accommodating and welcoming. My friend and I got our salads and went to find a table. The food was fresh, we wish there was some chicken or meat option in the salad bar but that is my only complaint! My friend is gluten free and there were a lot of options for her!   About half way through the meal Paul who had greeted us when we came in, came to the table and asked if he could refill our drinks for us which was so nice! The soup was really good and tasted very fresh! And the ice cream was creamy and rich! I had a great experience there and would definitely recommend!  There were a lot of options and I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there today, I loved everything there. It was clean, the soups were kept hot and there were around 6 different kinds to choose from. The salads were so fresh. I will make this one of my regular lunch place"}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. There's nothing special or memorable, but it's a convenient place for a family meal."}
{"text":"So many options for salads, soups, and desserts. The broccoli salad with crumbled bacon, cranberries, and the vinaigrette are fabulous. I would eat at the restaurant since the to go boxes are small."}
{"text":"We returned to Sweet Tomatoes for the first time since the STFK remodel.  fortunately they changed back to the Sweet Tomatoes they once were and it was great.  Thanks for listening ST.   Actually some of the remodel is carried over to the redo and it actually is better then before..."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my salad.  Oh, the joys of buffets.  And that's all I'll say about that...   But now to the review.  We went on a weeknight for dinner and it was crowded.  I mean, really loud and crowded.  I felt like I was sitting in 20 different families' living rooms.  Parking was nothing short of a nightmare, and we wound up walking over from the far part of Goodwill's lot.  We had a coupon though so even though the parking situation should have signaled us to move along we moved forth to get our cheap salad on.    They have premixed salads here that are pretty good.  And they have a ton of salad options so you can make a pretty rockin' creation.  They even have some premium toppings that are really good but at 2.95, I think, for one time around, the premiums are a bit of a rip off if you ask me.    We went during \"italian week\" and I was pretty disappointed by the breads/pizza/pasta.  Reminiscent of a Cici's buffet.  The desserts were just eh.  The brownie bites were rock hard at the edges.    I loved the drink options.  Great iced teas and lemonades all around.   The service was decent and they were really good about clearing old plates.    They gave us a coupon for the next time but my husband just left it because he was so disappointed.  We'll just make a salad at home next time..."}
{"text":"Food are fresh and good here. But service is terrible. Went to get my second round and the server cleaned up my table and gave it to another customer. And yes I have the card \"will be right back\" on the table."}
{"text":"A lover of Sweet Tomatoes.....Will not be back to this location. It is VERY poorly set up. Unfortunately whoever set this location up was just not a good planner. The spot where you have to wait for a table is in the way of people trying to get to the drinks and hot foods, and also right in front of the exit door. I have been to other locations and found the set up to be way better. Also, the girl who rang us up scolded my husband and I for stepping a little out of line so that my mom could get by us to pay. She was not very friendly. Lastly, I was sad because my reason for going was an ad stating that the monthly special was all of my favs....Tomato soup (very good), Grilled Cheese dippers (gross breadsticks with hard crusted cheese on top, NOTHING like a grilled cheese sandwich) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookies which we were told that they do not make until after 4pm (we went for lunch). Earth to Sweet Tomatoes, people like to eat cookies before 4pm too!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay.  I had to give this place another try, or tries.  After all, it wasn't fair for me to assess this place with the biased thoughts of \"meat\" on my mind...lol!  With a renewed frame of mind, my family and I dined here again...5 times!!!  Yes!  We've been going here quite often now since we have been making an honest effort to make moderate changes to our eating habits.  Although I know this place is not nearly organic and less processed as we'd like, Sweet Tomatoes is pretty fresh!  Everything does taste pretty good!  I stuck to the usual salad bar, preparing my salad the way I want.  You also have the option to select one of several pre-made salads too, ie. Caesar salad, wonton chicken salad, etc.  My kids enjoy the hot pasta bar and dessert bar the most.  What kid doesn't?  My husband can't get enough of their Vegetable Barley Soup...I think they are in the process of changing their menu, so this may not be on the current rotation of soups for now.  ?  As for the ambiance, cafeteria trays, and a more pleasant \"mediocrity,\" if there is such a thing, they are all still present.  We dine here for lunch moreso than for dinner - we need \"heartier\" for our dinners.  The one gripe I have is \"where did the little cherry tomatoes go?\"  They used to have it in their salad bar, and now they have replaced it with larger sliced tomatoes, not sure if they are Roma tomatoes or what.  We stay away from the added purchase of drinks, which will run you into an extra 2 and a half bucks per person.  Lunch is $8.49 pp.  $2.50 for the drink bar didn't make sense to us, since we don't drink those drinks anyway.  This is definitely a place to visit if you don't want to prep your own salad at home, which I've come to find out, it's more for the convenience and not the lack of talent to make it yourself at home."}
{"text":"After Linh finished shooting me, I asked him where he wanted to go for dinner.  \"What are you feeling like, bro?\", I asked.  \"Soup sounds good\"... and yes, it did sound good on this cold night.  So, we feasted like kings on salad and things.  The pozole, with fresh chopped green chiles you can add, was a delicious offering.  Throw some chopped onions, cheese and sour cream in.  It's basically a liquid burrito anyways.  But the star of the show, the one main stand out of the night, was the coconut muffins.  I am ashamed to say that I killed a dozen that night.  They were so good, we each took 4 home with us, discretely wrapped in white napkins.  We each looked like we were walking out with a small pillow in our hands."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Everything is always so fresh and the restaurant is always clean.   It's Delicious and Nutritious . i love all the options you have to put on your salad.  And the strawberry lemonade is sooo good, you have to try it."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here very often. I love being able to make my own salad. For the people complaining about the price sign up and get coupons with awesome deals. The only complaint that I have is I wish they would mix up The soup more often. Other than that my favorite fast go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but everything else is crap. There are probably 15 options other then the salad area. It was blah and not a good lunch option. There was one pizza option. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"If you'd like to pig out at a buffet but still feel okay about yourself, I'd suggest this place.  I like that is has the healthy options like the build your own salad bar but this place was lacking some essentials in the way of protein options.. I would've loved to have seen some salmon, shrimp, or chicken readily available to add on. Instead there was some mediocre looking pizzas and pastas sitting around. Kudos for the bevy of soups.. I did like that. There was anything ranging from broccoli cheddar to minestrone to chicken noodle.   Kind of a Panera Bread meets Golden Corral which could be a dream for some. However, if you're a normal human being just trying to eat normal portions and wanting to get your money's worth, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love this Sweet Tomatoes, but it is a bit pricey for just soup and salad if you don't have any coupons. I especially like the Caesar salad, chili, and chocolate lava cake (when they have it). I go about once every month, with coupons of course."}
{"text":"Not all Sweet Tomatoes are created equal. I used to scoff at my sister for coming all the way to this location when we live in the Southeast. It looks smaller than the Stephanie location, but it is cleaner and offer some healthier options. I love spring mix and it is a choice here.   The greens look \"green\" and fresh. The items are replenished in a quick manner and are bright in color. We eat with our eyes first and I loaded up on all of the vibrant colored items.   After the Thanksgiving weekend, a salad was something my body was begging for. Besides custom making my mountain of veggies, I like their Asian Chicken Salad and Caesar. The latter tastes lighter than most I have had before and that is perfect. Right now they have a Golden Yam soup and I am in love. I wish that they would keep the baked sweet potatoes on the line through winter. It seems to be a special during November only.   I must have been nuts to do two buffets in one day, but at least I loaded up on my vegetables.   I didn't sit out there, but it looks to have an outdoor seating option. It would have been heavenly on a beautiful sunny, 65 degree day like today."}
{"text":"This is so not in my ballpark. My family used to torture me and take me to Souper Salad when it was at the Pavillions.  I was dragged here by some folks when attending a seminar nearby. For what it is, it wasn't bad. Veggies & salads seemed to be quite fresh. Pretty tasty.  They had a huge selection of soups which is always good. I think there about 8 options and I hit on 2 of them. Thank goodness they had the baked potato bar. Pretty hard to mess that up. Pizzas (which I find to usually be terrible at these places) wasn't bad. Kind of a meager selection at the pasta bar. I always dig the frozen yogurt bar. Butterscotch ftw.  Walking in & out though, the sight of St. Francis and the proximity to Postino were killing me.  While I will never go to one of these places on my own volition, I can handle Sweet Tomatoes and am confident that I'll be able to rustle up something acceptable."}
{"text":"Once you get past all the health hazards of dining at a salad bar (I want to applaud those who used the hand sanitizer, cough or sneeze into their arm, and those who do not eat from the line), this place is virtually heaven for those who love their vegetables.   For eight to ten dollars this is a great deal. They have two signature salads that are served all the time. The Caesar is refreshingly light and not overtly creamy or heavy. The other is an Asian chicken salad which is tangy and sweet. This is the only option of getting meat in your salad without paying the additional two dollars for a tiny container. There is also a third specialty salad that changes every month.  Sweet Tomatoes offers an endless amount of options and toppings for the herbivores.  I always start with two plates, one for the specialty salads and one to create my own masterpiece. By the end of the line, everyone around seems impressed by how much I manage to stick onto one plate. It resembles a mountain more than a salad.   The staff are friendly and very attentive. When one container starts to look shabby or low, they will swap it out while making small talk.   They always have a large selection of soups, breads, pizzas, and pastas, but what I love the most are the sweets.  My favorites are the chocolate lava cake, warm brownie, or the fresh baked cookies. What goes best with any of these selections? The fat-free Dreyer's soft serve ice cream. If given the option, I would put ice cream on almost anything. Tell me it is fat-free and it is likely that you will see me with my mouth open directly under the dispenser."}
{"text":"I have really liked this place for a long time. If you like soup and salad and don't mind getting your food yourself, then this place is for you. I like being able to chose all of my salad toppings. Everything is kept fresh. Soups are pretty yummy. I usually get some muffins too...with honey butter! Yum! Staff is always friendly and keep your dirty dishes clear."}
{"text":"This is a joe average Salad Bar spot. it's large but the offerings are not even close to on par with the cheaper and much better Jasons Deli.  Eggs, yea they have them but its a chopped egg mix and its about 3 yolks to every Egg white. Not cool if you're health aware.  Olives for salads, all the have is black! Greek olives folks, thats what goes on salad.  Bad olive oils, tasteless and cheap. Healthy folks are going to use this for their dressing. Consider a tasty one.  Employees walking around with plates of cookies offering them to everyone. This is a salad place, many people are here to begin a diet and change their life and you are essentially taunting them! leave the cookies up at the fat people bar with the rest of the breads and cheddar soups. And Ice Cream.  I guess the biggest issue with this place is it's overpriced for the low quality of ingredients they use. They should ditch all the fat american food sections and kick up the quality of the health foods and they will have a winner."}
{"text":"For salad buffet, try-a-little-bit-of-this-and-that kind of place...A++.  The salad choices are great (and super fresh), the 3 soups I tried were great, and the selection of sides and drinks were abundant.  I really wish we had these in Virginia!"}
{"text":"I frequent the Souplantation back in Arcadia quite often, so it was quite a treat to find a Sweet Tomatoes located near me in Vegas. I have to say that this location of Sweet Tomatoes has a few things they do that make it stand out from the Souplantations that I have visited back in CA.   Came with my cousins on a fairly early Monday for dinner. No line at the salad bar - everything looked fresh and the workers were preparing salads every so often so that the bowls were never too low. Everything about the salad bar is pretty much the same as back home EXCEPT for the fact that they have blue cheese crumbles here! It probably doesn't make a difference to most people, but I LOVE blue cheese, especially when they serve their grilled cheese focaccia dippers.   Lots of tables and booths - I don't see this place filling up with too many people like other locations, which is nice. The drinks and desserts are located conveniently next to each other while the pasta, soups and breads are a few steps away.   Another big plus is that they have chocolate chip cookies here, something they no longer serve back at home. Great for ice cream or brownies. They also have mini ice cream cones and a ton of ice cream toppings (sprinkles, Oreos, nuts, etc.) - enough to make me a fan of this Sweet Tomatoes!   Prices are not too high, but they're always offering discounts via coupons in the mail or email. Workers are friendly and nice. Highly recommend eating here if you want something healthy and filling!"}
{"text":"The Salad was delish, the soup was not that great though and when it came to dessert & bread it was hard and tasted as though it was sitting around for hours. Think I'll stick to the usually buffets that have more to offer for your money, I had a coupon and still cost us around $ 28.00 for two people."}
{"text":"My husband and I use to frequent this place at least once a week. I'll have to say, if you're a big meat-eater, you may be a bit disappointed as there are hardly and dishes with meat.  When you enter, you start out going through a traditional salad bar with a couple already-prepared salad dishes, or you can create your own (heck, why not try it all?) There are also pasta salads, brocolli/raisin/bacon salad (delicious!), and plenty of dressings/toppings.  After you go through the salad line, you pay/get your drink/find a seat.  We always went at odd hours as the traditional rush hours are horrendous and not enjoyable in my opinion.  After we finished our salads, we went up to the other part (it's kinda difficult if you want 2nds on salad b/c other ppl are going through the line so you'd have  to squeeze in and yeah, not a fan of getting evil glances unnecessarily) which offers about 5 different soups, fresh fruit/jello, mac n cheese and a pasta dish, baked/sweet potatoes, pizza, muffins, dessert (usually cobbler), and there's a soft serve machine too.  The fun thing about Sweet Tomatoes is that each month has a new theme, and if you subscribe to their emails, you get weekly coupons which can save lots of $$!    I think one of the only reasons we don't go there as often is because I started a diet about a year ago and stopped the buffets.  Obviously it was just too good."}
{"text":"Back at Sweet Tomatoes... again. It seems I always get dragged here when Im in town. I just want to say that their Chicken Noodle game really disappoints me. We were here 5 minutes after it opened and the Chicken Noodle was already gone. I was fishing out sad, limp pieces of half-noodle from the bottom of the pot. The man behind the counter looked at me like I was strange, but didnt offer to refill it. Does he not realize some people only come here for the chicken noodle soup? Anyway, I am once again burned by my bad relationship with ST."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a rip off. Even after using coupons and discounts it's still overpriced. The food is just mediocre. If I'm looking for a healthy meal I will go elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. The food was good and we liked the selection. My only complaint is that, after drinking some of my tea through a straw, I noticed another persons lip prints on my glass."}
{"text":"The best word to describe this place is Meh. The food is okay, nothing spectacular nothing really worth trying a 2nd time. I hadn't been to a Sweet Tomatoes in years until my kids' school decided to have a fundraiser there. Nothing had really changed and I was quickly reminded why I hadn't ventured back in so long. The salads are eh-okay. The pre-made salads are all too heavy on the salad dressing, which leaves you no choice but to create your own. They have a nice variety of items, like jicama and fresh peas. Once you get past the salads there are the most bland pasta dishes ever found outside of a can. The three pasta selections actually have a nice al dente texture but the sauces are so void of flavor they ruin the whole dish. The bran muffins are tasty and moist. The soups always sound good in theory yet when I go to try one they continually disappoint. I was excited to see corned beef and cabbage soup, yet once I tasted it ...it was just meh, or maybe just blah. The Irish potato soup proved the same outcome. I didn't try the soft serve ice cream or the jello/ puddings, but I'm sure they were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Aways a good quick lunch or dinner spot nothing fancy but good"}
{"text":"the salad and corn bread was good. the garlic bread,and pizza was sorta doughey. the mushroom soup was very good,the brownie and ice cream was also good. also like to say the corn was to spicey to eat. The cashier wasn't to friendly but okay. the place was pretty clean too, once i was done,the buser came got the plates right away."}
{"text":"A family favorite. We get coupons pretty frequently, which helps with the price - it can get expensive for a family of three adults and one child. The food is always fresh, and I've never had a problem with the quality. I highly recommend the muffins, they are always warm and delicious!  I hope someday they expand, because the only thing I don't like is how crowded it can get. A few times, I have had to stand and wait for a seat...and it took about ten or fifteen minutes until I was finally seated. Other than that, it's a great place to eat if you want something healthier!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, but they were out of a lot of things and some of the different food stations were a mess."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Sweet Tomatoes for years.  I heard the rumors about the Field Kitchen test, but was skeptical about the actuality of the company trying something so stupid when Sweet Tomatoes has such a unique niche in the market.  Hardly anyone has this type of product anymore and the public demand seems to be thriving.    So a new Chief Executive of Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp tries to make a name for himself and invests a couple million to see how the chain can make more money on the average customer bill - by offering a few items such as alcohol and some chicken/beef skewers, plus a built in 7.5% tip for the franchise.  I heard about this last summer before it happened and I didn't believe the rumor.  Who would be that ignorant?  Very few of the changes sounded like an improvement for the customer.  In fact, most of the changes sounded like a benefit for the ownership.    Well, now we move forward in time almost a year later and the test concept failed. I visit one of the former \"Field Test\" locations several months after it converted back to the buffet style.  I'm disappointed because the location, having undergone the renovation, is a mess.  The island for beverages and soft serve is a cluster ####.  God forbid a senior try to navigate through the area with a walker or such.  It is congested and ill-conceived.    I always loved the soup and today tried the chicken noodle.  I've never been a pasta critic, but the noodles were gummy & difficult to chew.  There were no crackers for soup and my lunch companion said the other pasta choices weren't good either.    I feel bad because I always try to coax my coworkers to join me for lunch at Sweet Tomatoes.  If I do in the future, it will be at another location, like Whole Foods for their salad bar, or another concept altogether."}
{"text":"Beat the afternoon rush for the healthy meal of the day. Fresh chx noodle soup w oyster crackers, and chicken tortilla soup. Not like home but as close as your gonna get here! The salad greens were fresh and constantly tended to.. Customer service was on point and the staff was really helpful. Had to wipe the table down tho as it seemed we beat the floor staff to it! Hey, not looking for perfection. Just a cool salad... Good spot to hit up on weekend !!"}
{"text":"More than anything my review is for the service. WOW! WOW! WOW! best service I've ever had at a Sweet Tomatoes location.  Not sure if there was a change in management or something of the sort.  We were greeted at the front entrance and asked if it was our first time, it was for some of my family.  Then the cashier went out of her way in accomodating us with our coupons.  The waitress, super friendly and very good about picking up dirty dishes.  The best part though was when the manager ( young hispanic guy) came to our table said he heard it was our first time, gave us free cookies all wrapped up along with a coupon for next time.  Great job with the staff Sweet Tomatoes!!  TIP: sign up for email and get weekly coupons."}
{"text":"This place was next door to our hotel. After a few days of greasy burgers, we were hungry for some veggies. This salad/soup/pasta bar was just the ticket. We enjoyed the food, it was fresh and the serving areas were spotlessly clean. Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  I'll try one of these places again."}
{"text":"We love some Sweet Tomatoes! When we are in Phoenix, we find one so we can have a go-to place for a little lighter fare. The salad bars are always well attended and well stocked. The food is fresh and tasty. Soups are excellent. Hot bar items are a little institutional but still pretty good. Service is reasonably attentive.  We like it and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"You know in the past I would have raved about Sweet Tomatoes but it is fast loosing my thumbs up! This is the 3rd time I've been to it and it has not had my favorite soup, Clam Chowder.  Also, their selection for their sides has diminished as well.  Today I even had to ask for butter, they asked what kind and then brought it out from the refrigerator and let me take one then put it back! What's with that? You have to ask for the butter now?   We also tried the pineapple upside down cake, eh so, so!  I just to love this place now it's moving way down on my list!    It's still a great value for what you get, just needs to improve their selection for the sides and PLEASE BRING BACK THE CLAM CHOWDER!"}
{"text":"While I generally avoid any place with a sneeze gaurd, Rickie and I had a hankering for salad bar. And while we were smart and got our See's Candies first in case the salad bar experience didn't pan out, we were ready for 93 toppings to pick from. Upon entering I was impressed by the cleanliness of Sweet Tomatoes. Every station was stocked and ready for the pilling. I'm NOT here for a healthy salad. I want the egg, bacon, cheese extravaganza. I want ranch AND blue cheese. I want a difibulator!!!! All fresh. All pretty darn yummy. We had a Canadian Cheese Ham soup. Yowza! Good, gooey, salty...really, it was more like a dip. But we polished off that cup. They have pastas, desserts, focaccia, food, food, food. All in all my low expectations were exceeded by a good foodie experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place! All you can eat healthy salads and soups. What could be better. You will never leave hungry and so long as you take it easy on the pasta, potatoes and deserts, you can retain your girlish figure :-)"}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is kind of hit and miss with me. This location in particular I do not care for. The food is mediocre and for paying over $10 for a meal it is not acceptable. On one visit here  there was a long strand of hair resting in my salad, not such a fan of having hair in my food. Anyways, save some money and don't go to this overpriced salad bar with average food."}
{"text":"First experience at this location wasn't the greatest but all the food was fresh. Second time I went the service and food were both great. Great place for lunch or an easy dinner."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome veggie-bord. While there is no meat here, there is a lot more going on than just salad. They have a large selection of hearty soups, baked potato bar with all the fixings (including bacon).  There's also a small pasta bar and make your own ice cream bar.  All the non-vegetarian and non-vegan items are clearly marked as such.   Personal fav's include the cream of mushroom soup and the no-sugar added chocolate mousse. Bomb diggity!!!"}
{"text":"This is a salad buffet, not a high end restaurant, so expect the tongs in the food, messy tables, and out of control kids. For the price it is alright. You can always go back and get more, duh. But they have a really ridiculous 'premium' items section, which is essentially chicken pieces, for an extra dollar. Unless you are going to die without those items on your salad, skip them and fill your plate with the healthy greens. They have seasonal foods, such as chili in the winter, and strawberries in the spring. They always have low fat ice cream, and brownies, which you can make into a brownie sundae.  Waiters come around and clear your table pretty well, and will leave you a plate of warm chocolate chip cookies.  They have many options for everyone, from vegan to carnivore."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is. Salad bar with plenty of choices for toppings. I like how they have a variety of soups to choose from. They also have a few pasta and baked goods that lack in flavor. Service is just okay. Could be better. But again. It's good for what it is. A good alternative if you don't feel like waiting for a table at a restaurant and just really want a salad."}
{"text":"Love sweet tomatoes just not this one. Smaller than most and out of everything. Dirty and no service. Beware of the ice cream machine just got chocolate sprayed allover my new shirt. Wanted vanilla but yep was out of that too. Sad when a salad place runs out of ranch. I'll still eat at sweet tomatoes but not that one."}
{"text":"this plate is pretty amazing sister restaurant w/ souplantation in LA  Very good salads drinks the acai berry green tea  Soups made from scratch!!  baked potatoes w/ all the fixings  fresh pastas  an array of baked goods  ice cream machine  fruits and desserts  would come back again"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy and really great customer service you always see smiles on the employees faces I am going to come here as often as possible since it is truly a good place to eat and it's good for you as well"}
{"text":"Have been going to Sweet Tomatoes over the years and it has always been good.  Good selections, fresh quality and attentive staff.  However my complaint is they keep raising the price.  We were there recently for lunch and it was almost $9 per person and now they have added an additional charge for certain salad toppings!!!  Really?  So you must make a decision about your toppings that could add an additional $5 to your lunch choices. I resent that and understandably prices of everything keep going up, don't do that to me when I am hungry and selecting my salad choices!!!  I don't mind paying the $9 for lunch with all of the salad, soup and extras.....but don't add charges while I am going through the line! This was something new since we had been there and it just didn't feel right.  Of course ultimately I can decide what I want or don't want, but it was just not right. So, be prepared to spring for at least another $2.50 if you want more expensive toppings added to your lunch time choices.  I presume they  do this for dinner as well."}
{"text":"This place is good when you want to get a salad made your way and some other healthy choices. The service is pretty good and I personally enjoy the drink selections.. The pomegranate green tea is amazing. It is slightly like the chain fresh choice in northern California except sweet tomato has fewer choices. There is not a lot that can be said about this place, you serve yourself and they clear your table. So far... good job."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant,  been coming here ever since we moved here in 2003. Used to frequent every Sunday after church, and then they had a breakfast buffet for a little bit which we tried a few times, but we were more for the soup and salads. The pastas used to be overdone and tasteless but it's a little better now, but still not something I eat a lot of  anyway. We've seen management come and go, even the ladies who pick up dishes. There's one whose been there since we've been going. But we don't see her as often nowadays.   The Chinese chicken salad is their staple there and it's one of my favorites along with the Ceasars salad. The best things I like that they have to offer on a rotation is the Greek salad, taco salad, lemon, chicken and rice soup, albondigos soup, mushroom soup just to name a few.   I like how they stay  on top of keeping the salads , toppings and dressings filled, although,  most times there are always drippings of the dressings into each other. I have never seen it not dripped. and a lot of the times lately,  the pizza is a little overdone. it's used to come out nice and cheesy and not burnt on the edges. it still goes fast, but if you can get it out of the oven, you can get the middle pieces. I love the muffins,cornbread and brownies as well. After filling up here, who  needs dinner? we usually have a snack for dinner if we feel hungry."}
{"text":"Went here after our disaster at Lo Leo's.  Always good and fresh.  They rotate soups."}
{"text":"I've really been disappointed in this specific location the last couple of times we've gone. I love the buffet status because I have no shame in piling high for the prices they charge, but the last time we went was the straw that broke the camels back for me. For starters I know that the employees are not responsible for patrons kids, but when you see a kid stick his head under the sneeze guard and grab food with his dirty, sticky hands I think someone ought to say something. The employees, rather than keep the salad bar clean, were gossiping about the one girl that was sick and left early(they believe she was faking it FYI). The whole restaurant was just a mess, any available table was sticky from previous customers and then, get this, my partner goes to the restroom (which are also filthy, both male and females) and an older gentleman leaves without washing his hands! Guess where he went right after exiting the bathroom?! Yep, the pizza area. I was so disgusted with the unsanitary conditions that I will NEVER EVER go back there!"}
{"text":"I love Sweet tomatoes. Well, I really keep coming back for their Caesar salad and this tuna pasta dish that I never bother to remember its name. Also, I just love their blueberry muffins. It is moist, warm, with a crisp to it. I sometimes indulge by adding a little of their whipped honey butter on it. Yummm!   Oh, you don't have to get the Caesar salad. You can totally build your own salad! Lots of choices to choose for sure in that department.   They have a variety of soups which will vary. They usually have a themed month (mexican, asian, i.e...) so usually you'll find a specialty soup customed to the theme. Honestly, I don't really eat the soups. My husband does, the kids usually get the chicken noodle soup...which I've tasted and is actually pretty good. Chunky noodles and chunky pieced of chicken.   They also.serve a few pastas like mac n cheese, a penne type pasta, and even serve bake potatoes in which you can just add all the fixings yourself. Note, the potatoe isn't pre-cut opened so you'll have to slice that thing yourself or just put all the toppings you want in it on a side dish and do it at your seat.  I can only give them 3 stars though I'd wanna say 5, especially if you are on a trek or on a track to a healthy lifestyle...but they keep raising their prices to the point that almost 40 bucks (that's WITH THE coupon) isn't worthed. I could actually eat for the same amount of money elsewhere, still eat a salad, then at least my boys can indulge into something more of their liking.   But we'll eat here because as I said...they make a really good Caesar salad and those blueberry muffins are deelish. Love fulfilling my Caesar salad crave from here. You don't have to buffet-it. They do have to-go boxes that you just fill yourself. I don't know how they charge in that way...i should find out.   My advice is join their email club before going in so you can take advantage of any offers. They recently renovated, the place looks great. We certainly do no frequent here as much as we used to. However, we'll be back...we always come back at least a few times a year. I'd recommend this place for someone who is looking for an alternative route.   Note, they don't serve much protein. Whatever protein you find would be the ones they add into their soups, or a small cup of chicken to add into your salad.   Definitely kid and stroller friendly!"}
{"text":"This new sweet tomatoes location is amazing.  We used to go to the old one, but it was always crowded, loud, and somewhat dirty.  I haven't encountered any of those problems at this location.  It's super clean, it looks great, there are generally less people, and the food, and service is awesome.  They even have patio seating! Something I didn't know before is that you can also do take out.  You can get a box from the cashier, fill it up, and take it to go.  On a side note, their Sunday breakfast (every Sunday 9-12) is very disappointing. I've been trying to make time to check it out, and now that I have, I wouldn't recommend it.  The breakfast foods are just really blah, and the selection isn't all that."}
{"text":"Absolutely for salad lovers. Great options. Good for kids. Sign up for coupons!"}
{"text":"Never had major issues with the food before...until recently.  Went there for lunch.  After a few bites of salad, I noticed something crunchy and hard.  I spit it out into a napkin and found several pieces of black glass.  I notified the cashier and she spoke with her manager.  The manager stopped by and apologized and made sure I didn't need medical help.  Most restaurants would have comped the meal at the least.  She just left.  I wasn't looking for a free meal but would have been nice to offer."}
{"text":"Not the best, but far from the worst. I took my little one here after being cooped up in the house all day. I had some different salads and he loves getting peas and croutons and black olives. He enjoyed some soup and a variety of muffins and I had a loaded baked potato. We both had the chocolate lava cake for dessert which wasn't very good. Nothing is fabulous but nothing is bad, neither is the price. I'll probably bring my boys back sometime, though not in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Got an email for $6.99 lunch so I decided to head on out. I used to go here all the time when they had a location on central and camelback but this one is a bit more complicated to get to by bus... since it is on the wrong side of the freeway from metrocenter. Either way I found the place and started off with lots of different salad choices. The wonton happiness is my favorite. I also got some of thier lemon broccoli salad and Joan's broccoli madness plus some of thier tuna pasta salad. All was good and I paid for my meal and got a water cup. It was pretty busy and was seat yourself so I chose a booth where I could see the soup bar. After I finished the salad I tried some yummy potato soup and some lemon soup which was interesting. Lemon seemed to be in complete abundance from the broccoli to the pasta to the soup to the lemon muffins to at dinner they had a lemon lava cake. A little overboard in my opinion. But either way some of the best things I had that day were the broccoli madness, the potato soup, the cornbread muffins....with real corn inside, their delicious sugar free chocolate mousse, and a brownie sundae."}
{"text":"I love buffets. But every once in a while you need something a bit healthier. Sweet tomatoes is a great solution. You go through the salad bar first, pay, get seated, then you can go to the salad bar again or the soup station.  There's usually about 6 soups to choose from, some flatbread, and three types of pasta. The salad bar itself has several options including a couple premixed salads. A few of my favorite items are the wonton happiness salad, the seafood salad, the quinoa salad, joans broccoli madness, the sweet potato corn chowder, and the broccoli cheddar. For desserts there is brownies, a soft serve machine, and sugar free chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place lost their lease and tomorrow is their last day :( Guess I'll have to check out the Metrocenter one."}
{"text":"I'd give the salad bar 5 stars. A great selection of fresh vegetables, very decent soups, and good desserts.  That said, for $14/plate, you'd expect a little more than a very good self-serve salad bar. So overall: good but pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Its about time they opened one in this area!!  I was sick of driving to the NW to get my cheapo salad fix.  Its great that they always change up the menu w/ the different themes every couple of weeks..some hit..some miss but there's no other restaurant I'm going to get such a huge dose of veggies like this place.  We always get coupons in the mail here which make it even better.    I always get 2 plates when we go in.  One for the specialty mixed salads and the other where I just pile on a bunch of veggies etc.  I never bother w/ the breads/pasta section and usually get a couple of soups w/ the turkey chili and chicken noodle being my faves.  Its cool that Republic of Tea is included in the drinks section too."}
{"text":"There really isn't much to complain about here for what you get for the price.  I usually just stick with the salads and soups.  Some of the soups are actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"My Description:  Sweet tomatoes is a salad buffet and dinner cost us $9.95 per person. The food was fresh, I didn't see any wilted vegetables, the selection of salad toppings (ie, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, kidney beans, beets, etc.) were great!  There were about 8 different salad dressings to choose from.  They had about 8 soups to choose from, a couple pasta dishes (including mac&cheese) and the fruit selection was my only disappointment due to the small selection.  Soft serve dryers frozen yogurt (choco or vanilla) and the dessert was so-so.   My Review: GREAT for the price, staff was friendly and bussers were great at coming by and taking empty plates, atmosphere pleasant, restaurant was clean.  They have a great to-go deal that we'll be taking advantage of, you can create your own salad for just under $6 or add on a soup and some extras for about $8- a healthy option for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this chain! I have been to other locations in different states many times and this one blows them out of the water!! The salad buffet is always fresh and filled, soups are always hot and extremely appetizing, bread & potato selection is abundant... the food is just amazing! I wish I had a never ending appetite but then they wouldn't make any money as I'd be there everyday! This location is unique because it sells alcoholic beverages and has one of those fancy Coca-Cola machines in which you can create exotic combinations! I've been living here a short while and have gone to this location twice! I'm already craving it again! Definitely will return many many times!"}
{"text":"This is one of my FAVORITE places to go. It is all vegetarian, except for some of their soups. I love everything there, especially the fact that they make and bake EVERY SINGLE THING in the building! I definitely recommend this place to anyone. This place is also great for kids."}
{"text":"Mmmm. Time for some salads, soups, and a few other indulgences.  I really like Sweet Tomatoes at Best of the West shopping plaza.  On this visit, I was pleased to see that the buffet restaurant has gotten a fresh new look!  From the new wooden floors, to fresh coats of paint, and even a few new seating updates.  How cool? Smart move Sweet Tomatoes as the place was kinda worn before the remodel.  I found the salads to be very fresh along with all of the veggies and the ton of other toppings that vie for space on the plate.  My two pasta salad weaknesses are Broccoli Madness and Tuna Tarragon; I could get seriously fat eating these \"healthy salads\".   Then made my way over to the soup section where there is always about 6 or 7 kettles of piping hot soup from which to choose.  Decided on the Irish Potato Leek this time which I found to be creamy and very tasty. Yummy!  Another bowl please.  Don't tell anyone, but I always snag a piece or two of sourdough bread to dunk in the soup. My favorite soup for sourdough dunking is the Chicken Noodle.    Until next time Sweet Tomatoes..."}
{"text":"For a causual, reasonably priced, quick bite-this place rocks!  The salad makings were fresh & well maintained, the soups are pretty good, but the chili is my favorite, although on my last visit it seemed to be watered down.  My kids love the ice cream machine, and their blueberry muffins are the best!"}
{"text":"Eh, a regular old salad bar. The two staff on the registers did not seem fully trained though. I believe highly on first appearances and if they don't know how to even run a cash register or answer a simple question, then they do not belong out on the floor.   It was a busy night and they only had one person bussing the tables (I felt bad for her, she had so much to do with no help). Even the GM was there and I didn't see him help bussing, only sweeping."}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place. Pretty clean for the most part. If they had more smiley and happy servers checking in often with customers that would be great."}
{"text":"This location is okay.  Came here on a Thursday evening.  When I first walked in it just seemed kind of dingy.  The floors were sticky and food over many parts of the restaurant and several tables had plates piled up.  The food overall was okay, but the broccoli in the ham and macaroni tasted weird.  The mushroom soup was good, but the split pea and potato barley, chicken orecchiette didn't taste good at all.  I didn't try the chili but the chili is a lot thicker than the chili in the Las Vegas / Henderson restaurants.  The one huge plus of this place is that they had Diet Dr Pepper.  The plates in or table were pulled up for awhile before someone picked them up.  I saw more workers at the front than the in the area were people were eating-that explains why plates were piled up on many tables.  I like the layout of how the soups are set up, where people can get the soup in two sides, but only one ladle so you have to reach across the soup to get some of the ladles.    The men's restroom looked cleaner and smelled better than the restaurant itself, which is pretty sad."}
{"text":"Hate the industrial look of the building's exterior, but LOVE the food and service.  Excellent salad bar with never a wilted lettuce leaf in sight.  Love the no-fat honey mustard salad dressing, the Big Chuck Chicken Noodle Soup with more chicken than noodles (who woulda guessed?!), the bran muffins, the chocolate brownie muffins (which taste especially good when topped with frozen yogurt) . . . .  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, buffet kept up and well stocked. This was my first time at this location and I'd be back if I was in the area again. They offer all kinds of salads, soups, pizza, pasta and fresh baked muffins. Don't forget to enjoy their soft serve ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Before I begin let me say: I am vegetarian.  By no means am I a hater of carnivores, I just don't like eating meat.  That said, this place is great for a reasonably healthy and affordable lunch or dinner.  If you are looking for a lot of meat in everything, seek a meal elsewhere.  Join their mailing list for the weekly email coupon offers to save more either as a solo diner or in a group.   I enjoy being able to build a salad with lots of different ingredients and multiple dressings, if I choose!  The soups, pastas, breads, and baked potatoes (topped with everything you could want) are tasty too!  This location is cleaner than some I have visited here in Las Vegas as well as Utah.  They have a covered outdoor seating area which is enjoyable when the LV temperatures are not out of control."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a nice little salad/soup buffet place.  It's clean and the food is good.  It's a little expensive when compared to the Casino buffets, but the quality of ingredients is good here.  Worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food and soups were mediocre.  The soda machine was not working. The place was dirty. This location has gone downhill"}
{"text":"We go here quite a bit. the food is good, employees are pleasant. The price isn't bad, my only complaint is the dishes always feel gritty. if the dishes are not just down right dirty and with stuck on food more times than the management should be comfortable with."}
{"text":"I'm about as far away from a vegitarian as you can get and love the place. It's afordable and there is a wide variety of food. It has a decent veggie buffet portion but I'm not a huge fan of the pastas that they serve as part of it. They possess chick peas though which is amazing.   The part I go for is the buffet hiding behind the salad bar. The soups that threstaurant have are extremely good and vary depending on what time of the year it is. I have enjoyed all of them. There pasta on that side is so so but their breads and desserts are good. They have mousse. YUM! I recommend it if you feel like eating \"a little healthier\" than usual."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times, since I first tried this place a few months ago. My friends and I were weaning away from eating the regular Strip buffets, so we settled on one that was a lot more healthy. The salads, the foccacia bread, the soups...all delicious! I especially love their asian chicken salad and their broccoli salad. If you're a big muffin person, you have to eat their muffins with their apple butter! It's so good!   Don't feel bad when you eat here! A lot of their food items are low in fat. If you want to eat at a buffet, you can eat a little bit more healthy and save more money at Sweet Tomatoes (costs about $8.50 for the buffet with a drink). I'd eat at Sweet Tomatoes any day."}
{"text":"I enjoy the limitless selections on the salad bar. Five or Six soups to choose from. 3 types of muffins, baked potato, prepared pastas, fresh fruit, yogurt and toppings. Cold drinks, coffee, tea... I know that fast food restaurants work hard at keeping things clean. However sweeping the carpet with a broom and dustpan was a little disturbing. I know they need to tidy up, however when you begin to raise floaters that I needed to wave away from my plate.   As you enter the restaurant you make the decision as to which side of the buffet you are going to stroll. Pick up our tray and plate and get a squirt of some hand sanititzer just before you embark on the valley of veggies. It's nice that they have the sanitizer, however everyone does not partake. So it might be a good idea to have more sanitizer at the end of the line by the cashier or give out wipes at the table. Each veggie of course has its own spoon/serving utensil and I try really hard not to let that skeeve me out, know how many hands that have possibly touched each.   Welllllll, that's not going to stop me! I've got my own system to help me enjoy my meal every time. LOL"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes/Soupplantation (same place).  Wonton Chicken Salad, Joan's Broccoli Madness, fresh veggies . . . sounds healthy no?  It is until you get into the main room where breads, soups, pastas and cake await.  It takes willpower not to overload on the carbs and calories.  Still everything is tasty and the kids love it too.  They have great variety for both food and drink.  My only beef with this place (other than there being no beef), is that they charge a fee for about a dozen \"premium\" toppings including chicken, mandarin oranges, etc. Nothing special but I would rather pay $1.00 extra for the meal than $3.99 extra each time I want a few pieces of chicken to go with my salad.  And the worst thing is you have to pay everytime you get a refill even though the rest of the salad bar is free refills although seriously, how would anyone know.  This particular location is not as clean as one would hope and the staff is less attentive than expected."}
{"text":"Ok...this is a favorite chain restaurant of mine.....Great for foreign tourists who want to experience American opulence. Or for families with children and the money to travel...fresh perfect fruits and veggies...creative salads...fresh breads baked on site...though not usually gluten free....and never glutton free.  Lol....pun intended......soft serve ice cream and fruit and cottage cheese along with at least 6 c h prices of soup.....my mom swears by their chili.   I love the honey whipped butter.....yum...."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Can be pricey for what it is, but coupons are not hard to find. Food is always plentiful and quality. Place is always spotless as well."}
{"text":"I like this place; it is Soup Plantation. It is owned by Soup Plantation and has great food. Definitely not a meat n potatoes place. You've got salads, pasta and soup and dessert. It's about $12pp so that works for a family of 5. Kids were pleased with the food. The only difference for me is that Soup Plantations I've been to have more selections/varieties of food. But overall, I knew where I was coming so it was what I expected.  The desserts there were not for me but they did have a few different things.  They had ice cream/frozen yogurt machine which contained Peach Cobbler ice cream (not good to me lol), they also had brownies and a chocolate moose type dessert.  Check online for their menu before you go to make sure they have enough of what you want there.  Otherwise, what they had was very tasty!"}
{"text":"For a place that bills itself as a place for healthy dining, it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Their salad is romaine or iceberg, not exactly a healthy \"mixed greens\" selection.  Their raw veggies are \"ok\" but their salad dressings are far from even decent and contain a LOT of ingredients.  Their soups are not good for you either, one of them, the veggie chili I believe, listed oil as the second ingredient.. no joke.  For anyone with food allergies or who prefers not to eat specific foods like wheat or dairy, this place is a nightmare.  The managers know nothing about the ingredients and have to print the ingredients from a computer for every single item you have questions about.  Most of the cooked food is loaded with dairy and gluten.  Plus they charge $9.99 for the salad bar and like $2.50 for a drink!  bunk."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great salad and you think your being healthy....until the mac and chz and pizza and breads omg the salad was amazing but got washed down with dessert lol always a great time and good peeps working."}
{"text":"Nifty enough place.  Selection is surprisingly more limited than you'd think, considering that it's a salad bar only.  I've been in chinese boofays and sizzlers that had just about the same options for salad items.  Meat of any kind is few and far between, but if you're creative you'll find some.  Recommendation is to go when and only if you have a coupon, otherwise it's simply not worth the horrendously over-ambitious price."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes. You can sit here and complain because the buffet isn't a large sized buffet. And, also, their food at the buffet is not very delicious (if you ask me). But the children I babysit LOVE it. So I may just be picky.   BUT if you come to Sweet Tomatoes, I feel that you should be coming for their salad buffet. Its wonderful and accommodates about everyone. The staff is always very friendly and the restaurant stays clean. Thanks for amazing business"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet! Plenty of healthy and delicious options. Everything is fresh and the best part is that there is something for everyone, not just soup and salad."}
{"text":"Even with a coupon, I feel ripped off.  How much is a drink?  Over $3? And there is only ONE soda machine for the whole place?  How convenient.  Not a great place if you're a meat eater.   If you love salad and carbs, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"So I think there are maybe 5 people in Phoenix who have never been to a Sweet Tomatoes or Soup Plantation. Therefore, this review is a little ridiculous; however, I continue to write and you continue to read so here we go.    This restaurant is a chain that gives people the illusion of healthy offerings, when really there is little to nothing healthy about it. The salad bar is good, fresh, and extensive. I really like the caesar salad (not healthy) and the croutons (super not healthy). The rest of the restaurant is comprised of mediocre soups, pastas, and 'pizzas' that aren't anything special, but are very edible. The best item, in my opinion, is the baked sweet potato... can't beat that! Most of the soups are either bland or overly salty, but once in awhile you'll get a good one. The desserts follow the same mediocre trend.... 'brownies,' soft serve, pudding, jello.... meh, nothing amazing, but nothing terrible. Regardless, you'll eat it all... you'll eat it until you are super stuffed and feel sick . Why? It's a buffet! You have to try everything and you have to get your money's worth. Buffet mentality itself is not so healthy.   Anyway, they always offer a coupon and that brings the entire experience to about 10$ without a drink... not terrible. If you are going with a big group, this place has upsides as there are many options and everyone can most likely find something to eat. If you are trying to find a new awesome restaurant to try, maybe for a date.... this probably isn't the place. If you are trying to eat 'healthily' ....My advice... skip the buffet all together."}
{"text":"I have been to sweet tomatoes many times and to this particular location twice. I think this place needs more of a pro and con list kind of set up...so here it goes.... Pros: salad is usually fresh Good caesar salad Good balsamic dressing nice selection of soups Sweet potatoes!  Cons: -The soups aren't always very good... I think the best one that I've had is the albondigas while today I had the chicken stew which was too salty and the veggies weren't cooked enough. -The pasta is generally over cooked -The desserts are pretty meh -The breakfast is also very meh.... for example, the oatmeal is watery, the eggs are flavorless, and some combinations are really odd (today they had mediterranean pasta with scrambled egg in it...weird...)   So I will probably come back here again for lunch/dinner (not breakfast...ugh) due to the convenience factor and the fact that they send me coupons all the time, but I would definitely not pay full price...."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch prizes are not so bad for lunch.  But really not sure how this place survive with a much cheaper buffet around the corner.  That being said been here before and service was good from all cept the cashier she was a tad rude.  Even though it was lunch we must have missed lunch crowd place was mostly empty and still salad bar items were almost empty and several items.  Tried 3 soups and each was just ok lacking flavor. The same with pasta dish I tried.    And for some reason it felt really warm in dinning room.  Been here before and enjoyed in past but this visit was lacking for me."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if your craving salad and different options of Soup.  It reminds me of home and going with my parents years ago.  Excellent selection of the soup that's also unlimited servings with the salad.  You also get choices of pastas for the day and pizza which of course is a win win situation.  Plus, dessert at the end makes this buffet the spot to go to with healthy options."}
{"text":"This Sweet Tomatoes has a leg up on the competition because they serve cream of mushroom soup. Anybody that eats at Sweet Tomatoes knows that they cater to the geriatric crowd by not seasoning or salting any of their soups (or pastas) so I was surprised they had a decent soup at this location (it still needed salt and pepper though, but that's a given.)   This location also is better than others because they serve TWO types of pickled beets on their salad bar, LOVE!  I piled up two plates my FIRST go around with the Asian Chicken Salad and another with spinach, romaine, pickled beets, butternut squash, broccoli salad, black olives, carrots, hard boiled eggs, raisins, sunflower seeds, cheddar and ranch - I love that you can get all those toppings at this salad bar instead of your basic iceberg, ranch, cheese, croutons that are offered at other places.   I thought it was cute how they had little factoids above certain items which was interesting. I'm sure they're more entertaining if you're waiting in a huge line but luckily, since we went there at 8, it was pretty empty.  I picked the cherries out of a muffin to eat and they were excessively sour, so I'd avoid the cherry muffins next time.  For my sister and me to eat, both with tap waters, it came out to about $21. That's pricey for what we ate, could probably make it cheaper at home, but it's cheaper than a buffet on the strip."}
{"text":"I have never been to a salad buffet and I was surprised. The salads were customized by you. What you want is what you get. While we went near closing time, we did not receive any rushed service and things were stocked."}
{"text":"We eat here probably monthly and love that you can create your own salad with lots of options. The pre-made salads are good - I like some better than others, but that's why there are choices! Love the cream of mushroom soup and the tomato soup. The baked goods are very good - but I miss the chocolate chip muffins (haven't seen those for a while).   This place is very popular for families, which means kids. I see some complaints from other reviewers about noise and mess. Granted, they sometimes need to clean up the ice cream toppings area more often and if you go to eat late the floors get a bit messy. Note to the staff: If you have customers still eating and it's not closing time yet, clean the floors.  If parents would actually monitor their kids and teach them how to respect an area shared with other people, that would be super helpful, too."}
{"text":"This place focuses on unlimited salads and soups with a nice selection of breads and pastas. The salad bar is right at the door as you walk in. They advertise 47 foot long salad bar. You don't have a plate big enough to fit everything they offer. You then pass the cash register at the end of the salad bar. this causes a bottle neck and a slow line through the salad bar. Once through, you are free to roam the rest of the buffet. The tables are well stocked and the food is delicious. Everything is labeled plainly. The only confusion is if you want seconds on the salad bar you have to go back to the beginning and follow all the first timers through. It wasn't worth the hassle.  I was impressed with the quality of the food and the customer service. The tables were bussed promptly and the restrooms were immaculate. I also got a 15% off discount just for checking in on Yelp, so remember to check in. I think this will be a regular Sunday lunch stop."}
{"text":"This place has a great salad selection, their soups are great and I love their strawberry lemonade.   Their prices are far to expensive for what they have, I only go if I can find a coupon. I cannot tell ANY difference between lunch and dinner variety other than some pineapple upside down cake. Not worth the price increase.  I cannot believe they charge extra to put some grilled chicken strips on your salad. Their pasta is mediocre and have rarely found any of them I thought was \"really good\".   Overall I like this place, they have a lot of the food that I really enjoy and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"How can you NOT love Sweet Tomatoes?!  Such a great selection of soups and salads and other goodies.  You can try and be really healthy, or you can go crazy and have pizza and ice cream and all the good stuff.  Either way, there is a great selection and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Apparently Sweet Tomatoes are Souplantation are the same thing. The selection at this Sweet Tomato seemed alot more limited than the Souplantations I've been to so I was a bit disappointed. I'd also say 90% of all their food is vegetarian. All of their pastas, pizzas, and noodle dishes were vegetarian. The only non vegetarian dishes I saw were the soups and a couple of salads so I guess this is a pretty good place to come if you're vegetarian. My favorite dishes were the lava cake and their Beef Peanut Noodle Dish (supposedly vegan so I guess the beef was fake...but I couldn't tell)."}
{"text":"Its a nice clean atmosphere with great selection. Happy that there are Gluten Free options!  Its for those days when you want a buffet, but not overkill buffet! There is always great soup and salad choices."}
{"text":"Firstly, the pictures you see on here added from the company look WAY better than what you'll really be getting, lol, let's make that clear. Anyway, when I tell you we're here all the time, I'm talking at least once a week. This is my husband's new favorite place to eat and I feel guilty suggesting eating anywhere else because I know he's trying to get his AYCE salad. It's just a large salad bar with a few soup options, dessert options, a baked potato bar, and some pasta option. It's not my favorite place but the price is reasonable and the salad is fresh. I wish they had more protein options for the salad bar other than just bacon bites so you could make a chicken Caesar salad or something but whatever, no big deal. This is really a family-friendly place and they send out coupons fairly often via email and snail mail. The wait staff/bussers are always friendly and attentive especially during the busier times. The food other than the salad is just okay, not as good as Golden Corral but on par with Old Country buffet on an off day. I always grab two large plates when coming in since I don't want to have to put my mac & cheese or my baked potato on a little plate. As for dessert, it's very hit or miss and I don't care for the ice cream but my husband loves it. My advice to you is to bring cash to leave tips because my husband and I NEVER have cash and then feel terrible when we leave. They don't give you the option to tip on your card when you first pay (you pay before you eat) but I guess they really couldn't since there's no telling who will clear off your table once you're finished. I'm giving Sweet Tomato four stars overall (food, service, cleanliness, etc) not just for the quality of food, by the way. You can't eat somewhere that often and not give credit where it's due but remember, it's a buffet so you know what you're getting yourself into."}
{"text":"It's was alright. I don't know if I'd come back again. You pay $15 bucks for a salad and not so great soup and bread. Better to go get wings and a beer somewhere else for that price. I'd enjoy that more.."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is an awesome salad bar!  Everything is fresh and rotated constantly so food isn't left out to bake like typical buffets!  Their soups are very good and are constantly changing which is nice.  Their blue cheese and ranch are to die for!  Their staff is courteous and attentive, they know how to do customer service the right way!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome like Chris A. was mentioning the Cream of Mushroom soup is the bomb....may sound nasty but tasty!! (Drools Uncontrollably) The blueberry muffins are great and every once in a while I'll find a muffin CHOCK full of sour blueberries! I dont even really like the salads i love the soups though!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I used to LOVE this place! The desserts are now terrible. The foccacia that I was addicted to is now identical to the packaged pizza mix made by Hamburger Helper.  The chicken soup noodles weren't cooked. The only thing that is still good is the salad bar itself. For the price, I'm going back to Souper Salad!"}
{"text":"Love love love! This place has the freshest food around. I mostly get take out, which actually makes two meals for me, but I like eating there also. The restaurant is really clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Endless soup and salad. 99% vegetarian options with the exception of some soups with chicken or ground beef (chili) and cheese on bread or in pasta. The dessert selections are also good. Soft serve and many delightful treats for all ages. I guess my only concern is sodium since most soups/broths tend to have high content"}
{"text":"I tried the new gluten free coconut muffin and it was very tasty. We always enjoy dinner here. The soups and salads are fresh and delicious! The desserts are very good too. We can sit and not feel rushed to leave. ST always tries new things and now they have healthier greens and other healthy choices on the salad line. I appreciate ST!!!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food where you can and enjoy friends and family at leisure. Always delish with lots of choices."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here once a week for years.  I just love this place. It is my absolute favorite place to eat in the whole wide world.    We signed up for their e-mail program and we get awesome coupons.  If you have a smart phone you can just pull them up on your phone and the cashier can scan them.  You don't have to print them out. In 2013 we used to get coupons all the time for \"2 for 1\" but it seems like they stopped making those. It was a fantastic deal.   We find coupons in the junk coupon books that are shoved in our mailbox once a week, too.   Everything is always fresh and it's usually busy there and I've never had a rude or weird employee.  They refill everything before it's even low.  This place is doing it right."}
{"text":"I don't even know why I am addicted to this place but I am. I unequivocably love Sweet Tomatoes. This buffet is great for fresh food and the ability to dine healthy if you want. I also love that our 2 year old can eat healthy for free. For salads, you can choose from pre-made salads or create your own. There is also a food theme depending on the time of the month which determines the specialty salads, soups, pasta, etc. There are usually 4-5 types of soups, baked potato, sweet potatoes, 2 types of pasta, muffins, breads, baked desserts, fruits, and ice cream. My favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup, their foccacia style sliced bread (so wonderfully garlicky) and their freaking lava cake. Their lava cake is always the end of me even when I try to eat reasonably. What is also great for you sweet-tooth people, are the servers bringing around freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Ah, sweet heaven...or should I say, sweet tomatoes..."}
{"text":"Sweet Tomatoes is a MUST when my mom's In town visiting. In fact, In a one week period, between this one and the chandler location, we hit these up at least 6 times!!! We both like eating healthy-er, and love salads and veggies, so the huge salad bar for us never gets old! (Although I don't know how healthy it is when half your salad is black olives..) The soups are also pretty good. I love the asian broth one, and any of the broccoli soups:) I went to sprouts today and bought a ton of stuff to make salads, but a sharp knife and I don't get along all that great unless there's a bloody mess involved. I'd much rather save an hr and a trip to the ER and come to Sweet Tomatoes:)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here yesterday. My friend took me here with 2 other friends after work and he treated us. It was lunch time so it was about $7 (that's what my friend told me since he paid for it).  It's mostly salads and more salads and desserts and ice cream. There's brownies and bread and pizza stuff, too. I'll probably have to come back again for a more accurate review, but I was pretty satisfied and I'd definitely come back again.   Eating here would be enough to satisfy you for the time being but you'll get hungry soon enough. I ate a lot more than I thought I could eat, but some of the salads + the right sauces were really good.  We got our plates and everything cleared pretty fast and they'd come around and take our plates when we were done so service wasn't an issue.. especially since it was buffet style. If you haven't tried Sweet Tomatoes or might not be a veggie place, give it a try anyways! It's good to try new things :0D."}
{"text":"Such a great place!! Everything was very clean. Bathrooms were also clean. Food was very good. Especially the chicken noodle soup! My fav."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of salad and salad toppings. I didn't know what to expect for my first time entering sweet tomatoes. But there is a long salad bar which you can fill your plate to your hearts desire, then you pay. Dinner is about 11$. Grab yourself a seat in a booth or table, then you can head up to their hot food bar where they have soups of many varieties as well as some tasty pastas.   Everything was pretty good. The most impressive thing about the restaurant was how fresh everything was. The vegetables seemed fresh picked and sliced, the pastas tasted like they were hot off the stove, and bread was right out of the oven.   In the end, everything was pretty good and reasonably priced. It wasn't groundbreaking or life altering in any way, but worth the trip once in a while if you want to feel healthy and not break the bank."}
{"text":"I've only been in once for a quick lunch in Tempe...we really were in a hurry, so I didn't get to check out as many things as I would have liked...I do remember looking around a little taken aback at how much there was to choose from and how good everything looked and tasted! It was fresh and either Hot or Cold...nothing was halfway to what it should have been...We'll be back...Thanks"}
{"text":"Since we have a kid who attends and lives at ASU Polytech, we like to drive down there and treat him to lunch or dinner every week or two.  His favorite place to eat near campus is Sweet Tomatoes, so we have dined at this location many, many times.  This location has a very unique decorating scheme.  It is fashioned like a farmhouse/barn as a tip of the hat to the agricultural history of south Gilbert, and it is huge compared to other Sweet Tomatoes we have visited.  The service is friendly and efficient, and the soup/salad/side choices are fresh and extensive.  Go hungry!    One word of caution:  This is a snowbird hangout during the winter season, and the 'birds seem to occupy several tables in large groups much longer than local patrons.  We were seated, ate, and left within an hour, while the older folks next to us at a table set for 10 were there when we arrived and were there when we left.  Avoid visiting at lunchtime in the winter if you can.  Second word of caution:  Although the woman's bathroom is clean, I have never visited this place when it didn't \"stink\" in there...like something is wrong with the sewer system.  I don't know where the smell is coming from, but management should make an effort to find out what is going on.    As for the food, I was surprised that they had tomatoes and lettuce in such good shape considering the recent freezes in Mexico which destroyed 80-100% of the winter crops.  Management even posted a sign apologizing for a shortage of favorites like cucumbers and zucchini, but I honestly did not notice a lack of variety.  A final word: The Club Veg coupons are better than the ones in the newspaper, so it's well-worth checking out their website and joining.  I'll be back.  It's good."}
{"text":"I was going to school out in Scottsdale for a while, a few times I came for lunch. I love salads with tons of healthy veggies. This place was not bad at all. Salad was wonderful, everything was fresh and clean. Staff was friendly, moved fast.   Some of the non- salad bar stuff was not that great. The pizza/ pasta bar was so-so. Lacked a little flavor in my opinion. Dessert was eh. They had frozen yogurt, and jello, etc.  This place was packed with old people, seemed like the hip spot for the 60+ crowd. I also saw a bible club meet up there. Interesting. AZ is kinda creepy.    Anyways this place served its purpose I ate lunch alone and this place did not make me feel awkward, so i guess its great for groups and dining solo."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but this trip they seemed to understaffed on the table bussers. Will go back in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Totally average experience, the only saving grace was the soup. The buffet had a bunch of wilted lettuce with soggy croutons when we went there for dinner. They did have croutons separately towards the end of the counter, so I didn't understand why they had to put them into the ceasar salad in the first place! I took the egg salad, the croutons and lettuce and some cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices. I hunted in vain for some grilled chicken or prawn toppings, but there was none. The seating area was good though...spacious, with comfortable bench chairs. I liked the bread and soups waaaay better than the salads. They had garlic bread and an assortment of soups including chilli soup, french onion soup, clam chowder and tomato soup. Opposite the soup counter they have a small frozen yogurt vending machine. All in all, an overpriced eating experience, and I wasn't even satisfied with what I got. I don't think I am coming back here unless someone else is paying :P"}
{"text":"As long as your OK with the whole buffet self service concept, this restaurants does a nice job of serving fresh fruits and vegetables on their salad bar, and a nice selection of soups, pastas and pizza on their hot buffet line. Deserts are good and this is an excellent place for a family with children. I recently brought 5 business associates here for something different from what we usually do, and everyone really enjoyed the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite buffet restaurant! I love their salad bar, which has so much to offer including the dressings! There is also a soup bar...awesome \"Chicken Chili Soup, and Black Bean Chili\" atmosphere is good and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years (my first Vegas apartment is literally across the street.)    I think that it's great for what it is.   If you walk in knowing it's a convenience fast restaurant you can look past the slightly messy salad bar, etc.  And I absolutely LOVE the fact that they label everything with gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, etc.  It makes it so easy for me to choose what I want without questioning what's in it.   Also,  they have great dressings.   Like I would drink them they're so good.     Overall, great cheap meal that is mostly good for you."}
{"text":"The regular food is, well... okay. But frankly, for the same money you can go to the store and get the salad fixings you like, and it will last you a week.  HOWEVER, you have to go in on Sunday mornings. Great breakfest buffet. I especially like this because I don't like cooking breakfast. I'm tired and I'm hungry - who wants to mix waffle batter half asleep?  But I am saying it's bad for kids so you leave them at home. I hate children, and I hate yours more. Buy them a cage before you go out to places I suggest!"}
{"text":"CHEAP HEALTHY FOOD!  That's all I can say!  It's very difficult to find a place where you can get cheap healthy food.  It's great!  They definitely keep the buffet nice and presentable.  I'm a germ-a-phob so little spillings or drips on the sides...those things and I do not jive.   You need to try this place.   Just FYI, I am also not a health eater.  But this place, I do love...and I will go to again..."}
{"text":"March 6, 2016 2:30pm. 2 people for a late lunch  Ambiance: 3 stars* Food: 5 stars Service: always with a smile & Thank You! 5 stars!   First, I have to say that when I lived in Henderson, we would go here for lunch or dinner at least once a week! A healthier alternative of a buffet style salad bar with fresh made soups and pastas, and you can't beat the price!  Ambiance: When you walk in, a full salad bar is laid out for you ingredient by ingredient. You pick up a tray and a plate, and you start adding as much or as little of everything as you like. Everything is fresh! Nothing frozen here! Anywhere from six to eight kinds of dressing for the salad, as well as toppers galore! You are asked what you would like to drink, I highly recommend the fresh made strawberry lemonade. It's amazing! You're given your cup and you seat yourself in a style that looks similar to a Denny's, but don't be off by the ambiance! It's well worth it for the food! Also, the employees work their butts off to bus tables full of piles and piles of dishes; so if you go there, please leave them a tip, as they've worked so hard for it!  Food:  With every kind of lettuce and salad mix you can imagine, you make your way down a long aisle that is full of toppers from red kidney beans, to pasta salads, julienned carrots and zucchini, etc! Even stuff you never thought of putting on a salad, they have available! It's amazing!   You then make your way to the soup bar, with about 6 soups made fresh throughout the day. There is something for every taste and palate. You have your choice of baked potatoes, various different breads, and multiple pasta dishes as well!  To top it off, if you've not stuffed yourself to the gills, they have a frozen yogurt machine with any kind of topping you can imagine, including hot fudge or hot caramel sauce to go on top of it!  My husband and I went in for lunch today, and paid $9.99 each to stuff ourselves with something that was a healthier alternative to most buffets here in Vegas or Henderson. I feel good about my choices when I go here!  I hope someday soon Reno will have their very own Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Horribly regret coming to this place, all the veggies for the salad were dry and bitter. I should have asked for a refund then, but I pushed on... realizing that this is one of those gluten free places I quickly learned that gluten is essential in a lot of dishes cause everything tasted awful... the only thing good about this place was when I left, never to return again."}
{"text":"The salad bar was very clean and well stocked. An employee helped us get our trays to a table (which was also clean). The drink station \"situation\" could use some improvements. Customers can't get by each other and it's right next to the ice cream station. 2 very busy areas. I saw customers getting frustrated while waiting for each station. Our table wasn't bused until we were about ready to leave. But all in all a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian, this is a great place to eat!  However, if you are eating on a dairy-free diet, the selection is not AS great.  When I went, all the mixed salads had dairy in them, as well as many of the entrees and soups.  And the dessert (soft serve) had dairy as well!  I was still able to eat a lot, but more entree selections without dairy would have been nice.  My favorites were the blueberry muffins and cornbread.  Also -- they didn't serve hot chocolate chip cookies?! I was so sad."}
{"text":"I like Sweet Tomatoes, although some do not like it, but if you like a good, big, salad bar then you will like these places. They have friendly staff and clean restaurants. They have a yelp deal also :) - I would recommend them to everyone, they are good for casual and family dining."}
{"text":"I have been going to this exact  Sweet tomatoes since I was around 3 years old. Not exaggerating ! This is my first time returning here since I've had a Yelp account so I feel I need  to review it!    First let me say that I am not a huge fan of buffets typically. However, when it comes to this Sweet tomatoes I am all in! When you first walk in there is an array of freshly made salads I recommend the Caesar it is wonderful! You can also make your own salad with everything you could think of on it if you want to be creative! The renovation they did on this specific location is lovely. I really like how it is more modern up now. Next thing to try is the delicious variety of soups . My all time favorite thing is how they have a set up to make your own baked potato. My father makes the best so I love when we go together because I get to year a scrumptious loaded up potato!     The best thing about this Sweet Tomato is the staff is very kind and professional it seems like they really care about your experience.   Thanks Sweet Tomato! Until Next time!"}
{"text":"We recently took out of town family for lunch, much later we discovered that my cousin had lost her drivers license, was frantic since she needed it to board the plane. Placed a call, and was surprised that they had found it. Not only was her license in her card holder, but her credit card and money was all there. So after the big collective sigh of relief, we were pleased that we got to eat another delicious meal when we went to pick up the license. So please patronize this honest establishment, and enjoy all the freshly made foods, salads, soups, chili, and my favorite, the wild blueberry muffins."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I are regulars at the Sweet Tomatoes in Tempe on Southern & McClintock. We were just there a few days ago & it was wonderful. Went to this location and could barely eat the food. We both now feel sick. Both of our stomachs hurt, we are nauseous. The energy, lighting and cleanliness was awful. Looked like the food was sitting out all day. This location really needs to learn a thing or two from the Tempe location. Unfortunately, we will not be returning to this location.. :("}
{"text":"So, yea. Kelly's review has me more than a little concerned.  Thinking we won't go back for awhile. Most likely quite awhile.  I'd rather be sure they have that crap taken care of.  Literally.  But here's why we'll still end up going back.  It's all about 3 things.  It's conveniently located.  It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.  ALL the time.    Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate."}
{"text":"Probably won't go back. The food was just whatever and the service was poor. They ran out of many items including brownies, baked potatoes, and bread and they didn't restock until I was leaving. And they also completely ran out of cookies and weren't planning on making more. The salad bar was decent, but everything else wasn't so great. So if you want strictly salad then it's worth a try, otherwise don't bother. Also make sure you look for coupons online before going. I registered on their website and got emailed a buy one get one meal, so it was just about $12.00 for two people."}
{"text":"I generally prefer buffets with a wide variety of food overs ones with a few specialties. That said, the salads here are quite nice and great to customize, the vegetables seemed fresh and the dressings and croutons very good. The soups on offer the day we came, cush as chili and chicken pot pie soup, were tasty as well. Desert was nothing special, just soft serve and a couple types of fruit. Still, I was satisfied and I'll certainly come back again."}
{"text":"Wow I have to say the food was really good this time. And if you go between 2-5 it's discounted with a drink (maybe just senior rate not sure) Everything was hot and fresh and good. The last time we weren't too happy with the food and everything seemed to not be as fresh. Now I am actually wanting to go back again soon  . I hope nothing changes by the time we go again. So many choices when you don't eat meat. Plus the soups we're really good. The Tomatoe soup and mushroom soup was very good. I really enjoyed both. Looking forward to going back keep it fresh Sweet Tomatoes!!"}
{"text":"I think by now everyone has tried a sweet tomatoes at one time or another. We use to go to this one all the time when we lived closer to it, It was always one of our favorite salad places, We think it is a better deal of course when you can find a coupon to go because their regular prices have gone up so much over the years, As with anything , We love the salad choices, I just love their oriental salad I think it is a peanut sauce,. its so good! And the soups are amazing. The focaccia I think it is called which comes out like a pizza is go good especially when it first comes out!  The soups seem to change but everything else is about the same everyday, We would go back to this location, it seems to be pretty consistent. As for service sometimes they clean the table pretty fast depending on how busy they are. Over all it is always pretty good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years. I forgot about it, then I drove by and decided to check it out again. I brought my son, he loves salad, so first we dig into some salads, I really like that you can make salad however you want. They have tons of different toppings, and their dressing selection is nice too. After salad, we tried the pasta. The pasta was just ok. Really wasn't much flavor, so then I tried a muffin and bread. Those were really good and were nice and moist. The. For dessert they had some options from muffins, ice cream, and pudding. I had a tiny cone and it was good as well. The staff isn't friendly at all. Not once was I greeted, and the guy who rang me up didn't say one word to me besides asked if I wanted a drink with that. Then the lady who gets the plates came by, I tried to make eye contact and I said thank you. Not one look or word from her either. I'll be back nonetheless, the food is good."}
{"text":"Here's what my receipt says:  =================== SWEET TOMATOES * SALAD * SOUPS * BAKERY  10/3/08 12:03 PM 00000001#8427    **01  LUNCH  $8.19 TAX $.66 TOTAL $8.85 ===================  As you can see, it says nothing that any Yelper would like to know, except for the cost of lunch. What was lunch? I went with the salad - just the salad - from the gigantic salad bar. No drink. Only water. So to me, that's one expensive salad. Sure, they have plenty to pile high on your plate, but I left feeling that I could make the very same salad for 1/2 the cost.   Also, if you're in line in front of regulars on the lunch rush, be prepared to have your personal space invaded. If you're not moving fast enough, they will likely just push you forward with their own trays. Seriously. I think I managed to throw together a pretty decent salad, but the fear of the lady with the big-lady-bag scared me to the register.   I have no reason to go back."}
{"text":"New weekend breakfast buffet everything below average. Pre cooked bacon cold, cold potatoes Mexican eggs tortillas soggy and barely warm. Buttermilk biscuits suitable for hockey pucks, gravy with weeks supply of salt. Coffee was good, and water was free. For $10 not worth it lots of places doing much better won't be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is that of a cafeteria. Luckily not very crowded when we went but I can imagine it gets very noisy. The salad was good, soup was good (not great) and the bread was not that great. Overall, Sweet Tomatoes is ok for the price, but I can go to a good Chinese buffet for less money and get more selection."}
{"text":"Came in late after a workout. The staff was helpful but the salad bar wasn't as stocked as other locations. The serve we had was amazing and the cashier was very nice.   The salad you create at sweet tomatoes is always a mound and the pastries are always on point."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with sweet tomatoes! Solid and consistent. The salad selection and sides make this place go. I love the cheese bread by its always fresh."}
{"text":"So I have been a sweet tomatoes fan since I was in high school. It definitely has problems, but ever since all of the souper salads around us closed this has really been our only option for a salad buffet.   First off, the prices are really high but they give coupons away like crazy. I get an email pretty much every week, and they are all over the newspapers....just lower the prices already!!! Even with the coupons the price of a meal for a family is much too high for the food that you get, which brings me to my huge problem with the place. Why is there no meat for the salads? Even souper salad had ham and turkey and their prices were much, much lower.   The dessert options are laughable, it's usually oranges and some jello. It reeks of no effort at all and looks sorry. They do offer ice cream but I'm not a fan. Some other options would be appreciated. The service is usually very good and the warm cookies that are brought around are usually delicious.   If Sweet Tomatoes added meat to their menu and lowered the prices, I would be there more often. I don't foresee this happening but it's nice to dream. BTW I am so glad that this place didn't turn into that \"Field Kitchen\" chain that they tried with some other locations. That sounded like a disaster."}
{"text":"I love sweet Tomatoes  their salad bar is the best and believe you me I am a huge fan blue cheese and theirs is delicious.  I do wish they would do the lobster bisque soup more. Their blueberry muffins are always warm and delicious."}
{"text":"This place has great salads.  Clean, efficient compared to other sweet tomatoes in the area."}
{"text":"Literally the best service I have experienced in a very long time. That is why this restaurant is getting 5 stars!! The food would still be 4 though. It was awesome. Honestly, I prob wouldnt go here unless I had the same coupon I used this time. It was dinner and a drink for $9.99 or something like that. The amount of money was worth the food there. I wouldnt pay $12+. The salad bar is very good and fresh. The baked potatoes never fail and the mac and cheese is awesome! The idea of going here came from me and my friend wanting to go to cici's pizza but deciding that we were looking for something with alittle more quality. This was a great choice for us. We were able to get our fix of \"pizza\" with the delicious foccatia bread which tasted like a yummy slice of sicilian pizza. I prob wont come here often because it is impossible not to over eat!!"}
{"text":"For getting a healthy dinner that's quick and inexpensive, you can't get much better than this place. Loyal customer here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying. I hate buffets. Sweet tomatoes was a refreshing change. I really enjoyed the soups and the salads."}
{"text":"My sweet hubby and I went to lunch here the other day for something different since we both had never been before. I noticed a coupon in the mail which was two for $18.99 and included unlimited drinks so we used it.   This is a smaller location than most and is funny how it is set up with the salad bar near the front entrance. Anyhow it was super clean and the nice and cool air conditioning was a super treat for it being such a hot day outside.  We really enjoyed the items they had to offer especially the fresh strawberry lemonade in which we could have all we wanted.  This is a buffet/AYCE establishment and they boast that everything is homemade.  What we had:  Salad Chili broccoli and cheese soup baked potato w/cheese, sour cream and chives cheese bread sourdough bread macaroni and cheese pasta (cold) pasta (hot) blueberry muffins cornbread strawberry lemonade dessert chocolate frozen yogurt sundae with hot fudge and caramel   We really enjoyed it, the food is good however I grew up in San Diego where we had the soup plantation which was Amazing with quality food!  We will be back for sure because my sweet husband really liked it more than he thought he would.  The only annoying factor is that the table next to us was filled with staff eating on their breaks including the Manager. They were loud, laughing and goofing off which turned me off a bit.  The staff who clears plates off of the table was not on their game. While we ate dessert we still had our plates from our meal still on the table stacked up. The Manager walked pass our table several times as well and did not seem to care as he was more interested in hanging out with his staff who were on breaks eating hanging out in a booth."}
{"text":"I really like Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar is extensive, with a good variety of vegetables and some premade salads that are tasty. The soups are pretty good, the breads are nice, and the other sides, like mac and cheese, are fine. I do like their soft serve ice cream and warm desserts a lot. I eat more dessert than I should!  The food isn't the best I've ever had, but it's a good concept, the price is fair, and it's easy to find coupons so the cost is more reasonable. Sweet Tomatoes is a good way to eat a little more healthy if you're dining out.  Don't go in expecting the meal of your life; go in because the food is lighter and healthier and pretty reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We went to Sweet Tomatoes last Monday and were pleasantly surprised to see the hard boiled eggs have returned and that they had a tostada special. The tostada was actually very good. The chicken was moist and tender and the vegetables in the fajita mix were very flavorful. There was so much of the delicious juice that the hard shell tostada softened. So last night I suggested we revisit Sweet Tomatoes to take advantage of the tostada special before it ended. What a mistake! Unlike Monday's experience the chicken was tough, dry and tasteless. The vegetable mix had no juice or liquid at all and no flavor either. It was inedible. We've been going to this Sweet Tomatoes for years and normally it's pretty good, not necessarily consistent but pretty good. Last night was an exception that I hope will not be repeated. We'll return but it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Pretty good, food is fresh and well stocked. Could have used a few more option but my kids loved it. Family friendly environment"}
{"text":"We love it here and vist multiple times when we are in town.  Loads of fresh vegetables and  soups. They list nutritional info and if vegetarian or vegan on each item which is fanrastic. They typically have a vegan soup and prepared side. This location has baked sweet potatoes along with baken white potatoes.  Lots of natural light in the dining area. A great value and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"They get a well deserved 5 stars in their space.  They served 75 of us with a smile in and out in an hour.  The servers worked hard and fast!!! It was great to see everything else was well done to sweet tomatoes standards and consistency!!!"}
{"text":"Healthy meets affordable!   I love to come here because it's all you can eat soup and salad (They also have pasta dishes and a few other items) and you can usually find really good deals especially checking in through Yelp! I usually pay $8-$10 which isn't bad."}
{"text":"Surprised that this place was rather nice inside given the seedy location by Metro.  Parking was decent.  Staff were friendly.  Food options were as good or better than other S.T. locations I've visited in recent months.  Heck, I might have to go back."}
{"text":"Nice, clean & more modern looking location here.  Food is pretty much the same as other locations, with parking being a challenge sometimes due to adjacent restaurants.  Buffet prices aren't bad, but the soda fee is a ripoff."}
{"text":"Soup, salads, baked potato & more.  Fair price.  Fairly clean place.  Lot of riff-raff here, but it is a buffet and they seem to be a riff-raff magnet I suppose.  I thought the skew towards healthier options would be a deterrent but I guess not.  Maybe if I find one of these in a more upscale zip code the ambiance will be better, because it is hard to use the same tongs as some of the folks you see in here!    Snobbery aside, the food is rather average, but the convenience & variety are certainly a plus."}
{"text":"Our family loves coming to this sweet tomatoes specifically for a few reasons.   The bathrooms are always clean. There is always someone walking around cleaning and making sure everyone is ok.  They have high chairs (believe it or not some places do not )  And their food is never out on the line . They always restock. We have never had an issue here. The only one bad thing i would say if I had to is that if it's really packed and there is nowhere to sit . They still let people come down the line and grab their food instead of stopping it so u can get all the way to paying with no tables available. If you have children this could be a sucky situation."}
{"text":"It's Sweet Tomatoes, so you know what you're getting:   A nice mix of premade salads, build your own salads, along with soups, breads, pastas and some frozen yogurt.  This particular location is a little weirdly laid out, and somehow seems like it has fewer options (although I know it doesn't). It's also the oldest Sweet Tomatoes I have seen in the Valley and might be a little worse for wear.  Last but not least: I am not into the Elementary School cafeteria flavors as of late. Maybe I didn't notice before? I still LOVE the salad (can't really mess that up). But the pastas are bland, as is the \"pizza bread\".  So here's some Level up Hacking advice for you - Use the salad bar to up the taste quotient of your food. Mac and Cheese? Head over to the potatoes and dump some of that tasty shredded cheddar in there (you'll thank me). I think if you come up with ways to jazz things up, it'll do just fine.   So this spot is A-OK, if you want to stop in for something a little healthier for lunch/dinner. Meh C+"}
{"text":"Well..gave this restaurant another chance. I shouldn't have. The choice of food wasn't that great. The pizza for the kids looked like the cheesy bread sticks from Pizza Hut. The soups were bland and as was the pasta. To top it all off. It was a bit overpriced for a mediocre salad bar. At least the kids were only 3.49."}
{"text":"We have frequented Sweet Tomatoes in the past but recently they've jacked up their prices significantly making this a non-starter for us. We thought that it was worth the family price before but this recent hike in price is too steep for the return. If you want to try to dig around for coupons then there are some discounts available but they've really made it difficult. I'm afraid that they've lost us."}
{"text":"LOCATION/PARKING: Free standing restaurant in a busy shopping area. Parking was full when my mom and I went for lunch. It looked like a very popular spot among the locals. I've been to the one in Atlanta years ago and loved it.   ATMOSPHERE: Casual. Laid back buffet style. No wait at all when we went during the week at lunch time. Clean and plenty of places to sit.   MENU: Two sides of self service salad bar as you first walk in. Variety of fresh salads, pasta and toppings. My favorite is the strawberry fields salad but I also love creating my own salad.  The next room offers soups, bake goods and dessert. My favorite was the coconut muffin. It was so moist,  melt in your mouth and beyond delicious. The key to the recipe was all fresh ingredients. There is also a self service drink island in the middle of the restaurant with enough choices to quench everyone's thirst. They offer teas, coffee, sodas, lemonade. If you're in the mood for soup and salad, this is the place to hit.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: Excellent. The staff was very nice. The manager was awesome and we had a chance to chat with him briefly."}
{"text":"This place has consistently good salad, soup, and food and is a good healthy place to take the family esp. to get the kids used to eating their veggies!  My wife and I are very happy dining here and it is a good value esp. if you are on their email list and get their coupons.  The only trouble you might have is eating too much!  Eat the right amount and feel good after leaving here because you just had a healthy meal.  As far as buffets like this go, this is one of the best ones of its type.  Much better than the competition!  The only reason we give it 4 stars is because there could be more variety with some of the non-salad food and desserts.  Other than that, it is wonderful salad dining experience."}
{"text":"So after a few weeks of Yelping and dining out everywhere I decided to eat a wholesome meal. My girlfriends daughter recommended this place. I was hesitant as Im a meat potatoes & seafood guy  but agreed to give it a shot.  I made a huge plate of salad without. Realizing there was a soup/chilli side that comes with deserts.  Dont fill up on the salad side! I did and had to force down some chilli, some cream of  broccoli and a cookie.   I will be happy to go back the next time I get a healthy urge and I know my GF and her daughter will be happy to join me."}
{"text":"There needs to be more healthy places!  I get all my greens for the day here and I also get the search soup pizza"}
{"text":"The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Favorite buffet of all times.  Boyfriend and I love coming here for lunch, everything is delicious and very clean."}
{"text":"Good food and at a good price. Great for lunch and eating light. Build a salad and good soups. My son loves the endless mac and cheese. I love the blueberry muffin and chocolate muffins / brownie."}
{"text":"I guess that I'm a fan of Sweet Tomatoes. It is a good meal for the price!   They email me coupons so we feel like we get a deal, each month they release new signature items and it's an all you can eat salad bar with soup and more. We couldn't prep all the things we love on our salads and eat for the price we end up paying.   The staff is attentive in clearing our plates as we finish them and nice so we usually leave them tips (yes, it's okay to tip someone working hard in a food establishment).  The only downside can be other patrons but you have to look past that when diniing at a buffet (it can be quite annoying or disturbing sometimes).  No matter what we will be back to Sweet Tomatoes for a \"healthy: meal."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with Sweet Tomatoes today! There was only one person refilling salad items. The romaine lettuce was low, the lettuce looked like they were old or got frozen. We were excited that there was clam chowder; however, it was awful. It was like they may have opened a big can (I have no problem with that) watered it down to stretch it and add flour. It just tasted like flour. The other soups weren't any better. In fact, everything hot that we tried didn't taste good...except for the baked potato. They were very short handed...besides the one lady doing the salad, there was only one cashier, and one waitress that we could see. Our table was never cleaned off in between rounds."}
{"text":"It's comical watching folks see how high they can pile food on one plate. Who doesn't know there's no limit to the number of times you can go back for more?  One school of thought says it's better to visit the line a few times to experiment with tasteful combinations instead of lumping ingredients together in a single homogenized heap.  The heap approach is adventurous. It can result in a legendary blend, something like how the Cobb--or even Caesar!--salad was invented.  Why delay gratification when you can gorge yourself immediately on a single heaping monument?  The arrangement of the buffet line lends itself to erecting your own fortress of salad-tude.  Build a symmetrical cone or bulging mound.  At the end near the door, start with a foundation of leafy greens, followed by chunky morsels of broccoli and cauliflower to support your slices & strips of veggies such as celery, carrots, squash, & cucumber. Throw in some Jell-O to hold it all together. Carefully scoop on peas & beans so they won't roll off the pile.  Apply generous dollops of dressing to form a cohesive mortar to hold the whole mish-mosh in place. Mix your favorite dressings in zany combinations such as bleu cheese, thousand Island, & ranch. Garnish the tidy shambles with shredded cheese, croutons and tasty flecks of textured protein, aka \"bacon\" bits. Add a decorative necklace of cherry tomatoes around the edge.  Every item is labeled either vegetarian, vegan, or gluten free.  Do people really go to a salad bar to \"eat healthy\"?  They're gonna chow down regardless.  Don't kid yourself.  All the runny creams and sauces, the yummy garnishes have as many fats and calories as a Big Mac.  At the start of the feeding frenzy it's fairly peaceful.  But as the lunch rush builds, the din sounds like a cell block disturbance, making it so hectic & stressful that satisfaction comes only when you beat a hasty retreat out the side door.  I was about to leave a dollar for the table server when it occurred to me that when there's an orgy of gluttony greed can't be far behind.  Someone would snatch that girl's dollar.  Plate pilers are not to be trusted. On the way out I gave her the dollar personally.   I awarded an extra star because many of the offerings are fresh & tasty."}
{"text":"Start your review...I don't go to the \"salad places\" too often. Sweet Tomatoes is one of the few healthy food joints that I actually go to and will continue to return. Their food is always fresh and their servers are always polite. I have never had a negative experience at this location and I've even had the manager, and asked if everything was okay.  The only thing that has changed is a no longer have an area for the add-ons like chicken and other items. It used to be that you could pay a couple dollars more and put check in on your salad but they remove that option it look like. Me being a meat eater, I always look for a protein substance to put on my salad. However even without this I found the food to be good.  I had several different types of salads along with the tuna salad. It always good and I would highly suggest going here. It's a nice alternative to pizza, or burgers."}
{"text":"I love sweet tomatoes when I feel the need of being healthy. And then, it beats the point cause it's all you can eat! The prices are great for buffet! And they have good soup and pasta. My favorite though is making my own salad. They have fresh ingredients and really yummy dressings. If you can't choose, you can have all different kinds! The interior is really nice and clean. I like going here with my family. Their dessert is good too. Love the fudge brownies and little ice cream cones!!!! Mm mm mmmmm."}
{"text":"Whoever came up with this concept is genius. All you can eat salad, pasta, soup, and dessert bar for cheap. Like how can you get any better then that?! Their salad ingredients are super fresh. You start by going down the line to either an already made salad or create your own. You then pay for the meal and you enter the world of yummy food galore. You truly can't complain about this place unless you made your own salad concoction and have no idea what you put in it. Other than that, the soups are always hot and tasty and the pasta hits the spot. Don't forget to get an ice cream cone on your way out, they really are a treat! I love all things sweet and I definitely love tomatoes. Yay for sweet tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Last time. Too many other choices for a quick salad, soup, etc. these days. Gets dirtier every time. Today I commented to the cashier that the silverware container was looking a little grimy. He replied, \"I know. It's hard to clean.\" Umm, just take out the silverware and wipe it down. Then he offers me a large take-out cup, as the first two plastic ones seemed less than sparking clean. Should have asked for refund and left at that point. Here's the rest of the rundown, as I was so hungry, I stupidly stayed. Food mediocre. Salad okay, but most soups looked overly thick and sticky like when sitting too long and too much liquid has evaporated. (This was at 2:00pm.) Had chicken soup. Broth super salty and what at first seemed like a lot of white-meat chicken turned out to be hard, fatty bits. Only other thing I tried today was bbq chicken pizza. Probably pretty good when fresh. This one tasted so dry, I wondered if it had been made today. Truly thinking foods may be being reheated next day. It was actually that bad. Again, last time for me."}
{"text":"Normally I like this place but today it wasn't as good. Numerous items had acumalated water in the buttom of their containers, which left you with watered down salad dressing and leaving your plate with water at the bottom."}
{"text":"I like Sweet Tomatoes.  Especially when I utilize my email coupons and get a deal on dinner. Well, in fact i dont go to sweet tomatoes without my coupons.  When I got a good craving for salad and soup, this hands down the place to come. Their chicken noodle soup is a little bland for me, but once I add salt I am good to go and love this stuff. The potato leek soup is also very tasty. And when they have thier lentil and spinach soup I am a fan of that too. However their tomato soup is KILLER. I mean to die for. It basically demolishes anything else on their menu. I want some now just thinking about it.  If you are going here with a die hard meat eater, skip this place. For veggie lovers only. And every month, they have a new \"flavor\" or featured item so the soups and premade salads always vary.  Next time you are there, get a baked potato and top with their chili and some shredded cheese. Pure yummy goodness.  and you cant go wrong with their foccacia bread sticks. especially dipped in some yummy soup."}
{"text":"Fresh good food. The staff are ALWAYS friendly even offering extra cups of coffee or cookies. The soups are delicious and the option of potatoes or pasta is nice. I know it's a salad place but the fresh pizza is a treat.  We go here at least twice a month."}
{"text":"It's a good one - big, lots of parking and seating, and TONS of selection!  Went here a couple of weeks ago while visiting Phoenix!  All Sweet Tomatoes (aka \"Souplantation\") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.  You know what you're going to get -- SALAD, SOUP, PASTA, and MUFFINS - done.  It's not good for a diet, you know that.  Too much temptation.  Hint: If you are on a diet, DO NOT GO TO ANY BUFFETS.   Pssst...here is a secret: If you have one plate, you will not gain wait and instead, pounds will shed.  They keep everything well monitored and maintained so it's always fresh.  I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat salad bar that's kept fresh!  One extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla, and the chocolate, are AWESOME!"}
{"text":"It's a newer location, but smaller and less variety.  All Sweet Tomatoes (aka \"Souplantation\") are good in my book, always consistent and fresh.

I'm a fan of a good all-you-can-eat (AYCE) salad bar that's kept just like this, fresh and clean!  While this location is just more than a year or so old, it has about 2/3 the salad bar, and about 1/2 the amount of variety of soups, breads, muffins, etc., compared to most other ST's that I've been to.  Q:  Is less more? A: Nahh.  One extra item just to throw a couple of more hundred calories at ya -- non-fat Dreyers Ice cream.  Both the vanilla and the chocolate are AWESOME!"}

{"text":"Oink! Oink!  While it isn't the largest selection of items I've seen - the presentation is really nice.  They have smaller stations set apart for the salads, desserts, breads/muffins, soups, and drinks -- so you don't have the big line-up going on.  If you are a little piggy like me with multiple trips, this is efficient!  The server/attendent was hilarious (didn't catch his name, bad Yelper...whack on my hand).  He made lots of jokes as he drove a big cart on wheels \"Mexican driver coming thru\", a second cart a few mins later \"Another cart coming thru, same mexican driver\".  Had the whole section in stitches!  Later, when speaking to him at my table, I found him to be a very pleasant and kind man...with a super positive attitude (I mean, who is this happy?).  Located in the lovely and central Desert Ridge shopping center, the food is really kept fresh.  This location has a slightly different design than others; a warehouse open-style, with glass and framing inside, and very tall ceilings.  I like it!  Good, especially, if you are claustrophobic...as well as \"starvin' like Marvin\"."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but good value for the family of all ages 12 - 83.  Its well managed, managers on the floor directing the flow.  The food particularly good for our Friday night dinner.  Fresh salads and toppings, sweet potatoes and six soups.  The praline bread pudding was a big hit.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I liked the salad fixings, but the whole experience was lacking. After we payed $14.00 each  for our self serve salads, we served up some soup and chili.  The chili was not flavourful unless you count sugar as a flavour.  The zucchini soup was good.    The pasta was awful.  I wish I'd skipped that.  We did not have dessert. It's not romantic.  It's noisy. It's messy.   Great for families."}
{"text":"Haven't been to one of these restaurants in a while, and I forgot how much of a selection they offer! I walked in and and they have trays and large plates stacked for you to take. There's two sides of a long salad bar with pre-made salads and build your own. A large selection of choices from greens to pasta salads and toppings and dressings. At the end of the salad bar waits the cashier and rings you up for either lunch or dinner (it's a set price so go for it!)  Take your seat and they have a drink station that offers teas, sodas, juiced and even milk!  Another section offers hot soups and muffins and breads and even build your own baked potatoes! Also two different types of macaroni and cheese dishes! Their dessert selection offers several different choices but their chocolate lava cake is fabulous, and throw in some of their soft serve and I'm a happy girl!  Workers come around and clean up your dishes after you so don't worry about having to slop it anywhere!"}
{"text":"I love Sweet Tomatoes.  Where else can you delude yourself you are eating \"just a salad\"  but as you prepare your healthy greenery and feel smug as you sit down the wafting aroma of baked goods and pizza hit you.  So then you add your weight in muffins and real butter but hey - it's just a salad right?  The salad is terrific.  A wonderful selection of greens and veggies that are always fresh and the area clean.  No easy task.  It is a little pricey when you consider it's just a salad but hey - someone else cut it up and has it ready for you to heap on your plate(s).  That makes it worthwhile enough.  Live the fat-free honey mustard dressing.  Then there are freshly baked blueberry muffins - did I mention that? They are heaven on a plate especially when slathered in Land O'Lakes butter.  But hey - it's just a salad."}
{"text":"I love going to Sweet Tomatoes! You can fill up on healthy foods and the taste and flavor is awesome! Their partner in California is Soup Plantation. The choices are varied and delicious....We will always be a fan of Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"The staff is great! Very friendly and they keep up with their guest. I wish they served clam chowder here but you can't win 'em all."}
{"text":"Cheap and great all you can eat salad buffet. All kinds of salads, sauces, pasta. I really enjoyed the mushroom soup they had and the baked potatoes. However, there are a lot of kids. The prices are 3.99 for ages 2-6 and 5.99 for older children making this a very popular place for families. This is an amazing place to eat if you're looking to eat healthy."}
{"text":"Felt like eating a lot of carbs so we decided to come here for lunch. Amazing service. The bussers were absolutely amazing. They came around asking if we needed our drinks filled and taking away any plates that we didn't want anymore. All the surfaces were clean and neat. The chocolate muffins are by far my favorite thing here."}
{"text":"A little dumpy inside but the food was fresh and the workers very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Not only is this place over priced but multiple plates were dirty, It didn't seem like anyone was keeping the buffet area clean, and the employee clearing the plates in the dining room was so rude. I was sitting there waiting for my son to finishing eating and I was on my phone dealing with something important. The worker decides to come over and wants to take my dishes and tray away..because I was BUSY and didn't acknowledge her she rudely waives her hand right in front of my face and says are you done. I'm like ...really and she's says ..well you didn't answer me.. First of all  I'm in the middle of the something and I shouldn't haven't been interrupted and secondly what your doing isn't important to me .She continues to pile up all the dishes in the center of the table on the tray while we were still sitting there and wanted to remove everything all at once..I felt so uncomfortable and I immediately got up and left. She was rude and I felt so disrespected that I went to find the manger to let her know what just happened and all she tells me is SORRY..just...a simply sorry ..I will never come back !!!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I didn't think I would but I love their soups... since I am a soup fan lol.  I wouldn't say this is the best quality food but if you like soup like me you should come here, they have a variety of soups to choose from.   Happy yelping xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Ack. I don't know why my brain tells me every once in a while that this place is a good idea.  After spending nearly $30 on my husband, toddler and I, I get irritated that basically a soup and salad buffet is way too expensive.  Though they have a good variety of soups, and salads, I can't justify the price.  Other items that are available are slices of pizza, sweet potato and baked potatoes, 3 pasta selections hiding in the corner and appear to have been sitting there under the heat lamp for days.  They really need to either cook smaller portions or replenish them every so often instead of leaving it in there to crust up.  They also have muffins and a dessert bar.  Again, I don't know why out of all the selections in Desert Ridge made me chose this place. I'm pretty sure I told myself that I'd never eat here again the last time I was here. So I say it again....I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the quality of ,the food. My Cesar salad actually tasted watered down. My booth was dirty. The seats had hand prints and the seat back was dirty as well. Not happy with this experience at all, especially for the price I paid. Not a good dinner date with my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I had been in a soup and salad state of mind for a few weeks and I finally came here to quench my thirst.   We came when they opened around 11AM on Sunday and were surprised by how crowded they were. The sign said they opened at 9AM, so that might account for the line that formed outside the restaurant when they opened. They might want to update the signage for convenience. The salad bar was clean and had lots of options. The one thing I enjoy about Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation is the consistency. They are all pretty much the same and you find the same favorites from restaurant to restaurant with the addition of the monthly specials they have.   Service was friendly and most importantly, staff cleared plates and cups regularly to avoid pile accumulating on tables. They have a huge selection of drinks, which I find important since I like variety. Be sure to look out for coupons online or in the paper."}
{"text":"This is a typical Sweet Tomatoes location. Not my favorite around town, but they have pretty fast and friendly service. The food line is well-maintained, which is important for a buffet. They cleared plates pretty quickly and the service was friendly.   They have all the typical salad and soup selections that you come to expect at Sweet Tomatoes. They were especially busy on the day we came here for a local fundraiser and they were really able to keep up with the barrage of people that all came in at the same time and were very accommodating.   Definitely a good option in the Henderson as far as chain restaurants go."}
{"text":"We stopped there for a late lunch.  Although it was not very busy, the one waitress saw fit to take her broom and pan and sweep around the tables where people were dining.  My husband was eating his dessert and one of the workers reached over his shoulder to take away his dinner plate.  She wanted to take mine as well and I told her no.  I can see being efficient but good judgement goes with it.  Who wants to dine when someone is cleaning up almost under your feet.  The waitresses have no manners at all when it comes to taking your plates away.  They have just raised their prices as well.  I think I will dine elsewhere....as they say you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with two very nice ladies and a beautiful baby. The atmosphere was good and accommodations for the baby was good too. They frequently checked on us and brought fresh warm chocolate cookies to our table. I will go back again."}
{"text":"healthy choice. great bang for your buck. cheap place to get lots of healthy salad and food. always fresh and good. staff always helpful and on par. thanks again for a great experience."}
{"text":"Not good.  $10 for lunch, eat all you can, soda $3.  Everything is below average and yet, it's busy. Marie Calendar is a better choice for soup and salad."}
{"text":"All the Sweet Tomatoes are similar  in lay out and the food will change with the seasons. I would call them a salad buffet even though they do have other thinks offered after you walk the salad line.  If you like salad they have a lot of makings. Or some would salad stuff. Per-made salads or make your own. Their salads makings are always fresh and attractive.  After the salad comes the pasta, bake potato, soups of many kinds cheese bread, and chili. Then the desert, fruit, soft ice cream, muffins, hot pie, cake. The reason for a 3 is they are good if you like vegetables, and high carb foods. If you want protein you are in the wrong place. They do make a big chunk chicken noodle soup. If you want protein you can pick out the chicken.  If you are a senior they have a special rate if you get there early."}
{"text":"The Sweet Tomatoes I have gone to have all been very clean and everyone greats you with a smile. The vegetables always appear to be fresh.  I am not much of a buffet all you can eat place. Especially when there is a limited amount of protein available. I go there because the rest of the gang likes the place. We have three boys under 4 and they like to pick their food. Great place to do this.  As almost everyone that goes there I start with a salad, trying to pick the items that have the least amount of carbs. After I eat the salad I usually get the chicken noodle soup, picking out the large chunks of chicken and trying to not any noodles. So when you go and there are no chicken in the soup you can blame me. Then I put on some red chili pepper and cheese.  If a salad buffet is your thing this is the place to go. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I grew up in the Bay Area with lots of salad bars - a must for a then Vegetarian and a weight-conscious teenager.    So, you could say, I am an EXPERT on salad bars, if there is such a thing.  I want to like Sweet Tomatoes in Ahwatukee.  After all, my daughter LOVES going there (I mean, where else can she load up on garbanzo beans, pasta, kidney beans and ice cream in one place)?  The problem is... I just don't.  I go to this Sweet Tomatoes every couple months because it is convenient and I am running out of places to take my near-Vegan sister to when she visits.    This is, however, the second worst salad bar I have ever visited.  Am I against all Sweet Tomatoes?  No.  The one in Tempe I would rate slightly higher and the one in Central Phoenix I might even rate a 3.5 star.    This particular location does a few things wrong.  Let me highlight:  1.) They charge kids $1.99 for cups when the other locations give them the cup for free with their kids' meals.  This location is in family-friendly Ahwatukee.  Really?  Charging $1.99 for cups is sort of like saying... \"hey, come eat here but don't bring your kids.\"  My daughter gets water with her meals.  Better for her anyhow... but I don't appreciate the discrepancy between locations.  2.) The salad bar often differs from one side to the other.  So if we choose to go down the right side, we might have to go back... around other people... to the other side to get the garbanzos my daughter loves so much.  It is just inconvenient.  And annoying.  3.) It is pretty dirty.  I often go to the bathrooms in restaurants to wash my hands before eating.  The bathroom here is never up to par.  Also, the tables never seem quite clean enough and there are almost always crumbs of food on the benches.  4.) The recipes are just a little off.  I don't know what is pre-made and what is made fresh, but the soups and pastas are often over salted or taste funny.  Oh, and I have encountered sour-tasting \"cheddar\" cheese shreds on more than one occasion.  5.) It is overpriced.  The value for your money is just not here.  Paying $9 for a lunch here is ridiculous when you are only eating a salad.  I can get a salad at nearly every other restaurant for less.  Some of those restaurants may even include a lean protein on the salad like chicken or salmon for that price.  Sweet Tomatoes now charges $2.49 for adding chicken or edamame or mandarin oranges, almonds or even cranberries to your salad.  And you only get one pass at that, so it almost seems like if you want to do it, you should fill an ENTIRE plate up of chicken, etc and share it.  I don't know why I still come here.  Maybe if I had one extra kid and could use that $19.99 coupon that I get emailed it would be ok.  But, then, is it worth it?  Still, I say no."}
{"text":"We don't typically go out to places like these, salad buffets, mostly because they gross the husband out.  That's fine with me, I understand.  At the request of friends one time, and for a family celebration another, we came here.  I've been to a couple ST locations, and this one seems to be laid out better than others as well as cleaner.  Their selection of food always looks fresh and they don't let it get too low, so that's nice.  I do love their corn bread with the honey whip ( you have to ask for it) and their side dish type pasta salads are usually pretty good.  This place isn't amazing, like my best friend thinks it is, but it is a pretty solid salad buffet."}
{"text":"Salads, Soups, Pasta, Bakery and drinks.  Create your own salad with different kinds of lettuce and premade salads. I always choose to include eggs, olives and mushrooms.  I have always liked the Tuna Tarragon which is a mix of pasta with tuna mixed in. Such a refreshing combination.  There are always a good selection of soups and the favorites are the Big Chunk Chicken Noodle Soup and the Deep Kettle House Chili with Corn Bread.  From the Bakery the corn bread is a must with chili on top.  The soft serve ice cream is good and also put on top of the selection of hot desserts or the baked cookies.  Always look for coupons whether it be in the newspaper or on line to save a few $.  A good healthy alternative but you always over eat here.  Will be back again when we want an alternative to burgers and pizza."}
{"text":"Compared to all other restaurants, I would probably give this place 2 stars, but based on \"you get what you pay for,\" I'm bumping it up to 3 as perfectly acceptable.   Yes, there are lots of salad and topping options, plus an acceptable soup and carb station. Everything is \"fresh\" in the sense that it doesn't often seem like it's been sitting out all day.   That being said.. you know those bags of already-cut-up salad they sell at the supermarket? To me, they never taste as good as when you buy an actual entire head of lettuce. They always taste more bland and maybe just a little plasticy. This is what the lettuce here tastes like. The other toppings also look and taste like they came out of a factory / bag.   But can you really expect hand-chopped salad and fresh-grated cheese for $10 a head for dinner? Not so much.  Busser/server Amandi is the most hyper, friendly person you'll ever meet. Sometimes she can be a little obnoxious / intrusive, but I would much rather interact with someone like her than someone who is rude or negligent. And you can't fault a girl for having spirit! Last time we were there, we told her it was our friend's birthday, and she made him a happy face cookie with ice cream and got the cashiers to sing him happy birthday. If you ever meet her, you'll never forget her!"}
{"text":"I realize this isn't fine dining, but this location is consistently disgusting. The salad bar is always messy, but today I found a hair in the shredded broccoli, and hot food stations were messy as well. The service wasn't much better; although no one was rude, just distracted. The server refilling the salads made more of a mess refilling them than the customers. Food was everywhere.   Even if it means that I drive out of my way to Lake Mead and Rainbow, I won't come to this location again. Management here must have absolutely no pride in how their restaurant is presented and that's a shame. Two stars for the name only."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today... The salad was soggy and wilted.... The Alfredo had no flavor.... My daughters Mac n cheese was hard,  they made new one it was like soup.... I spoke to manger who brought me more runny Mac n cheese.... I brought 6 people, I asked for 1 meal to be refunded as she would not eat anything else here,  but all they would do is give me a complimentary meal voucher.... NEVER COMING BACK HERE!!! SHOULD HAVE JUST FLUSHED $75 down the toilet....."}
{"text":"I go to Sweet Tomatoes when I want to pretend to eat healthy, then I veg out on unlimited delicious quattro formaggi focaccia (say that 10x fast), basically cheesy pizza bread.  Of course I'd be the girl to go to the salad place and get everything but salad.   They have a huge selection of toppings and dressings to put on your salad; I never end up with the same salad twice.  You can start out with undressed greens or go with one of their signature tossed greens like caesar asiago.  They even have deli salads (like tuna salad or pasta salad) for those who like some variation from greens.  I love that they have beets as a topping, they are my absolute favorite on salads.   Personally, I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the \"premium\" toppings.  I think they're like, $2.50 extra each time you get a salad.  Some of the ingredients in that selection perplex me as to why they'd cost extra (like tofu, isn't it basically 90% water anyways? it should be free!)  Also, the last time I was there, they didn't have chicken available all day.  That made me a little sad since I'm a meat girl.  They didn't have a single meat item in the premium toppings selection.  Besides that, the non-salad items are also really yummy.  They have warm muffins, brownies, and deliciously heart-healthy seasonal soups.  Some of their soups (like the thanksgiving dinner soup they had in November) are really really delicious and I end up going back for seconds.  Their pastas, like the mac and cheese, are just okay, nothing spectacular.   I also like their drink selections, especially their yummy teas.  Overall, I like going to Sweet Tomatoes not only for the salad but for everything else.  The food isn't out of this world phenomenal, but it's a great healthy buffet spot for lunch & dinner at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"it's all about the two-fer and it's the only buffet i can go to without feeling guilty afterward... even with dessert - soft serve frozen yogurt! =D"}
{"text":"My family and I love a salad especially the make it your own kind of salad! We love Sweet Tomatoes and when we crave salads and soups this is our location! But, the past two visits the place has been unkept! Always food on the floor which I find to be hazardous! The silverware and drinking glasses always cloudy and just seems like it went thru the quick cycle! Our cashier seem frustrated or overwhelmed with the drinking glasses she gave us cause they all seem dirty and the manager was just looking at her with no concerns! The condiments for the baked potatoes that area is a mess! (Show some love for the green onions) Last but not least, I felt a bit queasy!   Big props to all of the folks who collect the dishes. They are always so nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location at least five times so it's probably time to post a review. Good selection of greens and toppings at the salad bar, with helpful information on calories and nutrition. Also yummy little muffins: peach poppyseed, blueberry. They also have sides like baked potato and soup. I would like to see a small meat station simply to appease the meat eaters in a group who want to go out together. We have so few salad bar choices in town (with a large assortment of toppings), I'm very glad we have Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Wow ! Friendly staff and super fresh selections, amazing considering it was 8pm, an hour from closing , so I was already expecting half-empty bins  and picked-thru ready-made salads. But WHOA, salads were loaded with plenty of the Star ingredients (nuts, tuna, cranberries, etc.) And the chunky chicken soup was super chunky, the best for a sore throat. This is our new favorite location !!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of pasta salads. Love love love the tarragon tuna and broccoli with bacon. It was light on the bacon, but if you remember to think outside the box, you can walk over to the hot foods (hot potato bar) to sprinkle some fresh bacon bits into the broccoli salad. Nice spread of other salad fixings.  I was impressed that I was stopped from re-using my plate. Here I thought, I'm just getting the same salads on my 2nd round, why waste water (save them from washing another plate. One of the staff suggested I get a fresh plate. When I said I was ok reusing my plate, he nicely advised that for health and sanitary reasons (to prevent accidental contamination), it would be best if I used s fresh plate. It never occurred that could happen. You learn something new everyday. I was glad he stopped me, glad he was conscientious of what clientele might do without realizing potential missteps.  We're stuffed after the healthy buffet. We'll be back for more soon."}
{"text":"Do you love fresh salads and soups? Do you have friends that are vegan or vegetarian?   This is the place for you!   The salad bar is endless. Every item is listed with the ingredients too. So you can avoid meat or dairy with great ease.   Not to mention the dessert area is effing drool worthy."}
