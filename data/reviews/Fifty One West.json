{"text":"Coffee is great. Vegan apple fritters are stellar!!"}
{"text":"It looks like they just moved?  Anyways we are here.  Really good coffee.  Vegan pop tarts!  Live shows.  Barista seems really cool.  Chill vibe!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some afternoon caffeine on a Friday.  The cold brewed coffee is perfectly tasty and nice and strong.  No complaints.  Service was nice and the place had lots of interesting stuff to look at if I were to hang around. It was quiet and dark, which isn't surprising for midday on a weekday at a coffee shop.  The only difficulty I had was figuring out where the parking lot entrance is. That's only because I don't normally come to this plaza, but I'm sure not a problem for other people.  It's immediately east of Kyrene on Southern, FYI.  I will be back! Can't wait to try some of the pastries next time."}
{"text":"All veg place that's close to Monty's! Has been on our list to check out for a while and they just started a vegan taqueria menu! Unfortunately that menu isn't available tonight (and since I'm in LA during the week, I can only come on Saturdays/Sundays). Hopefully they extend it.  Got a chocolate almond milk for the little one. Ordered \"The Dude\" and \"Scarface\" specialty coffees for Monty and I. And got a breakfast sandwich. Bagel, soyrizo, potato and vegan cheese.   Hope they grow!"}
{"text":"This is more a review of the place as a concert venue.  It's very hard to find and not much when you get inside.  The coffee bar was open so I had an iced coffee and it was fine.  Don't know about the food items, but if you're someone who eats Vegan, taste isn't generally an issue for you, and if you're someone who enjoys cream in your coffee...well tough shit, Soy Milk it is.  Meh, it's a Vegan & Gluten-Free coffee shop, what are you going to do?  The main issue was when the band came on.  It's very poorly set-up, the guys running the front door were nice enough in all, but I don't think they know how to run a sound board or mic the show right.  I was a big fan of the headlining band and I was never 100% percent sure what song they were playing because the locals were so low and the guitars were jacked up so high it just became a noise blur.  It's just sort of a bummer.  On the upside you can easily meet the band after because it's just a big rectangle room so it's up close and personal.  So take this as a reveiw of it as a place to see a concert.  Otherwise, if you're looking for a place to update your anti Monsanto blog while eating something that resembles a danish but tastes like Lays made a Danish flavored potato chip, only not as good...well like the Talking Heads said; \"This Must Be the Place\"."}
{"text":"1 word YUM! Great coffee & vegan pastries, super nice staff. Laid back vibe ,not too pricey. I haven't been to any of the shows they have there ,but ever time I drive by it seems hopping .  Tip: Try the nitro coffee(for extra fun add Kahlua)  Bonus their local!"}
{"text":"Haven't found a place like this since I left Cali....and good coffee,nice staff....my new go to place for a great latte."}
{"text":"Worst coffee I have ever had, thought I'd try something new and get my coffee here. Ugh! Maybe it was the person making it but I spent $4 on a 16oz cup of coffee, what a waste."}
{"text":"Vegan Pasteries, amazing coffee, a constant stream of community activities like game nights, art classes, movie nights, and live music!   What's not to love.  Glad I found out about this spot it's truly an incredible to have this as part of our community.  Definetly made this a pet of my morning and evening routine!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place and definitely don't know what the other reviewers experienced to warrant 5 stars. This place was hard to find and the sign blended into the exterior siding making it difficult to identify. I walked in and it was empty, smelled, very dark with loud screamer music going. I actually asked the barista if they were open because it was so dark and there wasn't a single food item out. The latte I ordered was good but not worth the disappointing experience. And I was hungry but there certainly weren't any baked goods to be found like those in the pictures."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here and the donuts  also the coffee omg I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Excellent! The cold Nitro has been making my day for the last couple days. I have picked a few different treats as well, excellent also. While I was in today they were prepping to expand the kitchen, excited for that. Great things on the horizon for 51W! Keep up the great work. Need to pick up one of those awesome shirts one of these days too!"}
{"text":"The nitro cold brew and soyrizo bagel sandwich I ordered were excellent. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Love the atmosphere and the coffee. Awesome to see that they carry donuts from Welcome Donuts. The staff are always super friendly and accomodating. It's a good day when I'm able to spend some time at fifty one west."}
{"text":"Most unique cold brew I have ever had, try their nitro cold brew you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great place to see an intimate show with your favorite band.   Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Nitro coffee was excellent.  It looks like they have some awesome pastries during the day, so I will be back for that.  Plenty of parking in the back.  Keep up the good atmosphere.  Many places don't."}
{"text":"Their hours were not on the door and the first time I walked in. The guy behind the counter, after I waited at the counter while he was talking to a friend, just turned to me and said \"Oh no we're closed\" and laughed with his friend as if I wasn't there. So after that interaction I tried to come back and they weren't open still no obvious hours posted. Then after an extensive search online I found their hours which are strange. I finally was able to go when they were open and was able to try the nitro coffee. It was not great and pretty darn expensive. Their pastries looked really good and it looks like an okay venue.   I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and maybe I'll try again but really not a great impression so far."}
