{"text":"Very nice place to eat and shop. My wife had a roast beef sandwich and I had the kalamata sandwich. Both were very good. The service was great and generally a very good experience. We will definitely be back. T.P."}
{"text":"Was not very good. Over priced mealy olives. I bought olives and  asiago cheese and parm pesto. It a waste of a drive. The Gelato was good but it is really out of the way for gelato. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Overall I loved our experience at the Olive Mill. The outdoor dining area was perfect for a beautiful day. 

The store is fun and has very good olives and a great olive tasting setup.

The food was really good too. The day we went it was abnormally crowded - so the ordering process was a little confusing... but the taste made up for it!

In any case, it's a great visit if your in the area."}
