{"text":"I've been twice and was glad that the food was good both times. The prices are decent for the entertainment district and the quality of the food.   The zucchini fritti was good but a bit too oily.   Arancini came in 3s and it was nice for sharing. Not a must try though.  The prosciutto pizza was good. The crust was very thin so if you like thin crust, you may enjoy this.  Overall, pleasantly surprised and would prefer to come here over some of the other \"nice\" restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wen't for a friends birthday a few weeks ago and had a really nice meal evening. I had the  Zucchini Fritti and it was delicious! We also all shared some of the Truffle Honey House Made Ricotta which was fabulous.  I had the Tortelli pasta which was very very good. The sauce is a butter sage sauce and the portion isn't huge, but the dish was amazing!   My only criticism is that the service was very slow and there were issues with one of my friend's meals. The restaurant wasn't overly busy, so I was disappointed with how long some things took. However, we had a nice evening out and the food was great! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself is beautiful, however the service was some of the worst I've experienced.   We were a group of 4 with a reservation on the patio. It was a weeknight and admittedly it was decently busy when we arrived (although the inside was completely dead, all of the action was on the patio). It didn't take long for the patio to clear up a bit as many patrons left for the Jay's game. We waited about 10 mins or so for our table which none of us seemed to really mind. We had to wait about 20 more minutes before we could get the attention of any server to even order a drink. It was about 30 mins by the time our first drinks came and about an hour until are appetizers were served.   We all shared a few salads to start which were pretty standard. I'd say it was about an hour and a half at least until we were served our mains. I had the Tortelli, which I'd give about a 3.5/5 - I'm of the belief that pasta can never really be that bad, but felt this dish was a little too rich with the butter really over-powering all of the other flavours.   Our biggest disappointment was the service here. Ridiculously long waits for drinks and food, and it was nearly impossible to even get someone's attention to serve us. We left the restaurant without even knowing who our server was. No one checked on us at any point in the evening and every time we needed to order food or a drink we had to flag someone down. Our glasses sat empty 80% of the night despite all of us being in the mood for some bevvies (we were celebrating after all).   I will be giving them another shot and hoping that we caught them on a very bad night."}
{"text":"Ambiance is beautiful, Service was Impeccable and the food was delicious. Perfect restaurant !! I will go back here in a heart beat!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner in this Italian restaurant on a Tuesday evening. Front of house was very friendly. We were seated quickly and offered water and the cocktail/wine list. Good selection of both.  I ordered a mojito  (not on the menu) which was very good.  We ordered a mix of starters to share - ricotta and honey, salad and battered courgette.  They were all tasty but not super amazing.  We also shared a pizza which was very good.  For my main I had the wild boar pasta. It was very rich and tasty and a good size. None of us had room for pudding unfortunately...  The ambiance was nice. Relaxed, slightly funky music (not over loud) and a pleasant modern decor.  All in all a good restaurant that I would visit again."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and we were honestly so disappointed. Everything was so overpriced and the dishes were lacking flavours. The pizzas were so bland, the pasta was decent but i kid you not, it is definitely not worth the price. The restaurant itself is nice however, it is a bit loud and it's always so hot inside regardless of the weather. Overall, customer service was great however the food really isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"The interior is gorgeous however the food is a complete let down. So disappointed. Appetizers were bland and so was the pasta. Unfortunately nothing special."}
{"text":"I'd been dying to come to Figo after my company hosted last year's Christmas party here. The interior is beautiful and they served a few very delicious dishes.  This time, I visited with a girl friend and she was very impressed with the restaurant environment. We ordered a Seafood Fritti, House Sausage Pizza, and a side of brussel sprouts. The dishes were just ok, with the brussel sprouts being the first to be gone.  The Seafood Fritti was not as crispy as I would have expected. The batter wasn't overly thick or anything, but it looked and tasted a big soggy. The Pizza was alright, but nothing special. I really wanted to like this place, but it's not making it on my list of best places for Italian food in the city."}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner here for the first time after hearing good reviews. We called about fifteen minutes ahead to see if we would be able to get a table and were told we could get high table seating, which we later did. We were seated at a table wrapped around a huge pole but we're still able to feel the sexy atmosphere.   Our server gave great recommendations and described the dishes well. We had the tagliatelle (with clams) and bucatini (with wild boar ragu). The former was very light and fresh, while the second was more heavy and meaty. The noodles were made well and chewy. My friend ordered the Queen's Park cocktail but found it very sour - the server quickly switched it for a different drink with no fuss.   For a student's budget, this place was expensive considering the small serving sizes, but for the ambiance I can see why it attracts young professionals."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having dinner at Figo but was left feeling disappointed.  I had reservations a few weeks in advance only to be told there was only bar space unless we wanted to wait 30 mins. The person serving us acted like we were an inconvenience and was quite rude when we asked for separate cheques (group of 3).  The food was meh (I have the scallops, which were overcooked), definitely overpriced for the quality.  The only thing I can say that was positive is the space is beautiful and our meals came quickly, which we appreciated.   I've heard Figo's brunch is great so we may give the place 1 more shot before writing it off completely."}
{"text":"Two stars is the perfect rating for Figo, where everything is superficially good, but disappointing upon deeper examination. A few examples:  It's a beautiful room. But, the tables are crammed too closely together and it's extremely loud.  Menu looks great. But, one of our dishes (tagliatelli with dill and clams) was underseasoned with badly overcooked pasta; another (gnocchi) salty as all hell to the point of unenjoyable. The \"fresh\" arugula salad was made with stale greens, and the \"warm\" mushrooms on the dish were served cold and slimy.  Wine list looks interesting. But, wines by the glass are aggressively priced, and it's not great watching a group of three employees pour your glass from a previously opened bottle, and then pass it around, each sniffing it, apparently debating over whether it's good enough to serve--and then serving it to you.  Service was good.   For the price, this is not a good choice. Go instead to Piano Piano, Enoteca Sociale, Campagnolo, or Terroni--real Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"We ordered a brunch set as well as a salad and pizza, the price is okay but not so much fit for its taste.The service is good that he would take care of you for the whole time!The salad is great that it has the large portion and good flavour, I love the vinegary salad! The granola & yoghurt is very blend that the granola is exactly like the plain oats with a tiny little bit of dry fruit and a hint of honey and the yoghurt itself is thin and plain as well. Then it comes with my biggest expectation this time, I literally came for it and I was disappointed. That is the mushroom pizza. It is a little bit oily for me and lack of the mushrooming flavour and the cheese on top just turn into a hard crust , the watercress is a little bit too salty while the topping underneath is plain , super upset for this one... Additionally,  we ordered the scrambled egg toast as the main of the set. The egg is good , it is sufficient and rich , then cheese flakes is right for the little kick. However, the toasted bread was burned and I can clearly taste the burnt pieces through the rich eggs... The last but not the least, the dessert is just okay. The moose is creamy the cherry syrup is okay, not that cherry for me actually... Maybe I would come back for a dinner to give a chance for their pasta or something else next time but definitely not for their brunch..."}
{"text":"Great location, nice street level patio great for people watching. Service was professional and friendly. Unfortunately the food is uninspiring. The chef or cook made dishes that were what you would expect from a chain restaurant. Its too bad, for the premium prices they ask for you would think the chef would have more freedom to make the food special."}
{"text":"Brunch menu, they don't offer the lunch menu anymore. Pizzas were better than average, but not the best I've had. Patio is nice on a summer day with sun. Chicken salad had a generous portion of chicken. Actually, quite generous, I think there were 3 full chicken breasts at the bottom of the salad and they weren't cut up. Salad was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Figo. I must say I was quite disappointed. There was a bit of a wait to have our orders taken and the meals themselves were not to par. I had the chicken salad and the chicken was very rubbery and the pizza was very bland that my husband had. I think the price point fur the quality of the meal was quite high."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday evening with reservations for around 7:00PM. We ordered ricotta&bread appetizer, the potato pizza and the bolognese and found them both to be good, but nothing special for their proposed price. However, there was about 45-50min interval between the appetizer and the main dishes, so I am not too sure if I would come back again.  The ricotta and bread appetizer tasted exactly how it was described in the menu. I would get it if you're really hungry and waiting for the main dishes, but overall nothing too special, so you're not missing out.  The potato pizza (ask your server for the name) tasted good, but my friend found it to be bland compared to other pizzas she's had at Italian restaurants. I think they forgot to season the ingredients, although the dough tasted okay.  The bolognese was good, but the pasta was a bit cold in the outer edges when it was served. It wasn't anything to the point of getting it re-served, so we were able to finish it.  The downside of this restaurant is that the service was very slow, despite the server being nice. After we were served our appetizer, we waited around ~45-50min to get our next dishes. It was a bit exhausting, and for that reason I don't think I'll be coming back and checking out other plentiful Italian restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews so this would be my first. This was my second time in the restaurant. The first time was for brunch. This time, we went as a group of 5 for dinner. We did not have a reservation and it was a Thurs night. I understand that there will be a wait, so not a problem.. however, the host had serious attitude problem. When I asked for an approx wait time, she looked really annoyed and said, there's no approx ma'am. You can wait if you want. I asked if I could put down my number as we can wait around the area while. She said sure, but again, I don't know when that will be. (I get it, you don't need to repeat what you said). So after an hour wait, we got a seat on patio. Food was just okay. Jumping into the complains, cause unfortunately there's nothing good I can say about this restaurant. We ordered a bottle of wine. A fly flew into my glass - as it was just about to drown into my wine, I asked the server for another wine glass so I can pour it out without the fly touching my wine (I thought I was being nice cause normally guests would have asked for a new glass of wine). The server came back and told me they have no more wine glass, took my glass, used a straw to flick out the fly. The fly touched my wine while she was doing this. I stared at her in shock. She looked at me and said, there you go. Gone. I didn't end up drinking it btw. I also find her very unprofessional in cleaning the table or taking away our plates too. She made it look like we were always in her way and moved our cellphones around. Um, excuse me? You should NOT be touching my personal items. Ask us to move them and we will! I am not sure if i'm allowed to call out names, but the server name starts with a \"Y\"."}
{"text":"Went to Figo today for lunch with a few people from work. It was underwhelming. Ordered from the Price Fixe menu: soup, Pizza Margherita and rice pudding. Soup arrived and I had to remind the waitress about my drink (others had theirs).   Soup was scalding. I gave up less than half way through because the taste was not worth the discomfort. I ate both slices of toast though - delicious.  Pizza was weirdly both burnt and cold (not cool, cold). I had two slices and brought the rest home after sticking it in the fridge at work. Pro tip: bacon can save any pizza (don't care if you hate me for that - had bacon).   Rice pudding was great.   Food presentation was okay (aside from burned pizza - see photo). Service was okay to good - one person in our group had his order delayed 2 minutes by the kitchen because it didn't look right to them and was being remade.   Lots of windows make you forget you are cheek-to-jowl with other tables.  Was not terrible but will not go back."}
{"text":"3.5/5! We enjoyed all the dishes we ordered! For starters, I recommend the zucchini fritters. As a main- the mushroom pizza and bucatini pasta are must haves- and finally for dessert go for the tiramisu. Overall, great ambiance and location but slightly overpriced for Italian food."}
{"text":"The ambient is nice the food not so much  It took them more than an hour to bring our food we orders the breakfast prix . After all the wait the pizza was COLD once we complained the waitress politely offered to bring us a new one which was barely warm !!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Figo for dinner and overall I had an alright time.  We shared the zucchini fritti, truffle honey house ricotta and wild boar ragu.  The zucchini fritti was lightly fried, it was light and sweet. The truffle honey house ricotta was good, very light but could've used a dab more truffle. The wild boar ragu could've been better, the pasta was way undercooked, so it was quite hard when eating it.    The service was unbearable, the waiter wasn't helpful and kept coming at odd times to check up on us. For instance - we just received the ragu and not even a min into it, he asked us how it was. So it was quite annoying. I would not come back."}
{"text":"I live a 30 second walk from this place and had heard lots of good things from my neighbours. It always smells really good when I walk by as well, with the kitchen door being open to the street.   I don't regret going, because I wanted to try it, but unfortunately, it was a pretty disappointing experience. It was fairly empty when we got there, and we asked for a table for two. It was 7:30 PM and the hostess said we could have a certain table until 9 PM but that it was reserved afterwards. We didn't wind up needing the full hour and a half, but there must have been 6 or 7 other tables for two available when we left at 8:45 or so.  The actual restaurant is beautiful, and the service was pretty good; our server checked in with us periodically, was available when we had questions, and gave us the time we needed to decide on what we wanted. That's why I'm giving an extra star.  However, the food was a major letdown, and on top of this, the portions were so small. And not just the food- I don't even think I got a full ounce of the Glenfiddich I ordered. The only tasty part of the meal was the arancini appetizer, but even that was cancelled out by the fact that they don't serve bread and oil at the start of the meal. I thought this was an Italian restaurant!  I ordered the wild boar pasta (bucatini I think?) and my date had the lobster pasta (think it was called gigli). My noodles were barely cooked. Way too firm. The sauce was good but I was blown away by how small my portion was. I could have (and have) made a much better pasta at home. I tasted a bit of her tiny pasta as well, and we both thought it was overly fishy. There didn't seem to be much lobster in it, either.   The atmosphere and service are good, but the food itself is pretty underwhelming and waaaay overpriced. Even for the Entertainment District. I think I would have still been disappointed had we only paid half the price for our meal.   On top of it all, we were both still hungry upon leaving.  I'd come back if somebody else was paying but it wouldn't be my choice. Feel free to cross it off your list even if you haven't been."}
{"text":"I've been here twice each for a birthday. I have to give them credit for design and atmosphere. That's how they fool you into coming in. The service is also great, very friendly and attentive. The food had fresh ingredients but so bland I just.. Can't. I tried the margherita pizza, one with Sausage, and clam pasta. So.. Plain. The pasta sauce was watery and all I could taste was salt and dill. I couldn't really taste the clams. There weren't very many in there either but I thought  it sounded great to try out. Bad mistake.  The pizza's didn't scream out anything special to me. They were.. Standard handmade pizza's. Also kind of bland that I had to add in chili peppers. But I do like my chili peppers.  For dessert we had everything:. tiramisu, panna cotta, lemon olive oil cake, chocolate almond torta with gelato. I really did not like the panna cotta or the olive oil cake. The tiramisu was delicious and chocolate torta was very rich in flavour.  I wouldn't come here again unless its a birthday and I have to."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Got seated at the patio fairly quickly. Had the Bucatini which arrived fairly quickly. The server always ensured that our water was refilled in which he came back fairly often. Food didn't seem like anything too special although it's a lot higher on my list of places for Italian. I don't think the pasta was worth it for what I paid but I think i'd come back for the environment."}
{"text":"Such a cute interior! The ceiling itself has a great flower art which goes with the purple flowery art look of the resto. Great bar setting - although the space around the bar is quite tight with the long table in front of it which leaves little room for the tables by the end windows to get through to go at the other end of the restaurant to use the washrooms. I had their ravioli and their chili potato fries. Ravioli was amaaaziiiing! The potato fries were excellent as well - portion was big for a side. I would go back. The only thing thats off putting is the location. Its surrounded by pubs & bars and right next to a Hooters. This place would likely get alot more service especially from the type of clientele they are aiming to attract - given their interior and type of service - if they changed locations."}
{"text":"So good! We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. We ordered arancini for a starter, the margarita and mushroom pizzas for our main course. The arancini with the lemon garlic aioli was absolutely delicious, some of the best I've ever had. The pizzas are made from scratch on a woodfire grill, can't go wrong there. The margarita pizza was good, but nothing out of the ordinary but the mushroom pizza was incredible!!!  We had great service, the decor is beautiful too. I wish I lived in Toronto instead of just being able to visit throughout year because I would be a regular.  It will definitely be on my list to return back to!"}
{"text":"Overall this place was fine but I probably won't go back unless someone else really wanted to...and even then I'd try to convince them otherwise. Came here for dinner on a Saturday night with 3 other girls and we shared everything. The decor was probably the highlight of the experience.   Figo delivered on exactly what my expectations were for the price I expected to pay. The food was tasty which was expected at a $65 tab with 1 glass of wine + tax/tip. No more, no less.  Meal highlights and things I would eat again: Zucchini fritti  Branzino  Things that were tasty but nothing to write home about: Sopressata pizza Sea bream crudo Brussels sprouts (note, it took me 5 minutes to remember the last thing we had, that's how not memorable they were)"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to come here for dinner. I was particularly intrigued by the number of seafood options they had. The ambience is great for a girl's dinner as it is quite girly. I ordered the Fergula, a pasta dish with mussels. They were very generous with the amount of mussels. It was a little too salty for my liking, but other than that, taste was on point. Service was also great. I was running late, and the staff was willing to accomodate, as they made sure my dish was warm and fresh by bringing it just minutes before I arrived!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience but super bland food...typical prototype of Charles Khabouth restaurants."}
{"text":"Ambiance. Loooved the inside and ambiance of Figo. The light palette of the fixtures and gigantic dusty pink/grey rose lined ceilings were gorgeous! Great place to sit and chat on the weekend for brunch.   Service. 5 stars. Some typical brunch places take forever to prepare food. But here, waiting was no problem. Food came out hot and quick and our waitresses was always available. Double like!   Food. Eggs benny was great. Classic hollandaise sauce w everything else. The smashed potatoes though.... Oooooooh boy were they good..definitely a must order! Salty, crispy, slightly soft but still intact. Looking around at least one person from each table ordered pizza, so we ordered a house sausage pizza. Looked super appealing but taste was Meh. Not amazing and taste was kind of flat. Not for me.  Buratta also looked great on the plate! I prefer it warm although I believe its supposed to be served cold.  Frittata tasted great.  Not a fan of expensive tuna salads made with flaky canned tuna.  Highlights : get the smashed potatoes! :ppp"}
{"text":"Pretty place but with giant windows on one side, its meant for a gorgeous day. When I went, weather was grey and there was so much construction going on that there wasn't much to look at.   Made reso for 2, hostess at the front sat me down at the most awkward table in the middle of everything. So much foot traffic! And there were so many other empty tables.... asked to be seated somewhere else, she said all tables were reserved as well. Moved us to another table that wasn't as bad.   Food was mediocre, our server was super friendly though. The tables that were 'reserved' was still empty when we left 2 hours later. I hate it when hostesses lie when its so obvious. Who the hell are you saving those tables for? Probably never going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service make Figo a stand out dinner spot. We started with zucchini fritti and arancini, then the branzino and veal as mains. Everything was fresh and delicious, and the wines by the glass were well chosen. Our server was highly knowledgeable, attentive and professional. Will be back!"}
{"text":"What an overpriced place.  We had the sausage pizza, burrata, and zucchini fritti for a quick dinner. Everything came off as just showy, but really not flavorful. The burrata did not feel fresh, and I really wonder if \"micro-melons\" (i.e. cantaloupe pieces that are cut in 5mm cubes) added anything to a cheese dish.  The best parts about our experience here was everything except the food: the accommodating and friendly waiters/waitresses and nice atmosphere and decor of the venue."}
{"text":"I love the decor and the setting of this place! It's so bright and lovely looking. The patio is big and it's a great place to sit. This is definitely a more expensive restaurant depending on what you get. I had a three ingredient salad which was definitely more than I would usually pay but it was REALLY good. The warm mushrooms were cooked perfectly and went nice with the arugula.   Order the Figo Cocktail. It was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy and the presentation of the crushed ice mountain and thyme looked great."}
{"text":"Went there for a late lunch with my hubby and we had the pink bubbles for drinks and the arancini + house sausage pizza for lunch! The food was good and we had a decent service.  Really nice view of the CN Tower from their confi patio also! We will return for lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"EXPERIENCE Reserved our table on the website from the open table app. The restaurant was pretty empty at around 5pm when our reservation was closer to 6. The hostess gave us a centre seat and we wanted a booth seat. It took a while for the hostess to walk back to us to say we can have a booth seat when the restaurant was empty!!!   FOOD The food was excellent. Ordered the calamari fritti and the rib eye steak. Both my husband and I ordered the steak. Very moist, tastey, oh just to perfection! The 14 oz rib eye steak was a lot, both me and my husband had a tough time finishing it. The dish alone was fairly overpriced at 65$ each with only a few mushrooms shimmered on top. I was expecting more than just the steak and few pieces of mushrooms. Perhaps, rice potato or fries, but it was not an option.    SERVICE The staff seemed nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Had the pizza and it was really good and decent price. Place is very nice inside. Staff are attentive. Drinks are nice as well, esp cocktails. I would return here to try more food or another pizza. Good date place."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Appropriate for the area: pretty seating, decent and solid service, pretty OK food in small portions at the expected price range (~$20/main dish per person).  Shared the truffle honey ricotta, fregula pasta, and mushroom pizza.  Fair warning: I was too tired for an appetite that night; would've otherwise left pretty hungry!  Though simple, I rather enjoyed the ricotta that came in a small dish with two spoons, flanked by crisp slices of toasted crostini.  The fregula had more mussels than pasta, which is nice if you like mussels, but you might want to pick a heartier dish like pizza if you're looking to be more full.  The mushroom pizza was OK, but didn't have any truffle taste to it.  I'd come back for more creamy house ricotta and maybe try one of their seafood or meat mains next time.   I'd probably prefer a little more seasoning/salt if my meal were to be accompanied by beer/wine, but I thought it was fine.  Overall, the food was pretty simple, with no parts being offensive but nothing in particular really stood out for me either..."}
{"text":"We had decided to check out Figo after seeing photos pop up on social media of the cute interior design and decor.   We had made reservations for brunch, and when we got there-- the place was packed! With most brunch spots in Toronto, do reservations!! There was a couple of groups that were waiting in the front.  We were seated against the wine wall and it was a great opportunity to look around the restaurant and see how well lit it is. (Perfect spot for a photo op)  For drinks, I had decided to go with the Pom Fizz (ketel one vodka, limoncello, pomegranate, lemon, soda). The drink came in a slender glass topped with alot of ice ( i mean alot..). It was super refreshing but a couple of sips and it was done, for 14$ im better off with a glass of water.  Now getting to my meal, I had decided to go with the Figo Breakfast. Reason being is I enjoy variety and having a taste of different foods leaves me... hmm I guess \"bored\"?  My meal had 2 eggs, black pepper bacon, mild italian sausage, wood oven tomato, balsamic mushroom, rosemary potatoes, grilled sourdough. Everything on this plate I had scooped up and left barely any crumbs. Even myself who is not a tomato eater loved the wood oven tomato (super unique flavor). The potatoes were crispy but very moist and fluffy in the inside. The balasmic salad and mushroom was a great palate cleanser and was a great pairing to the italian sausage.   TL;DR - loved the meal, super cute atmosphere especially if you are meeting with a couple of friends. The drink I could have done without. On the pricy side but hey- most brunch spots in Toronto are."}
{"text":"My husband and I truly enjoy dining at FIGO. We specially loved the service, including the manager Alex, waiters Ryan and Vicente. The food is always so amazing. We highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who is look for a fun and deviousness."}
{"text":"Loved the lively ambience of this place for Italian cuisine located in on Adelaide and John St. The Tagliatelle with clams were delicious! For apps the Burrata with Figs & Coppa served on Foccacia is a must! The Zucchini Fitters were served with a Lemon Creme Fraich and honey... this was good but a tad sweet. I would definitely go back to try the other  pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Had the set menu today for lunch (19.95, soup/salad, pasta/pizza, ice cream/ rice pudding). Great value for great food. Impressive pizza oven. Service was excellent- really friendly and attentive. Only critique would be it was a little slow- fine if your not in a rush but I wouldn't order it if working and under pressure. . Really nice decor as well- staff seem very proud of it and spoke about plans to involve locals in future menus and tastings. Def will go back"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week and was underwhelmed by my meal as it was unimaginative and frankly plain.    We had the Prosciutto Pizza - which likely was the best part of the meal, however, nothing to rave about. The pizza was basic and plain.  We then had the Soppressata Puccia, which was dry and not worth 15 dollars - I am not too sure how anyone can charge $15 dollars for salami, bread and a little cheese.  To end of the worst part of the meal was the Tuna salad which literally looked like they took the stalks from iceberg lettuce and combined it with canned tuna.  AWFUL  There are much better Italian Restaurant in the city like Ovest and Buca!"}
{"text":"Came on a Wed night for dinner with a friend. Service was wonderful and food was awesome! We both shared the house ricotta with figs, port and prosciutto - excellent and wished their was more figs and port on it. The bucatini - wild boar ragu- loved that the noodles were made from scratch and the sauce was not greasy. Carbonara pizza - pancetta, potato, crema fresca, egg, black pepper. Good but confused about where the egg was. Assumed it would be lying on top over easy but maybe it was mixed into the sauce?? Ended the meal with the lemon olive oil cake. Made it even better that it came with crème anglaise!!"}
{"text":"The food at Figo is average but I commend them for their service. They are very professional and friendly. I also love their large patio, perfect for a summer drink or cosy date in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I regularly frequent Figo for lunch and it's always been a great experience. Today I'm writing about my first dinner experience. This place has a completely different vibe at night, which was perfect since I was out to dinner with my wife.  We had Colin and Turi come by our table to say hello and were welcomed like long time friends. Fernando was our waiter for the evening and was excellent. Very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  We started with the pork belly ricotta with maple syrup, calamari and sea bream crudo. All of them were excellent (even the sea bream and that's saying a lot considering I do not like raw fish at all!).   For our mains I had the 14oz rib eye which was cooked to perfection with a side of potatoes. The toppings on top of the steak were excellent and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. My wife had the seafood fregola and she really enjoyed her dish as well.   Dessert was tiramisu, chocolate almond torta, and lemon olive oil cake. All 3 were amazing and we had to pack quite a bit of our food.   Overall the experience was amazing. I regularly come here with colleagues and clients and will continue to come for dinner with my wife. I highly recommend Figo for all types of occasions. The food, decor and people are excellent and you'll be hard pressed to find another place that serves this trio up so perfectly."}
{"text":"we got there earlier than the reservation and so there found us a seat at the bar. We ordered two drinks - the unlovable and I forgot what mine was called but it was the 2nd under Delicate cocktail selection (if that's helps) it was delicious and light. I loved the bar design with its white and gold accents. The decanters on display were beautiful and the stools were comfortable .   We ended up waiting a while for the table and when we saw them set up a table for two at the window we thought for sure it was ours but the hostess ended up seating two guys that just came in. When my husband inquired, they immediately set up another window seat that just became available. It was fine and we had no issue. The manager came over to apologize and offered us sparkling wine.   The waiter was fine, not overly friendly but wasn't rude. He did his thing and we did ours. another waiter cane by our table to drop give our appetizer and he was good with some recommendations. The food - I don't remember the names of the menu items.  1. Zucchini frites - yes! The lemon and honey was a fresh twist along side the fried zucchini. It made a light but tastey dish. I'd go back just for that. 2. Lamb. - got it medium rare, it was so good!  3. Duck pasta - also good. Lots of duck and mushroom, creamy sauce. 4. Pancetta pizza - this is probably the only thing I wouldn't get back. The pizza was very cheesy and I thought the pancetta would cut through that. But it kind of just blended in. The waiter did say we can get pizza anytime but we didn't listen - I suppose we were just hungry 5. Dessert I forgot what we got. We were so full we got it to go.   The bill was about $200 but it was worth it. We have a special night out with really good food!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night celebrating my husband's bday. Awesome mushrrom pizza and must try their fried zucchini. Great service and will definitley go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. You could hear yourself talk which is always a plus. We went for Easter Sunday lunch at 1:45 and we're a bit disappointed the lunch menu was not available. Only brunch. Possibly I missed the announcement on the website but I am pretty good at noticing things like that. We did get a special order of the zucchini fries - a good choice but very rich. Good item to share at a table. Brunch did not disappoint but a choice between eggs and pizza. We had the baked eggs and a full breakfast. Both really well done. Be warned wine is very expensive here. 9 oz. can cost you upwards of close to $30.00. There is no carafe available. The sommelier was very helpful in helping us chose a nice lightly -oaked Spanish Chardonnay under $75. Staff were very knowledgable and attentive. Parking is pretty easy and In a great location for the theatre and TIFF. Definitely will go back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but the service is awful. I had a reservation and ended up getting a table 45 mins after the time. When seated, the server did not come to take our orders until I got fed up and went out and asked. When the meals came, they never really checked on the table. Didn't replace utensils if they took ones away from a previous course."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp so we decided to try it after visiting the christmas market back in December.  The atmosphere and the interior design of this restaurant is very modern and chic, a DJ was there playing music too.  The menu is quite simple- not too many choices. The 3 of us ordered zuchini Fritti, carbonara pizza and 2 tagliatelle pastas.  The zuchini fritti came first, it tastes very fresh and different - but it started tasting very oily and filling after a few more pieces (i would consider this to be a very filling appetizer)  The Carbonara pizza was ok.  My favorite dish for the dinner must have been the taliatelle pasta, they had lots of clams and the sauce was so good!  The service was a bit slow but overall this restaurant is not bad and the price is decent.  I find this as one of the better italian restaurants in toronto - when i crave for pasta i would definitely come back for the Tagliatelle."}
{"text":"Went here when I was in Toronto for work. It was recommended by a few locals, so we were excited about it. The tables are almost on top of each other, but at different angles, so it doesn't feel as cramped once you are seated (just need to be careful getting in and out of your chair to not bump someone). We had a good meal and an attentive waitress. We started with the Truffle Honey Ricotta (fresh and flavorful!), Zucchini Fritti (crispy and like the Italian version of tempura), Arancini (delightful!) and a salad (I forget which one). For my main, I had the 40-day dry aged striploin (which was fine - came just as advertised with the bone in and a nice salsa on top). For sides, we shared the Black Kale (expected a bit more spice to it) and Potato Puree (nice and creamy - good flavor). For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu (really well done!) and Gelato (chocolate and vanilla with ginger snap cookies). A nice wine menu and we shared a bottle of red, which accompanied our meal nicely. Definitely a spot I would return to if I were back in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Figo last night, and I was a little back and forth about going. I've been to Byblos and Patria, and while I went into both wanting to love them, I left underwhlemed. So I was afraid this might be the same, but it wasn't the case. The food was excellent, but the reason for 3 stars was the service we received.  We had made a reservation, so when we got there our table was ready - however it was the table closest to the kitchen and poor guys who have to work in there it was bloody hot and the sitting at that table was hotter than it was outside, which is frankly impressive given it was still 30+ degrees outside. So we asked to move to the patio and luckily there was a table. So far so good.  However, after initially taking my drink order, the server did not return for a long time. Someone else brought my wine, but our server did not come back for 25 minutes (yup I counted) to take our order. But she was around our table all the time, refilling our the next tables water, making chitchat, etc. I was trying to make eye contact to no avail, and it's not like we were sitting there poring over our menus. They were closed, generally a clear sign people are ready to order. When she finally did take our order, I asked between a couple of dishes for a recommendation, and instead received an explanation of the dishes. I know what burrata is, I understand that tortelli is stuffed, what I'm asking for is what would you recommend. Anyway, after not getting a suggestion I went with the burrata which was excellent.  Our food was served by another server and came fairly quickly. The burrata was excellent - not quite as soft as a true burrata in my experience, but very flavourful. My husband had the bucatini which he said was good, but not amazing. Overall though, I'd say the food was solid.  However, as I said the service was not good particularly given that other tables were being served more diligently. And I couldn't help but notice we were the only non-white couple in the vicinity. I'm not saying that's why we weren't served as well, but I am saying that I noticed a difference. I decided to mention this to the manager as we left, because it was bad enough that I wouldn't go back. To the manager's credit he listened to what I shared and did not get defensive or try to deny my experience. Instead he apologized, said that was absolutely not what they were about and gave me his card in the hopes we'd go back. I'm still on the fence about it, but the food really was quite good."}
{"text":"Do not come here for brunch. The menu is super basic and the food is very bland. It's actually pretty overpriced for the quality of food. You are paying for the atmosphere which is pretty nice but don't get the food. If you come here then go for drinks only."}
{"text":"Figo is absolutely lovely with an Instagram-worthy interior. The kitchen is open which is something I particularly love to see in restaurants. In the summertime they have a pretty big patio space out front decked with cute tables and chairs.  We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away. I was disappointed that they don't offer brewed coffee here but I ordered the americano instead based on the recommendation by the waiter. We got the classic breakfast and the cacio a pepe. There was a bit of a mixup and instead of the classic breakfast, they brought out something that was a cross between both of the items we ordered which was kind of weird. They apologized for the mistake and brought out bacon and tomatoes on the side which would've come with the breakfast. In my opinion, for exactly the same price the cacio a pepe is basically a scaled down version of the classic breakfast except you get cheese in your scrambled eggs. I don't really care for cheese in my eggs (actually prefer without) so next time I would definitely just order the classic breakfast!  Food was good and so was the ambiance. I think Figo is deserving of 3.5 stars and I'd come back for brunch."}
{"text":"Food is average, ambience is fine, but my real issue was the service and the attitude of the place.  I made a reservation for out of town guests well in advance, and received a call a few days before the reservation that \"due to high demand on that day, the menu will now be a prix fixe menu\", at a much higher price than I intended to pay for my group.  To me this is unacceptable and says something about management.  If a guest makes reservations, to call a couple days before and say the menu is now limited and at an increased price is not right.  This needs to be stated at the time of reservation.  The lady I was speaking to offered no apology for the last minute change and said \"it is a management decision...a lot of people are reserving for that night.\"  That's not right.  I am fairly forgiving for a poor experience, or a server having an off day, however this just rubbed me the wrong way and kind of came off like a money grab...we have lots of reservations, so let's switch the menu to a flat high price last minute.  Needless to say I cancelled and am now reservationless for my group!  It's unfortunate - this place is at a great location near my office and I was looking forward to plenty of business lunches/dinners here, however an experience like this makes me actively want to take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Having been suggested Figo through a colleague I was impressed with its mix of an authentic Italian dish restaurant and laid back atmosphere.  The menu was simple which makes it a great quick bite after work restaurant but was very satisfying as though you ate at a notable establishment.  Service was great and everyone was open to serving you better in a easy going way.  Had the gnocchi and palenta which were very delicious.  Indulged in some desserts and was very impressed with the variety.  The prices were a little on the high end so o would frequent this place for special occasions or with company you enjoy.  Some good craft beers as well.  Will definitely return to try the pizza."}
{"text":"This review applies to brunch only. I was looking forward to this visit as the feedback from hard to please friends was positive. Add to that they took reservations for brunch (apparently getting harder by the day or weekend :)  was a major plus as we were a larger group. They have a decent selection of items which should cover all bases. The prix fix caught my eye so decided to stick to that. I had the arancini which was great the eggs benny (below average as the bread was sub par) and affagato for dessert. The side of potato was tasteless and forgettable. Others in the group said the pizza was decent which could also be substituted to a margherita. The baked eggs also fared well. Omelette was OK as well. Hmm nothing special here with decent service. I might come back for a dinner as that has a lot more positive feedback."}
{"text":"A friend and I scoured some menus looking for a trendy, new spot when we found Figo. Who doesn't love Italian? We made a reservation and off we went. I made the reservation a week in advance and there was nothing available between 7 and 9pm! This place must be good. We went at 6:15pm and it was fairly empty, but by it was brimming with patrons.    The cocktail menu is interesting. The flavour combinations were hard for me to imagine together. You just have to pick one that has a few ingredients you like and dive in. There were a few things I'd never had or heard of before..made me feel like I've lived a sheltered cocktail life. :P   The menu was small, but it was still hard to decide. It's nice to see restaurants stick with what they're good at instead of offering lots of mediocre food. I went with the Gnocchi and my friend chose the Tortelli. So, when I say the service was fast, I mean FAST. We ordered, our server left and came back with food. These chefs were prepared for the rush! The food was hot and fresh. The Gnocchi was smothered in tomato sauce and sprinkled with basil and buffalo ricotta. The tomato sauce was just that: tomatoes. Nothing fancy. My friend enjoyed the Tortelli; the sauce was rich with real butter and sage.   Could I say no to dessert in an Italian restaurant? Of course not! Tiramisu is a given and this was the real deal. The bottom was soaked in coffee and it had more layers than I could count. Definitely in the top 5 of tiramisu!   Everyone, from the hostesses to the servers to the chefs, was friendly and pleasant. The décor us uplifting and comfortable.    I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I have walked by here so many times and did not realize this gem existed! I came here with my gf on her recommendation after a Jays game. We were immediately seated on a late Thursday night but it was still pretty packed. The decor was beautiful and it was dimly lit with a beautiful open kitchen in the back. I did feel underdressed in my jean shorts and baseball cap, but there were a mix of people casual and dressy. We started with the house ricotta truffle honey. It was a bowl of creamy goodness. I didn't even need the crostini. I could have sat there with the entire bowl and spoon. So delicious and not overly rich. I wish I had some right now. For dinner I had the tortelli. It was in a butter sage sauce and this was amazing. It is a bit on the smaller side for portion but because I had the ricotta it was fine. I took my spoon and made sure all that sauce was in my belly! For dessert we shared the tiramisu. This wasn't anything to brag about but it was still good. My friend had the gnocchi and it was a nice soft pillow in my mouth. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I had brunch at Figo last Sunday and was quite impressed. We arrived and got seated right away being we had reservations. The table for the 2 of us was quite small but at the same time it was kinda cozy. The waiter attended to us right away and brought water with him which I loved because at some restaurants you are a) waiting for the waiter and then when they arrive you have to b) wait for them to return with your water. He asked us what would like to drink and I got the white Pinot which was the special of the day and my girlfriend got a cappuccino. It was not too long before he returned with our beverages to take our orders. He asked if we had any questions about the menu and I asked for his breakfast favourite and he suggested the pancakes. I wasn't in a pancake mood (I always get the pancakes) so I asked about the eggs benedict and he said they were really good so I opted for it.  Our breakfast arrived very quickly and it was delicious. The hollandaise was very appetizing and I enjoyed the smashed potatoes. The tomato focaccia was the perfect pairing with the eggs and completed the meal. It was light but also filling, perfect. I will definitely be visiting Figo again it exceeded my expectations.   Oh! and the interior of the restaurant is decorated to perfection. I love the white wire chairs and wooden tables. Everything looks clean and pristine. Definitely my type of spot for brunch!"}
{"text":"An exceptional dining experience from beginning to end. The drinks, food and staff were all so wonderful. We felt like we were well taken care of. Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"When I arrived at Figo I fell in love with the ambience. I said \"I want to have all my birthday parties here!\" Then I had the food and I changed my tune.   The service at Figo is excellent. The food is nicely presented but extremely bland.   I am thoroughly disappointed with my meal at Figo. Maybe it's because Toronto Life put it on the top restaurants of 2016 list, maybe it's because the owner typically puts out great restaurants, or maybe it's because of the head chef's credentials. It could be a combination of all three. I will most likely never return to Figo. It's a shame because there was so much potential.  The main issue is that the food is BLAND.   We had: Fig homemade ricotta cheese - 2/5 I got this because it was well reviewed in Toronto Life. The jelly was good, the prosciutto was okay (crispy) but the ricotta was noting special.  Margarita pizza - 2/5 There was a good amount of basil and the cheese was a decent quality but the crust sucked. I can't put my finger on what was wrong with it, but I have had MUCH better pizza. For a chef who came from BUCCA, this is even more of a let down.   Arctic char - this was a substitute for the snapper which they were out of. 1/5 SO BLAND. They piled fresh herbs on top of this bland piece of fish, but what it really needed was some salt and pepper.  Scallops - 2/5 bland. Despite the herbs and sauce and roasted vegetables on top these scallops were not tasty.   Black kale side - 2/5 for diet food this is a 4/5 but for a restaurant that is supposed to be tasty this just didn't deliver. This dish NEEDED salt.  For desert we had the chocolate gelato - 2/5 very heavy on the bitter cocoa. Good if you like that taste. The cookie it came with was just okay.   All in all the food was extremely under seasoned and very disappointing. I don't recommend Figo."}
{"text":"Went for lunch this week. The décor is beautiful. OMG, the food was SO bland!  Does the chef not TASTE this before plating it? We started with the ricotta honey appy and  the leek soup. How can Leek soup have NO taste? I went on to a very pricey Nicoise salad.  SO bad, just so bad that I had to tell the waiter how incredibly bland it was. I'm so disappointed. Had great expectations for such a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to hit up for drinks after dinner or a movie. There is a bar tender there so hot I could die. Looks like the guy from Sons of Anarchy. Smart business move to get my $17 per cocktail. For that face? Gladly. My girls and I tried every cocktail creation they had to offer, and all were delicious. I'll have to go back to try the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is decorated so beautifully, and their patio is sunny and full all summer long. If you're an instagrammer, it's a popular destination for that and photographs well. That being said, Figo has a ways to go. I've been here twice now and the service is super inattentive until you want to pay. Also, my boyfriend ordered the Char tonight and it was the most boldly underwhelming entree I have seen in my life. $30 for a small (like 100g... not kidding) fillet with parsley on it. No veg or anything. It was virtually indistinguishable (taste wise) from a frozen High Liner fish fillet you would get at the grocery store. Also, when we gave our server feedback he blamed the kitchen... lol why? It's your management that decides what an entree looks like. Two stars because they have an unreal seafood fritti app. Everything else points us to other restaurants more deserving of our business."}
{"text":"It was kind of risque going here one week after their opening, but you wouldn't know it given all the familiar faces from other Khabouth-group restaurants and the seamless service.  The space is absolutely gorgeous. The bar area is sublime, and the ceiling is just magnificent. I suspect Figo will become quite popular, if it's not already; the place was packed with patrons. Not cheap either but the food delivered on all fronts. They're not joking around here. The exec chef earned her pedigree at Buca, Scaramouche and Lee and their pizza/pasta game is on point. So are their cocktails.   --Burrata: This dish was outstanding. Served with melon, huckleberry and crisp bread.  --Tortelli (ricotta-arugula, butter, sage) were surprisingly light. Portion was on the smaller side. Okay, seriously, throw a bit more tortelli my way.  --Bucatini: Wild boar ragu, perfect for those winter nights --Half chicken: they ran out of this dish pretty quick  --Rainbow trout crudo: love the scandinavian added elements of sea buckthorn. --Tiramisu: this is good for sharing because it was really rich. I was surprised how \"classic\" their dessert menu was; hope to see more \"creative\" dishes in the future.  Che figo!"}
{"text":"A lovely brunch in a pretty environment but Figo didn't possess anything in particular that would make me rush back.  Highlight: Beautiful setting and close to downtown core"}
{"text":"Good was good, atmosphere nice, server attentive, and kinda cool restrooms. VERY simple menu."}
{"text":"Figo's atmosphere and the service is really why I am giving this place 4 stars.  The food wasn't really all that or anything to rave about, except the ricotta with honey and cracked sea salt / pepper was VERY GOOD.  However, it was a little much and rich.  We did the 3 course meal, which honestly made the most sense.   We went around 2PM on a Saturday and it was not too crowded at all.  We did have reservation though and were seated immediately.  We sat outside which was VERY nice- i really liked the area outside.  It wasn't too crowded The selection on beer was not all that either as it was limited to about 6-7 if I remember correctly.    Honestly not sure about the parking situation, because we stayed at a hotel which was in walking distance... I did see somewhere $20 though- not sure if that's still a fact...   I don't think I would come back here, but I would say that overall I had a great experience, but I really like mouthwatering food and unfortunately Figo didn't do it for me/us."}
{"text":"Sexy setting for a bright brunch or romantic cocktail.  Went here with my bestie for a progressive lunch and this was the first stop.  Great wine by the glass or bottle selection.  Deliciously executed apps. We had the burrata and arancini.  Perfect accompaniment for our full bodied wine.  Will be back here again for more drinks!"}
{"text":"Everything we tried on the menu was great. Would highly recommend the steak and the margarita pizza. Last I went was on a Sunday and the restaurant wasn't so busy which was great because the service was exceptional. We had a movie to catch and managed to get in and out in about 40 minutes."}
{"text":"AVOID THE BAKED EGGS! AMAZING PANCAKES!   Great brunch experience soured by overcooked  and odd (for lack of another unappetizing word) tasting baked eggs.   FANTASTIC pancakes: perfectly fluffy served with mascarpone and maple syrup.  They ran out of the frittata too early on a Sunday. It looked great which would've saved us from the dreaded baked eggs."}
{"text":"If you want Italian food I do not suggest this is the place to go in Toronto . I was in with a group and can honestly say mediocre at best anything higher than a 2 is impossible to give ."}
{"text":"Good ambiance and service, and pretty good food! Really gorgeous interior, and out professional servers.  Went in a large group so we were limited to the prix fixe menu. There's not much selection on the menu: soup or salad to start, tomato basil pizza or tomato basil pasta as main, and a scoop of gelato to finish.  I did halvsies with a friend though, so got to try everything. The salad was great - a huge pile of arugula with parm, and the soup was ok (yellow lentil soup with turmeric) but came with really good bread. The pizza was done well - not too thick or thin, and not burnt to around the edges, which is how I like it. The pasta was really chewy, felt a little harder than al dente. Blueberry gelato was ok. Flavour tasted a bit artificial. I heard the chocolate gelato was amazing though!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch and dessert! All the pizzas are to die for! Desserts all made in house and so delicious! I would recommend going morning-noon-early evening for the patio; such an incredible vibe out there! Beautiful restaurant inside, really eye-catching decor!"}
{"text":"The Bucatini... sooooo gooood!!!!! The pizza is amazing- they have a pizza stove in the kitchen! The decor is lovely and service is great. Patio seating in warm weather is a must"}
{"text":"A very pretty resto with unique design, though a bit dark and hard to get around. Good food, enjoyed the group prix fixe. Super rich and quite sweet - everything really. The arugula salad was well done, zucchini fritti were WAY too oily, arancini are delicious. Yummy Cornish hens though very sweet. Arctic char was lovely. So filling. Potato and rapini sides are ok. Delicate and tasty panna cotta dessert and good gelato. Wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food leaves to be desired... Their pasta is not very impressive... something that you could easily replicate in your own kitchen...  Tried both the spaghetti limone and the tagliatelli... not overly tasty but highly pretentious.  The appetizer, beats with strawberry was an interesting combination; however way to salty and the vinegar was overpowering.  The desert, tiramisu was made in house and it was  pretty good... Unfortunately there was no trace of mascarpone in it which was replaced by whip cream... nevertheless, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Boy was I ever disappointed. Where should I start? The tap water was room temperature; and our Toronto city water isn't anything to be coveted. Then again, good move on the restaurant's part to up sell $20 cocktails, etc.   Not to go overboard on my first visit, we ordered simple meals that even a junior chef wouldn't have problems heating up in a microwave. The was where the disappointment began. The clam pasta was of average flavour; however, it was the clumping of the pasta that threw off the entire plate. It wasn't one or two strands that were clumped together. It was practically the entire dish.   The pizza we order was just so average. Considering the hype and reviews this was a complete let down as we have had much better in Toronto. It was borderline soggy and not cooked the way expected.   I would surmise the popularity of Figo has to do with its location as its convenience to many entertainment facilities and offices."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Went here with a group of 7 for a birthday on a Wednesday night. Service was very attentive despite it being busy. We ordered some appetizers to share and also shared a few mains while some people got their own.  Everything was delicious. Our favorites were the zucchini - spiralized and lightly fried and drizzled in honey; fresh ricotta with oil and pine nuts; warm mushroom and arugula salad; gnocchi - served in a simple tomato sauce, was delicious and perfect; the pizzas were all delicious.   Had a decent wine list although I wasn't in charge of ordering.   Appetizers were 10-15 and Maine were 30-40. Sides were about 10 dollars extra and weren't included in the mains.   Overall surpassed my expectations - I thought we were going to another showy place on King west but I was pleasantly surprised, will definitely be going back.  It is a bit loud FYI."}
{"text":"A few bites from our full review -  \"The feel of classy feminine lightness was in the air with plenty of off-white shades, veiny marble and a ceiling unlike any other. \" \"The Zucchini Fritti arrived first, creating a small mountain of fried tempura-coated zucchini, thinly cut in swirls. The dish was sweet and crispy with a subtle hint of key lime pie, as it dripped honey - a bit too much for us.\""}
{"text":"Coming from the entertainment masterminds which brought us Colborne Lane, Spice Route,  Koolhaus/Guvernment, and Ultra Supper Club (and a long list of others), one would expect a well-crafted dining experience, and Figo largely upholds this expectation. Among its family, Figo is equally self-assured, but a much more poised, light and airy sibling thanks to its high glass walls and penchant for off-white + clean-line decor, though some bold flair is found around the restaurant - from the bright pink bathroom tiles, rose-printed ceilings, to the broad checkered arches which frame the open kitchen.   As my party of four arrived for lunch on Saturday, the restaurant was only 1/5 full and very low-key - I can't even recall any background music playing.   To start, we ordered a bottle of '14 Tenuta Santome Sauvignon Blanc, which was pleasantly fruity and robust, but disappointingly served too warm. The ricotta and truffle honey crostinis were loved by all - simple but thoroughly stimulating on the palette.   As mains my fellow diners had the soppressata pizza, bucatini with wild boar ragu, and burrata, while I opted for the seared snapper. I can only comment on the snapper. Beautifully presented, the star of the dish was actually the fresh mixed herbs and bed of sauteed black kale, which was fresh and simply prepared - in true Italian spirit. Unfortunately, the snapper was just not fresh and the quality / aroma of the fish fundamentally let its execution down. Given the snapper was not as sweet as it could have been and the greens were already quite meaty, I would design the dish with cod rather than snapper to create wider spectrum of texture, rather than relying too heavily on the  quality of the fish as the signature. Knowing that excellent seafood is hard to come by in Toronto, I probably should have mentally prepared myself for the slight let-down on this very reasonably priced dish. Everyone else at the table was very pleased with their dishes, although I did make a mental note that the bucatini's plating seemed a bit sloppy.  Service was very attentive and non-intrusive through-out, and our laid-back server took good efforts to connect with our table. Though we sat at a table right next to the open-concept kitchen, noise was not noticeable at all. What was noticeable, however, was the constant draft coming from a high vent above. Oh well, nothing a good cocktail won't fix (which I'm told are all designed by the bartender in-house).  So, to end the meal a couple of us opted for cocktails and another tried the Panna Cotta. The Tequila-based Trans-Atlantic was very enjoyable - an earthy, herbaceous remix of the classic margarita, and fondly reminded me of freshly cleaned carpet. The Jet Lag, however, was not my cup of ... cocktail .... reminding me of dark and dingy convenience stores (my friend suggested it was the bitters I didn't like - fair enough).   As we got the bill, I asked our server what \"Figo\" meant. Turns out, Figo translates to the equally homonymic english word \"cool\". Ahhh - makes sense now doesn't it.   In sum, I would consider this a fine establishment to bring my visiting parents for lunch, or colleagues for civilized after-work cocktails. Fine-dining foodies should already know... being Figo sometimes means sacrificing substance for style."}
{"text":"Great location, stylish ambience, and promising menu; unfortunately, probably the worst Italian food in all of Toronto.  Went as a group of four and collectively tried: scallops, branzino, lamb, black kale, polenta, and savoy cabbage.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the mains are presented without any accompaniment - ex, scallops are literally three small scallops for $36.  Sides must be ordered separately.  We were willing to overlook this but unfortunately each and every dish was terrible.  I had the scallops which were hard - crispy and rubbery.  Another friend had lamb which he said was terrible.  The branzino was the best dish but likely only bc my friend ordered it specifying no salt and no oil.  The black kale was extremely salty but edible.  The polenta was so salty it was literally inedible.  The savoy cabbage was sickly sweet and so terrible that we had to send it back.  Only ok menu items were alcohol (out of a bottle) and gelato (out of a box).  I will give props to the servers.  Our server seemed aware of how atrocious the food was and replaced the savoy cabbage immediately.  Not sure what the restaurant owners are thinking - great location, beautiful ambience, but absolutely atrocious food.  I would not recommend dining here, even out of curiosity.  Stick to a drink on the patio at most and don't let the promising sounding food menu tempt you.  Absolutely vile."}
{"text":"almost impossible to find parking nearby, and when you do find a spot, it's $20 flat rate. i guess it's better for locals to come here, don't drive here. Place looks nice and big on the outside but inside is pretty tight and tables are pretty close together, chairs are big and table is small pretty bad layout. what is worst is that service AND food was super slow and the food was nothing special."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Friday night. We had no reservations and was told the wait was 30-45 minutes even though there was a bunch of seats available in the dining room and other walk-ins were immediately being seated. Aside from that, the decor was very nice and had a great atmosphere. I heard lots of good reviews for this place and I had to try it out for myself.  The food was good but i found everything to be very very oily. We ordered the fried calamari, sopressata pizza, mushroom pizza, and the pasta with clams. My favourite had to be the pasta since it was very light and not too heavy. I definitely expected more from this place since I've heard all positive reviews however I was a bit disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"We dined on a Sat evening - our first time there. We were fortunate to get a table on the patio - it is a large patio.  The staff was friendly and attentive. The zucchini fritti is different and fun. Also ordered the radicchio salad (it was average) and the ricotta with fig/prosciutto (delicious) appetizers. We had the gigli lobster pasta (delicious and filling), and the arctic char (prepared a little rare, very good but didn't come with any sides so make sure your order separately). The waiter recommended the Figo cocktail - YUM - we had a few. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Really gorgeous atmosphere, great space on the patio, but the interior decor is worth sitting inside! Perfect for date night, group brunching, cocktails, or other events. The food was really good quality (We ordered a variety of pizzas to share) as well as wine to drink!  I definitely recommend going to Figo!! It also gets really busy so I suggest making a reservation as well."}
{"text":"Figo has a great atmosphere to it - especially at night. I've come a couple of times and have introduced my friends outside of the GTA to the place. During the summer months, the patio can get filled fast, so it's best to make a reservation.  I've always had great food and great service at Figo and love all the pastas I've tried.  My only thing to look out for is the fact that it's on the pricier end for a casual lunch (but it's never bad to treat yourself every now and then!)"}
{"text":"** 3.5 stars ***  4 stars for the ambiance (beautiful - very upscale, trendy, classy, etc - they have won interior design awards) and 3 stars for the food.  We ate here because we didn't have a reservation anywhere else on a Friday night and they were able to seat us quickly, and it served us well.  But if you are planning ahead and focused on food rather than vibe, you may want to keep looking, or just come here for drinks before or after dinner.  House Ricotta - this is definitely worth getting; it was the best thing here. We had the truffle honey with black pepper. I'm not the biggest ricotta fan in general, but I really enjoyed this.  For my main I had the branzino, which was fine, but definitely didn't stand out.  It lacked real flavor or kick. For $36, definitely not worth it and I'd try something else should I come back.  A drinks and appetizers place rather than a dinner spot."}
{"text":"Figo has a super sexy bar and the mixed drinks are just as pretty. However aside from perfect lighting and atmosphere their food is lacklustre at best. Usually pretty apprehensive about \"Italian\" restaurants around town to begin with. But I was hopeful that this one would be different. Not sure if my expectations are just too high or I just don't see the value in what's available on most menus.   1. Last night we tried their Ricotta with fig which was meh... at the end of the day Ricotta is a bland and tasteless cheese that you have to dress or mixed with something for it to be palatable. Not my number one go to cheese dish.  2. Sausage Pizza - basically a mish mash  of everything for great color and instagram pictures however the flavors were not cohesive. PIzza crust was great, perfectly thin and crunchy where it counts.   3. Next I had their clam tagliattelle the clam broth was delicious with lots of dill flavor. But the downside is, it was if as they had asked their distributer for the smallest unsellable clams to use for the dish. Tagliatelle texture was a bit sad and over done.   4. Tiramisu - pretty good, nothing special     Panna Cotta - tasted okay served right in the bowl. Nice light dessert after a meal.    Figo has a lot going for it. I won't rule them out for another meal here. Given time I'm sure they can come together and serve up great food in this beautiful place."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on a Friday night at 8:30pm. At this point, you need a reservation; so plan ahead -- I booked two days in advance.  Great ambience. Pleasant service; prompt with the food but maybe a bit hard to grab afterwards. Both our servers were very sweet; one of them could have starred in When Harry Met Sally, clothes and all.  The food was good but a bit pricey.  We had (in order of tastiness):  Burrata: incredible, highly recommended -- very good burrata (and lots of it), beautiful presentation, nice pairing with melon -- I would go back just for this dish.  Branzino: very well prepared. The plate was a bit sparse for the price ($36!!)  Arugula salad: ample and tasty. Nice crunchy bits but the arugula could have been more peppery  Black Kale side: good, no complaints  Ricotta (w/ red grapes and chili oil): I suggest avoiding it unless you want an oily chin. Both the ricotta and the crostini were too greasy. And the chili oil wasn't hot. This was the low point of the evening.  We also had a couple of glasses of red wine: one primitivo (A. Mano). Nothing special, actually kind of average.  All in all, if you want Italian, I would choose Gusto 101 over this place: similar food quality but Gusto is cheaper and has better wine by the glass. Unless you want burrata, mmm, that burrata. Or you like Meg Ryan. Then Figo is for you. Actually, I think I'm going to go back right now for more of that burrata."}
{"text":"Great variations of Italian food. The Cornish Hen is very tender, slightly sweet with a bit of Mexican flavor twist. The seafood dish with mussle, clams and salmon is amazingly delicious. The pork belly ricotta is very good too. Most other tables ordered pizza and pasta and they seem to be enjoying those. Service is great as well. Wine list is pretty long, although very pricey."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous new Italian restaurant and impeccable service.. but the food fell a bit short for me.  Chic, modern and charming, the decor and ambience was spot on especially with their impressive open kitchen. For a new restaurant, the place operated like a well-oiled machine. The servers were very knowledgeable and experienced with the menu which had a good amount of options and variety. Service was very attentive - my water and wine glasses were never empty.  Where the seams came apart a little bit for me was the food.  Radicchio salad ($13) - watercress, parmigiano and apple vinaigrette. The greens in this dish was quite bitter and just wasn't able to taste much from it beyond the bitterness.  Sea bream crudo ($14) - like ceviche this was thin slices of sea bream cured in citrus juice with chili and basil. Sounded really appealing but tasted just okay and was such a small portion. Shared between 2 people I only had a few mouthfuls.  Mushroom pizza ($19) - out of everything we had, I liked this the best. With caramelized onion, watercress, potato and truffle, it tasted like a wood oven pizza which I enjoyed.   Fregula pasta ($18) with mussels - in a tomato sauce (more like tomato soup actually) the fregula pasta are very tiny little pasta balls. Mussels were good but I think my issue was that tomato sauce tasted kind of plain..  Comments on food aside, I'm a sucker for how beautiful the restaurant looks and think this would be great place to check out for drinks but the food just missed the mark for me."}
{"text":"This was an excellent meal. The space is beautiful, the vibe was buzzy for a random Wednesday and the service was really good.   We shared some apps:  Zucchini- light and crispy with a bright, lemony sauce.  Arincini - a must!  Rich and decadent with an even better aioli than the zucchini.  House ricotta with truffle honey - very good.   For the main, I had tortellini in a butter and sage sauce. No kidding about the butter. There must have been 4 sticks worth in that sauce. (No complaints!). Incredibly rich and indulgent.   The wine list was a bit over the top - $41 for a 9oz malbec?  Come on.  I ordered something more economical ($17 a glass, x2).  Even with $34 in wine, my bill was only $75.  A bargain considering the quality of the food.    Italian restaurants are in no shortage in Toronto. This one was special.  Simple but so well done compared to other like places. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We visited Figo for the first time tonight and we're somewhat concerned about some of the Yelp reviews complaining about the service. Our experience tonight was excellent. From the attentive wait staff to the young lady who helped with our wine selection we were well looked after from beginning to end. Food items were explained as they were delivered ...very professional. The starters were tasty...especially the fried zucchini...not to be missed. The ricotta was also excellent. The mains and desserts were very good as well. All in all a very pleasant evening in attractive surroundings. The decor is sophisticated but not stuffy. We will be back."}
{"text":"4.5  Burrata watermelon salad was delicious. One of the best burrata dishes I've ever had. Gnocchi was pretty good but not amazing.  Wine selection was also very good, and service was great as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and even better food!  Definitely recommend for dinner or lunch with friends, or even a date!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with a group of 15 with an 8:30 Reservation. We didn't start off well considering we sat down at 9:30. People without reservations who came in after us had their dinner while we waited at the bar.   Pros: Food- ordered the family style set menu and it was delicious!  Ambiance- fun and funky vibe  Groups- able to take a large group with no set minimums  Cons: - Service: didn't care that we weren't seated,  didn't take drink orders for half the table before food came out Gave us one Cheque for the two split tables in the end and did nothing to help us  Won't recommend when there are so many great restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Went around 1:30pm on Sunday for brunch and it was pretty bumping. I was lucky enough to get seated right away for a table of 2. I started off with some mimosa (can up the oz a tad bit) then the eggs benedict. The eggs were slightly over poached but the toast with tomato and caramelized onions was SO good. But the potatoes were definitely the scene stealer. It's super buttery with some kind if pesto on top which was super flavourful. My friend got the classic breakfast with scrambled eggs and it was perfectly cooked the european way with bacon, potatoes, butter toast + grilled tomatoes. The meal was all over a great experience with friendly-chic yet romantic ambience + professional service. The food wait time wasn't as long as other places either which was a big plus. I'd for sure come back but would make reservations ahead of time as seating is limited."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for dinner, and shared all our plates so that we could both have a taste of everything!  Their truffle honey ricotta was my favourite! It's served with a few slices of toasted (?) bread. I would definitely go back just to have that! The arancini and gnocchi was alright. The mennonite lamb was amazing! We had also ordered fries, and drinks.   The decor in the restaurant is nice too, very chic. We were seated almost next to the open air kitchen so we could see which dishes were the post popular!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: order the mushroom pizza and lemon caper pasta (not sure what the name is). I definitely would come back for just those two dishes. :)  I don't remember the name of all the dishes, but here is the gist of what I ordered: clam pasta (my main dish), boar pasta, lemon honey ricotta appetizer, zucchini appetizer, brussel sprouts side, mushroom pizza, and grilled fish.   The clam pasta had a nice hint of spiciness from the chili flakes; however, it was on the oily side."}
{"text":"Nice decor.  It was really warm the day I came here.  I had a reservation and had to wait a bit for my table.  The hostesses knew the girl who came in after me, but promptly seated her at a patio table outside.  Other than that, the food was ok.  I was meeting a friend so the company was good.  I don't think it was the best italian food I've ever had, but it was ok.  Definitely a 3 star kind of place."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, lovely atmosphere. The decanters were tasty and great for sharing. We had the Punch Americano and Punch Electrico.   I booked a sunday brunch for my birthday party of 8. Please note if you come in a large party you are forced to order from the brunch prefix. I was a bit disappointed by this because I saw a table of 4 get ricotta pancakes, meat balls and a burger which are not allowed to be ordered. Although the prefix is a good deal. I was  willing to splurge $$ more for variety but it wasn't allowed. Maybe we should have just split our group up.  Those who ordered the cacio e pepe eggs loved it but also paid $6 more to add bacon. I suggest passing on the bacon. I'm a bacon lover; myself and 3 others did not enjoy Figo's version of bacon.  Best of our meal was the Affogato.   Worst was service from our server. The other staff were a bit robotic but pleasant.  One of my friends received an incorrect order. She 100% did not order this because I specfically remember the debate and heard her order. Maybe our server heard wrong which is an honest mistake. But it wasnt okay when he showed her his notepad and tried to tell her that it was what she ordered. He took away the incorrect dish but we all felt the defensiveness was unnecessary. We also did not quite like him off the bat because some of us weren't ready and we asked him to start orders on the other side but he said no (how rude) because he has to take orders in a specific order and forced my friend to rush to figure out what she wants so she wouldn't keep us waiting. Overall we just didn't like his persona, we can tell he was pretending to be nice. You know what I mean? Maybe come to figo in smaller parties and avoid the \"mean\" waiter. Large parties don't seem to get treated very well. What a birthday eh."}
{"text":"Made reservations for my birthday and to my surprise, they were fairly empty. I love the ambience of the restaurant - it's soft and intimate. Bonus points for coat check!  We ordered the pork belly ricotta with maple glaze, zucchini fritti with crema fresca and honey, beef carpaccio, and a cacio e pepe pizza all to share. All the appetizers were amazing! Each had an excellent balance of flavour, texture, and presentation. I never order pizza at restaurants and I definitely regretted it. Really not a fan (as my sister would say).  To finish, we had a tiramisu, panna cotta with amarena cherries, aged balsamic and salt, and a latte. The tiramisu tasted like chocolate than coffee. The cherry, balsamic and salt on the panna cotta was too overpowering that I felt like proportions were not right. Otherwise, the flavour was unique and tasty. My latte was cold so I asked them to make me a new one that was hot."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about then hostess.. she wasn't that friendly but when we sat down the server had made up for it..Really great service... glass never empty and the wine expert had great suggestions.. I'd come back"}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor here is absolutely amazing. Lighting is perfect, everything white and bright! Perfect for taking pictures :)   Now lemme get onto the 3 star situation.  First, service wasn't that great. Our server didn't have any recommendations for us when I asked him for suggestions (as it's my first time here). Made it seem like the restaurant didn't have any signature dishes to try.  Second, there were SOOO many flies in the restaurant. It was extremely annoying and disgusting. Flies were all around our table, touching our food and on the ceiling lights. I really hate bugs, so this basically ruined my experience.  Third, food wasn't anything special. Pizza crust was way too crispy and hard. The outer edge had to be torn off because it was difficult to bite.   Brunch menu isn't that great. Limited selections. I want to try their zucchini fritters and pasta but it wasn't on the menu. Not sure if I want to be back with all those flies though."}
{"text":"The food lacked flavour. The staff were courteous but not overly friendly.  I doubt I'll be back.  I think there are much better options at this price point in the city."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 10/10 at 8pm.  Our group of 5 ate appetizers, dinner and dessert here.  I'd recommend this restaurant to others specifically to have a drink and experience the atmosphere of the restaurant, then continue exploring the city for the rest of the evening. It has a classy but warm, spectacular inviting vibe once inside."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner before we went to the movies.  It's a very trendy spot, and the decor feelings the same.  The inside is beautiful and the patio has similar clean looking decor.  Service was nice.  My friend and I shared the Honey Ricotta, the scallops, arancini and tiramisu.  We both had tap water to drink and with tax and tip it came to just under $80 and I was still hungry.    The food was all really good.  The prices are a bit on the pricey side, but the food delivers in flavour.  Expect to spend a bit more if you want to leave with a full tummy."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5 star.  The ambience and decor is chic, modern, and beautiful. Very detailed design from the ceiling to the tiles on the bathroom. Kind of remained me of Colette cafe, but in pink.  The chairs on the high top tables were very modern and most importantly, comfy to sit on.   I called to make a reservation because they didn't have anything available online. I left a message and they returned my call on the same day. Points for that! They only had a high top seat for 3, but it was ok. There's a lot of low two seaters, perfect for a date.  The verdict on food:  Punch Americans: sweet and strong. Nothing too special. $15 (B)  Beet salad: very good. A lot of ingredients including pine nuts, hummus, different types of beets, and Persimmon. The persimmon added a very sweet flavour. $15 (A+)  Zucchini fries: very unique. I liked the lemon, sweet crema, but the fries itself was very oily. $11 (B+)  Wild boar ragu: it was essentially ground pork with pasta. Too much meat and not enough pasta. Good amount of taste. It was ok, but nothing special and it certainty wasn't work $21 (B)  Duck confit pasta: I tried this and it was pretty good. Very unique taste and flavourful. I liked this dish more than my main. $27. (A)  Chocolate cake with vanilla gelato: warmed chocolate cake. I liked it. (A)  Overall, I liked the apps more than I liked the mains. Our server wasn't very friendly, but did her job and made sure we were never empty on our water. I liked this place, but it didn't wow me so I don't know if I would come back for mains. Maybe I'll come back to try their other apps! Usually with a 3.5 rating on Yelp is a hit or miss for me, and perhaps, I had more expectations of loving this place!"}
{"text":"Personally, I think this place is overpriced. The location is perfect, and the interior design is beautiful, but the food is average. It's always crowed.   I have seen photos of brunch on the internet, the food is very photogenic for instagram purpose."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk inside is that the restaurant is spacious and tastefully decorated. It's a good place for a date or meeting with friends and family. They can also accommodate large parties. We went for weekend brunch. Their menu is small, but curated. The mushroom pizza we ordered was delicious with a hint of truffle oil. Other people at the table had the classic breakfast, eggs benedict, cacio e pepe and pancakes. The quantity was substantial and everyone was satisfied with their choice. A chocolate gelato ending was delicious as well. Overall a solid choice.  Bonus, they also have a nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I came to Figo more for the environment than the food. The space is bright with beautiful rose ceilings; perfect ambience for date night/long chats, though the music can be a bit loud. Service was excellent - I really liked our server as she was naturally pleasant and took attention to clear & wipe the tables. Our tiramisu dessert was complementary (after we had ordered) because the mains took too long (something I had also noticed, but was not affected by).   Food: 3/5 Generally decent, nothing really stood out, but I didn't like the Zucchini Fritti which was all batter.   Apps/Sides: Beet Salad, Mushrooms in Truffle Butter (good side, but pricey at $14)  Mains:  Soppressata Pizza - this one is for fans of black olives as the olive taste is strong. Also a bit spicy.  Tagliatelle with clams - a light pasta dish  Octopus - nice flavor with this one, and I liked how the chickpeas were not too mushy  Wine: Sauvignon Blanc $10/5 oz. I liked this!   Overall: 3 stars for food + 0.5 for service and ambience"}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night since it's a place that's close by and have been meaning to try. It was pretty packed and we luckily got a seat at the high tables near the kitchen. Otherwise, you should make reservations days in advance as the wait was a few hours for a clear table.  This restaurant has a very nice chic white decor that makes it feel luxury but not pretentious. Most of the wait staff were wearing black nike shoes so don't feel like you need to be super dressed.  We ordered the ricotta with figs, sausage pizza, and tagliatelle with clams. The ricotta came first and it tasted fresh although the crostini were pretty oily. The sausage pizza had a good balance of flavours and a little kick to it. The pasta was thinner than expected at other italian places and some of it clumped together. Not sure if it was because the sauce (which seemed like a white wine, clam sauce) wasn't able to stick to it or they didn't mix it well before plating. Seems like it could be easily rectified or maybe it was a one off. The pasta and clams did taste good and was a light refreshing take on tagliatelle, which usually comes in a tomato base.  Value wise, I would rate it above average in terms of other $15-20/entree establishments and would come back again."}
{"text":"Figo is on a popular intersection in the entertainment centre just around the corner from the TIFF Lightbox. The floor to ceiling glass walls make it a good space to people watch and the decor is stylish and clean. Service was accommodating and more than happy to make recommendations when we were torn between choices.  Food wise, I was disappointed. I had the gnocchi and shared a beet & strawberry salad.  The gnocchi was unfortunately over done, which made it really gummy. Also, the flavor was bland so overall the dish was not to my taste. The beet and strawberry salad was much better, with bright vinegar and sweet notes from the fruit. The food was sub-par but the service was very good."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible hostess and management. The hostesses, especially the one with the tattoos on her chest, were complete bimbos and insensitive of the fact that they were more than 30 minutes late, despite having a reservation for my sister's birthday. What made us angrier is that the hostesses couldn't have cared less that we had to wait WITH reservations, telling us that we may have to \"wait and see\" when asked how long it might be. The manager decided to chime in to apologize and talk to us after half an hour after we had already decided to leave for Pure Spirits instead. The couple behind us were also waiting for 45 minutes despite having a reservation as well. No accountability, and clearly zero qualifications/communication skills necessary for hostessing at Figo."}
{"text":"Came during tiff and service was friendly and fast. The zucchini starter was amazing!!! Although it had gluten, I splurged and did not regret it. I had the lemon pasta with gf spaghetti and it was very tasty. The interior of this restaurant is lovely with lots of windows and a nice patio."}
{"text":"@FigoToronto @nowtoronto @torontolife #FIGO #YELPTO  Figo has been making it to too many top10 lists in Toronto. The blogs should really have \"mystery eaters\" go to this place to really experience the service. The clean design, nicely clad servers, and the decent enough food all go into a 1 star category when the servers start misbehaving. Some detail to my experience:   We were a bachelorette party of 9 looking for a classy brunch. So we made prix fixe reservations at Figo. That's about $32 pp (taxes and tips included). But these guys couldn't care less. NOTE: We were not a rowdy party. But we were an evident bachelorette group with matching shirts. We walk in, it's a nice day and we think about sitting outside. I voiced our request to the hostess - \"Do you think you could seat us outside?\" Her response, accompanied with a frown was, \"No..\" and after a few seconds \"I'll check.\" With that she disappeared for a good 15 mins. Finally, we were seated outside. Another pretty rude lady came by with the water - and kind of clink clanked her way through in a way you don't expect at a classy brunch place.   Anyway, the next guy - who was our server - took the cake. He came by, and without introducing himself clink clanked away the plates infront of us because we were doing prix frix. Then, without a smile on his face, he took our orders. The menu is in Italian and not one of us is - we wouldn't usually know what an Arancino is. Everyone had quick questions for him while ordering. All of a sudden, after taking 5 orders, he goes \"hold up and pay attention please...\" and then describes the 3 appetizers on the menu. He didn't take the time to go through the all the choices for the entrees and desserts as well (about 6 more items) and none of us wanted to really ask him another question after that sudden outburst.   Next, he starts bringing out our teas, coffees and mimosas. No milk, sugar or stirrers, we ask him for some. And he responds \"I only have 2 hands...\" 15 mins later, we still didn't have stirrers and half of us were using our bread knives to stir. He did bring us the milk and sugar in dishes that were unclean.   Then he comes to our table, and starts pulling at the unopen napkins so that the cutlery falls on the table. We'd been given a fork and a knife for our meal; it was probably assumed that we'll eat our appetizers with our hands because he didn't bring out spoons. Upon asking, he brought out spoons and asked which of us wanted them. Meanwhile, some of us had already dug into our appetizers with the stirring spoons or the meal forks.   There was a huge wait between our appetizer and entrée. We didn't really dare to say much. But we did ask the server to bring out the desserts right away. The food was okay at the best. I am never going back. The reason I am detailing this experience is so that whoever reads this review, picks another place for brunch because I really don't want these guys to ever get any business.  While the server was misbehaving, the manager of Figo (who's a total daddy btw) kept looking and smiling at us in a creepy way. But he didn't once approach us to find out if we were doing okay till the very end when half of us had already paid our bills. Our annoyance was a giveaway and he was standing close enough to notice our displeasure.  The server's name is Bruno as per one of our receipts. If the manager is reading this, he should fire him.   And Figo messed with the wrong group. 3 yelp elites and 1 newbie in the crowd!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch. Really nice place, white, grey, clean decor that is inviting. There are some high tables and regular seating. There's  signage for $8 cocktail 5-7.  Lunch was nice! We started with Arancini and ricotta with truffled honey crostini were yummy. We wished the crostini was different, thicker, different bread, something that better complemented the ricotta.   We shared pizza and bucatini with wild boar ragout.To me the bucatini was the highlight. The weather just started to turn cold today and perhaps i found the pasta went cold really quick while we were sharing both and catching up in between.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place reminds me of cafes in Paris or something you'd find on the Champs Elysees. Watercolour imprints of rosepetals on the ceiling, beautiful décor, hints of pink and gold. It was a wonderful setting for a girls night. On a Friday night, it was super busy - there were people on dates, groups of friends, suits who came straight from the office. Swanky, classy setting that doesn't disappoint when it comes to atmosphere (ironically, it's also located right across from the Hooter's on John St., hahah).   First, the parking situation. Street parking is limited. There's a few parking garages and lots along Adelaide and around John St. you may want to consider, and it's also not too far of a walk from Union Station (about 12 minutes).   Second, the service. The hostesses are awfully rude, no question. No smiles, brusque tones, not welcoming at all. Really, really awkward. However, our experience totally improved with our actual server, Denisa, who was so sweet, accommodating, welcoming, and helpful. She may be an anomaly in terms of service here, but she made our experience better, and for this, we thank her!  Third, the food. We ordered a large bulk of items and split it between the four of us: the house ricotta served on baked crostini was fine but very small in size, it's basically crackers and a small mini tray of ricotta with toppings (we got truffle honey with black pepper at $9.00 and figs, port and prosciutto at $8.00), the zucchini fritti (very good, probably my favourite part of the meal! Tasted like zucchini tempura at $11.00), the black kale with crispy garlic at $8.00 (it was fine, the kale was kind of limp), the Gnocchi at $17.00 (pretty good, tasty sauce, but I've had better), and the mushroom pizza at $19.00 (above average, quite tasty, not too doughy which I liked).   Overall, we'd come back here for the atmosphere - the swanky environment is definitely its winning point. The food overall is a hit or miss with the hits being better than average (for me, the hits were the zuchinni fritti and pizza out of everything we had). We split our bill four ways, and for all that food, with tax and tip, my total was around $34.00."}
{"text":"I've been to Figo three times for brunch and loved it every single time. They offer a Prix Fixe option which include app, main and desert. Very worth it. The service is attentive and friendly. And the decor is absolutely beautiful. Definitely instagram worthy. One of my favourite place in town!"}
{"text":"I tried one of their pastas and their desert.  The desert was great but I can't say the same about the food.  The atmosphere is great though.  Worth a try if you haven't been..."}
{"text":"Great vibe! Went for a brunch on the long weekend with a girl friend. We got a nice table and found the setting to be intimate enough to have a good conversation. The brunch options were good but nothing fancy. I ordered the scrambled eggs and my friend got the baked egg (shakshuka) dish. She loved hers but mine was a bit average. We also shared ricotta pancakes as dessert at the end and those were delicious. We got an iced coffee and fresh squeezed OJ for drinks. However for the price of $35/person, it was a bit less than amazing! Lunch and dinner menu looks promising though!"}
{"text":"I love the food, the ambiance, the patio is amazing too. The food is really amazing. But they really don't do takeout, they won't let you. Super strict. But I went back twice in the same week for the mushroom pizza cause it's amazing. Ps. Caciocavallo is a cheese. Try it for sure, you will crave it everyday!"}
{"text":"Do go to this place if you like your food served with a side of attitude! Probably the worst the service I have encountered at a restaurant, this was my first time going for brunch and last time here!   Service Besides the fact that our waiter had horrible customer service skills, who seemed utterly annoyed by his table when asking what the dishes were since they were Italian accompanied by no description. Tip#1 for the waiter: Perhaps explain the menu to the table quickly before asking them to order... Not rocket science!  Tip#2 for the waiter: try to provide cutlery along or before serving, so your customers are not staring at the food go cold!  Tip#3 for the waiter: reserve the attitude and fake a smile...   Restaurant:  Prior to trying to become a fancy brunch  and having a sub par food and forcing mid size parties to preset menus, TRY CLEANLINESS. The restaurant has upholstered chairs which were visibly very stained and looked dirty! The same unclean trend went onto dish ware and cutlery.  I have posted a picture of the dirty stained cream and sugar cups we were given.   Clean your chairs! Clean your dishes! Train your staff!"}
{"text":"First impression, absolutely gorgeous Italian restaurant. The interior is decorated in a very simple yet chic style. I really enjoyed the ambiance. The location of this restaurant is at the corner Adelaide and John Street, but you have to look up to see the restaurant name. I kind of got confused looking for the restaurant because the patio for Figo is right next to Fox and Fiddle's patio (right next door), so I thought it was all the same restaurant.   We didn't seat outside in the patio because there was already a lot of people there, so we opted to seat inside. Our server was very friendly and funny. He wasn't overbearing, but he made sure that our water glasses were always full. The only thing I didn't really like was that he would catch bits of our conversation and make funny comments. Other than that the service was great.   The food was good. I really enjoyed the House Ricotta. We ordered the House Ricotta with pork belly. It was really good, except that the sauce was a bit thick. For my main, I ordered   the House Sausage Pizza. The Pizza was good, the sausage was a bit spicy. But it was the right amount of spicy.   Overall, very good experience although a bit on the pricey side. But a good place to go for a nice Italian meal."}
{"text":"With the beautiful attention to design and central location (amidst a lot of meh restaurants in the Entertainment District), this place is perfect for a girly get together (in fact, every time I go, there seems to be a baby shower or some other similar celebration). In the summer, the patio is great.   This is one of my go-tos for weekend brunch for one reason: eggs cacio e pepe. Order this. It's a generous portion of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs with shaved cheese and pepper on top of bread, with a refreshing side salad and roasted baby potatoes with lots of herb seasoning. It's filling and delicious! They also have a 3 course brunch prix fixe that I had once, but it was too much food for so early in the day! It is a good deal though if you are very hungry. Pizzas are also a solid option here.   I have always found the servers here genuinely friendly and attentive. I even got into a discussion of Netflix shows with one recently, as she overheard my friend and I talking about shows:P"}
{"text":"5 star for ambiance and venue. Great spot for a date! Food was good. We tried the zucchini frites, bucatini -wild boar pasta (probably wouldn't order that again but wanted to try something a little different)  and branzino -whole fish, followed by pistachio and chocolate gelato."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of girlfriends for a birthday dinner. We loved the ambiance- the interior is gorgeous. I would actually give 5 stars for the setting. Food was pretty good, but nothing that I would come running back for. I wanted to order the mushroom pizza, but unfortunately when we came we were told that something was wrong with the pizza dough so it would be 30 minutes before they were able to start making pizza. Instead, we all ordered pasta. They also didn't have the pasta I wanted to order at the time, so instead I ordered the gnocchi. It was really tasty and I would totally order it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back for it. My friends got the tortelli, bucatini, and casarecce with gluten free pasta. I liked the bucatini the best- it was super rich and flavourful.  We also ordered a decanter of their punch americano. It was presented beautifully and very tasty, but warning, you couldn't taste the booze at all if that's your thing. So overall, a good experience but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch one day. One of the lady servers at the bar that was taking out orders was not pleasant at all, made me feel a little uncomfortable. Two salad took about 35 mins to come. Tasted great, was not impressed with service. Hopefully next time service will be better."}
{"text":"All the food was amazing! The honey truffle ricotta to start. Cocktails were great. The decor is absolutely beautiful! The only downfall is the portions feel a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"Came here not knowing much about this restaurant, but was pleasantly surprised, the atmosphere was great, service was fantastic and food was really on point, will definitely be coming back, hopefully they do something for winterlicious or summerlicious"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my girlfriend a few months back.   We ordered the truffle ricotta, wild boar Ragu and mushroom pizza. All the food was very good. I enjoyed the mushroom pizza the most. The Ragu was great but just a bit salty for my taste. I still really enjoyed it and would for sure order it again.   Over all the bill was just a bit over 120, we each had a drink which ended up being the most expensive things we ordered.   For sure will be coming back here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had reservations for 2 @7:30 pm. However, we were free earlier than expected & showed up at 6 pm, the host was accommodating & seated us promptly (even with us changing the request for a patio seating, to now an indoor seating). This should be a standard, having a host who is able to change & be dynamic to the patrons.   We ordered the calamari fritti and the truffle honey ricotta dishes to start & I strongly recommend the calamari, lightly breaded & fried perfectly, portion size is a bit small but that is only because the frying & the sauce accompanying the calamari makes you feel like you haven't had enough. The ricotta was really good, the honey was a good balance to the lemon zest and saltiness of the calamari. Don't be shy to ask for more cristini for the ricotta.    Our server, James, is very well educated about the menu as we had some dietary restrictions; lucky for us, we had James, who saved us from disappointment or having to send back a dish.  We ordered the mushroom pizza, which was really good except for the watercress being topped on top which has trouble staying on the pizza when eating. But the flavor is still good, the cook was done well. & we had also ordered the spaghetti a limone, which was okay, the capers flavor was too overpowering & the oiliness of the pasta was a bit much. It helped to have the pizza crust clean the palette.   Dessert was skipped for my girlfriend & I surprisingly became full.   Overall, our server was quiet, but we personally liked that, he came by and cleaned our dishes when we were done, constantly had our waters topped off, saving me from having to think about that for my lovely date. James is a good server, knowledgeable & seems to get the specific service style to use based on your guests The atmosphere is nice, I do recommend the side by side booth, or the seating closest to the kitchen in front of the wine display wall."}
{"text":"Had my birthday brunch here after wanting to try this place out for a while and I wasn't disappointed! Lovely decor, great service and delicious food! I had the Eggs Benedict and was so excited to eat it that I forgot to take a picture before eating it haha. Also tried the dessert special that day, which was an almond cake that tasted good and was not overly sweet. Would like to try dinner here another time!"}
{"text":"Figo is bright, trendy, and a solid brunch choice. Their brunch menu options are relatively limited - it's mostly egg-based meals - but they execute them well. I had the 'porchetta and eggs' (not pictured). The eggs and arugula accompaniment were standard fare, but the porchetta was deliciously roasted and served with a nice green sauce. And they make a good tiramisu too!"}
{"text":"Environment is good and quietish. The Service was nice. I didn't like that they charged 18$ for an average old fashion drink.$20 with tax!"}
{"text":"This rating is solely because we were served a burnt pizza.  I ate it for lunch the next day and it was very burnt and tasted like charcoal.  The toppings and flavours themselves were delicious, but I was disappointed in the presentation and charred taste."}
{"text":"I'm extremely impressed by Figo.  I had this place on my radar for a long time, but just never managed to get myself there. The feedback from friends was extremely positive. I had a general sense of what to expect in terms of quality.  This place exceeded my expectations for the price point.  The space is wonderful - clean, crisp, modern, large open concept kitchen, with an excellent patio. The service is top notch - extremely attentive and much higher quality than the price point. I'm really impressed - it reflects so well on management.  The food is excellent - I'm a big seafood fan, and specifically branzino. There aren't that many restaurants in Toronto that can really impress me with this dish, and somehow, they're the best I've ever had (including Europe where the fish is from, various restaurants in Toronto and the West Coat/LA) . The fish was cooked perfectly, and they opened up my imagination to some possibilities on how to serve this fish that I haven't seen before. I also have to mention that every single dish I had that night was nothing short of perfect.   Overall, I'm cognizant that it's probably rare to have a perfect dinner night in Toronto these days, but I had it at Figo, and all my friends seem to be saying the same thing.   I'm very impressed and wish this restaurant all the success they deserve. Looking forward to coming back... except for the parking situation, which is terrible in the area."}
{"text":"I have yet to come across a wood-fired pizza as tasty as the mushroom pizza I had here. I'm a fan of mushrooms and caramelized onions and so the both added a nice refreshing touch to the pizza. Loved that the potatoes were thinly sliced and that the pizza was CRIPSY. I've had wood-fired pizzas at a few other notable restaurants and the bottom of the pizzas would be soggy, causing the toppings to slide right off. Figo's pizzas was done just right. Not to mention, I loved the atmosphere, decor and high ceiling/tall windows. Came on a weekday afternoon and it was bustling with people and noise but I didn't mind the dynamics."}
{"text":"Place is cute, food is ok, service is horrible. Last time we went we asked for a table on the patio, the hostess told us there was one available and they were setting it up and we could wait at the bar. We got a drink at the bar and almost 30 minutes later she came to ask us what our name was that we gave for the waiting list??? When I said that we weren't supposed to be on a waiting list she said oh ok they're setting up your table. Then we waited another 10 minutes at least. How does it take 40 minutes to set up a table? I don't mind waiting but we were waiting for no reason. When we did get our table our waiter was super rude. We had pizza left at the end and asked to take it to go and had two half full glasses of wine on the table, went to the bathroom for two minutes and they threw our stuff out. If this was my restaurant I would fire the entire staff."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick bite Tuesday night. Usually skeptical of new restaurants as they need some time to work out the kinks. This place was operating like a well oiled machine that had been open for a year.  Food - 5/5 Ambience - 5/5 Service - 5/5  The mushroom pizza may be one of my favourite pizza's in Toronto. Me and my GF liked it so much, we made a reservation for the following Friday.   Hoping they can sustain the quality so this place can become one of my frequent spots!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty solid here, as is the décor. I came here on a Monday night for dinner. We had the zucchini fritti, arancini, and ricotta with crostini to start. All were good - if you can only try one, I'd go with one of the former two as the crostini breaks very easily so you might not enjoy the eating experience as much. We also had the margherita pizza for our main - we enjoyed it, but probably could've gone without it. For dessert, a heavenly tiramisu made in house - a must try."}
{"text":"Impressive customer service. My friend brought a cake for me. It was not their fault to make the cake mess but they still took the responsibility and gave us a discount. Also, our waiter was nice,too. We started with Burrata. As long as I saw others' review pictures, I decided to try it. Fortunately, it is satisfied. For main, I ordered the Mushroom Pizza. In spite of a little bit dry, the pizza was really tasty, everything was well-balanced. On of my friend ordered the Grilled Whole Branzino. However, it was not soused evenly. The pastas were average. Before I went there, I was attracted by its interior design, especially the roof. The night is another side. Because the space was too close between seats to seats, it was somehow noisy. Overall, we had a nice dinner and a great night together."}
{"text":"Place is beautiful  Our apps were descent  Pasta was very  bad - I had the gnocchi in tomato sauce and I would say Olive Garden   is more authentic Italian . My friend had the pasta ragu and it was like eating saw dust. Our waitress wasn't on the ball either. We waited 10 mins with pasta in front of us for our wine to come. Apparently she's never dined out and thought wine was served after the meal. I would say come for a drink and app sit at the bar but not for a dining experience."}
{"text":"This place looks gorgeous and romantic. Unfortunately their patio gets full really quickly, but the interior is gorgeous.   The starter ricotta is very memorable. So delicious, especially the one with figs. Very rich and flavourful. I've never seen ricotta on its own as a menu item but I am totally into it!  The salad was a generous portion. It wasn't amazing or anything but it was a good, hefty serving. It balanced out everything else I ate there. Less guilt.   The branzino is delicious. They give you a whole fish and take all the bones out for you. It's really delicious. Normally I don't eat the skin because my mother always told me not to, but I found I couldn't help myself, it was so good! Don't tell my mom.   The cocktails were delicious. They messed up the order and I didn't realize it but the bartender did and gave me the right cocktail, so basically I got a bonus cocktail out of it. Score!  Service was good. Atmosphere was gorgeous, especially up at the bar, which appeared to have been made of marble. I love marble. The whole restaurant is beautiful though.   I definitely plan on going back here sometime. It was a really nice experience. Those branzino and ricotta dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"The brunch was super delicious with egg Benedict and especially the burrata salad!! So tasty and yammi! The finishing touch with Panna Cota made our day! Loved the server! Super caring and made my latte the way i wished! Solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Figo? More like No-go.   I'm giving a couple of stars solely based on the absolutely gorgeous decor, but I think we can all agree that isn't the reason we go to restaurants ...   I am a huge fan of Italian food, but this place completely missed the mark for me.   I ordered the casarece, basil & hazelnut pasta - the pasta was not al dente, but instead undercooked and lacked flavour. Very small portion for $18.   My friend was equally disappointed at the price she paid for 3 small scallops ($26), which didn't come with a side and were quite rubbery. The server recommended that she get the kale as a side for $11 and my friend hardly touched it as it was completely flavourless.   There are SO many incredible Italian places in Toronto, but unfortunately, this is one that I won't be returning to.   Go here if you want to be impressed by stunning decor (maybe order a drink?), but I wouldn't suggest ordering the food."}
{"text":"The white restaurant! White table setting, white walls, white decor. White people. Then one black person on one end. And this Latina.  But aside from the exterior and patrons, the food was exquisite! I had the sausage pizza, with thin crust, made more delicious by the slight burnt exterior! It was a portion fit for 2 small stomachs, and yet I managed to eat it all.  My dinner companion had a vegetarian pasta. Sadly, I was too enamoured with my own sausage to look up to her dish!  The service was charming and inviting. We stayed long past our dinner and never made to feel our welcome was overstayed."}
{"text":"Trendy and instagram pretty... thats the review summary I got when I read about Figo.  I have to agree that the space is stunning in pictures.  It's really well thought out and makes full use of the light entering the space through the large windows.  But once you look around, you notice the wear and tear is taking it's toll heavily with chips, rubbed off paint, and marked up walls.  I feel the emphasis is on the micro second moment in an instagram shot and less on the overall tastes and experience you can have.  The space is light, airy, and gives you a young energetic but elegant vibe.  It's a really pretty space.  So if you're looking for a nice atmosphere for drinks, this might be a good spot to meet up.  The bar area is a highlight and just a wonderfully long large space.  Though everything is instagram pretty, don't look too into the details.  The tables and chairs are showing a lot of large paint chips and there's lots of scuffing on most things.  It's like the upkeep in the past year it has been open isn't working as well.  Service here is efficient and polite enough.  Nothing seems out of place from a staff perspective but it just feels a bit robotic.  They're all doing a decent job but nothing seems sincere compared to other nice places in Toronto.   As for brunch, the menu had enough variety to give most people a few happy choices.  They even have a price fixe which is unique and novel to the brunch scene.  Prices are definitely higher than your average neighbourhood spot.  For my salad, it was about a 40% mark up from what I had from Cafe Neon ($12.5 compared to $17).  Figo is definitely a different feel, look, and location but it's still a jump in price that I have to wonder if it is worth it.    Tuna Salad - A hearty salad for those who don't necessarily want a big pizza or red meat for their brunch.  This had a good amount of tender tuna that wasn't overly fishy.  On top of the salad sat a perfectly poached egg.  The olives was a nice burst of acidity and sourness to give the small leaves a flavour.  Overall, it wasn't over dressed but I just found the overall flavour to be a bit bland.  Everything was fresh, well executed, and looks perfect on a plate... it was just missing a flavour that made me go 'this is good'.  3.5/5  Meatball Puccia - Large potatos made of lardo and veal were cooked in a tomato sauce and stuffed into a pita looking bread.  It was also served beside an arugula salad.  Similar to the tuna salad, everything was fresh and well executed but it was missing flavour.  Decent meal but nothing would on the plate would make us want to book a return for a dinner.  3.5/5  Home Fries Potato (side) - We asked for a side of potato... these were really nice and crispy.  For $6, this was a bit steep compared to Wickson Social where they had the phenomenal duck fat fries.  Figo was half the size of Wickson's and more expensive.  3.5/5  Overall, it's not a bad choice for brunch but it just leaves you wanting something of substance and memorable tastes beyond the first moment of 'instagram pretty'.  It doesn't help when you literally have all the tables beside you trying to recreate a shot from above to post on Instagram and Mean Girls side eyeing everyone."}
{"text":"Lovely decor, tasty food, ok experience. Came by on a weeknight with a reservation at 6pm. The main entrance was easy to miss because it looks like an emergency door with its caution sticker. Patio seating was full by then but the pretty and comfy interiors were a much better sight than the Hooters across the street anyways. The staff were attentive and service was fast.   They definitely knew the King West demographic as there was a range of vegetarian options on the menu. I had the Gnocchi ($17) and sampled my friends' orders, the Tortelli ($18) and Radicchio ($13) salad. All of them were good, simple dishes with fresh, quality ingredients but we weren't quite full after. There were also a few flies buzzing around possibly because of the open kitchen, which wasn't cool for a restaurant of this standard. Overall, I did like the dinner and atmosphere but it's not quite a go-to place for me."}
{"text":"We came here looking for a quick bite to eat before going to the Bodyguard Broadway show @ Mirvish Theatre around the corner. Trendy. Great atmosphere, near downtown core of Toronto. My partner in crime shared seared salmon, fettuccini pork, with red wine and for the finish, their Tiramisu cake. At  this time, Figo was rated in the top three restaurant and we can see why. Yup she got her red vino too. The good: The service impeccable, our waiter was well versed and even recommended our food and wine.  The bad: You need to call ahead to reserve, rare you can just walk in like we did. Uber it in downtown. The ugly: parking downtown Toronto is pricey. Across Hooters restaurant. Our single guy friend said that  having this view isn't  that bad. Tip: place for group parties like Christmas. Intimate dinners.  $$$-$$$$"}
{"text":"The first wave of people to go here were impressed. Early adapters are inclined to think their unique experience was special. Then came those, showing up on the pretense that this place earned the hype, it does not.   Fregulia was abysmal. Think alphaghetti with extra salt and you have a, similar, but better tasting dish.   Burrata was good, but you can't really fuck up cheese.   Gnocchi was on point. Each of the other pasta dishes we tried were nasty. The dearth of fresh tomatoes is unforgivable.   Their most popular appetizer, which is basically a tower of zucchini chips, is tasty, but not something I'd come back for.   Figo has found a subtle and classy way of putting ads in their menu (incl. movie times for the TIFF Lightbox across the street) Props to the marketing and design teams, thumbs down for everyone else."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on my American Express dining program where I received a complimentary glass of champagne upon arrival. Located in the heart of downtown, this restaurant is mainly contemporary Italian cuisine with tasteful decor. Came here for brunch on Saturday wherein they offer their prix fixed menu. We ordered the truffle honey ricotta and the house sausage pizza and it was strictly average. However, given the ambience of the restaurant, I would return to try out their other dishes to experience the lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Ambiance a little lacking. Just didn't feel warm and cozy. Might be better for a lunch spot than dinner. Would go again."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Realllly wanted to give it a 4 but the food fell short, while the prices stayed high.  GREAT atmosphere. Beautiful inside and really nice patio. Service was great and all the people who attended to us from the hostess to our main server and the other few who came to also check on us, were all friendly and attentive, but not pushy, which I love.   They take resos which is also a plus. I was easily able to score a patio table for 4 on a Wednesday evening after work. The restaurant was steadily busy from the time we arrived at 6pm until we left at 10.  Food was good but not great, and prices were a bit too high for the quality imo. Either decrease the prices or increase the quality.  As their reputation states, the zucchini fritti was delicious. First bite I was a bit underwhelmed, but when you a piece with the honey drizzle and the crema its realllyyyy good. $11 for a small plate. They could afford to top it up a bit since it is just zucchini, but I probably would still order again.  We got three different types of pasta (all around $18 each) and a pizza ($19). These were all good, but small servings and basic and nothing special. Pasta should be $15 for what you get, and the pizza was good (mushroom pizza) but def not worth $19.   I know you're paying for the location (dt toronto) and the atmosphere, but I feel the competition offers a bit more, and a better bang for your buck so to say.  I would still probably go back. But more for drinks with a zucchini shared app, but likely not for dinner."}
{"text":"Love the feel of the restaurant, with open spaces and big windows and natural light. Also super busy, as it filled up quickly and we were only able to get a reservation for 4 for 1030am. Service was also good, but on the whole I was quite disappointed with the food...  I got the eggs Benedict, and it truly was one of the least flavorful eggs Benedict dishes I've had before. I thought the poached egg was watery, the tomato bread a bit burnt, and potatoes somewhat tasteless. I actually had to season quite a bit with salt and pepper to add some flavor to the dish."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, didn't find anything new or special. The interior of the place looked much nicer in pictures compared to real life."}
{"text":"Living in the heart of the entertainment district, I've learned to be cautious of restaurants because you never know when you might be in a tourist trap. Given its prime location at Adelaide and John, I wasn't sure what to make of Figo, but after a recommendation from a friend decided to give it a shot.  The first thing I noticed is this place looks great. The decor is quite nice - when you walk in you get the feeling it's \"upscale\" without being \"formal fancy\" if that makes sense. If it doesn't, well I don't know what to say - it's my review so deal with it.  We started out with cocktails - as a fan of whiskey-based drinks I went with the Unlovable Cocktail, and it certainly didn't live up to its name because I would consider getting a comfy two-bedroom apartment and settling down with this drink. Obviously the drink would have to pay most of the rent because, you know, Toronto.  For dinner we split the beer and strawberry salad (delicious), and each had a pasta. The tagliatelle with clams was my choice - as a white wine pasta it was light but I'll of flavour. There were a decent amount of clams included, and overall I enjoyed the dish. The bucatini is also quite tasty. The boar Ragu was on the dryer/chunkier side as far as sauces go, but it was also quite enjoyable.  Overall, the drinks were great, service great, food was good but not quite great. For the area, this is where to go if you want something slightly more upscale (not hard when Hooters is the alternative across the street), but you will pay more for it. Maybe a bit pricy for the portion size, but not a ripoff - we left full and satisfied and would go back."}
{"text":"Nice patio to grab a drink with friend. I had a cocktail sunset raider. I like the mixture. Busy street all the time but I like it in the summer night"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant not knowing anything about it, only that it had recently opened in the Entertainment District just around the corner from Festival Tower. My friend and I came on Tuesday evening around 6:30 PM for dinner, and were seated at the bar. Their menu isn't hugely extensive - maybe around 4-5 items in each category of apps, salad, pizza, pasta, mains. My friend and I decided to share a few things, so we tried the burrata salad, zucchini fritti, and the bucatini. We had our app and salad first, and they were both fantastic. The zucchini fritti is actually something I would come back specifically for. If you are a fan of tempura you will probably die over these... they are very lightly battered, super thin slices of zucchini, topped with some lemon crema fresca and a bit of honey for some added sweetness. Absolutely delightful, and it wasn't heavy or greasy in the least, I honestly could have finished the entire plate myself. The burrata cheese that made up the bulk of our salad was very light and creamy, and mixed well with the little chunks of melon and berries in the salad.   Our pasta, the bucatini with wild boar ragu, was also not bad but not quite as rave-worthy. Perhaps we had been taking too long with our appetizers, but when our pasta came out it was only lukewarm. I liked the chewy texture of the noodles and the sauce was not bad but I mean was basically just regular meat sauce, so it wasn't that exciting.  I tried the pistachio tart for dessert and was a bit underwhelmed. The tart was harder and more crumbly than I wanted, although the pistachio flavour was decent. Not much else to say, I probably would not order again as it wasn't anything special.  Figo is overall a lovely, trendy new Italian restaurant that had a few pretty standout dishes, but as a bit hit and miss for me and wasn't good enough to top my list of Italian favourites. I would consider coming back again for their zucchini fritti and maybe to try other things. It's decently priced - I think we each spent around $50 for our meal, including a cocktail each (both cocktails, 'Queens Park Cocktail' and 'Boy With Apple' were delicious)"}
{"text":"I went to Figo for a \"fancy lady brunch for fancy ladies\" (TM) on a Sunday afternoon. There were 15 of us so obviously we made a reservation, but miracle of miracles, they still had space for our large group when we called to book only five days out. Granted, when I arrived at 1:05 for our 1pm reservation, we had to wait a few minutes, but I think its totally reasonable to have this happen during a busy Sunday brunch. Our group gathered by the bar and chatted contently and I'd say by the time everyone arrived and completed our round of hugs we were sat by 1:15 ish.   Because we had a group over eight we were required to order the prix fixe brunch menu, which were were informed of when making the reservation. And honestly, there's nothing else I would have wanted off the menu anyway. Plus, it seems a great value. $24 for three courses and coffee or tea. Figo also does an auto grat for groups this size, which is pretty standard practice. Plus our group of largely once and current service industry people enjoy the reduced stress of knowing the tip will be covered without much stress or Sunday hangover mental math.  So, WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD. I had the burrata with peach, thyme, basil and almonds for my first course and hello, yum. For me it was the perfect brunch starter: fresh, sweet, and a little earthy and salty, but not greasy at all. This is important because I knew I was going for the eggs Benedict for my main. Benedict for ever and always, and no I don't mean the Cumberbatch kind.   Figo makes a nice variation of this dish with pepperonata and capers on a tomato focaccia. Almost made me not want ketchup. Almost. It does come with potatoes after all and what is a smashed breakfast potato without ketchup?  Third course was an Italian donut (bombolone) which was good but I could only muster a couple bites. I'm sure if I was less full by its arrival I would have enjoyed it more. There are certainly worse problems to have."}
{"text":"I find myself in the area of Queen and John a lot given its proximity to two movie theaters, so it really was just a matter of time before I gave Figo a try.  We showed up around lunchtime on a Satuday and was told we could only sit at the bar, despite a very large assortment of available tables. (I should note that many tables were still empty when we left.)  After being served room-temperature water (no ice?) by a helpful bartender, I ordered the pancakes (which comes with maple syrup and mascarpone. I'll admit these are very tasty pancakes; they're thick and fluffy, and the accompanying mascarpone is a brilliant addition. My problem with the dish was its unrelenting sweetness, as the total absence of sides (I would've killed for some apple slices or melon pieces) ensures that it's the same bite over and over (and over) again.  I should note, too, that my dining companion ordered the baked eggs and was extremely unimpressed. I'm thinking maybe brunch isn't Figo's thing, so I might just go back and try their dinner offerings."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 1:45, got to the restaurant at 1:35 and the hostess said they were just cleaning the table which was fine cause I was early. So my friends and I waited outside and went back in at 1:45 to hear that the ladies at the table were just paying and waiting to clean the table so they told us to sit at the bar which was fine. It was nearing 2:00 and the table meant for us was still preoccupied. Eventually at 2:10 we were told that the ladies weren't moving so there is another table we can sit at, which we were excited to finally be seated because we were all getting really hungry at that point.   Service was really slow, they took forever to take our drink order and even longer to take out meal order... A brunch that should have been 1.5hours max turned into 3.5 hours...   The food was good but they never asked us if we wanted more drinks or how our food was... which we wanted more drinks and trying to get anyone's attention was impossible!  For a restaurant so finicky about reservation times (I got an email and phone call reminder the day before) they dropped the ball on that...   Even though the food was pretty good. Over service was terrible... They never apologized about seating us 25 minutes late. And for a pretty trendy/fancy place that's pretty low...."}
{"text":"This place has gorgeous decor and beautiful interior. The servers were nice and the ambiance in this place is very nice, and it would be romantic at night. I came here for brunch the other day, and the menu was your average. They do have a good price for their set brunch menu. I ended up getting the eggs benedict from the regular menu. It was your average eggs benedict with a just right poached egg. The only twist, being Italian, was the tomato focaccia bread instead of the traditional English muffin. It helped add a bit of flavor to the hollandaise sauce, which I thought would have been a bit bland without the flavors from the bread. I really wanted to try their bombolone, unfortunately they didn't have any the day I went.   When the dessert menu came around, I got tempted by their gelato and house made cookies. As I just got back from Italy that week, I really wanted to compare with a Canadian Italian restaurant. I wish I didn't. I chose the strawberry and blueberry gelato, but it ended up being just a sorbet. The house made cookie was just the wafer like cookies you could get at Costco in bulk (even tasted like it). I must say that the portion of the \"gelato\" scoop was really big; a lot bigger than I thought, but big doesn't mean it tastes good. It just means I feel obligated to have to finish it since I ordered it and it would seem like such a waste to not even eat half of each scoop.  Overall, I would like to go back to try the dinner, but it wouldn't be on top of my list."}
{"text":"I have been to Figo quite a few times, as it is near where I live - both for weekend brunches and dinners. Firstly, I want to mention the lovely decor - it really is a very classy place, perfect for a girls' brunch. They also have a great patio in the summer.   For brunch, there is a pretty good prix fixe menu which includes coffee/tea, an appetizer, a main and a dessert. But I actually prefer their dinner menu. Some of my favourites on the menu include the Soppressata pizza (the honey added just the perfect touch of sweetness), and the tagliatelle with clams and dill. I find that the pasta portions are not that big, so if you are hungry, then definitely go for the pizzas.  If you are planning a visit on the Friday or weekends, I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time (can book via Opentable). Lately, I have been finding it increasingly difficult to get a table just by walking in."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants downtown that had available tables for our large group last minute on a Thursday evening. The interior of this place is beyond beautiful - so nicely decorated with beautiful furniture and a dreamy ceiling. Our group decided to sit outside on the patio (bonus points for having heater stands).  I ordered the Cacio e Pepe ($19) pizza and split it with a friend. My other friends ordered the bucatini ($21). The pizza was not large enough to fill up 2 people, so definitely order your own.  The Cacio e Pepe pizza was quite average (don't expect authentic Italian style pizza). The crust was thin, but a bit soggy. I found there was too much oil on my pizza.. honestly I wanted to go to Gusto 101 instead but we were too far away.  My friends with the bucatini had their pasta undercooked (more raw than Al dente). Our waiter was friendly and professional, and took back their bucatini and made them new dishes. I took a taste of their new plate of bucatini - the pasta was cooked just right, Al dente, but the taste of the ragu fell quite flat and disappointing.   At the end of our meal, our waiter and manager came to once again apologize for the undercooked pasta and offered us a complimentary platter of desserts: tiramisu, lemon olive oil cake, and a brownie with gelato. Super disappointed in the tiramisu - the chocolate chip threw the texture of the dish way off, and the lady finger was not soaked enough and not in good espresso either. The brownie with gelato was way too sweet but that might be fine for some consumers. I thought the lemon olive oil cake was the only thing edible - and it doesn't even mean that it tastes amazing either. It was nice of them to offer the desserts as I would not have wanted to pay money for this quality.  Overall this place serves average Americanized Italian food in a decorative setting. I'd recommend you come here for a drink and chill by the bar instead and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is delicious... Although I'm not a big fan of the waiting stff... Very pretentious...  The location is a premium corner at the corner of John. Great for people watching while out on the patio   Might come back just for the food"}
{"text":"Been here twice for their fixed price brunch. This place is a great choice for downtown brunch because it is $24.95 for 3 courses and there is no crazy brunch line!  Unfortunately, their fixed price menu doesn't have that many options. You can choose from 2 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts.   This time I had the yogurt and granola (with honey and a strawberry compote), cacio e pepe (creamy scrambled eggs on toast with salad greens and herbed potatoes), and the affogato (espresso over vanilla gelato). You definitely need to try the affogato, it's DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I will start with that service was good!   Buttt the food was terrible. The worst pizza ever, not enough sauce, not enough flavor and too dry!   There were flies everywhere, buzzing around like they own the place! And maybe they did!   Disappointed and won't go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. I'm usually one to shy away from food reviews however my experience at Figo tonight was poor enough that I had to comment.   Very disappointed with the service and food. Considering the location and strong presence of quality Italian restaurants nearby  (Buca, Gusto and even Cibo); I expected a comparable level of service at the very least.   Server was very rude particularly to my friend who was visiting from out of town. The server made a real effort to make my friend feel out of place.   The food was nicely presented but failed to hit the mark.  Zucchini Fritti was too greasy.   Arctic Char was bland, very overcooked and dry.  Arugula salad was good but basic in the sense that it felt homemade (not in a good way).   Poor food is forgivable, poor service is is not nor is it seldom forgotten. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Beautiful downtown restaurant, modern and and spacious.  Staff are friendly, right from the hostess to bar and wait staff.  We were having dinner before theatre show and made them aware of it and they were respectful of the time.    We started with the Zucchini Fritti (all yelpers said to try this and they are right as always!), the Pork Belly Ricotta and Calamari Fritti.  Zucchini Fritti - amazing thin strands of fried zucchini, light batter and very light tasting.  The batter and oil they use to cook in it is fresh.  The lemon cream Fresca that they too with it in my opinion is not needed as the zucchini stand alone by themselves.  Next time I would get that on the side.  Pork Belly Ricotta - the BEST thing we ate there!  MUST ORDER THIS Yelpers!!  Soft pork belly, maple cider and fresh ricotta....what a taste sensation (my hubby's words)  Calamari Fritti - great portion, fresh fish, great batter and again they use fresh oil to fry so was so tasty.   For entrees our group had the following: House Sausage Pizza -  good thin crust but a little too well cooked for our liking so would not recommend. Pipe Pasta - fresh and good flavour  Seafood Fregola - this is what I ordered (see photo) it was a saffron tomato broth (but I didn't taste the saffron) and had good helping of mussels, then some artic char, baby potatoes, and tiny tiny scallops.  So what surprised me is how spicy the broth was which I didn't mind but menu does not say that so if you are ordering this make sure you like the kick!  The fregola which is like a tiny round ball Pasta was sparse but good.  Muscles were the star of the dish.  Desert we ordered the LEMON OLIVE CAKE & oh my is this amazing!!  It's served warm and delicious...would order that again in a heartbeat.    Cocktail menu is cool and great drinks too.    Great choice for downtown quick dinner oh and also love the fact they have universal washrooms."}
{"text":"As everyone a seems to agree, the interior of this place has great decor. I didn't sit inside so I can't speak about it haha. Anyway, a friend and I came here on a weekday night for a quick dinner. Service was attentive and prompt which I thoroughly appreciated. I had the Spaghetti a limone and my friend had...something else... I can't recall tbh. But who cares, this is my review. My dish was pretty good, the Spaghetti was Al dente and the lemon flavouring was a great addition. We ended up skipping apps and dessert but overall a fine experience. Would definitely visit again!"}
