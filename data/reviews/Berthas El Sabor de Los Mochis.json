{"text":"This is a little hidden gem I'm a regular the breakfast was awsome the tortillas are home made they are great. The service was excellent.  All the menu plates are prepared home made style I recommend it"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! That I hope remains hidden, but don't at the same time because the owner is soooo deserving of more business. This is our new go to spot for ceviche, tacos, good food, and even better service. Be prepared if the wait is a little long for ceviche or any food in general everything is made to order and extremely fresh, completely worth the wait. Bertha keep the food coming, and I'll keep boasting about this place. Can't wait to go back, mouth is currently salivating!"}
{"text":"Muy buen sabor, limpio, comida con sabor auténtico mexicano, excelente servicio,  Es un lugar un poco escondido pero muy recomendable, definitivamente regresaría y lo recomiendo"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley. We called before we came and she stayed open just so we could come and try it. It's a little family restaurant in a house and everything is made fresh right when you order. The service is unlike any other and makes you feel right at home. If I could give 10 stars I would"}
{"text":"+este es mi lugar faborito para comer esta delisioso un poquito tardadito pero bale la pena"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure!!! These authentic flavors definitely come from Los Mochis, Sinaloa without a doubt. One night I ordered two burritos and one was way more than I bargained for, HUGE! :) the flavors were on point and everything from the nicely cooked homemade flour tortilla to all of the layers in the burrito. (Very well put together, not your average burrito) the next day I had a campechana (seafood cocktail) and I was taken away by the quality of seafood. The chicken soup is great, loved the broccoli and noodles. Excited to see the growth within this local restaurant. I can't wait to stop by and get some good shots of all of the dishes they have to offer! Will without a doubt be back again."}
