{"text":"While very good you can't help but feel you're not wanted in the Boxcar Social, a cafe with good quality stuff, but a little too much attitude. The decor is nice though."}
{"text":"Great coffee (I've had lattes and iced coffee), wonderful service, extraordinary croissants, fantastic sandwiches, and the best music ever.  Miles Davis right now.  80s hits, not too cheesy, a couple of days ago.  Well, a little cheesy... Don't Stop Believing.  I've been sitting here the better part of the morning on my laptop after dropping my kids off at summer camp.  It's a beautiful, sunny space.  It will be worth a special trip back even when summer camp is over.   I haven't been here in the evening yet but they have a nice selection of imported and local beer, and 30 or so whiskeys (mostly scotch but also rye and bourbon)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the decor and the staff is very nice.  Great place to grab a coffee and hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"Cute place!  I sat at the bar and was given a very friendly greeting &  wine menu...  I don't think they \"take orders\" in the conventional sense:  Basically, I sat there while very long line of patrons ordered their coffee & wine- I just assumed that once they got caught up, someone would check on me or ask if I'd made a choice (still sitting at the bar mind you). That never happened, despite all of the deliberate eye contact I made with the bartender/baristas...so, new people came in got their orders taken & I left.  Didn't consume a thing despite having high hopes for Boxcar Social :(  After I left, it occured to me that they probably expected me to join the queue to order my drink- not something I'm accustomed to once seated at a bar with a wine list- BUT  would it have killed someone to fill me in on the protocol there?! They def knew I was sitting and waiting...  Oh well.  2 Stars for the cute/ quaint ambiance. Greeting was pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this place in the summer, when the patio is open. It is so cute...  The cheese and meat plate is really good. Their drinks are so great... Bartenders know their drinks for sure.   In the winter, it's a great place to get a nice drink and cozy up reading some The Catcher in the Rye. People are super social (like the name) and very cool."}
{"text":"Go for the latte's and the cappuccinos and you won't be disappointed.  Also, if they have the nuttella cookies available you should be walking out with as many as you can carry.  The coffee is average cost for a fancy coffee bar, and quite good! All the baked goods, courtesy of Bake Shoppe are also superb.  Edit: JUST KIDDING. Now they aren't associated with bake Shoppe so don't expect superb baked goods. Coffee is still real good though"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and was extremely excited to check out the swanky new bar in my area in hopes of finding a new hangout venue besides Amsterdam Brewhouse.  We were very disappointed. A few friends and I went to check it out after the gallery opening at the Powerplant and we were greeted w terrible service at the bar.    I had stood at the bar for a good 15-20 minutes patiently waiting for my turn but after watching everyone around me get served along with some newbies who had just stepped up to the counter, I gave up on waiting to place orders for our drinks. My friend decided to give it a shot but after 5 minutes of just being stared blankly past he gave up too.   The bar had turned itself into a spot for an after party but it wasn't ram packed that the bar tender couldn't have kept tabs on whose turn it would be for drinks.  Needless to say we were all thoroughly disappointed.  It was a sour start to our night and I would not recommend checking out this spot.  With this kind of service, they will prob continue to lose customers to Amsterdam Brewhouse."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood coffee joint with amusing chalkboard musings...deservedly busy: coffee and service are great; hopefully, as my NYC pal said, more pastries offered soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and prices, I think they'll do really well in the future."}
{"text":"Worst coffee experience ever. It was poorly organized and none of the customers knew what order was for them. This could've been solved by asking customers their names.   I ordered a latte but never got it because the guy behind me order 4 drinks and I think grab mine by mistake. I should never have to fight or argue to get my coffee so rather than make a scene or wait for them to make another I just left.   Ordering was another ordeal where it felt like being at a bar waving money to get attention. The baristas have no way to know who's been served and who's waiting. I'm sorry am I suppose to fight to get attention? Am I at a coffee shop or an Apple Store? It's environment is so hipster that it comes off as trying to hard.  This might be good at night as a bar scene but 2 in the afternoon for a coffee avoid this place and go to Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"Good coffee and great service. Really nice and relaxed vibe throughout the place that is great for small groups"}
{"text":"Great place for a fresh decent feed and coffee along with a chilled vibe... Aussie approved!"}
{"text":"Best coffeehouse in Toronto! At Boxcar, they consistently make excellent espresso with precision. Also, you can buy coffee beans from high-end roasters like 49th Parallel and Heart. The wine and bourbon lists are also varied and worth a visit later in the day."}
{"text":"A great place for coffee and munching. The patio in the back is a perfect place to get your book or laptop and spend some time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe in the place. Had their vanilla latte (with lactose free milk - they also offer soy and almond milk). The vanilla was made by one of their baristas and was incredible. Great addition to the area where and excited for their wine and beer additions!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this cafe. It's a great place to hang out casually with friends with good music playing in the background. There's also ample space upstairs, where it's pretty quiet if you're looking for a place to study or work.   Had the Americano this time and loved it! They seem to be using quality beans. Coffee tasted great.   Also a huge plus that it's so close to the subway station."}
{"text":"Went for drinks last night, I love the location and building they are in. Probably better for coffee during the day than drinks in the evening. My old fashion was horribly disappointing. The rest of the drinks were overpriced albeit summerhill. Tried two crostini's. Also very bad. I'm sure you can find things to love about this place tho. Would return for beers in the back terrace, but probably no more than a stop in due to poor service, prices and no good tapas."}
{"text":"The best latte I have had in Toronto, the milk they use is delicious and they use the perfect amount with the espresso shot for an overall incredible latte. Can't wait to go back and have more!"}
{"text":"This place definitely brings a much needed coolness factor to the stretch of Summerhill near the flagship LCB(O). It has a large patio and a quieter area upstairs, suitable for working. It also has an impressive selection of scotches, which seem to be a specialty, as well as an array of wines, beer and coffee-based beverages. I actually googled PEC after reviewing the wine list; it seems to be the Niagara equivalent of \"appellation controllee\".  At the same time, the selection is weirdly limited. On the three occasions that I've visited this establishment, it did not offer anything that I actually felt like having.  On one occasion, I stopped by on a hot day following a run. I wanted some kind of sparking water (Perrier or plain San Pellegrino), but they did not have any cold, non-alcoholic, sugar-free beverages. On another occasion, I wanted a matcha latte, which is offered at just about every cafe in the city. Nope. On a third occasion, I ordered an iced latte. I was not asked whether I wanted whole or skim milk. When it arrived, it was so fatty as to make me feel queasy.  Postscript: I thought the upstairs area would be a great place to hold meetings of my writing group, but it's closed from 6pm onwards since it's not licensed, so my group ended up meeting on the patio. Hopefully the upstairs will get licensed soon."}
{"text":"I felt really awkward with my experience here. Sat at the bar looking at the menu with what appeared to be an owner in front of me behind the counter. Wasn't greeted or even acknowledged despite clearly having questions about getting food. It was like I wasn't cool enough to get his help.   Next I went up to order. The barista says \"what do you want bud\" in the most condescending tone I've ever heard.   I actually left without an order because I was so put off by the vibe from behind the counter. Guys you run a coffee shop, not a hedge fund. Get over yourself."}
{"text":"Coffee was good but nothing special. Atmosphere is good. Location was good. Wouldn't go back though as so many other places to explore. I agree with other comments that place is slightly pretentious."}
{"text":"These guys have just celebrated their 1st year in business and have a great attitude and passion towards serving their coffee. Their new upcoming location will feature a Spirit Triplette by Kees Van Der Westen"}
{"text":"amazing peach blossom tea, amazing porchetta sandwich, amazing grilled shrimp, amazing seared tuna, and amazing service."}
{"text":"Great location (once you find it) a bit hard to find but a beautiful spot for locals. This new boxcar, like the others, is for those who appreciate casual service, delicious coffee, wine, craft beers and a wide range of scotches, bourbons etc. They offer pastries and shareable snacks starting at 6pm. We did not eat but my girlfriend had an Iced Latte she said was delicious (I tried it, and it was). I myself had a couple different local beers that blew my mind. Try the Blood Brothers Paradise Lost if you like tangy, sour and yet refreshing beer. Never had anything like it before. The bartender Cirus (hope I spelled his name right) was great.  He was patient, quick, pleasant and managed to still talk to me about the beers while serving other patrons. Overall the service and design of the place is spot on. I would recommend this spot as a date venue or going with some friends."}
{"text":"A nice combination of coffee and booze, not spectacular by either standard but coupled together it results in a nice location to visit for a quiet night out or a lunchtime coffee.  The biggest difference between this place and other coffee shops are the great location, longer hours and the selection of alcohol. The locale is by no means exciting, fresh or new as it has the typical minimalist interior that looks more like a run down home than a business. Needless to say, I am not a fan of the interior and I prefer the patio. I strongly recommend that you track your orders carefully, this place gets busy and they don't do a very good job of it which can lead some awkwardness when you go to pay.    This place shines as a midtown getaway for a romantic evening for two in the middle of the week. Fresh coffee, a glass or wine or two, and a charcuterie board to share outside on the patio as the sun goes down makes for a great feeling especially as you get up and leave by candlelight. Time seems to stand still and you lose track of the hours much the same way as you would sitting down in your own yard having drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"Great Americano! If you're allergic to hipsters then I suggest you stay clear of this place though ;)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but the coffee was very good. I grabbed an Americano and immediately noticed how well-prepared it was. The ratio of hot water to espresso was just right and the coffee had a rich, creamy depth to it that was spot on."}
{"text":"love that you can order wine, but their license only covers the first floor and seating is kind of limited. You can always sit at the bar while you're waiting for a table though, and the wait isn't usually too long.  wine list is a tad expensive imo but good quality and i love the service!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a post-dinner drink here with my boyfriend on our way home from downtown. It was cozy, the bartender was great, and the wine was good. I was surprised it wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, it was easy to find a spot to sit."}
{"text":"Despite great service and wonderful decor I was really disappointed by the quality of their espresso, which is basically all I'm concerned about when going to a coffee shop.   The espresso was painfully acidic and sour, my friend's Americano was far too watered down and weak.  Furthermore, the espresso macchiato sat far too long before the milk was even steamed leaving my friend with a lukewarm drink.   All in all a poor experience in a beautiful location with great people. I'll be back regardless."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee and atmosphere! Love their iced cappuccino! They have a patio in the back, which is great during the summers and have a second floor that is good for studying. The second floor tends to close a bit earlier than the main floor though."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, nice little patio out back, and good-tasting drinks. Servers were friendly and this is a great spot to just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for coffee + breakfast snacks since moving into the neighborhood.  This weekend I tried to go for lunch with my family and my dog on the patio and was asked to leave because dogs were not allowed. I have come here several times before on the weekend for coffee and a granola bar or peanut butter cookie in the morning with my dog and sat on the patio and have never before been asked to leave or told that it was a health and safety violation. While I fully understand this may be the case, I never would have brought him for lunch if I thought it was not allowed because I had brought him to the patio so many times before. Just an overall annoying situation that ruined my lunch plans.   That being said they do have great coffee."}
{"text":"This is a recent expansion to the boxcar social chain. The view is lovely, your overlooking the water right at the end portion of the harborfront centre. We had trouble finding it initially because there is another patio bar located behind the bandshell (I believe this is another set up of theirs - the slip). The place was packed outside and they have a very small patio outside with about 7-8 picnic tables for seating. These had been filled so we were forced to stand at the bars they had built - and not very well every time I moved the bar shook. Now for the booze...word to the wise, if you like some sort of other mix with your whiskey, scotch, bourbon etc, don't go here. They serve every shot on the rocks or neat. They ONLY serve beer, wine and whiskey. If you feel like any other kind of drink, don't go here. They did offer 2 ciders so after finding out their coffee bar was closed......!!!!, I settled on a cider....which was horrible. It tasted like dirt and leaves, I only forced myself to drink it based on the fact that my husband had paid $6 for it. Overall, I was not impressed, the view, if you get a spot on the patio, is gorgeous, so points for that. Maybe their coffee better?"}
{"text":"Hipsterville....but inviting and coffee is heavenly. There is an upstairs and patio to sit. Central to great decor shops and subway. Handy and delicious."}
{"text":"Unique. Eclectic. And really really great coffee. After wandering Toronto for a while and discovering rather meh coffee, I stumbled upon this \"pop-up cafe.\" Pop-up in this case means that while the weather is still warm-ish in Toronto, the Boxcar Social guys will man an outdoor cafe on Bloor. When the weather cools off, they will move back to one of their brick and mortar locations (I'm told that this goodness will go away on Oct 11... I'm so sad). Don't underestimate the outdoor-ness of the location, the coffee is completely fantastic and the baristas really know their craft."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a drink. It is unusually dark though, and has loud people. Make sure not to come hungry, because there aren't a lot of options of food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor of this coffee shop is great. Really nice patio out back too. This is a total laid back hipster coffee place. And the staff is right out of central casting, and friendly.   Now for the product. The lattes are pretty good and the baked goods (brought in) are delicious. Unfortunately, the only thing that's not good, actually, downright awful, is their regular coffee. It's really acidic. Undrinkable really. I've tried it a couple of times thinking maybe it was just off one day, or possibly me. But no, it's the coffee. I've also heard the same comment from others. And funny, it came up in a group discussion recently and once someone said something about the, \"hip coffee place with terrible coffee\" everyone chimed in with similar thoughts. It's was almost like no one wanted to be the first to mention it for fear of criticizing a hip place and seeming uncool."}
{"text":"Coffee experts and a cool vibe. The place is spread out over two floors and I can't wait for the patio and liquor to be ready. Its a very good spot now...soon to be great. Only good option for coffee in the area."}
{"text":"Gorgeous spot. Loaded with rustic wood tables and a fabulous patio. Plus they serve/sell Phil and Seb coffee. Enough said."}
{"text":"This coffee shop occupies a small house close to Summer hill station. The coffee bar  takes the main floor along with a few tables and in  the back you can find a super cute patio. The restrooms and study area ( quiet area) are on the second floor. The cool thing about this place is that they serve alcohol and do coffee tastings. I was a bit disappointed when I learned that they only serve their coffee tastings until 4:00pm because they get \"too busy\" as there is only one person behind the bar.={"}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe in the city. My experience with a lot of tiny cafes in Toronto is that the staff can be either pretentious or completely uninterested in their product. Boxcar Social is neither of those.   Staff are friendly, non-pushy and non-pretentious. The patio out back feels like you're sitting in someone's back yard. I didn't take a look at the menu since my friend and I made a bee line for the patio (it's small, so we wanted to get a spot since it was such a nice night!), but we simply told the server what we were in the mood for and he was able to make suggestions. It was a really relaxed and fun atmosphere and made for a great night of catching up with an old friend!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood. I often see people coming in and out from Boxcar Social day and night. Finally I tried and had latte. Latte was $4.00 and very very good late and beautiful. They have patio during the summer, but not in the winter. I wanted to eat croissant, but I could not expect baked items there because Boxcar Social was a wine bar and Cafe not a bakery. The menu was a blackboard. The left side was coffee menu and the right side was alcohol menu. It was funny to see alcohol menu the next to coffee menu in the morning. There are many people to get a cup of morning coffee. The mix of bar atmosphere and coffee shop atmosphere was interesting. The staff is very helpful, talented, and friendly."}
{"text":"Round 2  So, I've been back a couple of times since the last review and I'm happy to say service is much better (more trained staff and attention to detail - cleaning up tables and following up on food, etc).  I came back for the beer and delicious food - now the staff is slowly matching the food quality.  Win-win!"}
{"text":"Having been in the USA I am very pleased to have found a cafe here in Toronto that serves real coffee (i.e. does not resemble Starbucks) and a healthy non deep fried meal and without fries.  Overlooking lake Ontario the view is very pleasant and relaxing. Great spot."}
{"text":"It's an awesome looking place with an awesome vibe. Coffee was good, but I didn't get a chance to try their other drinks. I'll be back for sure though,"}
{"text":"Service was nil, actually. Sat down outside and waited for 15 minutes. 2 servers walked by me, each twice. I got up and left."}
{"text":"Great local craft beer selection and WiFi - what more could I ask for? Lots of families come here since there is a skating rink and the Harbourfront right in front of it. It's a great place for dads tired of being dads, or moms tired of being moms, just needing a beer to take the edge off of parenting a screaming tot.  They do serve bar snacks like fries and so forth. Stop in for a latte too if you're needing some caffeine.  Come here to watch the sunset too. So romantic.  Oh, and a story that actually happened at this establishment: Two guys (that didn't know each other) were on their laptops and one guy removed his power cable from the power strip. But before he did, he SWITCHED OFF THE POWER STRIP. The other guy was like, WTF?! And apparently he didn't have a battery in his laptop and was using the power cable as his primary source of power, so he lost all the tings he was working on on his computer. But like, YO MAN! If you're going to work on a masterpiece, HAVE A BATTERY IN YOUR COMPUTER or like DON'T USE A PUBLIC SOURCE OF POWER AS YOUR MAIN SOURCE OF POWER. And to the other dude: WHY ARE YOU SWITCHING OFF THE POWER STRIP. CLEARLY THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE PLUGGED INTO IT. You were both stupid and if you are reading this, I hope you learned your lessons."}
{"text":"Love this spacious cafe / bar! Nice vibes!!! I got the matcha latte - perfect for a cold day in Toronto"}
{"text":"A gem on the harbourfront! I'm not a huge fan of their coffee, but their beers and new dinner menu can't be beat! A lot of the drafts are only $6, which is such a deal.  We recently went to try their new dinner menu and I was pleasantly surprised. We had the salmon plate, which came with SO MUCH salmon. I couldn't believe it was only $12. We also had the arancini and meatballs, which were delicious. I'm so glad we have this place in our neighborhood! It's a cute date spot too."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social is a hidden gem located near Summerhill Subway. I don't know how I never spotted this place before as I am always in the area, but I'm glad I eventually did!  This quaint coffee shop serves great coffees and teas (iced and hot) and the baristas have a great knowledge of the product they serve. Although I didn't get to try their baked goods, they looked great.  The best part of Boxcar Social for me was the patio out back. Quiet and peaceful, it's a great way to get away from the hustle and bustle, even if only for a few minutes.  My latte was great, and the espresso had a nice kick but without the aftertaste. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is over rated in the extreme. My Coffee was watery and weak, and nothing but huge tables with one person taking up the whole table, so no seating.   What you get is over priced, and an overly entitled attitude from the staff serves you to boot. All this would be marginally ok, if only they knew how to make coffee to match their attitude (I left my coffee on the counter half finished)."}
{"text":"My favorite cafe!! Go there almost 4 times a week just like my backyard..Every single cup of drinks were beautifully done! Great selection of whiskey and bourbon, also beers. Chic ambiance and good crowd~ if you have sweet tooth.. Get the hot chocolate.. You won't regret when you have the torched marshmallow melts in the mouth..."}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee shop in the city. Incredibly knowledgeable. Extremely friendly. They can explain every detail of the flavour and roasting of their beans. And thr fact that they serve beer, wine and whiskey means you can stay late. The variety is fantastic. And thr ambiance is warm, cozy and homey. Chill upstairs with some friends, or in thr summer, on the patio."}
{"text":"My favourite of all the Boxcars!  The menu is excellent here - whether it be early morning snack, lunch, dinner, or brunch on the weekends.  Like all the Boxcars, great selection of coffees, whiskeys, wine, and craft beers."}
{"text":"Great Montreal-like vibe.  Awesome coffees, craft beer, and wine selection.  Casual and cozy by both day and night.  Great first date spot and awesome patio out back!"}
{"text":"Great location next to the water. No denying that. The cuban sandwich and mushroom soup were decent. The sandwich came out greasier than expected however.  The most disappointing was the coffee. I ordered an Americano and there was no coffee crema on top. It looked and tasted more like a drip coffee."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Boxcar Social and have been to the one at Summerhill many times. This is a fantastic new addition to the harbourfront. For those discerning coffee drinkers who would never drink at Tim Hortons and prefer independent over Starbucks, this is a fantastic new option. If you're in a hurry, don't go here. They lovingly take their time to make the perfect espresso drink. If you're a fan of scotch, whiskey, bourbon or beer, this is a fantastic place. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about each and every spirit they sell, and you might be surprised at the incredible selection - many of which you can't get in Ontario. Discover a new bourbon but heads up, don't expect mixes with your drink or fancy cocktails. This is for the hard-core spirit lover. There is also a small food selection and beautiful Charcuterie board. All in all, I can't say enough good things about this place. The people are lovely, quality is exceptional and they even managed to take a tacky, touristy box and turn it into a very cool space."}
{"text":"Walking through harbourfront my friend and I decided to stop by for drinks. I wanted a mojito and she wanted a sangria. They didn't have either which I thought was a little odd.   We both settled for wine (5oz) which was basic. Can't remember the names but she had red and I had white. Our server switched midway through without telling us so we had to ask a different server for our bills etc. Neither were very friendly and seemed a bit standoffish.   Also we weren't seated for a good 5-10 minutes when we walked in and had to ask someone if it was okay to sit anywhere. Not a welcoming vibe at all. I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"Very cool place for a hang and a coffee. Unfortunately no hello when walking in and a frowny face behind the espresso machine depressed the whole mood of the place. The two ladies taking orders and steaming milk were friendly though.   The espresso I had was a bit wonky for me, not because of how it's made, rather more a case of me not liking the overly bright new wave of espressos.   They made three of my coffees but forgot the drip I ordered. Not a big deal but when I informed them I got a half full cup of warm coffee from a thermos. I asked if it was the special Kenya the cashier sold me on but everyone was too busy with the backed up line to acknowledge my question.   Overall impressive, amazing coffee selection, might have just been bad luck on my part."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible place and even better atmosphere.   The coffee is amazing and constantly changing to help you find that perfect cup. The staff are all extremely knowledgeable and friendly and never have I seen poor service. The beer and whiskey selection is also very impressive. Night or day, alone or with friends, it's the perfect place to go.  I've become a regular and will continue to come back time and time again."}
{"text":"This place has almost everything I look for in a great cafe - top notch coffee, friendly service, cool decor, relaxed atmosphere and a gorgeous outdoor patio.   I ordered an Iced Americano and to my surprise, the barista actually made it twice because he himself was not happy with the first pour. To me that gives me the impression these guys take their coffee seriously and I for one can appreciate perfectionism. The americano was spot on in my opinion. Good coffee flavour, no unpleasant bitterness. If I had to be a slight critic it may have been slightly acidic. However, I liked how it wasn't super diluted like most coffee places and you could drink it similar to a machiatto.  Lovely refurbished wood and metal furnishing. The patio has a great vibe to it, relaxed but perfect for catching up with friends or casual date spot (not too loud but nice background music to avoid awkward silence).  My only real complaint would be the lack of any food/nibbles - I saw a few cookies in a cabinet but maybe I just came after all the good stuff was taken.  Edit: it appears they do offer charcuterie - mmm kay I will say they deserve .5 star more since this is one of my favourite things in life but I do wish that pastry cabinet was more ample."}
{"text":"Needed to put finger to keys in a bad way so was looking for a coffee shop with wifi in the vicinity of my appointment and came across the Boxcar Social in Summerhill. I'd heard the name, read the reviews, but never found my way here.  WOW!   Coffee, baked good, easy access to pizza slices, AND cocktails? #Heaven? Pretty much.  I ordered an Americano (two in fact) and was so amazed by how naturally sweet the espresso was straight up - not needing milk or sugar at all. Smooth, slightly sweet flavours created by their Ethiopian beans.  I mentioned Pizza and while they don't make it, they do have an arrangement with Yeah Yeah's Pizza next door and the pep and cheese was a 1/4 pie and delightfully delicious and thin crusted!  I was seated at the bar, you know \"working on my screenplay\" as people do at hip coffee spots. It's basically a metaphor for people feeling the need to be in public doing their work so they can talk about what they're doing, but thankfully this didn't appear to be an issue here.  Aside from a few other fellow keyboard warriors the majority of the patrons were there to have coffee and actually talk with friends. Unreal!  .... oh and my spot at the bar was RIGHT NEXT TO the dessert display counter.... I managed to avoid any purchases for about 2 hours, but then caved hard and bought two - so much for diets I guess.   Maybe I'll have a cheeky cocktail before I leave... maybe. Oh hell, who am I kidding, I totally will.   Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, love the place. I walked all over Toronto today looking for the right place to eat. The food was delicious! Unfortunately, the plates are very small, as this venue is not intended to be a place to go to for dinner. It is a bit loud, but I loved the lighting -soft- the cavatelli, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Very hip bar on yonge street. It was a Friday night when I went and they had hip hop music at full blast - kind of had to strain to chat with my friend because of the sheer volume but it worked with the overall feel of the place. A party had reserved the back of the bar so there were only seats at the bar when I first stepped in. The space is pretty narrow though and is like the size of a corridor when you're trying to walk down the bar.   They only have 4 cocktails but a large wine and coffee list. The only food they have is pizza by the place next door, called Yeah yeahs pizzas. I had a slice of \"the white\"and it was lukewarm and mediocre at best. There was no crisp to the crust and just tasted soggy and sad. Also it was $5.25  for a slice, basically $6 after tax + tip. For a slice of mediocrity, i think that's a bit steep.   Bottom line is I would come back for the music and for a quick drink with buddies, but would definitely have food beforehand."}
{"text":"My husband and I passed by this place last night and popped in for a drink. The vibe is great - There was such an eclectic group of people in there and the decor was very interesting, with live edge tables and pipes used as shelving support. We also really enjoyed being able to sit at a bar right at the window and look out onto the street - a very unique experience. I was very pleased to see they had Spirit Tree cider, which is one of my favourites. Lastly, the customer service was top notch. It was obvious their top priority was for us to enjoy ourselves, and that we did!"}
{"text":"Awesome space, beautiful patio out back. Excellent coffee combined with a fine selection of beers and cocktails (still to try).  The coffee is top notch with obsessive attention to detail and personable service. Have to face the fact that there are a lot of great coffee shops in Toronto and it's pretty hard to differentiate between the good ones. That being said,  this was the best iced latte I've ever tried. Mixed like a cocktail with no ice cubes in the glass. Super smooth; sweetness of the milk really came through. Great rotating selection of espresso, pour-over, drips, etc. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is not your average coffee shop. It has the best of the best of both worlds: coffee and alcohol. They have wine, but I'm not much of a wine drinker. However, I can assure you that they have a very good collection of single malt scotches and the baristas know their stuff well.  I've been here twice, my first time just to check out the place and ask about how busy it gets during the weekend. One guy told me I could make reservations via email, which I did. I would have given them 4 stars after they gave me conflicting information, saying that they don't do reservations on the weekend, but they redeemed themselves when the owner of the place figured out who I was and personally apologized for the mix up. That was totally unexpected and it really impressed me.  The atmosphere is very relaxed. It's basically a house turned into a coffee shop. The second floor has more seating. They don't allow alcohol up there, but it's more airy and bright if you want to find a cozy place to read and get caffeinated. Lots of stairs. Definitely not wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place is a serene haven on a busy street. The coffee is really really good (cortado at least), the staff are lovely & the fit out is excellent.   It's amazingly quiet since it's on such a busy street. There's free wifi and a little sunny courtyard out back which is heaven.  There's a selection of pastries as well."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops/bars in the city. Essentially the only place that is open at midnight during a week day outside of the downtown core with amazing interior and a solid menu with reasonable prices. Also a great patio."}
{"text":"This cafe/ bar has a great vibe. It appeals to all crowds bc they offer cafe options, food and drinks. They have great hours, open from 8am to midnight. It's a nice breather from this swanky part of town because it's a really relaxed atmosphere, and relatively good pricing. They have lovely art on the walls and they rotate the artists they use every 3 months. It creates a really nice ambiance. Our server was very kind and chill he answered all our questions and created nice conversation about the location and art.  The music playing was low volume but interesting selection. This would be a great first date spot."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. Absolutely ruined Mother's Day. Probably should have read the reviews about their terrible service before coming.   Just walked out of this place with godawful service. Came in for mother's day today to treat my mom and we had been walking around so we had 2 Starbucks fraps. We walked in and ordered fries and avocado toast. At no point did the cashier or any of the waiters mention that outside food was not allowed.   As we were enjoying our food, the \"manager\" (the quotations are my expression of shock that someone with such an awful disposition could ever make it as a manager in the service industry.. Or any for that matter) Miles abruptly approached us at our table on the patio and said that he would have to get rid of our drinks as it was against policy- EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO SIGN OR INDICATION OF SUCH A POLICY.   I told him that and he continued to say that because they were a fully functional cafe, outside drinks would not be permitted. He actually tried to physically take the drinks from us and created such a scene (even though we were paying customers) that other patrons of the patio were looking at his behaviour. I offered to give him our drinks so that he could put it behind the counter if that really was the policy. He was absolutely rude and said he would have to throw them away. The couple sitting next to us intervened as well because Miles was absolutely awful and terrible. He absolutely ruined the dining experience for me and my mom for Mothers Day in addition to the dining experience of other people on the patio. His behaviour was appalling as he attempted to humiliate us further.   I spoke to someone that allegedly is his boss even though somehow he's the manager. She was a short woman and was somewhat nicer than him but continued to defend his actions. She said that because they had redone the patio, the sign was not currently up. She did not apologize for his rude and callous behaviour. I fail to see how its appropriate to harass paying customers for their drinks while they're trying to enjoy their paid for meal in peace in middle of the entire patio. If this really is a policy of the patio, they should have let us know as we approached the establishment or even when we went to pay for our meal and not attack us while we eat.   Miles, along with the entire establishment, need to learn a few things about appropriate social behaviour and how to treat paying customers.  Will not return due to this awful experience on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a bar where you can also get coffee.This place is cute and cozy. We came here after work and there was a small crowd, but we could still find a table and have a conversation without shouting.   The bartender/barista was very nice, but when my friend asked if there was anything with coffee & alcohol together he acted like that was a strange request...maybe it's an old-man thing to order, but we thought it made sense for a place that specialized in both things? Anyway he ended up making something tasty that did combine the two but I forget if it had a name.   I'd go back here if I was in the area...either for drinks or espresso or both!"}
{"text":"I liked the patio and the washrooms were stellar ! Good job peeps !  I will be back for your espresso ."}
{"text":"Love Boxcar. It's something the waterfront has needed for a long time, a non touristy coffee spot and bar all in one. Friendly staff and great stuff on tap."}
{"text":"First time here. Thus far I am enjoying the bourbon and beer selection! Definetly will be back!"}
{"text":"Harbourfront is slowing getting better. A sign of this is that places like boxcar are arriving on the scene. Thank you, planners! Let's replace some of the super touristy, overpriced generic spots. We are a world class city and deserve high quality hangouts for our waterfront. Let's showcase some of the interesting small businesses that are unique to our beloved city."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social is my new favorite spot because it is just so versatile and will hit the spot for whatever you're in the mood for, be it or coffee or liquor. The atmosphere is hipster-chic with a hint of Rosedale. The patio/backyard is so relaxing to be in--but get there early as the seats are usually taken by larger groups. There is also an upstairs area that is very private and quiet, though I've always opted to sit downstairs. The service is very friendly, although slow at times.   The atmosphere is perfect for enjoying a sit-down latte or spending an intimate candle-lit evening enjoying craft beers/wine/bourbon and small bites. Great charcuterie board, but even better lattes. I love that it's open late and can't wait to try their other location in Riverdale."}
{"text":"Yummy food, good beers on tap, great patio. Beware the wait and the occasionally snobby waitstaff. Other than the lovely young white guy working the bar, with an accent I couldn't pinpoint. He's very sweet."}
{"text":"I feel at home here. One of my favourite cortados in the city and wonderful alcoholic bevies too. The setting is relaxed and there's also a romantic rawness undertone which characterizes this place for me. Obviously the garden patio in the back is much appreciated as well.   An all-purpose spot where I can pick up a drink on the go while solo or relax with a hibiscus beer or a bourbon with a friend."}
{"text":"A nice laid-back cafe that doubles as a bar at night. The space is cozy and there is a wide variety of beers and wines. The cheese and meat plate is great too! Bonus: It's right across the street from the subway!"}
{"text":"BEWARE! The location listed on Yelp is incorrect, the shop has now moved close to St. Clair station!  Came here with a friend yesterday and got the cold brew and was pleasantly surprised! You know how when people drink good coffee they can taste \"notes\" in the brew? I've never experienced that at places like Starbucks or Second Cup, but got it here. Can't remember them very well now, but loved the brew!  Thanks to the bearded fellow who recommended it, I had a great experience! Will definitely come back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"This is nice cozy spot next to Natrel Rink. It has good ambiance, nice music and decor.   I ordered Cappuccino and cheese croissant. The coffee was overly milky and lacking coffee flavor. The cheese inside the croissant tasted weird.  I may try this spot another time for drinks and meals, but for now its fail."}
{"text":"The environment is inspiring and views are spectacular. The service was the downfall."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and people didn't judge me for taking numerous pictures of my beverage. Would recommend for a coffee date. Free wifi is an added bonus - don't forget to retrieve the password before you scurry upstairs."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I've been here three times. It really is a gem.  I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on that. The tea was good, and we picked out a bottle of nice Riesling with the help of our server. I absolutely recommend the charcuterie plate or the cheese board. Both are fantastic. On second thought, they may have come together. They also serve local-made jams [from a cute little place in Roncy, I forget the name already].  The atmosphere is really laid back. There's a hidden patio in the back, surrounded by [Christmassy?] lights. Highly recommend to sit there in the summer.  They also make arrangements if you want to close off part of the place for a party. I hear their baked goods are delicious, but I always come by when it's too late and they're all gone [i.e. in the late evening]."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this bar from coworkers, and it lived up to them all. Great local craft beer, chill bartenders, and great views of the water."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social looks like a coffee shop, but it is also a wine bar. The atmosphere and aesthetics is modern with a hipster vibe. The prices are comparable to other coffee / wine bars which is to say there's a small \"hipster tax\". On the weekends, the coffee and wine bar is quite lively.   I ordered the london fog with almond milk. It was pretty good, but portion was small for the price paid (again \"hipster tax\").   Boxcar Social also has a small menu. The items on the menu is light and fresh. I had the Avo Toast with salad. It was delicious. I would recommend it.  However, the portion is small for what you are paying.  The service is mediocre.  Overall, I would recommend this place if you are by the harbourfront. It is a great pitstop."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little coffee shop that isn't limited to just coffee. It's very cozy and welcoming, and great place any time of the day.  I only had their cappuccino, and it was really good. I would have to drop in again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I expected and wanted. A small, intimate coffee/wine bar. The wine bar was a bonus -- I had no idea. We sat at the bar and chatted with the individual serving us who was very knowledgeable on his wines and scotches. We arrived around 6:30, so there was still some room but as we wrapped up it slowly filled up so, keep that in mind; it's small. But I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"I passed by the Boxcar Social on Friday evening for some appetizers and drinks. The staff there is very proud and knowledgeable about all the products on there menu. It is great to hear and see there dedication to preparing coffee or discussing the various types of beer they have. It is a nice place that is not stuffy or overwhelming. A great place to have a casual drink with a friend and nice enough to take a date without the intimidation.  I like there focus on Canadian beers mainly from quebec as there is a great selection available - a great alternative to the international pub houses. I look forward to going back and trying there coffee and soaking in the good vibes there!"}
{"text":"Super cute spot for a date.  Came here for a coffee and was greeted with a warm smile and excellent overall customer service.  Was given a glass of water while I waited, without any pressure to order ahead.  We had a chai latte and a cortado, both of which, were very very good.  I would have to argue that the cortado was the best one I've had in Toronto!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Once again, the service is lacking to where I have had to speak about it again.  I'm here right now in the daytime. There are more servers and they are a little more attentive. But not much.   We ordered our food around 40 minutes ago. It felt like forever, though. And it still hasn't come yet. Turns out the system for the iPad ordering messed up? But still, wouldn't you think that the food should have come out within the first 10 to 15 minutes? You should check if the food is being made instead of making cutlery rolls. I am very disappointed in the lack of communication. They're making a rush order for us as I type, but this sucks. Not what I expect for what I'm paying for my meal on the Harbourfront in Toronto.  Atmosphere is nice, nonetheless. Good for sight seeing and people watching."}
{"text":"You have to order at the bar so how can they expect a tip? The outside patio has uncomfortable seats and is full of bugs. The prices of the beers are INSANE. This place is a joke only suitable for wealthy yuppies."}
{"text":"The greatest aspect about this place is that you can come in to read a book and do work, or come in with your friends or alone to have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere. Their coffee is great and they have different kinds of milks which is great as well. The staff were super friendly!"}
{"text":"\"The area is actually quite lovely for a weekend stroll. Boxcar Social was filled with a humming crowd on this sunny Sunday afternoon. Their unique, illustrated logo did not grab too much attention but rather blend in with the neighbourhood. Boxcar's lot was narrow, perhaps maybe to resemble an actual boxcar.\" \"It took a while to get to order. The two baristas were not in a particular rush. They were very committed to the task, definitely not about servicing quantity but showing quality in their craft. \" \"I enjoyed my Mocha at the \"shoe display\" area facing Yonge, I strongly considered the patio, but I was not brave enough as it was still brisk outside. The Mocha was lovely - with slightly sweet dark chocolate and the perfect amount of froth.\"  Just a few bites of our full review."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the coffee shop is really nice and welcoming. I had an Earl grey tea latte and shared some snacks with a friend. The prices are reasonable and the food/drinks were really good. The Baristas are super friendly and there seems to be a lot of locals/regular customers here. There is an upstairs for more seating, but it can get busy/crowded."}
{"text":"This location was near the Airbnb we stayed at while in Toronto. Hands down the best iced vanilla latte I've ever had. Instead of giving you ice in the latte to make it cold, it comes iced (without ice cubes to dilute the taste!) and it comes in a really cute glass. You can also see the vanilla beans in the drink (not the vanilla syrup stuff). The consistency of the drink was amazing - I find myself craving it now that I'm back in California. The food was decent but a little pricey, and service was pretty good though there was some confusion about whether or not we seated ourselves or needed to wait for the hostess. Oh, also it has big glass windows with a great view of the water."}
{"text":"Seriously, our favorite place in Toronto!  Environment is great! Coffee was amazing and the smoked Salmon sandwich with the salad and fries were spectacular! Definitely coming here every time we come to Toronto."}
{"text":"The good: The drip coffee is not bad. Hipster space and average prices.  The bad: The decaf Americano was pretty bad.   Service was awful. There was no organized line up. I ordered a decaf Americano and accidentally went to grab a regular Americano and was scolded with a \"I said Americano, not decaf Americano.\"  It was an honest mistake and as other reviews mentioned, asking people their names helps."}
{"text":"Bored of the nearby Starbucks, my pal and I decided to check out Boxcar Social this afternoon. Conveniently located right by Summerhill Station, it's a great place to meet up with friends. Very unassuming, I almost walked past BS. The menu is primarily coffee (and coffee based drinks), but they also have teas and alcohol. Staff here know their stuff and are willingly to answer any questions that you might have. I didn't see a food menu, but patrons were eating a sandwich. Not sure if this is a Sunday feature? Anyway, my pal and I sat on the patio in the back as we enjoyed our drinks. In spite of being right on Yonge, the cozy patio is so quite and relaxing. You feel as if you're just relaxing in your backyard. Can't wait to come back !  Good for: coffee, tea, drinks"}
{"text":"This place for me is more about the location than the actual dining experience. I recently went to the Harbourfront location on a very nice, sunny day and thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the wooden patio.  The food was definitely not bad but their selection is very, very small. This isn't always a bad thing but I think they could expand their options a bit.  They had a decent beer selection and prices were pretty standard. The overall quality of the food was quite good but again, my only real motivation to return would be for the lakeside view."}
{"text":"This place just opened recently, but unlike some of the earlier reviewers I has the privilege of visiting on the first night they had their liquor license. Here is a run down: 1. Liquor - lovely wine list with really diverse and tasty choices. Beer was also amazing, one of the few places the serves Beau's 2. Food - although there were few items to choose from, they are only just getting ramped up and will have a full meat board soon (or already?!). I got the cheese board and I have to say compared to every place I've been in Toronto this would be the best - the amounts were large, and they were all tasty and diverse. Bread and jelly were also provided. There were 3 jellys that upon inquiring apparently come from a store that makes them from scratch next door, amazingly tasty and such a great compliment to the cheeses, making the permutations of flavours quite large! Again, I can't wait to see what other food they add to the menu. The price was one of the lowest I've ever seen for a cheese board. Win. Win. Win. 3. Coffee - the latte was one of the best I've had on the city. Apparently the barista who runs the coffee side of things has own awards for his skills, so this isn't surprising, but definitely appreciated. 4. Dessert - amazing chocolate brownie; my boyfriend is crazy for chocolate and he swears it is the most moist and rich brownie he has had in a while. 5. Staff  - incredibly knowledgable about their menu. Very friendly, attentive, and make a habit of makin sure patrons are well taken care of. 6. Decor - rustic, comfortable, clean, inviting. Apparently some of the furniture was made from wood that was recovered fr fallen trees after the ice storm that hit Toronto late last year. Patio is warm and inviting.  Keep up the good work! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding lunch here.  We had the avocado toast (yum!), porchetta sandwich, smoked salmon toast, and french fries. All were delicious and we will be back for sure! My oldest kid loved the peach blossom tea.  Great view of the lake, excellent music, and friendly service. A+"}
{"text":"Just had a customer service incident where a guy was trying to butt-in. The staff immediately recognized it and served me first. Great taking ownership of the problem. And they closed the door to the patio so we're warm again.lol. I'd love it if Boxcar Social opened up a spot in a large, open concept place like 49th Parallel has on I think Main street in Vancouver. Looking like an old, abandoned turn of the century train station. BUT that's personal preference. For now, this is my favorite spot in TO."}
{"text":"This is a local coffee shop with lots of seating, great atmosphere, and the usual range of coffee shop drinks. I thought it was a bit of a tight squeeze at a busy time of day with everyone crowded around the counter and the wait was slightly longer than I would have liked, but the chai latte I got was great. It wasn't sweetened and was made from loose leaf tea. Also noted that they use organic milk and have a range of substitutes as well! I was surprised by the lack of food options though - they didn't even have many pastries.  Definitely a great place to go if you're looking for something simple and \"standard\" by hipster coffeeshop standards."}
{"text":"Great that my cappuccino could be made with lactose-free milk. Bit pricey for small cup ($4.20 but that includes tax) and seats uncomfortable. Lots of flies because of open door and windows. Bathroom was clean but toilet doesn't flush nicely. Not the greatest hangout spot but seems to be filled with students taking up large tables to themselves for studying/study groups. Also, a cobweb from the ceiling fell on my shoulder as I was chatting to my friend."}
{"text":"(Ex) Barista approved! This place is the perf spot for studying, a date, dinner or to people watch (and see people slipping and sliding on the ice in the winter). It's absolutely beautiful and the interior is quite large even though it has a very cozy feel. The aesthetic is dark, romantic and intimate.   It closes late-ish and it was my first time there and I can definitely say I'll be back even though it's not close to where I usually am downtown at all. I parked in the underground that's right there (cheap in the evenings) and it was a 3 minute walk from there. Easy peasy. I suck at navigating the ttc other than the subway but the streetcar stops right in front of the harbourfront centre too.  When people say 'you're fine like espresso', this is what they meant because this espresso was the finest, smoothest thing ever. Each drink was made to perfection and my espresso machiatto was deliciouso. They also have dairy free milk alternatives, which any coffee shop should have by now. I was taken here to try the vegan bars they have because apparently they're delicious, but they were out by the time it was 8pm-ish. Will need to satisfy my tummy another time.  They also have alcohol.  I felt like that had to be it's own sentence ..anyways! I can't wait to visit this beautiful coffee joint when it doesn't feel like my bones are going to freeze and crack anymore. Winter, go away."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I feel in love right away. The atmosphere is so chill and relaxing. I ordered a vanilla latte and was pleasantly surprised at how smooth it was with just the right amount of flavour. My husband was happy that there was a selection of beer to change things up since he is not a coffee person. Their outside patio looked great too but since it was a bit of a chilly July day, we opted to stay inside. My only qualm was a lack of cookies or something to go with my latte but that might have been better for me in the long run anyway since I had already eaten lunch ;)   I'd definitely come back here to read or get some work done or something one day soon."}
{"text":"We were looking for a wine bar to end the evening this past weekend and were very happy to find this one!  The lights & music (The Weeknd's new album) were enticing and the patio was relatively empty, making it a nice place to post up and relax.  Inside it was a little crazy, more people and the computers had crashed but the server was very nice, took our order and said we would figure it out later but he didn't want us to wait.  I had a glass of Bodegas Lozano 'Oristan Gran Riserva' 2008... SO GOOD.  Such a complex, yummy wine.  I highly recommend it! Definitely check it out, relax, enjoy the view & the music & order the Oristan Gran Riserva!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places when I'm in Toronto. Cute outdoor patio, good whisky and coffee selection and friendly staff. Can be pricey but that's Summerhill and the drink selection is consistently well curated so chances of disappointment are minimal. All in all, a good place to catch up and have a lovely time with friends. There's also the LCBO flagship store located conveniently across the street, if you happen to really like the drink you just ordered."}
{"text":"My go to cafe when visiting Toronto. Perfect temperature every time and great to see them weighing shots which seems to be lacking in most cafes in Toronto. Nice selection too, using a variety of roasters allowing you to get a chance to sample great coffee from all over. If there's one opportunity to grab an espresso based drink, look no further."}
{"text":"I get it,  Boxcar Social. After three decades in the service industry, eight of which were devoted to achieving award-winning service at the cafés I owned and operated, I get your challenges. What I don't get is the service attitude I experienced yesterday.  When wrapping up a long walk in the Rosedale 'hood with friends, we reward ourselves with a hot beverage at the Boxcar Social. Well, we did. Some of us frequent Boxcar Social several times a week. It's not busy anytime I've gone in during daylight hours, but I hear the place is jumping at night, offering adult beverages and a popular hangout. Business is thriving. I was happy to hear of a viable coffee shop nearby that purports to care about offering a gathering place.  My socks haven't yet been knocked off, but until yesterday, I was happy to support the business and stay open to the possibility they'd be about cultivating good experiences for their customers. Not any more.  Two of us came in first yesterday morning; we were the only people at the counter. There were three people working behind it. What a great chance to find the joy in caring about one's customers, right? 'Don't think the three guys behind the counter saw it that way. It was like we were interuppting them - no one greeted us until we spoke, and the 'wired-to-delight' gene wasn't evident in anyone. We ordered - and we ordered for our friend that would be joining us in a few minutes. I kidded the chap that he looked like someone we used to work with, and that he might mention this to our mate when he came in shortly. Yes, I get that part, too. I know I can augment my service experience by being a friendly and appreciative customer.  I asked to be charged for a tea and to let me know if that's not what was ordered and I'd make up the difference. After laying down $12 and change for three teas and a croissant, I dropped a toonie into the tip bucket. The two of us sat down. Until our friend joined us a few minutes later, tea in hand at the table, there were no other customers. I asked him if he was told it was paid for. He told me he'd paid for it and no one had said anything.  I decided to mention this double-payment on the way out and enjoy the time with my friends. Managing my own disappointment at what I perceived as inattentiveness and being non-plussed - there will always be time to reflect on how challenged some service providers are to understand the basics. As I stress when I'm training and doing needs analysis for service strategies, 'comfort' and 'being seen' are key things that turn customers into repeats and regulars, and are essential steps to creating a raving fan of one's business. I'm missing the committment to the bottom line here, folks. No repeat customers, no word of mouth ultimately spells no business. The plate needs to be kept spinning - great sales one month can disappear quickly when a ball is dropped. Yes, even for a cup of tea. It may be easier to sell a few high-end items rather than cups and cups of hot beverages, but that's what this business is built on - creating a great experience folks want to return to - one cup at a time.  As I left, I went up to the counter and said, \"I'd pre-paid for my friend and he paid for his drink himself, as no one said anything to him.\" OOOPS! Another opportunity squandered, Boxcar Social. This is where you get to sieze the opportunity to create a raving fan. It wouldn't have taken much!! I would have settled for an apology. Offering a refund or a credit would have demonstrated I mattered as a customer. Eye contact thrown in for good measure would have communicated it mattered at all... but instead, I got an off-hand, \"Oh, really.\" Nothing more. What an excellent opportunity to leverage a bad situation into creating increased business! You blew it, and you let your business everyone who depends on its success down. Why on earth would I return?  The 'hood has no shortage of coffee spots.  What I lost:  The comfort level of feeling welcome when walking into a favourite place I once frequented and feeling valued as a customer. My intention to treat my friend and surprise him, even a little, thwarted by the lack of caring service providers.  What Social Boxcar lost: Me. A customer and supporter and cost-free marketer of Boxcar Social who won't return. My goodwill. Gone is my perception that Boxcar enhances the 'hood."}
{"text":"I both love this place and hate it too.   What I love:   Its a super trendy vibe that makes a cheap raw remodel of a vintage house - cool. Its what every neighborhood needs and wants. Its a gem to have coffee meetings because it sure isnt your local Starbucks.   It takes its coffee seriously. Really seriously.   It has yummy treats. The Nutella ones are oh so naughty and good.   It has ample seating. Inside, outside (super cool), upstairs.   What I hate:   The service. Every time to go there, I feel like i'm walking into the \"coffee version\" of the Seinfeld Soup Kitchen they snub their noses at you. By who let me be clear, the owners, the early crew. I once let them know their tea they reco'd was 'no bueno' and you would have thought I was being sent to guantanemo bay with their dismissive gaze. You have to basically mollycoddle to the them or expect to be on the outs. It's that kind of attitude. Hmmmm.   The heat. In the summer you essentially melt. Its stifling. They have a portable air conditioner with a hose out the door battling for entry space as you wind your way up the steep stairs. For the love of Pete, get some air con in there. Why have a hot drink in a hot sauna.   The steep stairs. I dare say there has been a stumble in the liquor hours, for heavens sake put up a hand rail (on both sides).   I can see its growing in the liquor menu and fan fare so I'll try it again and re-star if it improves for now as i'm on the edge i'm having to give this a 3 but I so want it to be a 4 or 5.   Customers matter guys. Get on it.   Watch this space..."}
{"text":"Independent coffee shop, in an old house/ business, lots of quirky seating.. Coffee is decent enough, place is slightly pretentious but not over bearing.. A decent change from Starbucks .. No comfy sofa chairs though, guess they don't want people staying too long, even though the laptop brigade, will sit on a hard chair regardless...."}
{"text":"Ok I'll say this: The coffee is really good, if you want a nice strong cup of coffee like, you are in the right place!!! (coffee.late,cappuccino etc)  After 5 the place transforms into a \"bar\".. I don't get it.. The have bourbon, rye, wine list, beer and more whisky I can't remember and they don't make cocktails   loud music   Overall the place it's to hipster for me"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this venue. Simple, good drinks and light appetizers. The menu is short; no cocktails. They've found beauty in brevity. Charcuterie is great. This place doubles as great venue to meet someone in person that you \"swiped right\" for, or a great place to show up alone and do some swiping."}
{"text":"Bohemian interior, very masculine and hipster style, a little sterile. The coffee was good, nothing amazing. The service was slow. The barista was taking a long time weighing the coffee before putting it into the espresso machine. Who weighs coffee?? As a result, there was a long line of customers. Great coffee but the rest is... I guess is not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"The other reviews for this place are old -- this is no longer outdoors. The cafe is roofed, walled and generally sheltered from the elements.   I was only here for 10 minutes, but I was impressed. Bright narrow space, hip decor with a little edginess and friendly staff. I arrived sunday morning before the cafe opened and was served a delicious cup of filter coffee nonetheless. I plan to go back."}
{"text":"The guys that have opened this place are so great - love the casual, friendly vibe.  Love their concept for creating an awesome neighbourhood spot that pulls a crowd all through the day.  We have been a number of times for coffee, for beers.  Pros -  Good coffee, not the best, but very good and they clearly care Always good crowds and chatty staff happy to serve - they feel like friends with some standing by the bar chatting, others working in the back Love the Patio, and the furniture is really cool - I think one of the owners built it & he could start a side business, especially love the built in console near the front Beer and wine list is pretty good too  Cons -  Food isn't there yet - I think they need to keep working on the right mix of snacks, pasties & beer friendly food - they have a guest BBQ option which is a fun idea, but some trusty snack options as well would really help.  It took Ezra's a while to get the right mix and once these guys get it right they will get more of our business. All that friendliness can lead to slow service - not the best place if you are in a rush to grab a coffee (I guess that is deliberate on their part, but there have been a few times I had to leave the line).  Overall, check it out!  It is a great addition to the area and I wish the guys who have started it all the success making it in to a Summerhill mainstay!"}
{"text":"Good place for a cup of coffee or a drink. The downside is that they don't have anything to eat! Some croissant and maybe a muffin, but they don't even have an oven to warm up anything. But their coffee was great and the music and the place is really nice place to sit and have a good time"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite hangout spot! My girl friends and I were trying to find a spot to sit and have a few drinks by Harbour front but every resto had a line up. We walked up to this bar and the ambience was dim and spacious, only had a few people sitting in the patio. This is a bar which only serves beer, wine, and whiskey. The bartender was exceptionally nice and helpful. He guided me to a new fav beer and he offered us samples of whiskey! He definitely made our girls night out memorable. I would definitely come back again for the service and drinks. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times for their coffee. Their drip coffee is fine when hot, but turns into this terrible, smelly sour drink when it cools down even the slightest.   On the other hand, their flat white is great and the ambiance is incredible. But a great space can't remedy a coffee joint with coffee that spoils before you're done the cup."}
{"text":"my one of favorite cafe in toronto  good : great coffee and coworkers/ close to station/ patio/ good atmosphere bad : need more seats/ bad for studying (noisy)"}
{"text":"What a cute and quaint place this it!  Ok yes it's narrow and small, but there is a fairly large outdoor patio in the back you can take advantage of in the warmer months. t's got that upscale vibe without feeling pretentious at all.  Stop in for a coffee/espresso on the way to work and then for a glass of wine or some beer after work.  Their selection is pretty impressive and their prices are decent.   I can only imagine how busy this place must get Friday nights and weekends so try to hit it on an off time or a weekday.  It's located right outside the Summerhill station and you can get some street parking.  This is my only pet peeve - parking around this area is annoying at the best of times, can only imagine on the weekends if you are driving here.  All the staff are extremely friendly, but in such a genuine way.  The tables in the back (looks like they are made from reclaimed wood) adds a nice touch to this place."}
{"text":"I went at night, more bar than coffee shop, fortunately coffee still available. Excellent flat white, excellent. Bartender on staff was personable, really friendly. I don't usually go north of Bloor, boxcar and yeah yeahs pizza create a good reason to walk 10 minutes from Bloor and Yonge."}
{"text":"Great scotch/Whiskey bar. Food pairing was exceptional. Decor and music was amazing.  Place was hard to find and not a lot of signage to direct you."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of three times.  Each time is pretty much the same as the previous.  First off the location is stellar !  Views of the lake and island, and the proximity to the foot traffic along the lake, etc.  Hard to top.  I've only come here for drinks.  I've looked at the food menu and it does have a few items that look like more pub food, but with a twist.  If I was hungry I'd probably seek out other places in the area.  Every time I've been there is always a section to the west that is blocked off for groups (looks like mostly office functions).  The food that gets served there doesn't look anything like the food from the menu (it looks much better).    Boxcar has a great selection of beers on tap as well as some high-end spirits.  The place is always loud, but in all the times I've been there, there hasn't been any music playing, it's just loud because of the people in there and the acoustics.  The tables on the patio are much quieter, but on a nice day... well, Good luck !  All of the above would have netted this to be at least a 4 star place.  However the service or lack there of is the downfall here.  If you manage to find a table you are more than likely having to go to the bar yourself to get your own drinks.  Which usually means queuing up behind the table servers (yes the ones that should be getting the drinks for you).  The Bartenders are very personable, but clearly understaffed.  I've often seen staff just standing around behind the bar.  Not really sure if they are servers or what.  Even if you do get a table and a server, don't be surprised if you have to flag down other servers to get fresh drinks.  Attentiveness isn't something practiced.    Overall, because I like the location, and the selection of beers, I'll go back, but I know the expectations for service, so I won't really be disappointed.  It could just be so much better."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5. The view is absolutely beautiful. Can't argue with this place for the water front setting. It's busy but there's always space somewhere. So props to the designers for accommodating throngs of tourists, locals and lakeshore lovers.  We came here for coffee. The first attempt at a an americano was not too good. Too much water so I was happy to see they accommodated us with another cup. I ordered a london fog latter which stranglely enough tasted spot on with a starbucks version. A compliment or not?I am unsure.  I can say, I loved the setting. Very relaxing. The customer service was okay. Not a smile or a wee bit of positive energy from the three that worked there. I was hoping maybe at least 1 out 3 might crack a smile or maybe something that said they liked being there.  It's better coffee than the usual in the area but by no means is it say, a destination coffee house. Which is disappointing considering they featured phil and sebastian."}
{"text":"This is without doubt the best coffee shack in TO. Grant, the barista... (Or owner) has more passion for coffee than just about anyone I have ever met. I had the \"Origin Flight\" the same coffee done with 3 different processes. The place oozes cool... Amazing west sun patio. Just awesome."}
{"text":"I usually just go in for an espresso and its exceptional. They serve it with some sparkling water to balance out the bitterness. The back patio is awesome and allows for some quite working/reading time during the day. I'm excited to bring my girlfriend with me so we can try out the wine list sometime."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. The staff are always so friendly and welcoming. They have Tasting Flights you can try and a large list of different drinks and craft beers at the their bar. The upstairs space is quiet and cozy. Wifi Password: boxcarsocial."}
{"text":"The patio is a great vibe during the warmer months to enjoy over priced wine and no food, they have little trays of over priced cheese and crackers that take forever to come when you order it. The coffee takes forever to be made, the guys are nice enough but not a place to go if you want fast service, and nothing to eat."}
{"text":"Waitresses r blind here, well... Actually when we finally flagged her down She just waved back and walked away..... no miss I am not ur biggest fan...Ur a waitress not a celebrity no need to wave back and walk away...O God...So thirsty...Let me go to bar area and ask for a water...Wait is this a restaurant or food court...So confused .   We asked to moved tables she didn't assist us at all.  We moved all the plates, cutlery drinks everything ourselves.  Hard to flag down a waitress, you might as well go to the bar area yourself.  Food was alright....Just toast.  To our server reality check ur not Taylor Swift."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social has a tiny storefront, but it's so cozy once you step in. The barista was very cheery, and seemed to be quite nifty at latte art. We ordered a macchiato and iced tea. I would pass on the macchiato next time, but they had a wide variety of tea flavours. The peach blossom iced tea was very refreshing. Keep in mind that it takes around 5 minutes to brew. In terms of food, they only had a small tray of pastries to the side, so be sure not to come here on an empty stomach.  The seats downstairs were pretty much filled, so we headed upstairs. There's a skylight and plenty of natural lighting, which was great for working. However, the walls were covered with random paint splotches and hooks where paintings should've been. Not sure if things were taken down or if they mean to fix up the place in the future. The background music changed genres frequently, but it wasn't too loud, so earphones would easily cancel out unwanted noise.  I would definitely come back to try some of their coffees. Overall a great little cafe."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a coffee shop that also serves alcohol. Buffalo doesn't have NEARLY enough. The vibe is always good...almost by definition. Wanna make a lot of money? Open something similar in the Queen City. I digress...  Combine a great drink menu with wonderful lake views, big bright windows, friendly staff, delicious looking food (can't comment on taste...) and fantastic unlimited wifi, this is a perfect spot to work when visiting Toronto. They have a few locations in the city, but this one is located just down the road from the main tourist hubs and many hotels (CN tower, aquarium, stadium, etc). I suspect that locals prefer their other locations, but this worked just fine for me!  Visiting in March meant it was pretty dead. Too warm for tourists to ice skate; too cold for tourists to walk along the lake. I'd imagine the place fills up during most other months, but I liked the quiet, chilled out vibe. Great music selection too...I don't go to coffee shops without my trusty headphones, but they actually were NOT needed here.   Not bothered by anyone for the few hours we were here. Great spot overall! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Ended up here after an evening stroll down Yonge after work. Cool vibe. Liked the washroom upstairs! Laid back but pleasant staff.   And 18 bourbons to choose from. All good.   I wish I new there was food option. Shoulda asked I guess. Cheese nibbles described elsewhere sound good."}
{"text":"Right from when we entered this place it was a total waste. When we entered there was no one to help us with the table or get us seated.  We found a table ourselves and sat there for like 20 mins and no server came to our table with menu or water. So I decided to go to their bar and get some menus and when I got there all their servers were busy chatting with each other and 5 mins later they realized I was standing there seeking their help to get some menus and water. They handed me the menu which was too small and the entire menu was divided in time slots with nothing special on the menu at all.  When you go there beware that their service is really poor and food is not that great.  I am definitely not coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Great if you want to sit here and enjoy the atmosphere. Terrible if you actually want to get something. Servers are excellent at avoiding eye contact and talented at zooming past you before you can even begin to say \"excuse me\". Once you manage to catch a server they will begrudgingly take your order.  If you an actually manage to get a drink, it's pretty good.   Hipster scowls are free with every order."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social has got a whole lotta stuff going on and I like it. Ever since they opened with their (originally) small coffee shop on Yonge Street across from Summerhill Station they have continued to grow and improve. Great coffee? Check Patio? Check Liquor licence? Check New upstairs floor? Check Even bigger patio? Check New location on Queen East? Check (and need to check this out)  It's like boom boom boom - these guys are going great guns. And it is nice to see a business run by young people.   The coffee - it's always good. I'm not a every day visitor and thus not familiar with all the baristas they have now. The owners have been there less and I would assume it is because they were busy opening up the new storefront.  The liquor - a nice selection of premium whiskeys and bottled beers. Extra points for the basil hayden and the dieu du ciel rosee d'hibiscus.  The food - a selection of pastries and cookies similar to what you would find in other independent cafes around the city. And also charcuterie and cheese boards to go with your scotch.  The patio - it is a lovely and peaceful place to sit under the trees and newly expanded to fit a hell of a lot more people. And the wifi works well out there if you are closer to the door.  One comment I will make is that the staff are not particularly chatty. They are pleasant enough if you engage them or go to the counter to order something but that's the extent of it - they'll just plonk your coffee down on the counter and go back to speaking amongst themselves or whatever else they were doing."}
{"text":"@boxcar_social @HarbourfrontTO #YELPTO #TORONTO #COFFEESHOP #COFFEEGEEK  This was my alternative for Amsterdam BrewHouse on Queens Quay because it was full as usual. Boxcar was a pleasant surprise. I have been writing it off as a coffee shop and would've never thought to wander there in the evening, but boy was I missing out? Glass exteriored Boxcar offers an amazing lake view for all. The interior is large yet cozy. I am thinking this is due to the dim lighting - it feels quite intimate. I'd say it's a great place for a date but I'd totally even just crawl in there by myself.   I didn't eat there but the bites that I saw made me want to try some and I am probably going to go back soon. However, I did sip on a few glasses of light white wine and it was lovely. The wine, I believe from what I remember, ranges from $12 to $20 per glass. My friend ordered whiskey. And I know they serve beer too. And ofcourse, coffee.   Can't wait to go back for some food and coffee next time!"}
{"text":"Walked in thinking this will be fantastic! Walked out facepalm-ing myself.  Ordered a \"pour-over\" which was marked \"MP\" on the board (meant market price). Thinking it was probably standard as everywhere else, decided to take a leap of faith...but ended up a leap off a cliff.   The price came up to be $5.85 and around 275(ish) mL!!!! Really wanted to ask \"Come again?\" Fair enough, for something so expensive it must taste heavenly or at least demi-godly, right? Nope! What was worse was that the beans were under-extracted and coffee quite sour; can taste the unpleasant sourness coat my whole tongue and perpetuate down my throat (chewed 2 pieces of gum after).   Coffee was disappointing, BUT the flaming hot chocolate looked interesting...hopefully it will erase all the facepalms from this experience."}
{"text":"LOVE this cafe!  Amazing atmosphere, it has a very chill and cool vibe.  The coffee is really good quality, and the service is great.  The space is interesting as it has whatever you're looking for, the backyard is very relaxed, perfect for a chill/talking with friends, and upstairs is more quiet - great for working/studying. I also love the fact that they have liquor and are open till 2!    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they don't have much food options, and although the location is cute - there's absolutely no parking in the area."}
{"text":"Really sleek cafe with tons of space. I love the addition the cafe makes to harbourfront! Great choice, good eats, and it looks like they have a bar too. It's a little chilly inside though."}
{"text":"If there's an option to give half star, i seriously would.    My boyfriend and I were strolling around in the area over the weekend and we decided to check this place out for a quick beer and snack.  Instead, that turned into an hour of sitting in the sun for beers that never made it to our table.    We waited in line for 10 mins before we get seated at the patio which is fine considering it is the Canada day long weekend.  We waited at least 20 mins before our waiter, Carlos, came to our table to to greet us.  He recommended us two beer samples for us to try before ordering full pints.  We agreed as the restaurant does not carry the beers that we normally order as they only carry local beers.  We also ordered a poutine as a snack.    Another 20 mins of wait before our poutine came(with no utensils), but the beer samples never made it to our table..... We had to ask another staff to follow up on our beer samples as we were just too thirsty (imagine eating poutine in the heat without drinks being served).   The beer samples finally came when we were already half way into finishing up the poutine.  We did not like the taste of the beer samples that they gave us at all.... we wanted to ask for other samples to try but our waiter never came back to check on us.    It came to a point where my boyfriend got fed up with the terrible service that we got up and went to the cash register to ask for our bill.  This was when our waiter, Carlos finally came to us and asked if everything is okay.  Why is that even a question?  I told him how disappointing we were  due to the lack of service.  Carlos apologized and said he would take care of our bill but my boyfriend insisted and paid for what we had and left no tip (first time ever).   All in all, we spent an hour and 15 mins at this restaurant for a poutine (which was alright) with no water/drinks being served.  Never coming back again and would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I used to live near the one on Summerhill, so I used to go there quite a bit on my way to work. I had some work that I needed to do, so I decided to try this one on for size. When I  told the hostess I had some work to do, she placed me in a corner by an outlet, and out of the way!!The young lady who served me was Fantastic! it was her second day, I told her to take care of the other customers while I got settled, when she came back to me, she was patient, only came over when I asked for her! I got so wrapped up in what I was doing I didn't even see her go off shift! (I did mention to her manager how good she was!)  The only thing that I would recommend is that they expand there evening food selection."}
{"text":"The coffee is excellent and the pastries they source from Delysees are first rate. The patio is lovely on a sunny morning as it overlooks the Natrel pond and the lake. The sandwiches are more or less tasteless. A good selection of interesting wines - not the usual boring stuff. The downside is service. It can be good at times but more frequently it's ineffective, inefficient and seemingly disorganized. It's galling to see one person handling the drinks and orders and others meandering in and out of the back office/kitchen oblivious to customers."}
{"text":"Great beer, great atmosphere, and great coffee. A good place to head alone to work, meet friends for a beer, or chill while skating. The beer menu is stellar."}
{"text":"So if I am walking towards 7 Grams for my Sunday morning latte, and I come across a coffee stand that is outdoors and doesn't have a very long wait, would I stop?  Ummm, heck yeah! This one of their three locations. For now, it's directly in front of Club Monaco. I'm told they will move downstairs when the weather is colder. There are three small tables with about 3 chairs each in front to, if you want to sit and people watch. There's a Bake Shoppe stand next to it as well if you want to grab something to snack on with your coffee. The latte was good too. I think it's a great outdoor location for a coffee stand!"}
{"text":"Cet endroit offre des cafés exécutés avec un savoir-faire difficilement égalé. Le service est très courtois, l'endroit est sympathique."}
{"text":"Great alternative to the chain coffee shops in the area. This is a vast improvement from the cafeteria that was previously here. Prime location overlooking the Harbourfront Centre and lake. It's right next to the skating rink (in the winter) and pond thing (in the summer -- which people hilariously try to \"canoe\" in, even though it's about 1 foot deep!).   The decor and vibe is similar to other Boxcar locations. It's a great place at any time of day, both as a coffee shop, somewhere to eat a meal, or for a drink. There's plenty of seating, including several long communal tables and patio seating. There's wifi and in the quiet parts of the day, it's an ideal place to read or get some work done.   Food options are much more robust compared to most cafes. They have a nice selection of paninis and salads at lunch. The fries portion is huge! Unfortunately, I found the fries super salty and their seasoning was overpowering. I've been here for dinner and they have a few small plates/sharing items. There aren't many \"entree\" type dishes, but there is a cavatelli dish that could be a main course and it was delicious.   This area is such a culinary wasteland, so Boxcar is very much welcome here and definitely my go-to for Harbourfront eats."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here. I have only been here during the day, but they do have a liquor license and drinks menu at night. I find this to be a great spot to get some reading or work done. There is ample seating between the two floors, it's not too noisy or crowded, and they have reliable wifi and great espresso drinks. Bonus points for a decent selection of food offerings in case you get hungry. I like their croissants (available in regular, chocolate, chocolate hazelnut, and cheese varieties). Add friendly service, stylish decor, and a convenient location just across from the subway station and you have a pretty perfect spot!"}
{"text":"I waited at the door for over 5 or 10 minutes during which 2 waitresses walked passed and never said a word so I just left rather than beg for acknowledgement"}
{"text":"Went here in September and was able to sit in the patio. We ordered London Fog and hot chocolate. Both were yummy. The atmosphere is very hipster like. The patio has decent amount of seating and even has twinkling lights strung around. Good place to hang out or do some work."}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend introduced it to me a few weeks ago and I have now been twice. Both times have been great experiences, and I personally haven't experienced any of the issues about which others have commented. On my first visit, I ordered a cappuccino. Great quality, cute latte art. The second time, I ordered a glass of wine, and spent a while chatting with the bartender, Grant, about it. He let me try 2 samples to make a decision, and even wrote down a wine recommendation for me on a post-it note because we have similar tastes/preferences. Great customer service, in my opinion, and great quality on the menu. I will absolutely go back. Can't wait to try the patio this summer!"}
{"text":"This place have the cutest patio, hands down.  And that is why I can literally say, I am in love with this place.   The service was super warm and friendly.  My friend and I was deciding on what we want and they were like, \"ok, we got your order and repeated it to us.\"  Talk about being ahead, right?  Really superb service!    My iced latte was the prettiest and my friend's americano, he said, was just right.   I need to come more often.   It's nice to see a nice coffee shop in this area after Patachou left.    I kinda wish I can keep this place a secret forever and ever so I can keep their patio to myself.   Haha...  Note to the owners:  Please serve food soon!   Anything!  Something small even.  Although,  I still love you guys just as much without it.  But it would be a nice added bonus. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is right on top of the harbourfront skate rental. So while my friends are off skating, I had time to sit and relax to enjoy cup of beautiful cappuccino! I sat in front of the large glass windows that's facing the line up right in front of skating rental. The menu has variety of specialty coffee and beer. There's also a menu of appetizer and full size meal entrees. Some of the options look delicious like the Brussels sprouts with poached egg. Next time when I come I will be sure to come on an empty stomach to try the delicious sounding healthy options."}
{"text":"I love coming here on a brew-tiful day!  Boxcar Social has now become my #1 place to work, hang out, meet friends, or even just admire the beautiful (I mean brew-tiful) view of Harbourfront!  The ambience of the place is perfect and transitions seamlessly through the evening from a chill bar to one that is full of energy and bustling with people moving in and about!  During the day, it's a perfect place to work, kick back with some good tea or coffee and watch the ducks fly in to swim on the pond in front. During the evening, it's a wonderful place to relax with some friends over a couple drinks and catch up on the day's/week's happenings The patio is accessible (although the inconvenience of the ramp is slightly off putting) but the marvellous view tends to make up for any ill will.   Moving on to the actual menu, the drinks are reasonably priced (Half bottle wine on Tuesdays!!!) And the food is actually fairly delicious.   I would recommend the Peach Blossom Tea with it's scented aroma and it'll leave you in a very relaxed state. Combined with the Patatas Bravas, which has a sour taste but very delicately made and the potatoes crispy, it's a good light bite to get you through the day! Other recommendations also include the smoked salmon and the seared tuna (only available after 6pm at the Harbourfront Location, aren't you lucky?!) The staff are friendly, nice and not to mention, extremely accommodating and incredibly patient (a virtue I highly admire in any restaurant staff!) I love this place too much (not to mention come here to work and chill) to give it anything less than a 5 Star Review PS Great date spot!"}
{"text":"This café is so Toronto. I was there on Monday and they close at 5:00. I don't know what to say about Toronto. Unless one wants to go through a  McDonalds drive through (yuck) everything in this town is closed at night. There is a grill restaurant near my house that starts putting up its chairs at 8:00 PM! No wonder the riff raff and their polluting cars get together in the parking lot of the doughnut shop every night (car fascination is so 1999).  With that said, why the four stars?  The beverages are quite good and rich. They use real and authentic ingredients. The view is fabulous looking onto Lake Ontario and the islands. The waiter and the person behind the counter/cash were quite polite and friendly. They have wifi and the premises are clean. Yes, the beverages are $1 more expensive than elsewhere, but given what I just wrote it is worth it. With that said, five o'clock??"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Friday afternoon since we were looking for a casual hangout spot close to work just to socialize and catch up and coming here was a perfect way to conclude our busy working week. This intimate little coffee house that is hidden between bigger stores truly lives up to its name as a social house. Although it looks small on the outside, when you enter, the amount of seating space available was very impressive. They have two levels to choose from and the furniture and decor has a very vintage/urban theme and the whole coffee house seems to be constructed with 90% wood. My friend and I sat on the upper level, which was surrounded by industrial looking pictures and being up here felt like visiting an art gallery except this time we could sit down and satisfy our sweet cravings. Spacing between tables is enough where you and your friends can talk freely without worrying about other customers overhearing your conversations. Also, the washrooms on the second floor have newspaper articles as their wallpaper, which I found unique.  However, if you are looking for full meals, I wouldn't recommend this place since their selection is limited only to their basic pastries like croissants and pop tarts, which taste really good though. Boxcar is more known for their wide selection of specialty coffee, tea, and other hot beverages. I ordered their hot chocolate and one of their pop tarts and it satisfied my afternoon snack craving. The sweetness level in their hot chocolate was balanced for my personal tastes (I don't like my drinks overly sweet but I like a small level of sweetness) and the mug was huge. I would actually rank this as 2nd place on my personal top ten list of drinks (hot chocolate from Aroma Espresso would be my number one).   Total price I paid for that big portion hot chocolate and pop tart was around $6 before taxes, which seems typical for a specialty coffee house. Staff also seemed friendly when we ordered at the counter and one of the ladies came to our table to collect our plates and cups once we finished, but I also liked how they gave us our space and didn't keep dropping in every couple of minutes to ask how things were going.   Overall, I'll definitely come back here whenever I need a quiet escape within the city to read a book or do some novel writing without any interruptions."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times - maybe too much (check my Yelp check-in LOL), but I can't help it, this Boxcar location probably have the best view of the lake for me! It's difficult for me to write this review as I truly enjoy enjoy this place, however the service & quality are going down ...   I honestly don't know if the barista even care anymore. On multiple occasions, I noticed they only fill up half of the glass with my iced latte. Seriously? If you are charging $5 for a latte, I do expect to get 3/4 or full glass of the latte.   One time I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich, that took 30 mins to arrive and I had to remind them twice. Mind you, there were only 4 customers in the cafe and all of them received their respective orders. I even noticed customers who arrived after me received their smoked salmon sandwich first... When I reminded the server/staff on the second time, she even said \"Oh we probably couldn't find you.\" UH excuse me, you didn't even walk around to ask each customer if he/she ordered the sandwich. Also, even if you couldn't find me, what did you do with that sandwich then? Did you throw it away? Or serve it to another customer??? They used to have a number system - meaning if you ordered food, you would be given a number so the staff can find you - I haven't seen that system being used for a long time so I assume they removed it.   Would I come back? Maybe, maybe not. I might go to their other locations instead, and you guys should be aware of the terrible services here. Also, I noticed Zeel's review below regarding her experience, I was there and can vouch for her story of the customer service here."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's very friendly and cozy. It's a bit small but I personally feel when places get too big they lose some of their charm. I could spend hours here, studying or catching up with friends.   The coffee is great much more consistent than other places in the city. I also wish other coffee places would take a hint and maybe be a bit less snobby."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee experiences of my life. Toronto has really become a paradise for the coffee geek and this place should be emulated in cities all over the world."}
{"text":"They know their coffee and it's a really great place to either work or just hang out. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went on the patio and there was a group of 10 of us that increased to 13-14. In brief, don't come here for a meal as options are very limited and all include gluten. Not good for vegans.   Good: - allow you to make a reservation on patio for a large group  - beautiful and shaded patio with trees (at night they have cute lights) & minimal street noise  - clean washroom  - can do separate tabs/ bills (watch out for gratuity for large groups)  - no pressure to leave or order more drinks as the staff don't come around that often - clearer the empty bottles every hour or so  - variety of beer  Bad: - they were not ready for our 5 pm reservation on patio (had to arrange tables) and move people around which took ~10 minutes  - no beer menus (only for wine) - had to ask the waiter  - no draft beer (only cans or bottles)  - were out of certain beer  - limited food menu and kitchen does not open until 6 pm  - poor service (2nd round of drinks took more than 30 mins to arrive or waiter needed to be reminded) / staff were not attentive  - * did not tell us about the large group gratuity (& the % gratuity is not apparent on the receipt thus some people paid gratuity twice unknowingly)  - some bench seating which is hard on people's back if sitting for a long time   Would I recommend to a friend? No, because the bad outweigh the good other than patio"}
{"text":"Very hipster place that somehow doesn't offend me. I've only been here for alcohol so cant comment on the coffee but I'm going to assume its good. Decent wine selection. Note this place has several tripping hazards; an oddly placed step inside near the bar and on the way out to the back patio. I witnessed several close calls during my short time there. Good place for a casual drink with friends or a date."}
{"text":"The coffee was okay.  Great patio.  Is it licensed? I didn't notice, but that would warrant the addition of a half star."}
{"text":"I'm so sad I don't work in this area any more because it is definitely one of the best tasting coffees in the city. I wish they opened earlier on weekdays, but it's worth cutting it close to get an americano or drip coffee from here. The staff is surprisingly nice and not pretentious at all. I've only had the coffee but the treats look great. Nice decor and good looking drinks in the evening. Great atmosphere and perfect for a take away or weekend coffee!"}
{"text":"i've been twice.  pretty location.  decent coffees and sweets.    the décor is a bit dark, but that's a subjective call.    so much better than what was there before."}
{"text":"Comfortable, friendly spot for a delicious coffee or a drink near Summerhill Station. Peaceful patio in the back. This has become a regular place for me at any time of day."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a better review for this cozy spot that harbourfont has been missing, but I must say that service is terrible. The first time we came we waited for nearly 20 minutes for someone to take our order and left. The second time we came we waited to be seated but we're consistently ignored, so left again. If you have time to spare, try and visit."}
{"text":"Really nice place, nice people. Good selection of beer (though a bit pricey), and decent bar and area to hang out in. I'd definitely come back here to hang out."}
{"text":"Lovely spot by the waterfront with fairly priced and comfy eats. This cafe/wine bar is especially nice on a good summer's day now that they've built their patio. It's a pretty industrial looking space but the wooden finishes make it quite cozy. Walk-ins are generally ok and they can accommodate large groups as well.   I've come a few times for lunch and the food is good quality and decently portioned - my fav is the Avo Toast ($10), which comes with salad. Given their unobstructed view of the lake (and proximity to the skating rink), I'm surprised and happy they're not charging more. Service was a bit slow when they first opened but I'm glad they've since ironed out the issues.   They used to have soup and sandwich combos so I hope they bring it back!!"}
{"text":"Can tell they are passionate about what they do and its refreshing. Very patient and love to talk to you about their various offerings(so expect to wait a couple extra minutes vs a souless Starbucks).  Seating isn't very comfortable."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place is incredible in daylight, let alone by night when they turn on lights, making the place magical. The cafe is not only fascinating by design, but coffee...I'm in paradise with each sip. BoxCar has the best coffee that I tried in Toronto. I highly recommend the place for studying, socializing with friends, or just simply enjoying the cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Great coffee,  friendly staff,  great cookies too,   coffee is on the pricier side but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Went to Boxcar Social for their soft opening today. A gorgeous new specialty cafe in Summer Hill, they plan to offer wine, beer and other spirits later on -- but for today at least, just coffee. The space is a bit sparse but still lovely, evoking a rustic, cabin-in-the-woods type of atmosphere, with both a ground floor and upstairs seating area.   They had two different beans on the menu -- one from Calgary-based Phil & Sebastian, and another from Nova Scotia-based Anchored Coffee. It's evident that the staff are truly passionate about coffee and well-versed in what they have to offer. I tried the tasting flight of the featured Anchored roast, which comes with a shot of espresso, a macchiato and a pourover rendition of the bean, offering the opportunity to sample all the nuances of the coffee in three different forms. I thought that it tasted best with milk, and happily ordered a cortado to go (which was served in a fully compostable take-out cup). In addition to the range of coffee beverages on the menu, they also serve a handful of pastries and snacks, and prices seem to be generally on par with similar cafes.   Given the fact that its still in its soft opening stage, there are definitely some kinks to iron out and a few areas for improvement in terms of service and presentation. However, definitely a promising spot for good drinks (caffeinated and otherwise) and good atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The inside of Boxcar Social looks more like a bar than a coffee shop.  Along the wall, behind their bar is a huge display of liquor.  I think they do have a liquor license.   I ordered my usual flat white, and the hubby got a cappuccino.  We headed upstairs to grab a seat.  For a Saturday morning it was quite busy, all the tables were filled except for one.  Coffee was very good smooth, felt a bit on the weaker side at first, but left your mouth with a great coffee aftertaste."}
{"text":"Wine, Cocktails or Coffee?!  I love the choice and selection that Boxcar Social offers. I can see myself as the \"designated\" driver enjoying a well crafted coffee along with my friends that are downing/sipping some crafted beers or cocktails!  The seating options here are quite interesting. You can watch the barista/bartender in action if you stay in the front of the cafe. At the back, you will find tables and patio seating. On the 2nd floor, they have a room with some cozy armchairs.  Coffee was good. And love how it opens late."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see such a low rating for this boxcar location. They have a fantastic beer and whisk(e)y selection, and a solid food menu with pretty much everything, from the jams to the mustard, made in house. The fries are delicious! Besides, you can't beat that view over the lake. When it's a normal day, service is friendly and on point. Ive had fantastic recommendations and samples of beers I'm not sure about. However during festivals I bet they get slammed, which might impact service."}
{"text":"Super warm, friendly service. I visited there for an impromptu coffee with a friend since it's her favourite place and is in her neighbourhood. I ordered a chai latté and a \"cinnamon thing\" (a croissant with cinnamon sugar on it); she ordered a tea. Both were tasty; my friend warned me in advance that the chai used for the latté is unsweetened (unlike the syrupy-sweet mixtures used elsewhere) so I wasn't surprised when I tasted it. It was great!   Loved the simple, neutral, rough-hewn decor. I'm definitely planning to check it out one evening for a drink."}
{"text":"This spot caught my eye when I was out exploring and I ended up coming here with a friend shortly after. I love any place with coffee, beer, and wine -- and a backyard.  Service was friendly, if laughably slow. They were so nice it was impossible to be annoyed. The space is cute, they did their best with a weird layout. The backyard might not be the most charming space in TO, but there wasn't any competition for tables and it was a nice quiet spot for catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Boxcar Social is a great place to sit down and work when you need a change of scenery. I come here on occasion when I want to avoid being interrupted and need to get things done. I enjoy the natural light shining through the large windows and the view of the inner harbor. Even with music playing in the background and the idle chatter, the only thing that distracts me from my work is watching people ice skating outside.  The coffee is great. The wifi is fast. Come here for the coffee, come here for the view. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"They serve coffee and drinks so it's good for every crowd. Very friendly staff and nice interior decoration"}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends to relax unwind or get up & go. The coffee here will definitely win you over. The staff is very knowledgeable in all of the coffee they make. From the selection of coffee to the beautiful outcome of their cappuccino, you come back for more."}
{"text":"When stated half price bottles of wine on Tuesday...be careful. That is not applicable to all bottles. Was only told after the wine was poured that it was full price. No efforts were made to rectify the situation. Very disappointing. Will likely not return."}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere with good view of the waterfront but I will not return to a place that has such lousy service.  We sat at the bar for over 10 minutes during a very quiet weekday afternoon and none of the 3 staff we saw served us, nor even said hello.  They seemed focused on doing some other work or serving the odd person that came to the cash.  Perhaps they are inexperienced being opened so recently but still, no excuse.  There are too many other good, friendly nearby places to get a drink!"}
{"text":"Coffee is good! Lunch menu is reall nice Patio is awesome!!  You can all of thing in here Study, takling with friends, everything! Also there is free wifi.  There is good coffee, wine.  You can use a card."}
