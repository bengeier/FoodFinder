{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Absolutely horrendous. None of their food is good and it's like they're not even trying. For crying out loud, their general Tso chicken is a sweet-and-sour chicken with a crappy sauce on it. What a joke. I will never eat here again and I suggest you never eat here as well."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Staff is ok. The buffet serves it's purpose. Kids are more interested in jello and the ice cream bar, which typically is out of order 50% of the time. It is a quick place to stop on grocery shopping night or a busy day."}
{"text":"They have a really good selection of food for lunchtime and it's only $6.49. They also have a salad bar and I love their crab rangoons even though I hate sea food. Another good food item they have is the vegetable egg foo young. They also have an ice cream machine which has really good ice cream. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is very clean inside."}
{"text":"This place is a dump.
New owners & horrible food.

The is a fishtank in the front full of poop with barely any water and big fish trying to survive.

I used to go here but it's really the pits now"}
{"text":"One of the worst Chinese food places I have ever had the displeasure to eat at. Most of the food was lukewarm, and it was all very bland. The shrimp chips were flaccid, and the won ton soup was horrible. I actually spit some of my food into my napkin,just couldn't even swallow it! Nothing had much flavor at all.Chicken teriyaki was so tough I couldn't eat it at all. Save your money and go farther up the street to Tai Pan and get a really great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over four years now , it has not so recently change ownership which lead to the one star rate old management was kind and very warm, new management is all the opposite I always think they are watching how many times you go for a plate and they speak to each other in Chinese and laugh service is lousy and non friendly at all I think I keep going due to the fact that is the only buffet nearby but honestly I have taste and seen better I rather drive to Mayfield Heights to a better buffet try it you'll see the difference, all in all the service and sour faces killed this place."}
{"text":"Good food, good value, friendly staff, and good selection - if you get there early!

In Middlefield you have two distinctly different choices for Chinese food. The more formal (and more expensive) choice is Tai-Pan. Here you order a dish off of the menu and maybe share it if you are with a group. The other choice (and better value) is the buffet offered at the China Dragon. The quality of food is about the same at both restaurants, so it really comes down to if you are an \"order off the menu\" or \"buffet\" type of Chinese food person.  It has been mentioned by others here that there is better Chinese food in Cleveland. I totally agree.  However, when I am in Middlefield and don't feel like driving into Cleveland, the China Dragon works just fine.  

The restaurant itself is typical of any other Chinese buffet, with all of the choices that you would expect to find.  There is a salad bar with peel-n-eat shrimp, a limited, but tasty, sushi bar, and about 20 different appetizers and entrées.  So far, my favorite entrée is the coconut shrimp, but the pepper steak, the broccoli chicken, and the honey chicken are great too.

The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Just keep in mind that about half of them speak no English, so be prepared for a blank stare or a misinterpretation if you ask one of them a question.

On the negative side, I totally agree with previous people that have mentioned that the fish tank is disgusting and needs to go. I realize that it is traditional for Chinese restaurants to have one or more fish tanks, but that traditionally is so that customers can pick out their dinner -- fresh \"from the tank\".  Here there is a small fish tank with three large fish.  Too many fish for too small a tank.  It is a needless distraction and should go.  Of course, the same can be said about the fish tank at Tai-Pan. Yuck!

My other negative comment is that once they fill the sushi bar, they don't seem to refill it.  This means that you get a full selection at 11:00 or 11:30, but if you get there after 12:30 don't expect to eat sushi.  Since they don't drop the price after 12:30 to make up for the lack of selection, it is very much a buyer beware situation.

Overall I give it four stars.  If it were in Cleveland, it would be three stars.  But given the scarcity of Chinese restaurants in the Middlefield/Burton/Parkman area and in comparison to Tai-Pan, four stars seems about right."}
{"text":"I also noticed a downward spiral when the management changed, the fish tank was grody, the people weren't very nice and the food was mediocre at best. I got food poisoning. It was bad. But once we realized that if we just order like 40 pieces of sushi to go they are much nicer to us and the food is much better then too. It was awesome before the owner switch though."}
{"text":"I love this place! I can't wait to come back to Ohio just to go to the buffet! Amazing food, great service! their meals off the menu are huge and can last two meals!!!"}
{"text":"Cold food, no refills, dirty dining room. yuk.... never again"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a 2pm lunch the lady was on the phone almost the whole time I was eating yelling loud in Chinese to someone in the phone. The food wasn't great the coconut shrimp resembles something other than shrimp when you bite it in half and look at it. The sauces sucked teriaki was a water sauce as well as the spare rib sauce the chicken was soggy probably from soaking in it so long. Food was warm at best I didn't dare try any of the seafood who knows how long that shits been sitting out for. I hate to write a bad review but 6 dollar lunch you literly get less than you pay for id rather spend more and go to a better place."}
