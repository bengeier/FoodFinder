{"text":"Stopped by there on the way home this afternoon...  Ordered a Chicago style Black Angus Sirloin dawg.  IT WAS GREAT.  Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Terrific!  I've run by here a few times and have tried many of the items on the menu including many of the \"chef's special\" suggestions.  They've never steered me wrong.  Cooks are experienced and know how to barbeque just about anything that tastes delicious.  This is a smaller, family-run business and conversation there is entertaining.  I couldn't be happier with my visits.  Thanks Hawg 'N Dawg!"}
{"text":"If you are hungry for chili dogs this is the place to go! I just recently had the best chili dog of my life and do not forget about the three foot long chili dog challange, its got size and flavor! The prices are great and the atmosphere is even better, this is a great resteraunt for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try to this place for awhile now and today I finally did as I was driving on my way home and was craving a hot dog.  It's a quaint little place and I presume that most of thier business is done from take out.  I ordered the chicago style hot dog with an angus sirloin dog..it was fantastic...one of the best hot dogs that I have had in a really long time...actually it was the ONLY hot dog that I have had in the last year..Further, the people who run the place(i think they were the owners) were really nice and helpful and acted as if I have been a regular.  I am going to be a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Hawg-N-Dawg a few times now, and it's definitely a welcome addition to the neighbourhood  Check out the menu, it's worth a perusal.  The dogs come in an unusually large number of dog choices and in a wide variety of topping combos.  And they're actually one of the few places in AZ that build a proper gardened-up Chicago dog, poppy seed bun and all  Their BBQ is excellent.  Beef brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken . . . all are fantastic and practically gristle free.  Only downside is their BBQ sauce.  Way too sweet for my blood and no kick.  But hey, they sell the Q by the pound.  I bring it home and use my own sauce  The real surprise winner?  Their chili.  They call it Competition Chili, and I don't doubt it's won awards.  It's a unique thick blend that I've only tasted the like of at Jackie's Hot Dogs in south Chicago.  Mixture of beans, ground beef, and I'm going to assume pulled brisket.  I ordered two bowls to go today, one for dinner and one for breakfast in the morning  I'm not really a \"sides\" person, but I've tried their hush puppies.  Watch out.  Interesting and cool that they added green chilies to the mix, but man were they salty as hell.  I avoid salt, so maybe I'm just over sensitive to it  Overall, a nice quick little locally owned place on the butt end of the Warner/Elliot loop to grab some damn good grub"}
{"text":"I like the food from Hawg and Dawg.  I usually get a 1/4 lb dog with the green hornet toppings.  The chicago style is decent too.    As far as their barbecue goes, it's good enough for a quick fix but isn't really anything special.  The sides aren't really all that great.  They are mostly bland and boring.  I suppose some people like that but I want a little spice or flavor.  One thing that really bothers me is that they close at 7pm on weeknights and have even been closed at times when they should be open based on the hours on the window.  That being said, if you can make it over there while they're open, the hot dogs are worth the trip.  *UPDATING MY ORIGINAL REVIEW*  Apparently the owners here don't understand that if you have posted hours that you'll be open, it's probably a good idea to respect your customers and actually be open at that time. I can understand if you have an emergency and just can't open up one night, but now it has been 5 times that I've made the drive over there and they were closed during hours they should have been open. Yesterday, we went by and there was a sign saying they are at some vendor event and they are closed for a couple days. That's unacceptable if they think they're going to survive as a business. It already takes a special trip to go there since there isn't anything else around that most people would go to in that area. At this point, my recommendation is to just save the gas and make your own hot dogs. They're not worth repeated trips over just to find out you're not going to get one anyway."}
{"text":"Great hot wings!!  Big, meaty with smoky bbq flavor.   My husband said they were the best he's ever had. They have one of those smokers out front that does REAL BBQ!  Brisket was good, so were potato salad & beans. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This place located in an Ahwatukee strip mall is small and neat, also VERY busy; i saw a sign that awarded them best Mom and Pop shop 2010 in Ahwatukee by some organization, it definitely has that feel of a local independent shop.  My pulled pork sandwich was fantastic;  However;  the bread was very soggy and my sweet potato fries tasted re-heated.  I have only been once but would go back when i get a craving for barbeque..."}
{"text":"The place is very small just 6 chairs.  Stopped by for an early lunch - 11:30, was the only person there.  I could tell that they weren't ready for business.  After waiting 15 minutes for the fryer to warm up I told them to cancel the fries and settled for just the green hornet topped beef dog which was VERY salty, nothing special.   I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Closed.  According to the other shops in the strip center, they had a hard time remembering that in order to stay in business you have to be open when you say you're going to be open."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Great Hot Dogs and the menu is set up perfectly to make your Dawg your own. Lots of great ideas from previous customers. We had Chicago style hot dogs and also were able to sample their ribs which are cooked on a great offset smoker. They use pecan and apple wood, the best for Bbq IMHO. Try the Blue Cheese coleslaw. Great side  dishes we can't  wait to go back. The owners are friendly as can be."}
