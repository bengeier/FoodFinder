{"text":"This was just o.k. no French fries? It's a bar!!! Seems like they are going for a organic food bar?"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure to meet Jason and we new his Chef Rico and Bobbi one of his Day bartenders from before. Awesome place with great ambiance and a super daily happy hour.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Came in for a casual Friday night dinner. Very attentive waitress. EXPENSIVE wine by the glass. House $7, others listed at $9 and $14 a glass. Extremely average or below average French dip and an Italian sandwich both served with broken tiny potato chips. Loud. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"This was truly a surprise. It's a fun place, not fancy, but comfortable.  The food and service were supurb!  The steak special was cooked to perfection and the potato pancakes had a nice crisp texture.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian Sub I've had! Gotta try the meatballs and spaghetti squash too.. absolutely phenomenal! The owner Jason is always there and always stops by to check and make sure everything is good. Great neiborhood bar!"}
{"text":"We knew this place opened recently and decided to walk there this afternoon for a snack.  We had a couple of beers and ate some hummus and wings. The wings were baked and grilled. The food was tasty and a bit healthier than a typical tavern/pub.  I'm a porter/stout fan and the lack of those on tap was a bit of a miss for me but otherwise we like the place and will definitely be back.    The owner and bartender both introduced themselves to us.  They were very friendly which I appreciate and the bartender mentioned they would be adding more beers and rotating them as well so hopefully that will include a porter or stout."}
{"text":"Not good. Really horrible service. You can sit at a table three feet from the bar and nobody will approach your table for twenty minutes.  Bar tenders slow to acknowledge customers when they walk up. Bar tenders more interested in talking to each other than servicing customers. Also, I've been in this industry for 18 years, so I feel like I'm a good judge of bar service."}
{"text":"Here are just the facts: As we entered the place [early evening] it did not smell good. Strange smell. Rot smell. We ordered an appetizer, beer and wine. The waitress came back and said that my selection of wine was not available. I ordered another wine. She came back and said that that one was not available either. I ordered the third choice. I asked if it was dry she assured me it was. It was not. The appetizer was ok, but nothing to write home about. My guess: when a bar does not keep the wines on the [short] list in stock - they are probably about to close down the place. I will not be back there.

{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich today. Phenomenal!  Service here is always great, owner is always out, friendly, and adds to the experience.    Love this place. Not sure I have ever had even a 4 star experience here... Always 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great atmosphere, delicious food, generous drink pours. The staff is awesome! 5+ stars!"}
{"text":"This place has abnormally delicious food- we got the sliders and the kale caesar salad with chicken and a couple beers, and there was plenty to look at. The decor is a hybrid that we decided was \"Medieval Cowboy Rock\" and has a lounge area with unique arcade games with cool red and black decor. If you can make a weekday lunch you will get quick attention and friendly service. Love it, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first experience at the Rooster was awesome. They have a great HH and awesome sliders. My fave was the meatball sliders!!!! The bartender Bobbi was friendly and personable. The owner has pulled out all the stops when putting his personality in this place. Jason the owner has great energy and enthusiasm that makes you feel right at home.  A cut above bar food and not what you would expect. Looking Forward to trying more goodies on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar!  Staff is friendly and good service. We had the sliders and they were fab. Prices are reasonable and they pour a good drink.  They are new and here to stay!!"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across The Rooster Tavern! We walked in during happy hour and were greeted immediately with a friendly face.   We sat inside and loved the cool styled table at our booth. I was only stopping in for a quick appetizer but I asked for some recommendations. I was going to get wings but the server also suggested meatballs were very popular.  So I ordered both. They were both very good. Now I'm Italian and have been eating homemade meatballs for 40+ years. The sauce n meatballs were really good.   A cool guy Jason swung by the table to check on us and was super friendly. They have a solid menu, good location, great service and We can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"A night on the town or a nice evening alone The Rooster Tavern meets all of our needs.  To start the Shrimp Tacos and Meatball Sliders melt in your mouth.  The pretzel bread on the sliders creates a delectable taste for any partygoer.  The service is 5 STAR and Jason the owner makes sure everyone is having a great time.  It's on the top of our list everyday of the week!"}
{"text":"Random selection of neighborhood bars that we haven't been to today. This was the right choice! We love the atmosphere and the people. Food was excellent and the drinks were spot on. We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Live band so if you want a quite conversation this is not the place.  Food was good and the service was good too.  Had the Italian grinder and my wife had a chicken caesar both were good. Fun place to hang."}
{"text":"Just went to the Rooster Tavern for the first time and it will not be our last!  The owner Jason was very friendly and spent a lot of time visiting with us and the service from Katie and Lisa was amazing. Everyone there takes great pride in the Rooster and it shows. Great food, I suggest trying the meatball sliders and the bruschetta. It's a great neighborhood place and you feel like \"Norm\" when you walk in.  Strongly urge you to go there!"}
{"text":"We went here last night... good service...fun theme...I got the street tacos and everything about was outstanding.  the salsa was incredible."}
{"text":"Travelled from Chicago  and stopped in for a drink.  Ended up eating dinner there that night and stopped back in before we left town because the food was excellent !   Place has a back home feel about it with Great food - what was not to like  - If you are visiting AZ and looking for a bar or restaurant I highly recommend stopping by the Rooster                          A. Capone   - Chicago"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and drinks, atmosphere, vibe, ambiance, friendly good service. Love the Awesome chandeliers and woman friendly restroom. Whether you're a local or from out of town, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Immediately, the place took me to some of my favorite places in old town Vegas.  Dark, cool and friendly.  Great drink specials.  Great food specials.    I like to read a places lowest yelp reviews first to get a feel for what people whine about.   After seeing the \"books\" a few people left on yelp about this place, I assessed this has to be the place for me.   I was spot on.  My first bite into the meatball slider we ordered took me straight to \"Pizza Rock\" in downtown Vegas (favorite place there to late eat and get a great beer).  So tasty and tender!!!  The wings are baked and char finished on the grill, just like I do them at home!  Buffalo sauce was popping with flavor.    We split the French dip and fries for the entree.  Fries were so crisp on the outside and mashed potato-like on the inside like fries should always be done!  The horse radish sauce and the au jus are a perfect accessory to this sandwich and did not disappoint.  I know it was a fluke, but we got a large tough piece of meat in the sandwich.  Thinner slices would easily remedy that from happening.    Over all I am extremely happy to have a great hangout for football season so close to my house!  Great work on this gem of a tavern!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is incredible! Amazing food! Amazing service! Such a great little Gem for Scottsdale! If you have not been you need to go!"}
{"text":"Great service whenever I'm here. Get their meatball sliders - unreal. Jason, Rico and the whole gang are awesome to chat with. They catered my holiday party too. The bar itself is eclectically decorated and really has that \"home town bar\" feel to it. Everyone is friendly, nothing pretentious, they got darts and stuff too. Only downside? No Schlitz."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we had high expectations because of the great reviews. Unfortunately this was not our experience. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich and salad. She is allergic to tomatoes and asked for no tomatoes. The salad ended up with tomatoes and the chicken sandwich was so dry that she couldn't eat it.   I had the meatball sliders which were pretty good but they were really soggy.   Our waitress only came by once after we were served our food which by then the chicken sandwich was cold.  I think this place has a lot of potential. It's super cute and decorated really cool. Because they recently opened maybe there are some kinks to work out.   I was really surprised that we were not offered to have our check adjusted since my wife could not eat the chicken sandwich.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent staff! Excellent service! By far a top notch bar with amazing decor! Perfect place to grab a drink!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Wednesday, October 25 to try a new restaurant.  There was live music a singer guitar player who was wonderful.  The Decor is really cute and great artwork.    I had asked for happy hour and proceeded to order a beer for my husband I didn't want beer so I asked for a specialty drink suggestion.  The waitress was very friendly and suggested an elephant margarita, I agreed and she brought it out.    We ended up having the lavash pizza--they were out of mushrooms apparently, then I ordered of the spaghetti squash--they were out of the spaghetti squash too apparently, so we ordered a very boring kale Caesar salad.  The pizza was pretty good though the crust was nice and crunchy.  Then the bill came.  I could not understand why our tiny order was $50.  As it turns out my margarita was 20 bucks!!!  I never would've ordered it had I known the price.  The waitress was very friendly but I think she should have at least let me know the price before I placed the order.  It's a very cool looking dive bar, but I didn't expect any sort of exorbitant prices.  I would've had a great time and overall experience if it weren't for this drink price issue.  I just wanted a decent drink to unwind after a very long stressful day :("}
{"text":"Great local bar and love the atmosphere!  Wings and apps are great!  Bartenders and the owner are friendly. Great Bloody Mary bar during football season. Tasty drinks and wine. We always stop here while we're in town.   One of our faves!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great vibe and super friendly people. Casual eclectic decor, skeeball and darts! I highly recommend and I haven't yet mentioned the food!? Something on the menu for everyone, fabulous presentation and DELICIOUS! Beats those big chains hands down. Go go go!!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for an afternoon bite to eat! Very cool ambiance. Somewhere I could hang out at during the day for lunch and come back for the weekend!"}
{"text":"Bartender was super nice. Owner was cool. Loved the skeeball and other games. I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Arizona so I checked a place to get a burger and The Rooster had high marks on Yelp so we went there.  Had a great burger and fries!  Not disappointed at all! Also our server, Rachel, was terrific, gave us some great info about the area which was much appreciated.  Most definitely will go back when visiting again."}
{"text":"Have been there twice, the first time the owner was present and service was exceptional. Today, he wasn't present and service was non existent, with the exception of the Busboy whom we had to utilize to gain the attention of the servers and to even get salt and pepper. The bartenders were either talking to each other or on their phones. The Busboy was the Hardest working employee there today. For the food, did not care for the breaded shishito peppers, no flavor, dipping sauce either. Ceviche was average but small. Meatballs and spaghetti squash were excellent however. Definitely need more craft beers on tap as well. Very disappointing as the hubby and I really liked it on the first visit. Do like the decor however."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood!!!! Very friendly atmosphere!  Owner Jason in, even on  a Sunday! Superb customer service! Chef Rico knocks it out of the park!!!! Best wings in town! Spaghetti squash and zucchini spirals...... we will see you soon! Diane and John Your Scottsdale Neighbors"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try out The Rooster Tavern last night for dinner. I saw they had a French Dip sandwich on the menu. I always love a good French Dip sandwich so I ordered it. I was blown away by how fresh the bread was and the prime rib in it with the melted cheese was perfect! It was the best French Dip sandwich I have ever had and will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar. You have to try the wings, they are grilled and fantastic. Staff is friendly and polite. Quick service and good prices.  2 IPA's on draft which is ok but I could always like to see more. :) we will definitely be back. It's a great looking place that I could just ride the bike down to and hang out for a while also. I am glad that we finally came down the street to try it out."}
{"text":"Visited Roosters while on vacation. This is a great place!!!!! The sliders are awesome, highly recommend those, along with the fries. Cody, the bartender, is great......your glass is always full!!!!!! Great place to hang out and have a good time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a low key place to enjoy good apps and a cold drink on a Sunday afternoon.  FOUND IT. Great atmosphere.  Really good food, (try the chicken wings and meatball sliders). Great service,  good music, and good vibes.  We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ahmazing!!!!! The sliders were awesome and we got prime rib & Boison burger. All the food is really good. The service is great; super friendly staff and the owner stopped to introduce himself. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fabulous bar great food spectacular service with a very clean dive bar feel bye great music"}
{"text":"I love this Tavern!! The food is unbelievable, the owners are amazing and the ambience is the best!!! Thanks for opening the coolest neighborhood bar!! You have quickly become our favorite hangout!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some wings with the kids. Sat in a booth.Staff was friendly, service was quick. Great buffalo wings, and my family enjoyed the pretzel bites!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with great staff, good beer selection, and fantastic food. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The Rooster is awesome. Great atmosphere,  great staff, great food and drink. Exactly what the area needed. Cool relaxed bar when your sick of the sports bar. Go, and have fun."}
{"text":"I came here just on a whim .... driving by I saw a sign for 3 dollar sliders. Service was a bit slow but hey ... it's Saturday afternoon .... what the heck do I care ?   The owner ... which I forget his name now was actually who served us . I asked for a recommendation and he suggested the sliders. I got two meatball sliders, one burger slider, and my fiancé got the tacos.   Meatball sliders are what puts this place at 5 stars . I make a damn good meatball myself .... and these were on point if not better than my own .   Tacos were solid too and the atmosphere of the place is just wacky and fun .   I'd suggest coming here if you get the chance .... it's affordable and good"}
{"text":"Super fun Sunday football watching place.  Delicious fries and tuna melt.  The people there - owner, wait staff, customers, were all amazingly nice.  Highly recommend and wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous the atmosphere is great. This is no local dive bar it's an upscale dive bar."}
{"text":"First trip there we met the owner Jason, really nice guy.  This is a great neighborhood bar, much needed in this area and it has different and better food then your usual bar menu.  I highly recommend the pretzel bun sliders!!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken wings in the city!   Jason and his team  went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. This place is a 10+.    Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  I was in Scottsdale on business. It was my last night in town and I wanted something good. I found this place on yelp and it was only .5 miles from my hotel so I walked over. I was immediately greeted by the owner and some of the staff. Took a seat at the bar and that's when the adventure began. The bartender presented me with a great menu and took my drink order. I had a cold beer before I knew it. So let me say this. If you are looking for fine cuisine this is not the place. If you want hearty and delicious pub style food cook to perfection, you found it. I mentioned deviled eggs (not on the menu). The bartender mentioned it to the cook and next thing you know I have 3 kinds sitting in front of me. I also ordered the spicy shrimp with mushrooms. It was a huge plate and also cooked perfectly.  So I'm having a great conversation with a couple guys that were sitting next to me at the bar. Come to find out one of them is Jason the owner of the place. He made me feel as if I was a long time patron and I belonged there just a much as the fixtures. We had a great conversation about bars, rock and roll and the Scottsdale area. Jason had to go, but I continued my evening with a couple more cocktails before my journey back to my room.  Long story short... Great food and drink, great staff, good music and no riff riff in this place. I can't wait to return to Scottsdale just to visit the Rooster!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Thought we'd check this place out based on menu/reviews. It's described as a \"dive bar,\" but I don't agree. It's got a lot of character, not at all \"divey\" (whatever that means...to me, dirty, greasy, questionable). Husband had the chicken wings, I had the au jus sandwich. We should have switched, as I preferred his wings, and he loved my sandwich! Well, to each their own. I ordered a glass of red wine, which was served ice cold. I just asked that it be given a twenty second nuke, and it was much better! All in all, if we found ourselves in Scottsdale again, we'd have no compunction about visiting the Rooster again."}
{"text":"Great new find!  Ceviche is delish.  Nice neighborhood place.  Staff is attentive and cool decor. A must see!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a bar like this in the area for a while. I will for sure be a repeat customer. Super excited to have a bar like this in the area."}
{"text":"Just added cubano sandwhich, best lunch & drinks in north scottsdale.  Don't forget the meatball sliders. Bam!   DDD should make an appearance.."}
{"text":"Ok seriously!!!!!!!!! Best new place in Scottsdale!!! Staff, decor, f'n music all 10's!!! We have been begging for a place like this for years!! Well it's here! If your looking for a place that covers all the bases, The Rooster Tavern is the place! Owner of the place greeted us, sat us and made us feel like family!!! This is a go to for neighborhood people and for anybody looking for what I call a modern dive bar!!! I'm sold!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding new spot excellent vibe great service I can't say enough good things. One of the coolest bars I been to in years and the food was great as well!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! I love this local corner bar. Live music on the weekends, great drinks and friendly service. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"We came after golf on a Friday and were a little surprised that they did not offer a happy hour. Then again this place is pretty much a bar that has really good food so we kind of understood that would not make sense for them.  The staff was all super nice, attentive and knowledgeable about the food options.  We ordered the meatball platter and for $9.50 it was a pretty good value with three large meatballs, lots of tasty and chunky marinara and melted cheese. Instead of automatically serving you bread or pasta with it they offered a two dollar up charge to add a side dish or bread. We got nothing and were happy as we were saving ourselves for other items on the menu.  Next we ordered the Boursin burger (with caramelized onions and lots of bacon) medium. It came out nearly well done and we did not return it but it had good flavor and the french fries were amazing as others have mentioned.  Our third order was the hot and sweet wings as recommended by Joe our server at the bar. He was right, they took the base buffalo wing to a new level with the hint of honey. They are baked and then grilled so they are not greasy but yet moist. It would be nice if they were a little bit crispier but they did taste very good.  While we were enjoying our wings we saw a staff member sit at the bar with a couple of other patrons. We then noticed a pizza stand and then a medium size what looked like an extremely thin crust pizza come out to them. We asked our server Joe about it and he said that it was actually a large lavash cracker with melted white cheese and pieces of meatballs on it. It had no tomato sauce. Well the staffer sitting with the patrons turned out to be the chef and lo and behold about 10 minutes later they brought us a small version of the same pizza on the house. It was delicious! Being from Chicago we are used to extremely cracker like, thin crust pizza. This totally filled the bill! Joe said you can order it with any toppings. They must not want to sell a lot of these because they call it lavash and don't even mention the word pizza in the menu description. Maybe there are too many people that don't know thin crust pizza out here and would be surprised and disappointed if they called it pizza. We can guarantee you that if they're from Chicago they would know exactly what it is if it was listed as cracker thin crust pizza.  There are plenty of TVs to watch sports and the only thing we didn't care too much for were the extremely small seats on the high stools at the tables across from the bar.  The ambience is definitely a sports bar with extremely elevated food. It still had a slight grungy atmosphere to it (lots of tattoos etc. on the staff) so don't expect anything more upscale than a bar-like feel. If we were in that area again and hungry we would probably return and get that lavash \"pizza\"."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, we finally decided to come and try this place and I have to say this place was mediocre at best which is disappointing to me. I have driven by this place several times. When I walked in, the vibe I got was it felt like I was walking into a filming of an episode of Bar Rescue.   We followed instructions on a sign that said seat yourself, after sitting down for about 3 minutes someone who was sitting at the bar having a drink walked up to our table and handed us menus and said she would locate our server for us. A minute or two later our server, whom I felt was the saving grace, came and took our drink orders. Shortly there after, a younger gentleman came by and literally dropped two cups of water on our table and we said how are you to him and he just walked away without acknowledging our question.   I felt that our waitress was very attentive, she recommended a dish and we decided to order her recommendation. When the food had come out, I felt that it was missing something to take it the extra step and bring it over the top. After eating our meal for about 15 minutes a gentlemen approached our table to check on us and he seemed to be intoxicated. It gave me an uneasy feeling.   This experience was disappointing after reading all the great reviews. I do not believe I will be returining"}
{"text":"We had great service and the food was really good! Love this new neighborhood place! Highly recommend it. Brittany rocked as our server.  Give local business your support. Good recommendation Roger W!"}
{"text":"As we currently stand, this place has 4.5 stars on 129 reviews. I'm completely flabbergasted with that statement based off tonight. Not only did it take a god awful amount of time to get our beers, but the $14 wings were uncomfortably undercooked and squishy despite saying \"grilled and fried\" on the menu and two of my undersized chicken tenders were strangely hard in the middle. On top of it all, these guys had half of their TVs and projectors playing some women's basketball when the sweet sixteen games were not even playing!! This \"dive\" bar doesn't even deserve that term..."}
{"text":"My friends and I refer to this as our new spot;)  super fun atmosphere, crazy friendly staff and the food, the food is killer!  The meatballs are a must!"}
{"text":"Went here last night, really creative fun decor. Jason the owner thanked us when we left and asked us how our service was. It was amazing to see customer service like this. The food looked awesome and very reasonably priced. Will be back to try the food and maybe watch a game when football season starts"}
{"text":"There are a thousand great things about this place! The owner Jason is a great guy who cares about the experience of everyone that walks through the doors. The staff makes everyone feel like a regular and the service is top notch. The food is amazing and the drinks are cold. We especially love that the patio is dog friendly so we can bring our dog Bobby along!"}
{"text":"The food was good for the price point and the service was good as well.  The patio area is dog friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Amazing! Do yourself a favor and try this place! The wings are phenomenal , servers are so friendly and nice . Love it! Everything we have had here is delicious ! Will be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"Thank you Rooster Tavern for your hospitality for our event last night! We had over 65 attendees and the service was great! We will definitely host another event here and can't wait to get back there!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise this was. Great food and great atmosphere. The meatball sliders are so very tasty and the French Dip - wow!  This little place is a hidden Hideway!! Service is great..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink on a Saturday night.  Had a couple of PBR's and sat at the bar. The food really looked great as it passed by us, but we did not order any. The acoustic guy in the corner was a nice addition to the bar.     Next time I'm in the area, I'll be sure to stop."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the ceviche....ahh man.  Good people, happy to see this place so close to home. Good spot for sure. Golden Tee, good taps, good people."}
{"text":"This has become our go to place in the Airpark.  The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing.  Great atmosphere wether you want a quick bite, enjoy the game or some live music.  Can't beat the sliders anywhere."}
{"text":"Very unique decor and excellent service.  Good TV viewing.  House wines are good and only $5.  Lots of nice IPAs on tap. Mostly a bar menus but they had Taco Tuesday that look d good.  I had the three meatballs...very delicious, comes with a side.  I had the squash which was very nice.  Fun place.  Looks like they have a good happy hour which ends at 6, we arrived after that but there were still some people there and they were having fun."}
{"text":"So glad to have this spot in the neighborhood! Food is delicious (you must try the meatballs) and great beer and wine selection. Fun atmosphere too!! We stopped in for Happy Hour and will definitely be coming back again and again :)"}
{"text":"Got here at 11:30pm and the sign says that they close at midnight and the place is closed. It's unfortunate because the ratings were so high."}
{"text":"Such good food here! I've never been let down here. I've had their hamburger, chicken marsala, and their civiche. Let me just say, their civiche is the best thing I've ever tasted in my life! It had shrimp and crab in it and I'm in love! Totally suggest everything on menu"}
{"text":"We had to venture out of our normal comfort zone to go to Shane Co & stopped in here for a late lunch. This place has a dark/gothic, but still welcoming feel to it. I can't really put my finger on it, but would agree with other reviews that it's like an upscale dive bar!  Our server was Jessica & she was great! Super nice & helpful! We had a lot of food (hanger had set in). We ordered a cup of the chicken soup (chef's special) that was bomb, the meatball plate with a side of spaghetti that was delicious! The pasta was cooked well also. My husband had the buffalo chicken wings with ranch & an order of their buffalo chips-he said it was all delicious & the buffalo sauce had a kick, but not too spicy. Their wings are baked instead of fried, which was nice! My husband also ordered a single crispy fish taco. Yes, just one and he absolutely loved that too!  I'd definitely return here and would especially recommend for the crispy fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I never give five stars  I do believe this is a nice place. It's halfway between a dive bar and a restaurant. It's too polished to be dive. Too much money went into interior decorating for it to be a grungy dive bar. And the food is too good  Okay, on the advice of other Yelpers, I knew exactly what to order here, and I went right for it. But before ordering, I gauged the bartender's ability. I asked him what was good here, and what he specialized in. He told me that he knows how to make all kinds of drinks. And he said it with a straight face. So I decided to go for an old-fashioned. I opted for a well whisky, which I wish I'd upgraded to a familiar name. But the Old Fashioned was spot on. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Literally halfway in-between, which is what you want. Good, clean taste. Bartender guy knows what he is doing!  Next I opted for the meatball slider. Giant meatball with sauce, nestled between a very soft pretzel bun. Never had anything like this before, and I was an instant fan  I then opted for the fried fish taco. For three bucks, I got two pretty large peices of fish in one taco with cabbage, and a mystery yellow tartar sauce (something of a honey mustard tartar?). I definitely got my money's worth with this taco. There was enough fried fish in there for two tacos, actually. So for $3, you definitely get a good deal.   I could of stopped eating with those two selections, but the wings and the French dip were well-reviewed, so I dug into my stomach reserves, and made some extra space. And boy did it pay off!   Wings with buffalo sauce were total winners. These are baked then grilled wings. Because frying wings is not the right way to do things. Size of the wings was medium, and the taste of the chicken was very flavorful and moist. The last thing you want is over-cooked wings, which happens all-too-often. And you don't want inedible wings, which are dipped in a sauce that's too over-poweringly spicy. Buffalo was just spicy enough to give a kick, but not too spicy to require a glass of milk.   Monday night here is trivia night, and the deejay for the trivia was a pretty cool guy, and several people were playing. I feel this is the kind of place you can go to, be left alone, have fun, and enjoy good food and drinks for a reasonable price.   If I was local to Scottsdale, this would be one of my weekly go-to hotspots"}
{"text":"For being a new hot spot this place seems to be doing things right. Yesterday was my first time there. My friend found them on Yelp & we decided to check it out. They sit on the corner of a strip mall (old Dilly's Deli) The vibe when we immediately walked in was welcoming & warm. We sat at the bar, surprisingly next to someone we knew. Our drink orders were taken immediately. The decor is eclectic & cool. They have a bear rug hanging on the ceiling above the bar. They have a motor cycle in the restaurant along with a ski ball game. We met Jason (the owner) who was very friendly & funny. I like that he mingles with his customers. We ordered their grilled chicken wings. They were delicious. The guy next to me had the meatballs, they also looked delicious. The only thing I would like to see change, is having more micro brews available, not just Kilt Lifter. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Has a lot of promise!  New and exciting in the heart of north town. Come try a new spot that could become a regular joint. Great people and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 5 friends last night to this establishment. We made a reservation as we had read all of the great reviews on Yelp about the Rooster Tavern. We experienced terrible service as the waitress was not attentive considering it was not busy for a Saturday night. Long story short, we cancelled our food and went elsewhere. My friend had already left a comment on Yelp and on Facebook about our experience so I was not going to. However, after the response he received from Rooster, I feel compelled to leave a comment about our dissatisfaction with this establishment. The gentleman who replied was informal as he used young kid 'lingo' when responding. But he seemed apologetic and many of us have worked in the food industry before. We know there are good nights and bad nights. We were willing to give this place another go in the future until the gentleman felt the urge/need to leave a snide remark at the very end of his reply. Sir, you are in the service industry. There are going to be rough days when you will have a customer comment that you may not like/ agree with. However, you do not respond by insulting your guests, especially not online when future guests will be turned off by the bad attitude. The appropriate move would have been to approach our table when the server informed you a party was cancelling their order. But we were not approached so the issue remained unsolved and that is the reason why you have disappointed guests. We ended up driving five minutes up the road to Four Peaks. We had impeccable service and the manager heard what an awful experience we had at the Rooster so he brought us dessert on the house. Four Peaks will get our business in the future due to their outstanding service and attentive workers."}
{"text":"Great establishment. It was our first stop while visiting in AZ and the family kept wanting to go back. Good beer and food selection and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pretty cool vibe in this place, the staff and owner make you feel at home, which is important in a neighborhood bar. The menu is eclectic, from sliders and bruschetta to ceviche and burritos, to sandwiches and small dinner plates. I had the sliders, there are two types: traditional burger type and meatball type. The burger type was very good. However the meatball slider was simply wow. Very good recommendation by our server, Bobbi. My son had one of the meatball sliders as well and definitely concurred. He also ordered the ceviche, which I sampled. Perhaps the best ceviche I've had at a bar. Spicy, but not to hot, not swimming in sauce with plenty of substance.  Like the menu, the décor is also eclectic. But it works for me. The only reason it didn't get a 5 is a pet peeve of mine. We went for a mid-week lunch, and while it wasn't super busy, neither was it empty. They had a single server working the tables, as well as the bar. The owner was working the crowd, which is good, but imho, there were times it would have been nice to have seen him helping his server out. While we were not displeased with our service, she was attentive and we never had to wait more than a minute or so for her attention, she was stretched to her limit. Perhaps this was an aberration, as the owner seemed very attentive to the clientele, when I go back, I'll watch for this.  Regardless, the only other issue is finding it. It's kind of in a funky location in a strip mall in between Thunderbird and Acoma on Scottsdale Road. The strip mall is in two tiers: those establishments fronting Thunderbird, and then another row of retail further back from the road on the other side of the parking lot. This is where Rooster's sits. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Great neighborhood bar! The burger sliders were cooked to perfection. The meat was juicy and the pretzel bread had a great taste. We also tried the lobster bisque, very well recommended. I would definitely return for lunch, drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"Great upscale dive bar as advertised, however it is not a dive bar menu as the food is really good. We sampled the appetizer menus having the honey hot wings and sliders. The wings are fresh, baked, grilled and outstanding. Very tender and juicy. A bit pricy for wings, but worth it. The meatball and burger sliders on the pretzels rolls were very good as well. We had a side of spaghetti squash, which shows the diversity of their menu. Great live music and house rock and roll music when the one man band is not playing. We will be back. This is a gem in Scottsdale and Jason, the owner, welcomed us and really cares about the customer experience."}
{"text":"Our first time here...and it did NOT disappoint. We met the owner, Jason. He was great! Our server was Rachel. She is a great ambassador for Rooster Tavern...a neighborhood Grill and Bar. My wife Debi had the Mac n Cheese and a side salad. It was great! I would highly recommend the French Dip, that I truly enjoyed!  Tasty, tender...on a roll that had great texture for this sandwich. Both of our entrées were presented well. My only suggestion would be to serve Debi's side salad before the hot Mac n Cheese entrée. We WILL be back. Being restaurant owners ourselves, we appreciate this honest, friendly, fun environment.  Good Luck Jason!  Ken & Debi"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. We have been here a couple times to try to support a local owner however we receive less than par service and drinks are expensive for being a tavern or bar. We thought it might have been the first time but we went a second time and service was no better. I won't be heading back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a must go to bar and grill. The food is extremely good the service and staff are the best. It's like a casual capitol grill. This is my first choice for a night out. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Frequent visitor to the valley. Looking for something different on an early Monday afternoon. Found the Rooster. I must be on a roll. Cold brew, decent food and a killer playlist. Owner and staff top notch. Check out the Rooster."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Scottsdale... went for the first time today and can't say enough good things about it. Fantastic drinks, ambience and service. Did have  an appetizer, which was great, will sample more of the menu next time. Pleasantly surprised that the owner or manager? came around to say hello and also sincerely thanked us on our way out. Never see that in Scottsdale. Will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"I was told there was a new 'tavern' in North Scottsdale. I work up near the airpark so I had to stop. It's cleverly hidden behind Sapporo and RA sushi off Scottsdale and Thunderbird so now you were to find it! It's a friendly place, if you are as well, I sat at the bar and met two great ones! Bobbie and Tony were very attentive. I could tell there were a few friends/already regulars enjoying the place! I had the meatballs! Very good! The fare is tavern food as you should expect by the name! It's quality food at a good price. By 6:30 the bar stools were filling up so others obviously like the place as well. Happy hour is 3-6. $1 off wine well and domestic draft. It's a quick happy hour....but maybe that will change? For the physically disadvantaged, they have a drop down bar near one end! Yep, roll your wheelchair up and belly up! Not required by law but a nice touch! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came in for the first time based off the reviews. I ordered the meatballs. Omg! Best ever! I'm not a fan of the \"bar scene\" as a single lady but I go strictly for the food. It seems like an older crowd. Not for the younger scene. Ive been in several times and the food is amazing every time!"}
{"text":"Really nice local Scottsdale bar. Excellent grilled /baked wings! Actually really impressed with them and the overall food, ambiance etc here. Great place"}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar in Scottsdale. It has the small town bar feel. You're only a stranger once. Food is good. Pretzel rolls meatball sliders are great. Wings are baked and sauced. Service was friendly and efficient but food came out randomly. Nice spot"}
{"text":"Recovering Colon Surgery patient at MAYO craving these for 5 days. Finally get released for full food and send VERY EXPLICIT directions about adding EXTRA EXTRA SAUCE because it wont swallow easily.  ALSO request TWO ounces of Mayo, was given ONE once cup that was HALF FULL. Nothing says \"we read your ticket and realized you paid DOUBLE to use us through GRUBHUB, but Hey, we really don't care THAT much about you....\"  Totally. Wasted. Meal. TOO DRY TO EAT. I DONT SEE ANY SAUCE AT ALL on that pasta, much less EXTRA EXTRA SAUCE, now add that to the 1/4 order of mayonnaise requested and the pitiful half cup of au jus, and this all led to the entire meal being thrown in he trash after 3 bites of pasta and one slider.. too salty, too dry, too stupid to follow explicit instructions.  You RUINED this meal and promised a product you simply failed to deliver, you failed and I'm disappointed, an apology and a refund would be appropriate, Richard"}
{"text":"Of course I rely heavily on what others have to say about an establishment before making the decision to go.  The main motivation for coming here was proximity to home and the positive feedback it was receiving.  I understand it is a neighborhood bar with all the basic bar food, but it was so basic it was lackluster.  On a quiet Monday eve there were maybe half a dozen patrons, yet service was incredibly slow. Server seemed distracted and uninterested, I believe he may have been the bartender. Other people delivered our food and/or checked in on our table. At the end of my sojourn there we waited in vain for our check - which the server had forgotten about.  Buffalo wings that were ordered were incredibly dry and lacked the anticipated buffalo sauce. Even the sides of ranch and bleu cheese dressing were missing the key ingredient of flavor.  The buffalo meatballs, drenched in a buffalo and bleu cheese sauce, were disappontingly dry and flavorless.   No selection of drafts to be had here, and most of the beer offerings on the wall were domestics like bud and coors.  For a local tavern, I guess I expected there to be a more decent beer selection.   And that if the food offerings were known and customary bar food dishes, like wings, that there would be more of an emphasis on making those the best damn wings you have ever had.  Finally, no one cared whether we were there or would ever come back.  Honestly, I will often give a business my patronage just because the service rocks. This one, unfortunately, needs some work in all areas."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is beyond friendly and attentive, food is amazing! The French Dip rocks and the Ceviche is a must have. The owner stopped by our table to check on us and was super friendly. Definitely a great place and an awesome addition to Thunderbird Square!"}
{"text":"Peg and I visited this place a few days ago and absolutely loved the experience!  Joe was our server and even with his other role as a bartender took great care of us and my water addiction. The wings (got half bbq, half honey hot) are baked and grilled, and they were delicious. The bruschetta was topped with ripe marinated tomatoes and boursin cheese on top of crispy (not burned or soggy!) baguette. Peg had a very tasty tuna (albacore) melt and my French dip was NOT overly salty which can easily happen with au jus. Salads were fresh and the Caesar dressing was terrific. This place is a find, and while you need to look for it a bit in a shopping center...it is worth the discovery!"}
{"text":"Money... this is flavor town. Sliders are on pretzel bun juicy buttery cooked to perfection make sure to stop here for lunch or dinner. Great atmosphere and staff. Make sure you get to meet Jamie behind the bar for The perfect pour in the perfect cocktail!"}
{"text":"Was in town Monday for some family issues.  Decided to go out and have dinner at RA.  Upon leaving I noticed this place and decided to check it out.  Wow was I glad I did.  The theme-ing was super cool and fun and the drinks were strong and reasonably priced.  The man working there told me he was the owner and explained that they had just opened.  It looks like they spent a fortune on making the place so I do hope it sticks around because I would love to come back and have some more drinks and try the food that I didn't get a chance to!  Really nice place, I spent a long time just looking at all the stuff they had hanging on the walls and all the details.  Will be back soon I hope!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a 3.5 if it was available.  I still love the ambiance and the live music is always solid.  That said, what used to be one of our favorite places to grab a late night dinner at has gone to a 2 on food.  We went a few weeks ago with friends for dinner and the best parts of the meal were mediocre and the ceviche was really off.  Giving the benefit of the doubt we tried another night and our Boursin Burger was burnt and was really lacking on the cheese and toppings.  We'll still be back but from now on we're unfortunately going to have to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Meatball sliders are unbelievable! I go once or twice a week and always feel welcomed. All of the servers and bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"Little intimidating walking in but food is great.  People are very friendly too.  Dark inside but plenty of sports screens"}
{"text":"Happened upon this \"dive\" bar after brunch on a Saturday. Patrons inside waved and said hello on our entrance. We felt like we belonged! The bartender was very friendly and offered us a food menu and poured our drinks promptly. The atmosphere was eclectic to say the least but charming at the same time! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great bar, good menu selections and very affordable. Nice addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Just as advertised, a luxury dive bar.  Really cool ambiance.  Food was great.  We tried the honey hot wings and they were awesome.  Went on a Saturday night and there were Lots of people, but not so crowded as to take away from the place.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Very friendly neighborhood bar. Great serviced and awesome ceviche!I had the lobster macaroni and cheese! I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Just a great bar great service not the usual like Zips or Gallagher's you can eat their bar food and get a drink, this place has great bartenders, good bar food and servers."}
{"text":"Really cool interior design...trendy but comfortable. The patio is also really nicely done. Our server was really friendly and on the ball. The pretzel appetizer with cheese is delicious. Perfect for sharing. The tacos are great but spicy! My friend got the fish fry and loved it. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Cody is good bartender and down to earth and keeps serving the beers cold and the food speaks for itself and the wings are awesome baked and grilled and so good."}
{"text":"This place seems like it's got a lot of potential, but it needs a LOT of work.  Beer selection leaves a lot to be desired. Service is awful.  Food isn't good.  I have given this place two chances.  Not sure it deserves a third at this point.  And certainly cannot recommend it unless it gets better fast."}
{"text":"Hands down the best experience in our local neighborhood bar! Our waitress Stefanie was incredible, she went through the menu and answered all of our questions about the menu. She recommended the honey hot wings (they are to die for) then for dinner she suggested the chicken fajitas and ribs. The food is truly amazing and their wine list is one of a kind. The owner even came by our table to introduce himself and really made us feel at home at a place that you can tell he and Stefanie take pride in working for.  This place is a truly a diamond in the ruff! Cannot wait to come back to try the Prime Rib!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with friends for some drinks and we made a good choice! Great bar, great decor, good vibes, great drinks! Even have skeeball in the back! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a cool neighborhood bar to meet up with friends or meet new people!"}
{"text":"The worst service that I have ever had in my life. We got one beer in an hours time and the server never checked on us at all. We had a party of 6, you would think she would have been motivated. She came up and took an appetizer order but only asked a few of us. Next thing I new she was gone and I never got my order in. After that we sat dry with no more drinks nor did she check on us again. We got frustrated and one of us had to go up to her and tell her we need our checks and we are leaving. She didn't even care at all. She only had 4 tables including us. Management never came over to check on us or ask why we cancelled our food. This place is amateur hour. If they want to survive they need to get better servers and management needs to be on point. So disappointed in our time there. Hopefully they get it fixed. Would have loved to actually try their food."}
{"text":"My new favorite bar. The decor is welcoming. The staff is fantastic. And who doesn't love a bar that serves spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. Looking forward to trying more of the menu, but the spaghetti rocked."}
{"text":"Just discovered this amazing local spot ! The staff were incredibly attentive  as we sidled up to the bar . Ordered a couple pints of Uncle Bears beers and some of their signature baked then grilled wings , honey hot style .. SO GOOD ! The ambiance was so welcoming and all of the patrons , incredibly friendly ! My husband and myself were  blown away ! The Uncle Bears representatives gifted us glasses and stickers for trying the fantastic brews , the bartender kept samples coming to make sure we were satisfied with our choices !!  We shared the French Dip and we both view ourselves as experts & we loved the grilled onions and horseradish sauce & the au jus was perfect ! So happy to have discovered our new local hang out ! Do yourself a favor & visit this local gem ! You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Cody and Joe are great bar tenders and Chef Rico's food is ALWAYS great. A true diamond in the rough. Shhhh. Don't tell anyone. Oh, and a future Nebraska Cornhusker bar!!"}
{"text":"We started with the Buffalo Chips and my husband ordered the French Dip and I got the Pita sandwich. Holy crap the food is ridiculously delicious. We stopped here on our way home from Scottsdale back to Marana, and do come here often so will definitely be coming back. The service was super attentive (drinks never empty) food came out in a normal time frame, and these are the most properly made fries I have had since moving to Arizona a year ago. The decor is super fun and you have lots to look at while you wait for your food. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go...for a quick bite, to hang with my favorite peeps and for amazing food and atmosphere! Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"Really cool looking place inside. Nice decor & bathrooms. I had the Buffalo wings & a few beers. Craft beer selection was lacking. Service was very good. Wings were okay but expensive to me (10 wings for 13.95). I might stop back in if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Wednesday. I liked the vibe right away. Dark'ish but clean and nicely decorated. The bar stools at the high tops have tiny seats. Your booty might not want to sit there for beers 2 and 3. Server was a female, friendly and genuine. I had a salad and the Oskar Blues Pinner. There was too much dressing on the salad but it was tasty and the portion was generous. My friend had the wedge salad. He loved it. We shared the lavosh; also delicious. Service was spot on. It was kind of quiet but the other customers seemed like regulars, from a neighboring business. They sat at the bar. There was a child present, seemed like the son of a server. He was back and forth in the back. And there was an older (in their 60's) couple making out in a booth.  Entertaining. Bathroom was clean. I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Great selection of local brews several on draft always a bonus in my book! I really dig the decor elk mounts and motorcycles what else do you need? The food was delicious as well great bar food above expectations, especially the buffalo meatballs. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not sure how they still have a 4.5 at the time of this review. Sandwich less filling than a subway 6 inch, but it comes with the same Lays potato chips, and takes 10 times as long to make. Expensive and underwhelming drink selection. Just go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Original Review (gave 4 stars): So bad I want to give these guys five stars. The reason for four stars is the beer is not nearly cold enough bottle or tap. The atmosphere and the Decor is awesome! Such a great vibe! I highly recommend the sliders! Especially the burger sliders. I've been here three times and so far everything I've eaten has been excellent. Definitely, a great local place to hang out.  Today: I am changing the number of stars to one. I can't believe what just happened. I have been to the Rooster many times, sometimes with friends, sometimes with my wife and a few times by myself. The food is great, I still recommend most of their menu.  However today something happened to me that has NEVER happened to me before. I went in and found a spot at the bar. Before my butt was all the way down onto the stool a bartender approached me, speaking my name. My first thought was he remembered me from a previous visit, but I only remember seeing this bartender once before. Nope. He slapped down a receipt in front of me and asked, \"Is this you?\". Is was. He was more than a little disrespectful and had anger in his voice. \"Is there a reason you gave such a terrible tip?\" Now I remembered him!  I told him I would only give a tip such as this for one reason. He wanted to know if I didn't like his service...duh. Then I noticed a handwritten note at the bottom of the receipt, \"watch out for this bagger\". Hum. And of course, the reprimand? he gave me was in front of several other customers. I started to say something, then thought better and walked out.  This guy is an employee (hopefully not for much longer). How do you get away with humiliating and disrespecting a customer, especially a frequent flyer? He should have just sucked it up and when he saw me, his service level should have gone to a 10.  I will never go to the Rooster again, I cannot recommend it. The biggest mistake this idiot made, is the owner of the Rooster is the one that will pay for this. I will make sure everyone I know knows what to expect when they go to the Rooster. There are WAY too many options in town. Go somewhere else! Dutch~"}
{"text":"Very cool ambience! Owner was extremely friendly! Would definitely come back! Highly recommend the Apple pie moonshine and the wings!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place on Scottsdale road to meet my lady, so I went to Yelp and I found this place, it said it was Hot and New so we decided to give it a try.  It was a little difficult to find, so my girlfriend called them to find out exactly where they are and she was told;  \"THAT YOU CAN'T MISS US, WE HAVE A SHORT RED SCHOOL BUS PARKED IN FRONT WITH A GOLDEN COCK ON TOP\". The decor is a mix of medieval knight's armor, a stuffed fox w/sun glasses, a bear rug lying on the ceiling and a few video games. It's a cool decor if I just want to have a few drinks with friends and is slightly reminiscent of a 70's bar, without the smoke.  We sat down in one of the booths and a very nice young lady came over to help us. The young lady did the best she could do considering the situation; this was her first day and she just walked in five minutes earlier. She didn't know what was on the menu. Now if a place is going to be  successful they must setup a system to train their newbie's. Most restaurant/bars will have a seasoned server doing the serving and the newbie would tag along to see how its done. This way the customer gets the best experience possible with little or no hiccups and the newbie gets trained and setup for success. Our server had such a great attitude we decided to deal with it, but every question we asked, she had to ask someone else. To me this is all managements fault and the lack of attention to detail could be fatal to any business. Ask Jon Taffer!  I did take a quick look at the menu before choosing to come here, but I should have looked closer. I was looking to get a Burger and Fries, it's my base barometer when I try a new place since if you can't get this right, the other stuff probably isn't going to be right either.  After getting a menu I spotted my hamburger it was the first item listed on the top. The burger was a 6oz burger, lettuce, tomato, onion and cheese. It was $10 and came with your choice of a salad or potato chips. Wait, What Potato Chips, are you kidding me? NO FRENCH FRIES, NO ONION RINGS what are they thinking? I didn't object to the fact that I didn't get a burger and fries for $ 10, the objection was there was not a single French Fry or Onion Ring to be had not even as a side order.  Now everyone knows that there is nothing more American than Hamburger and French fries, not hamburger and potato chips or Salad. The sides that you could order were Sautéed Broccoli, Spiraled Zucchini, Spaghetti Squash and Spaghetti and red sauce. Of course everyone knows when you're going out to get your buzz on, your main thought is what healthy choices go with this high fat, high sodium, high carbohydrate food and the five domestic beers, two Scotch/sodas and two shots of Jägermeister you're about to drink.  No, I want hamburger and fries and onion rings and anything that is Salty, Crispy, Sweet, Charred, Spicy or Crunchy. This menu is just poorly planned. Additionally, we were told that it was happy hour but the only happy hour food offered were sliders for $3.00 a piece, but of course if I'm getting sliders I'm probably going to get at least three, which would have been nine bucks which happened to be the exact same price as the non happy hour menu price for three sliders, so no bargain here, again a management issue.  Now I will say the Burger was good and my lady said that the salad was better than most side salads she's had, the lettuce was crisp and fresh, the croutons were crunchy, but she really wanted French fries with her burger.  On another note; I'm posting a separate review for the Lays Company to let them know how much I enjoyed the potato chips. NOT! Here's the thing when I go to your establishment, I want you to WOW me with your attention to detail, the service and the quality of food you serve. If you want to serve potato chips, they have to be made in house and be fantabulous, not poured out of a bag, I go to Circle K to get Potato chips out of a bag.  We ended the meal by asking if they have any dessert substance. She asked a colleague and came back with the three choices, which by the way weren't listed on the menu. We opted for the Salted Carmel cake. The cake came with vanilla ice cream and was ok. However we both could tell it was a frozen store bought or food service vendor purchased cake. This was another opportunity to shine that fell short. There are so many locally sourced bakeries in the valley that will work with you to design desserts that are fresh, yummy and unique to you. If you don't aspire to be different with your food and service, then you're serving the same drinks and beers that the public can get anywhere else. At that point there is no reason for us to come to your establishment.  If you want to thrive you must improve.  I will give you a 2nd chance when your website shows the improvements in the menu.  GOOD LUCK"}
{"text":"Very cool venue! The food, location, and decor are all awesome and the management and staff work hard to keep patrons happy  I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"The Rooster Tavern is exactly just what our neighborhood needed. Easy access to drive or ride your bike to. Hell they even have golf carts parked in front. The inside is so well designed we felt right at home the minute we walked in. The decor is beautiful and very interesting. The staff is attentive and very accommodating. Carly the waitress and Charlie who does a little of everything, are so dang cute. Everyone there is so friendly. We love the MIND ERASER MENU, that is totally something we have never seen before, and we have been mind eraser drinkers for a long time. Be sure to try 1 when you are there! The Lavosh is off the hook good as well.. It comes 2 different ways and we will try the Tuna tomato next time we are there. Great place to hang out and meet people that's for sure. Thank you all for making us feel so welcome! Welcome to the neighborhood! Can't wait to go back for another round of Mind Erasers!"}
{"text":"So far, not great. 30 minutes and we don't have our food. Restaurant serves Lays potato chips. Salad should come out before the entree. High top tables along the window are really crammed. Decor is cool. If this was bar rescue they would be failing the stress test.  The wedge was okay but it was way too small. Iceberg is cheap lettuce. Why skimp?  Menu said the French dip came with horseradish but it wasn't served with it. Waitress looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for it. I ate half the sandwich before she even came back with the horseradish. I weigh 160lbs. The sandwich was three bites with very little meat.  I don't normally write reviews like this but I felt like I had to. I would come back here to watch a game and sit at the bar. The only issue is there are only three TV's.  I gave it two stars to be nice."}
{"text":"My new favorite tavern!  Charming decor with upscale finishes. The ambiance is casual, but everything is very high quality. Great selection of beers (and booze). Thoughtful placement of TV's keeps them in sight, but isn't overbearing like other places. Wings are amazing - best I've had in Arizona!  Excellent flavor, perfect size and flavorful char from the grill. Owner Jason is an excellent ambassador of customer service."}
{"text":"This little gem popped up just over a year ago in my neighborhood. It's now our go to place every Monday night for trivia. The food is amazing. Best french dip in town and their grilled wings are great. Pretty much everything on the menu is tasty. The owner, Jason, and the bartenders/waitresses are always right there when you need them. They also have good live acts every week. They had a Hendricks cover guy there this past Thursday and he was awesome. Can't recommnd this place more. Love it!"}
{"text":"During our first week in our new hometown, we had been shopping for emergency items until our storage unit arrived.  Hunger had taken over and we Yelp-ed a restaurant in the area.  This place came up. We had the kiddoes with us (11 & 15) on a Sunday afternoon and hoped the place lived up to the reviews.  Tables were empty but the bar seemed full.  We waited for what seemed like 15 minutes with no server to be found.  We were about ready to leave when someone came over and asked if we wanted to see a menu.  What?!?  Service was just OK- food was great.  We knew that we weren't \"regulars\" but we didn't expect to feel like outsiders.  Not sure if we will return for the food because the service was blah."}
{"text":"Have no idea how the food is since the service was so poor our party left after being repeatedly ignored. Will not return."}
{"text":"Great new bar with higher end restaurant food. Rico their chef is amazing. I've eat'n there 3 times and each time has been awesome.  I found myself another regular watering hole."}
{"text":"Great local hangout.. near our house and get food and atmosphere. Highly recommend- Continues to vary menu which is nice"}
{"text":"We were so pleasantly surprised with The Rooster! So many restaurants to choose from but I will choose this one again!  The food, although not unusual, cooked perfectly with top notch ingredients. The menu was simple but included choices for all. The wine list was short, but inclusive of interesting choices. Wine glasses were perfect size. Owner was kind enough to greet folks and chat us up, being present and interested.  Seats are comfortable, and overall vibe was inviting. Good job Rooster, we will return!"}
{"text":"Super friendly servers/bartenders. Had barbacoa tacos to die for and ensalada mexicana was fresh and super tasty. Definitely coming here again."}
{"text":"We were on staycation at the Princess and wanted to find a casual place that we could get food and some drinks. Since there was 8 of us, I called ahead and asked if they would be able to accommodate our large party. Jason the owner told me no problem come on down. When we got there he had 2 booths ready for us. This was perfect since half of our group were kids, they sat at one table and adults at another table. (Side note: for a \"bar\" type atmosphere it was mild enough for kids, however we are pretty kickback about stuff like that. Some might feel it isn't really kid friendly) I digress, the waitress was the only one there taking care of the entire restaurant but we never were neglected and everything we ordered came out quickly and correct. Holy cow the food was awesome! Wings had great flavor, burgers were juicy and huge, tacos were bomb! As we were leaving Jason came by and asked us how everything was and gave us his card and said to call him if we ever want to have a party or have any issues at the restaurant. Service was great, food was excellent, and the price was reasonable. It was a great start to our staycation!"}
{"text":"Yahoo the rooster I've been going since Jan good food friendly 3 dollar meatball sliders yum lv it lyn"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good eats.  Our server provided outstanding service and was very friendly.  The lavash with havarti cheese was excellent, chrispy and tasty.  The Boursin Burger was good, but arrived to the table with over-cooked dry meat.  Even when \"medium\" was ordered.  I am sure if I informed the server it would have been replaced with a new Burger, but I decided to eat it instead and save the time.  The bar appeared to have a real nice cool neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"The BEST French Dip sandwich in the Valley hands down. I'll be back to try the wings."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale. Great food and awesome customer service. This is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"Owner Jason waited on us immediately introduced us to the menu. Very comfortable place and personable staff. Met the chef and waitress. Enjoyed our meal and staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! The Rooster is a really cool, locally owned place to grab a drink and a bite. Cool decor inside with a great mix of tunes going on. Service is always very welcoming; Lisa at the bar is always warm and on point. Wings are good...they're baked and you can tell they are very high quality. The burger sliders are amazing(yes just burger sliders but so good) and I would go just for them! This place is the place to go if your looking to have some drinks, bar food(that is 10x better than any other places bar food) and great service."}
{"text":"Awesome food and people. Jason, the owner, is always making sure that everything is perfect. One night when we were there, his partner had some friends there and put out piles of wings for them to munch on. He went around insisting everyone have some (actually cannibalizing his own business). And you have to try the Honey Hot Wings. Check this place out but please save me a table!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted to eat here for her birthday.  Best wings we have ever had. Service was great. Great Neighbor bar and grill"}
{"text":"$15.00 for a vodka martini. I really liked the place until this recent sticker shock. Jason, the owner is a great guy.  He's engaged with the customers, and works hard.  However, at these prices, me and our neighborhood friends have to pass.  Going back to Zipps."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to this bar. Has a good mix of people from the mid mid-20s to 50s. They serve food but nothing really jumped out on the menu for me. Has an interesting interior kind of going for a mixed Heavy Metal Guns and Roses look with a modern twist. Drinks were decent pours for the price. I would definitely suggest to them to change out their tap list for beers. They only have one or two some what craft beers the rest are your typical Bud Coors Light Ultra etc. These days people want their craft beers even if they're local craft beers."}
{"text":"I'm really warming up to this place... I love the decor of this bar. Very cool. I'm going to steal one of those black chandeliers when you guys aren't looking. All kidding aside, I went there last night and sat at the bar. The bartender was exceptionally attentive and fun. Then, I tried the meatballs and wow, they were yummy. Oh, I also tried my friend's mac and cheese with bacon which was just as good. I'm definitely coming back to see what else is on the menu. Kudos for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great service. Comfortable atmosphere. Food was decent though not exceptional. Signage needs improved, was hard to find even with GPS."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had the French onion dip, friend had the pear and kale salad... both great! Mac and cheese a little small portion but good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, \"hugged\" chickens and awesome beer glasses. We'll be back !!  Great atmosphere and lots of fun."}
{"text":"Stopped in to sample the place heard it was worth checking out it was a great dive bar. Well better than dive bar in decor and the music was some great rock n roll. The wings are great excellent even although they are pricey for only 8 wings.  The meat ball slide was pretty good a bit heavy on the salt other wise fantastic. Well I highly recommend staying away from mixed drinks  not well made, he'll order a beer you cannot go wrong with a cold brew. Enjoy"}
