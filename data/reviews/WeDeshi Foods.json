{"text":"Food was very flavorful.  Had the chicken wrap  and the paneer wrap.  They made it fresh to order so tasted fantastic.  Prices are phenomenal for this type of quality!"}
{"text":"Butter Chicken (Served in 12 oz Container with choice of Naan/Chapati or Rice) $7.99  Mini tandoor platter (1 Tandoor leg + 5 piece Chicken tikka + 2 piece Chicken/beef Kabab) $9.99 - includes a small container of raita.  This mini platter is so so good. These meats are so deliciously seasoned. There is more then enough meat to appetize two people. Comes on top of a small bedding of salad (spiced dice cabbage, tomatoe slices, and onion)  The butter chicken is pretty good, but the chicken is scarce.  Tip: If you order the tandoor chicken, just put in in the butter chicken sauce, and your all set!   I wish they de-boned the chicken.    Amazing value and delicious food. No hesitation with my 5 star rating.   Only good for take out."}
