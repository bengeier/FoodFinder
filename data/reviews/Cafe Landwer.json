{"text":"Landwer

It was my first time at Cafe Landwer and didn't know what to expect. It was excellent with tasty food, quick and attentive service and  reasonable prices.

We got there earlier on a Sunday and didn't have to wait though it got busy while we were there. 

Two of us had the Leander's Famous Breakfast, great variety with more than enough food. All done to perfection. 

The others had Smoked Salmon sandwich and the Tuna Salad. The sandwich was quite large with delicious lox on a delicious roll. The Tuna Salad was a great size with a large variety of ingredients. 

All and all a very enjoyable experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been to the location in Jerusalem and it was the best breakfast we have ever had.
This location is the exact opposite where do I begin?
We were seated quickly despite the amount of people waiting. However then we waited 15 min with nobody even looking at us. The lady beside me ordered a coffee and it came on a filthy glass and she sent it back I heard her say it's so bad it's not drinkable. The waitress came back and said that is how the coffee is here does she want something else?
I took the opportunity to ask if she is our waitress because we are waiting to order.
We got the landwers breakfast for 2, 2 tuna mini sandwiches, landwers ice tea and an orange juice.
The breakfast came after a very long time even though it's pre made food and 2 fried eggs. I ordered over medium hubby over easy. They had no idea which when they brought it since both were over cooked and 2 popped and hardened eggs. The salads were so tiny they were barely enough for one.. pathetic for 2. There was no bread for the salads and no cutlery. The tuna sandwiches were tiny, not worth $5 at all. 
I spent 5 min trying to get someone's attention to get bread and cutlery. Finally locked eyes with a waitress who wouldn't come over and literally  expected us to yell across the restaurant of what we need. Finally they brought the missing bread and cutlery which now our eggs are cold.
My husbands OJ sat empty the entire meal.
My ice tea was 5.50 and was about 3 shot glasses of juice rest was ice and fruit. Couldn't eat the fruit as it was the skin of an orange not the actual orange. 
We left hungry after $57 bill and I hit a drivethru so I could eat something. 
I can't wait to go back to this the one in Israel but this location was literally the worst experience I have had for breakfast"}
{"text":"Ordered pasta Tomato Basil + extra grilled chicken. Pasta felt like \"heavy\" to chew (I could tell a good pasta), hardly any basil (I asked for more and was told there was no more basil in the kitchen), and the extra chicken cost me $5 (there was very little chicken). I would say this is way over. Didn't enjoy the pasta. However I heard good feedback from others. May be it was a bad dish"}
{"text":"Have been to this place twice. After the first time was going to give it 4 stars, because of some issues with service. After this Sunday breakfast I'm giving it 2.  We were a group of 6. They gave us a table and nobody came over to us for 15 min. I expect that for breakfast they at least serve coffee immediately. I tried to catch a server, but couldn't. Finally annoyed server came over and rushed us through our order. When we got the food no one came over even once! I had to ask them for coffee refill myself. Very poor service and they were not even full. The coffee is horrible, I mean worth then Tim Hortons, very sour. However great latte. Food is very good, but I won't come back because of terrible service. I think in today's world of reviews restaurants have to do a way better management."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in Richmond Hill area, lovely and friendly personnels, fresh and yummy dishes, will definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"Worst experience.  Food is below average. Wait times are well above average.  I don't understand how their breakfast can take 30 mins... all you are cooking is an omlette.  Everything else should be prepped. Service is non existant.  The coffee is good but that's about it, and honestly in a coffee town like this... you need to do more.

I believe they are shut down at the moment.  Not surprised because their offering is pathetic."}
{"text":"Beautiful place and a great atmosphere. Staff is super friendly. Coffee is to die for! But the show stopper is the presentation of their food and the quality is like no place I've seen. First when I looked at the breakfast menu I thought it's a bit pricy but when you get the food you understand why.   Every piece of your meal is served in a separate dish (wouldn't want to be their dishwasher) and they bring you a larger variety than you can handle. I don't know where they get their fruit but wow. I hope they don't change. The only problem I see is that it will get way too busy and I have no doubt line ups will be long."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one to write reviews, but I needed to in this case. I had high hopes for this place, as I've heard ok things from it. There were very unattentive waiters and waitresses, who were less concerned about service and had quite some attitude. Received dirty cups and water and when asked to get it replaced one of them rolled their eyes. The food was quite salty and never once did a waiter come by and ask how we were doing. Near the end, we asked for a container 3x and finally someone brought it over after they stuck us with the bill. Cafe Landwer you disappoint greatly."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch spot in Vaughan with really cute decoration! Popular for the shakshouka so I tried the halloumi cheese one. Tomato sauce, runny soft boiled eggs and deep fried cheese with bread, so yummy! There's a small salad which is great when you want a bit of a break and palate change. Interested to go back to try other dishes. They are also vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice casual cafe for breakfast or lunch. Food is great but service is pretty slow and seating is tight. If you are coming on a weekend morning , it will be busy! We waited half an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"This was such a cute cafe! 

It was pricey. But the staff is kind and it's busy but we got seated as soon as we walked in!

He manager was there which is great because it shows he cares!!! 

The margherita pizza didn't even look like one... kinda looked like a cheese pizza 

I got a 'four cheese pesto sauce' (the green pizza). I really enjoyed it especially cause my grandma makes a pasta version of it
The sweet potato fries were really good too crispy and perfect level of salty! 
The milkshakes were good too! I got a Belgium milk chocolate, my brother got vanilla bean and we were both happy. 

Even though they sat us near a window which is obviously going to be a cold area cause we're in Canada; it was a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Passed by this plaza and found this restaurant when our original plan didn't work. Saw a lot of people chose to sit at the patio and read the reviews were mostly great. The decor of the restaurant was pretty unique. We were seated at the patio as well. There are a variety of choices of breakfast one can choose. I chose something that not what I normally ordered. Felt adventurous this morning and wanted to get something new. I ordered a cup of French Vanilla and a Halloumi Shakshouka.

French Vanilla came first. It was hot and sweet with Vanilla flavour. It tastes awesome.

Halloumi Shakshouka is one of the breakfasts on the menu. It comes with Halloumi cheese and spinach with breakfast salad, labneh, and tahini as well as a choice of white or multigrain bread  on the side.

The sauce tasted a tiny bite of spicy when I dipped my bread in the sauce to eat with. The Halloumi cheese tasted good. The outside of the cheese looked deep fried and yet the inside is soft and tasted good.

The salad is fresh and delicious with tabini and labneh.

This is quite an exciting adventure and I am fully satisfied now."}
{"text":"This is the cutest cafe in the suburbs! I walked in and it didn't even feel like I was in Canada. The coffee is delicious and so was the little Nutella bites that I shared with a client.

I was in there for a meeting and I was able to hook up to wifi almost immediately, which was great!

My only reservation with this place was that our server wasn't really educated on the menu. I asked about what I could in my smoothies and she didn't know.
Also, I ordered an almond milk cappuccino only to realize half way through drinking it that it contained milk. Not a deal breaker but I sent back my coffee.

All in all, I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning with some friends. There was no line when we arrived but a fairly long one when we left a bit past noon. 

I love the decor in here! It's a cross between a hipster coffee shop and a cute brunch restaurant. It smells like coffee and has a comfortable level of background chatter.

They seem to offer a variety of food from eggs bennys to sandwiches to a kids menu. I ordered the Mediterranean shakshouka (incl. eggplants & feta) and the portion was quite large. Very cute presentation as well! The food was delicious and wonderfully filling.

The one issue I had was that the waitstaff, while friendly, seemed very disorganized and rushed. It made for many plates dropped and uncertainty on who we should flag down when we asked for the bill. 

Loved the food and would come back for brunch, but hope the service gets better with time"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday. 

Pros:
- Nice old school ambiance 

Cons:
- No reservations 
- 30 minute lineup 
- Food is average/sub par 
- Overpriced"}
{"text":"We ordered the kids hamburgers, which was more like a single beef slider.

Our kids laughed at the portion size. 

The kids burgers were completely raw inside, we asked for a new one only to receive a completely burnt (charcoal) hamburger that was nearly fully cut in half. 

My own kebab plate was bland with no flavour whatsoever.

Our first and last visit.

Aroma/What a bagel which are much better options just a few steps away."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and root veggies salad and it was really tasty. The mushrooms were really good and they added herbs to the salad as well.  Portion size was good. Staffs are friendly. Will come back to try more things in the future."}
{"text":"Yum, our first visit there was great. The salad with fresh fruit was delicious as was the pasta and appetizers. I just found the locale to be slightly cold, I had to keep my jacket over my shoulders, other than that, we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant , overpriced for mediocre food quality.  I have been twice wont go back for a 3rd visit for what it is there are way better options."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Food was great, specially the presentation... shakahuka is really good as was the coffee .. my only complaint was that I felt they didn't handle the whole line while being busy well"}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience here and will never return. Terrible customer service, unacceptable wait times to be seated and then to wait for your food, mediocre food. What a bagel serves better food with a quarter of the wait time and it's more inexpensive. I ordered my eggs scrambled, when my food arrived the eggs were sunny side up, I sent it back, waited 20 minutes only to have someone from the kitchen come tell me they couldn't make that dish scrambled. Are you serious? Overall wait time was over an hour and we left without eating. This place is appalling."}
{"text":"The decor inside is a bit overwhelming at first. There's a lot of patterns on the walls and floors and little decorations everywhere which can be somewhat distracting. Aside from that the hummus is to die for. Recommend the smoked salmon sandwich. Very fresh tasting food. Perfect for those watching what they eat, the menu is full of healthy options. The schnitzel was not the greatest but still"}
{"text":"A gem! Beautifully done retro decor (fit for Instagram), and delicious eats. I tried their Jerusalem sandwich and was very satisfied. Very friendly staff. Definitely looking forward to another brunch/ lunch at Cafe Landwer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way to vmills shopping mall. Very busy on weekends around 1230pm! Luckily didnt have to wait too long and got a spot. Overall great service & cute decor! Food was decent - mom and i got the Benedicts (small portion) with a side salad - pricey for the portion size however good food overall and perfect amt for myself! Had the latte - had higher expectations for the latte but slightly disappointed (wasnt very hot & no latte art). Overall decent experience!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday morning, around 11:30. The plaza was getting a bit busy but there was still parking to be found. First thing I noticed was that the decor is really nice with all the lights and graphics. Ordered the famous breakfast while friends ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict. The food took quite a while to arrive but servers were friendly nonetheless. Portions were a bit small, and wish there was more bread to serve with all the complementary items (such as the guac, jam, butter, and cheese). Presentation wise it looked pretty good.

Prices are comparable to other sit down brunch spots."}
{"text":"Came here because I saw the video on Blog To and learned this place serves Israeli food which I have never tried. Later learned this place is a famous China in Israel. We ordered three dishes, famous breakfast, halloumi shakshouka, and Sonia kebab. To be honest I think the other two is mediocre but he halloumi shakshouka is quite good."}
{"text":"Worth the trek! This cafe is 1st Canadian location of an Israeli chain, meaning everything is very fresh and Mediterranean tasting and the decor is bright and charming.

I went for brunch with two friends on a Saturday. The wait was about 20 minutes, which for a new & trendy resto in the GTA is not too bad. We shared a pizza, grilled sandwich and shakshuka between the three of us and all of the dishes were flavorful & delicious and the portions were generous.

My only negative feedback is that I found the service was a bit slow, it took quite a while for the server to take our orders and bring the food."}
{"text":"Landwer's Famous Ice Tea had mixed berries, fresh fruit, and passion fruit brew.  It was a beautiful coloured drink that tasting very refreshing too.  My mom really enjoyed it.

The Health Smoothie that I ordered contained banana, date, pistachios, tahini, date syrup, and soy milk.  This was an absolutely delicious smoothie!!  It was so smooth and creamy and the tastes of all the ingredients combined together were absolutely the best thing I've ever had!  The taste of the pistachios wasn't too strong either which I enjoyed.  Mmm, so yummy!

I had heard about their Crispy Cauliflower appetizer (or I was definitely curious about it) and ordered it.  I was prepared to pay for this on its own since I knew that the prize didn't cover it.  The Crispy Cauliflower dish was all right.  It was served on a bed of tomato salsa and tahini.  I thought that the cauliflower bites could have been more crispy and more flavourful.  However, for those who like blander foods, I think this was a very decent dish.

For one of the entrées, we had the Free-Range Chicken & Pesto pasta.  Their pastas were fresh and made from 100% durum flour and homemade upon order.  There was a choice between campanelle or fettuccine.  I chose the campanelle (a type of pasta which is shaped like a cone with a ruffled edge) since it was unfamiliar to me.  The dish itself had broccoli, mushrooms, and tomatoes in pesto sauce with parmesan and grilled chicken.

When it arrived, it was a beautifully presented dish!  I was in awe of it and took many photos.  Its taste was also very good!  The ingredients were so fresh and I adored how the grilled chicken wasn't rough or overcooked at all.  This was a great dish to order!  Even our neighbouring table asked me about it since they were impressed by its presentation too!  They ended up ordering it as well. 

The second entrée we ordered was the Kebab Sinia Pan which had mini beef kebabs, charbroiled eggplant, tomato, red onion, tahini, chickpeas, chickpeas, and parsley on a hot stone-oven baked focaccia with a chopped salad.  This was also a very nicely presented dish that was more than enough for one person!  I'm glad that we shared everything.  The chopped salad of tomatoes and cucumbers was very fresh.  The mini beef kebabs were good and we enjoyed it.

Lastly, it was time for dessert!  The Rozalach and their Legendary Crumbled Cheesecake caught my attention.  The Rozalach was crispy dough baked in a stone oven with a rich filling of chocolate hazelnut.  This was definitely one of the most unique desserts I've had and I was so glad that I got to try it!  They were little cute doughs that were filled with chocolate hazelnut.  You definitely have to eat this fresh and hot out of the oven when the chocolate hazelnut filling is all melted.  I loved this! 

The Legendary Crumbled Cheesecake had rich cheese and cookie crumbs served with homemade whipped cream.  The presentation of this was very nice too.  The homemade whipped cream was extremely airy and light!  It was so good!  The cookie crumbs on the bottom of the crumbled cheesecake made it a one characteristic one.

We weren't able to finish everything -- it was a lot of food -- so we packed up the rest of the two entrées and the Rozalach to enjoy at home."}
{"text":"This place has professionally done themed decor. The atmosphere is really family-run \"cafe\"-like, but with an openness of an outdoor patio. The food is very unique - I would say it's of the lighter variety. Definitely not a lot of oil or frills - just the basics. Simple ingredients, unique presentation and at a moderate price. Con't come crazy hungry or your wallets may take a slight dent, but instead for breakfast or a quick snack/coffee. The only downside to this location was the service. The staff weren't able to handle it that well and attention of the servers was a little lacking and impersonal. I may give this one more try when I'm in the area next time. I'd also like to a see more menu selections at a modest price...a bit more meat selections and maybe alternative drink options."}
{"text":"Tried this place first time this weekend. My wife is vegan, not many places around where you can get interesting choices for both. Atmosphere was great, the restaurant was full. Service was slightly slow, but I mean every seat was taken, people in line waiting. 

I had the schnitzel, my wife had the vegan shawarma and everything was super tasty. We had a good time."}
{"text":"I like this cafe so much, food is good specially for brunch. Not big portions tho, just enough which is good. Customer service is also good. 
Cons: waiting time"}
{"text":"I dined at Cafe Landwer on a Saturday morning, and I loved having breakfast here. I love that they have so many options, and I love that they have vegan options! I had the vegan omlette half sandwich, and it was UNREAL. It was so filling, yet I wanted to eat more! 
The service was also pretty good.
There are a bunch of other menu items that I want to try, so I can't wait to return! 
FYI it is a very busy place for Saturday breakfast/lunch, so expect a wait :)."}
{"text":"I was searching for a breakfast place in the area and came across Cafe Landwer. Glad I gave it a try! The place is fairly new and they have given it a really cool, retro vibe, money well spent as the place looks awesome including their spacious patio.
I ordered the \"famous\" breakfast which basically is a sampling of several of their dishes and includes two eggs. The serving was satisfying and well worth the price.
The shakshukah comes in three types and again a good serving. 
Paired with their free refills coffee and I was well satisfied including the great service.
If you're looking for a fresh breakfast option, I definitely would suggest you give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the type of restaurant that this neighbourhood has been looking for. This place is always booming with people in the morning all the way to after diner. The food is always great and the flavours are exquisite. There is often a wait if you go on the weekend or in summer but there is a little bit of shopping you can do in the plaza while you wait. The atmosphere of the restaurant is a little odd and rustic which all just adds to the feel of the food and your experience. The food comes out plated very nicely and has a great Israeli swing on things. The food can be considered to be little pricey but trust me the food is very worth it. The drink menu is out of this world and i highly suggests you try some sort of here drinks. This is certainly a key in this neighbourhood and really is a great restaurant to go to for a nice meal."}
{"text":"This place was SO GOOD. Wow I could not stop talking to my fiancé about how good the food was. It was a little pricey for what I THOUGHT I was going to get, but it was actually so worth it for the quality. When I first walked in, I got the impression of like an upscale Swiss Chalet just based off the decor, but once I saw the menu and received my dinner, I was surprised at the quality of the food and options. We got two hot drinks to share (hot apple cider pictured), and then I ordered sweet potato fries with the spaghetti squash. OMG that spaghetti squash was just awesome and so fresh. Definitely want to go back. Ate my food to quickly to get more pics sorry haha"}
{"text":"Really cute brunch place in the Bathurst and Rutherford area. It's very busy on weekends, but it wasn't too busy when I went on a weekday for brunch. It's definitely one of my new favourite brunch places. 
I ordered the fresh mint tea, and smoked salmon benedict which were both amazing!
Love the vibes of the restaurant.
Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe in the area. Items a bit on the pricer side for what they are, but quality is decent. Decor is charming, best described as the more \"instagramable\" Aroma but with full meal options."}
{"text":"I love their espresso - to be specific, I order a cappuccino made with almond milk any time I'm nearby the plaza. Absolutely delicious and extra smooth.

I've eaten here once for breakfast, it was pretty good and had many healthy options as well :)

The service could be much quicker, but I'll be going back for coffee for sure."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are good (outdoor seating ftw) but the service is SOOO bad. 

I've been twice. The first time, the service was very slow and dull. Grumpy waiter who was the opposite of attentive. We had to wave him over when we were ready to order, and got our food served well before our drinks. Of course he never came back after that to check up on us, and then we had to flag him down for the bill. 

The second time I went, I sat at my table for long enough and no one approached me, despite the fact that there were at least 4 servers inside the non-busy restaurant. I ended up walking out, and they probably didn't even notice."}
{"text":"Great place to share a coffee or a meal in a cozy atmosphere ; recommend the Shakshuka ; the kids pizza!! And the amazing tea of blue berry Burst . Great escape spot to an urban cafe in a suburban neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I walk 40 minutes one way just to get my latte here because it is absolutely superb.   Some of the best coffee that I have ever had.  
When I get a latte to go, I always get a delicious chocolate ball on the house.  
I have only eaten breakfast here, but everything that I ordered was quite good.   They have an excellent breakfast tray with eggs, fresh bread, , mini granola parfait, salad and lots of little bits.  It's very good.   There is also a fresh baked pita with sunny side up eggs and Mediterranean salad which was excellent as well.   
I love the decor of this place.  It reminds me of a cool restaurant on the ocean."}
{"text":"This restaurant is nice. Very warm staff. Very fresh ingredients but a mediocre chef. I ordered chicken pesto. There was no salt In The food  they didn't have fresh pepper for the pasta. Italian restaurant and no pepper mill!!!!

There was also not enough chicken in the pasta. 

Overall I recommend the place if your expectation is not too high."}
{"text":"I come from this industry and have spent many years dealing with customers......The moment we walked in... We were disappointed.

We went there with an understanding that there are NO reservations allowed (we called twenty min in advance ) as the wait time is already long upon arrival....apparently people that came twenty minutes after us called in fifteen minutes ahead to reserve a spot on the wait list ... And they were seated right away... They were a group of 4 and we were as well 4!

Then we finally get seated after 40 minutes with five minutes left to order breakfast because they cut off the breakfast portion of the menu at 2pm sharp.... 

As seen below in the photos... Our water glass came with a chunk of white stuff on the glass rim...

Our mint tea had a LIVE SNAIL on the mint... Luckily we saw it before drinking it...
The second glass they brought us of mint tea was a clear glass full of dirt from the fresh mint ... We told them to take it back as we did not trust it any longer...

The manager came his name is HEN ... Israeli man with glasses ... He was awkward and had barely any sympathy but agreed to take care of our bill as we had too many problems for our first time visit..

The food arrived... Over priced for what you get... Breakfast for two was basically an addition of $10 for 2 eggs and a mini yogurt... When I say mini I mean it was smaller than a toddlers tea party set.

Very cheap portions ... Something I would have never expected.

The bill came.... Nothing was taken care of as the manager had said. 

They forced free desserts on us at our table after we had already said we DO NOT want any sweets on the house (as if it would make up for everything else) ...we sent the bill back requested the manager to adjust as he said he would when finding snails and dirt in our tea ...twice .

The manager had ended up  discounting two meals by 20% and also he never even showed up to the table to apologize or even ask how our experience was...


I would NEVER go back to this place if someone paid me.

Super disappointed .... We even left there still hungry. Over priced- and the food portions were offending.

The manager does not belong in that position..."}
{"text":"Food is unique and delicious. Presentations beautiful,  although a bit cumbersome. They need to work out a few kinks in the service, which I am sure they'll figure out soon. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best salad I've ever had. Caramelized chicken, mushroom and onion seasoned to perfection and served over chopped veg."}
{"text":"Hey I have a question.  Who is whiny, wears a ton of makeup, wears Uggs, has lots of inherited money, and never had a job? Go to this place to find a farm of them.
The food here is actually quite good.  But the people that go here wow!  You wonder why people hate a certain group of people?  Go here and find out.
I enjoyed the Shakshuka.  Service was decent also. I wont be going back soon until they open more of these in different areas of the city."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place because they had vegan options (my friend is vegan). Cute little diner style eatery. 

I ordered their Landwer's Famous Schnitzel.$17 Crispy Chicken Breast with Green Salad and a side. I choose Florentine Potatoes (Parisian. Potatoes Garlic Rosemary Confit, Cherry Tomatoes & Spinach) as my side. 
The portion was quite large, had 2 big piece of schnitzels and half a plate of side dish. Taste was ok but the chicken was a little dry. 

Friend's Orders:

Sweet Potatoe & Chestnuts Pasta $15
(Chestnut Cream Sauce, Basil, Truffles, Parmesan & Sweet Potato Baked in a Stone Oven) My friend thought it was a bit too heavy for her and she couldn't finish most of it. But it was definitely different.

Red Wine French Stew 
(Soy Strips, Carrots, Celery, Mushrooms, Garlic, Caramelized Onions, Red Wine. Served with Carrots, Caramelized Onion, Almond Rice) and comes with Salad. Friend loves this dish, orders it all the time. 

Free-Range Chicken Breast & Herbs
Grilled Chicken Breast with Herbs with Salad. 
Comes with Side, ordered Landwer's Rice. Thought it was ok but loved the rice the most.

Dessert, we ordered a Rozalach Halva (Vegan Gulten-Free, Crispy Dough Baked in Stone Oven with Halva Spread) Not really sweet but also not much taste to it either. But it was an interesting dessert.

We sat for a bit to chat..but wait staff kept telling us it was last call to order from the kitchen..etc..but it was maybe 930pm. But my friend remember they close at 11pm. Then wait staff came again asking if we needed anything else and that they were closing soon..etc..so friend stated I thought you guys close at 11pm. Normally they do but they had kitchen renovations. So was going to close early. I wished they stated that in the beginning, instead of seemingly wanted us out of their restaurant. Lol. But it's all good. I would come again to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"If you have time to wait 20 minutes to be seated, then another 20 till someone comes to take your drink order this is the place for you. Food is good when you are finally served but service leaves nothing to be desired. Seen by just about every person on the staff once, then another 20 minute wait for the bill with a clear table, would have been longer if we didn't flag someone down across the room. Don't anticipate being back soon with so many equally good food spots around with much better service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and was instantly wowed by the interior design. It's beautifully decorated with attention to detail in every corner, chair and cup. It has a very fun and eclectic atmosphere. They have many locations in Israel and just opened this first one here in North America. I tried their classic shakshuka, which came with ample bread, tahini, labneh and a small salad. It was a good portion for $13, the highlight for me being the labneh. All in all a very good experience and nice to see such a nice cafe in the area. Will definitely be visiting again to try their other items."}
{"text":"Came here twice for breakfast and I could see some improvements over time. During my first visit, the cafe was half full, it was confusing as to whether I should seat myself or wait till a hostess would seat me because there were no signs, no booth and it was unclear who was the hostess. No body approached me until a minute later. The servers were friendly and I noticed that they gave complimentary biscuit to the girl who was studying at the table next to me. I ordered the Landwer breakfast and it took 30 minutes to arrive  but the only thing that needed to be cooked was the eggs; the salad, cream cheese, greek yogurt with granola, etc could have all been prepped ahead of time so I didn't know why it would have taken so long. And as with other reviewers, I could see a lack of organization with the servers in terms of who was responsible for which table. 

However the second time I visited, they had a \"please wait to be seated\" by the door, they hired more servers, the servers were quick to bring water, provide refills, and check in with us to see how everything was. Still felt a bit chaotic but could observe improvements in two weeks' time. The place was also packed around 1030 to 1200. You could see that there is a close knit community here because somehow, many customers at different tables knew each other. 

The price is a bit on the higher side but the quality of food is there, the teas and coffees are great, they have lactose free options and are sensitive to pregnant ladies' needs (pasteurized products, and reminders if something like their dish contains undercooked eggs). 

I look forward to visiting again for their dinner options. Beautiful and unique decor, very welcoming place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. Came by to study for finals and had one of the best soy cappuccinos I had in a while (and it was free for students!). Staff were very friendly and you must try their shakshouka, it is simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Wen there for breakfast. Loved everything there. Kids breakfast was the best I've ever seen in all the breakfast places. See the picture! My pancakes in a cast iron were sooo yummy. I had the Nutella latte and I am craving for one right now. The decor was also very special. Just wish they had more settings because there's always a big line up there!"}
{"text":"Came here for Dinner on Wednesday night. Great Service. Quick Service. Food was phenomenal! Highly recommend the Hummus with Mushrooms, Mushroom Ravioli, Schnitzel, and for desert, the tiny dough rolls stuffed with nutella...to die for."}
{"text":"Right in the Rutherford marketplace at the NW corner of Rutherford and bathurst, this diner serves breakfast till 2pm and has a good variety of sandwiches, pasta and drink options.  I went with my hubby and another couple for their breakfast on a Sunday late morning and this place was packed with people. We waited for 20-30 minutes and got seated.  I ordered their egg benedict while others ordered their signature breakfast.  Portion wise, they are a little disappointing as my egg benedict turned out to be only 75% of what a normal greasy spoon diner serves.  Taste wise, it's not the best egg benedict I've had.  Coffee tastes good but it's a downer when you have to pay extra on milk.  However, at least I like their customer service. 

Pros: Customer service, nice ambiance 
Cons: Wait time

Need to consider: portion and taste of food are OK for the price you pay

The place is only 5 min away from where I live so I will probably go back for its convenience."}
{"text":"My go-to uptown brunch place! It might not be for everyone, but it works perfect for me. 

I am a huge breakfast/brunch fan, nothing can beat a piece of toasted avocado sourdough with a poached egg or something as simple as an omelette. It is very hard to find breakfast uptown that does not douse your food in oil and butter. I was so glad to have found Cafe Landwer. It has something for everyone - from the healthier option such as the Famous Landwer breakfast to the shakshouka to a schnitzel. 

The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated with quite a large outdoor patio. It is packed during brunch hours every day of the week. The wait may take a while, but there is a nice waiting area for you to grab a coffee while waiting to get seated. 

I have always gone back for the same two things on the menu, which I should really try harder to refrain from the next time I visit so that I can try other dishes there.  First is the Landwer's Famous breakfast.  It is presented in a wooden tray with warm toasted bread and mini dishes of honey & granola with greek yogurt, guacamole, chickpeas and labneh, feta cheese, cream cheese, jam, butter, tuna salad and a side salad. You also get a choice of 2 eggs of any style or omelette. I often go for the plain omelette. I was quite surprised by how little oil was in the dish since it did not leave any traces of that glistening sheen on the plate. It is a good option for health freaks like myself.  Even though there really is no skill to this dish and that it is just an assembly of different dips and bread, yet it is perfect for someone who is looking for a lighter and healthier option. 

The next dish that I absolutely LOVE is their shakshouka. It might not be the healthiest option on the menu but their halloumi shakshouka is fantastic. This tomato-based breakfast stew is hearty, tasty and comforting. It is packed with rich Middle Eastern flavours with perfectly poached eggs to dip your bread with. 

I really like this place even though I know some may disagree due to the simplicity of their breakfast dishes.  It is a great place for those who are more health-conscious and would like a lighter but tasty option!"}
{"text":"Here's what we had
Omelette meal- super cute comes with a bunch of sides, pretty hefty! 
Berry salad- delicious!!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I've had a good cup of coffee and I'm glad I stumbled upon this place. The cafe is a really cute old school vibe and immediately I had a good feeling about this place. 

My boyfriend and I decided to try out this cafe this past weekend. We were greeted and seated right away shortly after 2pm and after looking at menu we ordered the following: 
* Halloumi Shakshouka
* Salmon Eggs Benedict 
* Latte and Soy Latte 

The presentation of the Halloumi Shakshouka was really pretty and appealing. I've never tried Halloumi before and it was quite tasty. It was a good combination with the tomato sauce and not overpowering. The salad that came with the meal was light and fresh. The portion was more than enough for lunch and could be shareable. 

Salmon Eggs Benedict was delicious and the hollandaise sauce was not too heavy. The sauce was just right and my boyfriend enjoyed his meal. 

As for the Latte, it was just right and I was happy they have the option for soy or almond milk. Presentation wise it was very pretty and taste wise it was equally as good. 

Service was good, very friendly servers and everything looked tidy and clean. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to my friends and I definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try the other items on the menu. This place definitely has an old school vibe which makes it an even better experience."}
{"text":"Had the best Shakshuka in the city. I have been eager to find a quality Israeli restaurant and this place has hit the spot each time. You gotta try the Middle-eastern Shakshuka it was delish. Also, there's tons of parking as the restaurant is located in a parking plaza in Vaughn."}
{"text":"Wandered in this morning for breakfast after a mishap had us out and about unnecessarily at 9AM on the last day of vacation.

This is a bright and airy space, cold in the winter because the fans are kept on. I'd say it is hipster meets 70s. Clean. Good service, but odd that they would not clear the monstrous wood platters until after we left. 

Food was good - cute presentation
Half omelette sandwich with salad was actually quite large
Kid's grilled cheese conversely was tiny but good
Pancakes were tasty. I wish they were served on a plate as the sound of sharp metal knife on cast iron pan is a bit grating.
Cappuccinos were excellent with cute art on them.

Nice individual washrooms, but the door on the woman's washroom were tinny and the lock kept sticking. Bring your cell phone with you to the washroom in case you get stuck as it will be a while before someone finds you."}
{"text":"Such a great addition to the Richmond hill area. Love the ambience and style and many vegetarian options. Haven't ordered anything I didn't like on the menu, and the service is usually very friendly. A mix of cafe, restaurant/patio, or just to stop by for a drink."}
{"text":"Amazing food brought to us from the holy land. Friendly service,great coffee and great tasting g food make for a very good experience."}
{"text":"So i got to the cafe at 1:30, finally got seated at 2:15 and got my food at 3:00................ dont think ive ever waited this long at a restaurant in my life.... the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the pancakes they were very tiny and dry, the maple syrup it came with was soooooo sweet(more than usual), my boyfriend ordered the regular Shakshuka, it arrived slightly cold and he too said it was mediocre at best!! The ladies beside me had their order sent back THREE times, for having the wrong the wrong type of eggs brought to them and and olives brought on their pizza when she stated she had an allergy.. i personally would not go back to this restaurant. Genuinely dont understand the hype"}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place. I just got back from Israel and was craving the Israeli food environment. The decor has got it down pat.. The staff too (because they're not always attentive) but the food... Eh. I'm not writing this place off I'm just convinced I orderd the wrong items. My table got the schnitzel which was super deep fried and salty as well as the health salad and the cauliflower app. The health salad was a disappointment the lettuce they use is bagged cheap lettuce and the amount of quinoa is minimal. Next time I'm definitely getting eggs or another breakfast item. I hope they step up their game because the idea is great.

Update:
I went back with friends for dinner ... We had pizza and salad...the pizza was great and the salad was good. Everything that went by looked interesting and now I'm intrigued to comeback and try other items. There must be a reason this place is always busy.... Service is usually awful but this time around it as good!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a good meal here.

The food is legit and the Shakshuka is everything I could imagine it to be when I order it and THEN some.

I highly recommend it for the food, but the service was a bit lax the day I went. It took a long time to be seated and get our order and getting the waiters attention was a bit taxing. It could have been an off day, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

Worth checking out, just be aware, the time you have might not be the greatest."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast or brunch. I am not such a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but my boyfriend loves it. Landwer have nice outdoor patio, too bad it's facing a parking lot. The service is relatively quick and friendly, though it depends on a waiter. We tried 2 dishes: egg benedict with smoked salmon and Israeli shakshuka. Overall, it is a nice neighbourgood cafe with some historic flavour, it was originally established in NYC almost 100 years ago."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I definitely suggest whoever is reading this, to try this place. It's so lively and a great choice for when you are down or feeling a bit blue. I tried everything there and here are my favs: coffee, teas and drinks are must try. Baked cheesecake is awesome! The Nutella or halva paisley, the Saleb is soooo good, they usually run out of it, the squash and chestnut ravioli is to die for, I love the Sinia kabab, the grilled eggplant and tahini( the shakahuka is also good and the landwer special breakfast for 2 is sooo fun to eat and play with, although the items are too little and not so amazing but overall it's a very cool thing to order and fun to eat, I love their thin pizzas too, my fav it the eggplant and feta and I order mine gluten free and try to have that with hot sauce ;-)
The cauliflower is not good, it smelled and tasted like re-used grease .... the grease and burner oil smell was too much and I couldn't enjoy it so I didn't order it again... I love love love the chopped salad that's comes with sinia kabab. The schenitzel is also good for those who like schenitzel (it's not my fav), those should try it. The soups are always good but I wish they were more 
The staff are ok too and the place is always busy and has this lively atmosphere. 
Mind that the brunch wait time on weekends are very very long."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend recently and decided to check it out! Brunch done Middle Eastern style!

This place is packed so make sure you're ok with waiting around 30 mins for a table. The waiting area is also pretty small but they do provide free coffee while you wait.

Once we got to the table though, service was pretty quick. We ordered the Halloumi Shakshouka and the Mediterranean Shakshouka, which tasted very good and flavourful! It came with bread (for dipping into the sauce) as well as labneh, tahini, and a small light, fresh side salad that was just the right compliment to the heaviness of the tomato sauce, cheese, and poached eggs.

So many other things on the menu that sounded interesting! Will definitely come back to try them!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with the family for a late night snack and it was awesome! I didn't realize their menu had so much diversity - you can get brunch, sandwiches, Italian food, desserts etc. It has a very cute, quaint feeling inside! Great for friends, family and taking nice photos."}
{"text":"Had the vegan breakfast. Have no idea what it exactly was, but it was amazing. Super fun too. Great options for non-vegans, of course. 

Staff was helpful. Worth the drive! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"3.5 for me.

We waited for quite a while to get a table at this Israeli style restaurant this morning. You can tell the servers and hostess were overwhelmed with the crowds coming in to try this new place. Someone who was maybe the owner or manager provided us with some samples of apple cider while we waited, which was a nice gesture. Once we were finally seated it took a while for our waitress to take our order. The restaurant is super new and the waitresses all seem really young and, while friendly, very inexperienced. 

Our party of 4 ordered a mocha and two americano coffees which were great. The food arrived soon after and we loved the presentation and even better, they tasted as good as they looked. We tried the pancakes, the famous breakfast, the Mediterranean shakshouka and the farmers breakfast. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals thoroughly. We had also ordered a plate of the famous rozelah but unfortunately we were in a bit of a rush and had to cancel it as it had taken over 20 minutes to come. Another gentleman maybe the manager or owner, I'm not sure who it was, was nice enough to apologize and give us some chocolate cake like pastries for free which were delicious.

Overall I would come back, maybe in a couple of months when they're a bit more organized. Definitely the potential to be a great spot that I'll frequent regularly. 

If you're planning on going here within the next couple of days/weeks, I'd suggest going only if you have a couple of hours as the wait times were a bit lengthy and service was a bit disorganized. Other than that, I can't wait to come back and try more breakfast items, the Italian looks good too!"}
{"text":"Super tasty and excellent value for money. The atmosphere is friendly and lively and the service prompt. The food was delicious, especially the cheese and bread. I will be back! I recommend trying the Turkish coffee and their breakfast special."}
{"text":"Very Good Service! Very tasty Shakshuka (some other food I tried were OK) and the specialty coffees are the best in area hands down!"}
{"text":"Second time here and want to go back again. The menu is interesting , tempting and all I tried till now was so good ! 
They have patio , another bonus to enjoy some sun shine . 
Go and enjoy !"}
{"text":"Landwer is great and quite busy. Has a lot of breakfast competitors in the area but seems to be doing well. 

On the weekends, you might have to wait a while to be seated for brunch. Usually the wait is no more than 5 minutes. They have indoor and outdoor seating which is nice. 

The decor is very old school, and has a home-y feel to it. The servers are also very friendly. 

My go to dish is the farmers breakfast which comes with focaccia, eggs, salad, and sour cream on the side. You can tell it's made fresh and to order, and definitely worth the waiting time. This particular dish has perfect portion sizes - I am not hungry at all after. The salmon eggs Benedict, which I had a few weeks ago, is a bit on the smaller side. Nonetheless, still fresh and delicious. 

It's easy to split bills here too between your party. I'll definitely visit again soon!"}
{"text":"It's finally open!  

We had high hopes for this \"chain\" since their Tel Aviv (Israel) locations are excellent!

The decor at atmosphere are unique and charming. Odd choice of table placement (lots of empty space) but it just meant that things seemed more private for us. 

Obviously things looked new and clean and the restaurant was nice and bright. 

Keep in mind it just opened this week... Service from start to finish was slow and scattered. Our waitress was all over the place helping out tables, didn't seem so efficient. 

Other than our main meal coming out well before our appetizer, we really enjoyed the food. Everything was fresh and tasty. 

We had the margarita pizza which was soft and tasty. The crust wasn't your typical crunchy cardboard like crust. It was soft but firm enough for pizza. The toppings were great and fresh.  

We also had the sweet potato ravioli. Other than the pepper that seemed a. It excessive, it was delicious. I would definitely order it again and again. The portion size was also appropriate considering the price. 

The crispy cauliflower appetizer would have been better before the meal but it was decent. Didn't taste oily. Served in tahina. 

The best part of the entire meal was the desert. They call them the rozalach- most people would call them rugelach. Either way, they were warm, soft and amazing! Who doesn't love chocolate hazelnut! (Nutella). 

The service can only get better once they get more experience, and the food is already fantastic. 

My suggestion is go now! Try to go during a quieter time so you don't end up waiting a while for food/service. 

I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at brunch today.  The place is probably always busy but we only waited about 20 minutes for a table (it helps that the patio was open on this gorgeous late summer day).  We ordered the famous breakfast and the farmers breakfast. We had a great server who made sure our water and coffee was replenished. The food came quickly and everything tasted fresh and was hot upon arrival. I love the presentation of the food and ambience of this place.   This is a great addition to the neighbourhood. Looking forward to trying out their dinner menu in the near future."}
{"text":"I love this place!

The food was very tasty. The service friendly and prompt. This was my first time and I'm impressed. The menu selection for breakfast options is quite extensive, with unique meals that you won't find elsewhere in the area. I have nothing bad to say.

I can't wait to go back in a couple of weeks to try to their Shakshouka for breakfast. I also appreciate their decor. It feels authentic enough."}
{"text":"Heard many good things about this cafe, went there today for breakfast and it is an excellent spot for food. Breakfast is amazing and the portions are so filling, don't be tricked with the small plate they put on the tray, you won't be able to finish everything. I had shakshuka with Halloumi  cheese perfectly done, I like the eggs more runny but they were tasty,the bread is perfect and fresh,we also ordered their special breakfast and it is a complete one from yogurt to labneh, cheese,eggs everything you want to have for breakfast."}
{"text":"Cafe with good quality of service and coffee was really good... Nice and pleasant atmosphere... Food quality is good.. must try when you are in area.. Good place to hang out with friends and family...."}
{"text":"I never heard of Cafe Landwer till it opens it's first North American outpost in Vaughan, ON. Apparently it is a really popular cafe in Israel with a lot of branches and have been in business since 1919!

Cafe Landwer is really busy no matter when you drop by for a visit. Opens breakfast, brunch/lunch and dinner. I love the diversified menu especially what they offers for breakfast.

Mr Moshe Landwer started back in 1919 serving coffee roasted in house, their coffee what I would recommend. Americano, Filtered or Cappuccino? And if you not a coffee drinker, then try their mint based tea/drink. (I have this thing for fresh mint!)

As for food, do yourself a favour. Order the breakfast items. My Farmer's Breakfast ($11) was so good: The freshly baked focaccia bread was the best part!

Service though can be slow. But luckily my waitress was fast responding to all my request.

They also have a nice outdoor patio. Hopefully I will back soon to enjoy a late brunch on a sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"It was a gem find so close to home. The cafe was very busy, a pretty rare scene in an uptown restaurant. We waited for about 35 minutes, the hostess wasnt too attentive but it was a relaxing Sunday, so we weren't overly concerned.

We order smoke salmon benedict and roasted mushroom ravioli. I have to say, the food was fabulous. Ravioli was stuffed with sweet potato, which i usually dislike, but the savory of the wild mushroom cream sauce actually balanced out quite nicely.

For drinks, i got a nutella iced blend (i forgot the name), which was alright. It was explained to me as milkshake but only blended with ice. It wasn't too sweet, but i think it wasn't nutella enough to my taste.

P.s. the menu online is different than the actual one. Some breakfast items online says serving until 2pm, but some are actually not or vice versa. 

In general, the decor, quality of food was decent, and definitely a lot of food items. its a nice place to hangout without travelling far to downtown toronto."}
{"text":"This was really one of the worst restaurants that I have ever been to. 
We ordered the breakfast for two and one Farmer's breakfast, three falafels with coffee and tea. 

Breakfast for two - The eggs were okay along with the tahini and sour cream but the guacamole, Zatar with chickpeas, labneh, feta, cheese had a very funky taste that was terrible. Didn't eat the thimble sized honey and granola with yogurt. The bread was that of a cheap wedding and didn't really accompany the awful breakfast well. 

Farmer's breakfast - came with two eggs and a salad right on the soft paper thin very soft focaccia. Bread is better on its own without getting moisture from the eggs and salad. We order three falafels which were very ordinary and too wet in the middle.

The coffe wasn't that good, it was very weak and lacked flavour.

Not a very accommodating place and for the price of $75 it should have been spectacular. 

No idea what the fuss is or is it a place to been seen but not eat?"}
{"text":"A local blog had recommended this restaurant as one of the top Brunch restaurants in Toronto, so of course I had to check it out! 

It was Easter Sunday today and nothing was really open so I decided this would be the perfect place to go for brunch. 
We called a few days ahead to see if we could reserve a table for 5 and they told us they do not take reservations.

We get there and it was over an hour wait. 
We were squished like sardines in the waiting area with hardly anywhere to sit. There was free coffee while you waited which was kind of cool. But it took way too long to get a table.

Finally we sat down and the menu was small not a lot to choose from and the meals are very complicated. You can't order just eggs and toast. 
I feel the prices were a little ridiculous for what you were getting. The food was great for Instagram pics but that's it. It was delicious but I feel the menu was not for everyone. 

We ordered a piece of BUBKA for dessert which was 7$ and it was tiny. 

The waitress never came to check on how we were doing and we never got our waters refilled or refilled any of the drinks. 

If you are going for a coffee and dessert it's a cute place to go and hang out but I don't recommend going in a big group for lunch."}
{"text":"Food is great, presentation is beautiful and coffee is amazing.  

The service is on the slow side but the food is certainly worth the wait. food is fresh, nicely presented and full of flavour! Coffee and drink prices are on the lower side (comparing to coffee shops around) and main courses are comparable to restaurants (15$-25$)

recommended dishes:
sinya kebab
halumi salad
sweet potato ravioli
Rozalah for dessert
Freshly squeezed juice

Cafe Landwer is a cross between a cafe and a restaurant - great for informal meet ups/grabbing lunch with colleagues/enjoying brunch on the weekend. At the same time, it's too loud for a restaurant and too slow/pricy for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Great place for an afternoon coffee. Had the Nutella Rosalach. Simply heavenly! Will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The place is new-ish in the area and after 4 check-ins.  I think I have my opinion on this place now.

Breakfast is good and not really good for dinner.

I usually have there famous breakfast.  A selection of dips, salad, bread, eggs, yogurt, and tuna.  I like the variety and but it could be a little expensive for breakie - especially since they don't include coffee or a drink.  When ordered with their mini sandwich, it's more than enough for two.  The food is pretty fresh and it's a change from your usual greasy spoon meal most places have.

Dinner was not that good.  Portion size is small and we ordered quite a bit of food.  The schnitzel, the sliders, ravioli, pasta...and other items.  Besides a large bill, we had to follow up dinner with a pizza later in the evening.

Overall, the food is good and well prepared.  There are plenty of items for the vegetarians.

The place is well designed with a coffee bar, throwback-ish furniture, bright lights, and a cozy feel.  Plenty of parking and other choices to dine in the mall.

All in all, it will be a place I will go occasionally for breakfast only.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Love love this please. Lots of variety for vegan and gluten free diet. Interior is very cozy and takes you to a whole other place.  Staff is very friendly.  We had veggie soup, pizza and vegan buckwheat with roasted root veggies. Loved it. Turkish coffee is definitely something to try. Great place."}
