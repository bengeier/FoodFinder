{"text":"I've been going since I was a little girl, I love White's!"}
{"text":"I bring my elderly parents out to Belmont every year to visit relatives and this is the place we go to on the last morning before we leave.  The people there remember us from year to year and really are the best part of Whites.  That's not to say the food isn't great because it is. Love to have livermush and grits."}
{"text":"You have to know what you are walking in to...  This is old fashioned, hometown breakfast at it's finest. The people running this restaurant ARE the family. Mr. White is the guy flipping my eggs over medium. The menu is simple. The service is great. The food will take you back to sitting at your Grandma's table...and that IS good!!"}
{"text":"Cash only breakfast spot in Belmont.  Definitely a place where you're recognized if you're not a local.  Menu is on the wall behind the counter.  A one-egg meal is along the lines of $5.  Nothing fancy, just good ol' southern breakfast.  If you're trying to find an easy breakfast on a Monday morning, this is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"Nothing special just a small diner with your normal breakfast foods. Not a huge selection of food nothing really stands out. Never got my coffee refilled and they have tiny cups to begin with. Not sure what people see in this place the Waffle House was better."}
{"text":"Simple cheap, the White's have probably run it for 60 years. Time warp back to the 50's, nothing out of place except the paper sign on the front door which says no credit cards. I don't think credit cards were around in the 50's, but they have to warn customers that they are going back in time to when cash was the only medium of exchange. 

One of a kind.

Best grits ever. Perfect crispy bacon.

Also hard to spend more than $5 per person so save your credit cards for IHOP, where the food is plastic also."}
{"text":"OK, I'd love to give it more stars because the staff was great.  They were comedians actually. Very nice ladies.  Very friendly and helpful and really strove to make sure everyone was happy with food.  Decor is sparse but that's ok. Bathroom is extremely tiny.....like midget sized. That's fine too; adds character.  I just wasn't a fan of the food. Stick with your basic bacon, eggs, hash-browns and toast.  The biscuits and gravy was the strangest concoction I've ever tasted. Kind of bland and salty, with a flavor never before experienced. Huge portion though.  Grits were good if you like grits. Country ham was extremely salty. Pretty sure it's cash only here."}
{"text":"I will say I enjoyed the down home feeling that Whites brought to me.  The owner is so nice and that's what really makes this place.  The only thing that was disappointing was the biscuit I had with the gravy it was old and dry but hopefully that was just a one-off moment.  It is indeed Cash Only here but $20 fed both myself and another with Drinks.   I will be back to try it again for sure with a friend or more as always.  Nothing makes me happier than to see a local merchant trying to save the customer money by choosing to not pay the fees and accept credit cards.  Just stop by the ATM and grab some out before and come with an empty stomach you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service- western omelet really fresh, grits and toast not fancy but good. A step back into the past worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow and the food was ok. Went early on a Saturday morning. Had to keep getting our waitperson's attention for refills and the rest of our order brought to us."}
{"text":"Simple, cheap. This place probably hasn't changed for decades. 

There really isn't a formal menu..just a list of what they offer on the wall. Your waitress will tell you what everything costs, but it's so reasonable..just order what you want.

I usually get the two egg breakfast: eggs made to order, grits, toast-or-biscuit and a meat. Plus coffee. And it's only $4.50! 

Note - they only take cash and close around 1:30 pm"}
{"text":"Love this place! Me and 15 of my buddies stopped at Whites while visiting from Ca for Bristol race. Mary and Carol were just awesome. We had a great time"}
{"text":"We ditched the hotel breakfast with its powdered eggs and carb - laden fare, hopped in the truck and headed here for Grandma to take care of us. Real eggs just the way you like 'em, country ham... sweet spot. Food cooked to order, support local business!"}
{"text":"Great place! I read reviews before coming and definitely feels like home! Very clean. Breakfast special was great and came with coffee! Also loved how the locals come in and grab their own coffee or whatever else they need!"}
{"text":"Spectacular breakfast! Great prices, i do believe the little old man in the kitchen is a wizard. Cash only & our favorite Saturday tradition!"}
{"text":"Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick, cheap, and tasty :)  The type of place with loyal regulars.  Great country ham and eggs.  No muss, no fuss, just how a breakfast spot like this should be!"}
{"text":"Great old time breakfast,  made to order your favorite way.

Just remember $$$. CASH ONLY. $$$$$"}
{"text":"Went into this place knowing we needed to use cash but that's about it. We were welcomed and told there were no menus but that we could get whatever we want, no waffles. Food was great, service was great; definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast when in the area. I got eggs, sausage, grits and toast, all delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect breakfast joint.  Great service and a traditional country breakfast cooked perfectly.  Simple and good.  If the owners read this, please start taking debit cards.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Good comfort food. Its a bit of a slower pace and its cash only but its  local and the foods good. Small menu but good prices and good food."}
{"text":"We yelped this place for breakfast.  We walked in and it is as if you walked into your grandmothers home.  The owners are waiting tables and coming around and ensuring you are satisfied. All of the food was home cooked fresh to order and it was fantastic.  I would not hesitate to return nor recommend this place to anyone needing some great food. 

The owners came and spoke to my daughters and they were just great.  Bravo Whites!  I am rarely wowed by service and commitment ...... but you did that to my family.  Thanks!"}
