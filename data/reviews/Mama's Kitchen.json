{"text":"Really great lunch specials. Choose from BLT, fried fish, chicken wings, chilli. The lady that runs it is super friendly and she cooks great! Everything I have tried on the menu is delicious and freshly made. Great place for catfish, the lortions are large and always hot from the fryer."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots. I love coming to mamas. The cook puts love into her food. You can always find a meal to suit your pocketbook. I suggest going in and trying it out!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and everything i tried to order the guy said we're out of this or that so i just left. I won't be coming back."}
